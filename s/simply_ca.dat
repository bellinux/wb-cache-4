40|$|Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), at {{concentrations}} {{higher than}} 1. 0 millimolar, is phytotoxic to etiolated seedlings of Pisum sativum. Substantial vascular exudation from pea epicotyls {{could be obtained}} without tissue damage at 0. 5 millimolar EDTA if the solution was buffered at pH 7. 5 with sodium N- 2 -hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'- 2 -ethanesulfonic acid. Treated seedlings exuded 950 micrograms (leucine equivalents) of ninhydrin-positive material per day and 870 micrograms (glucose equivalents) of anthrone-positive material per day. Amino acid analysis showed the exudate to have glutamine as the major amido nitrogen containing compound and sucrose was shown to be the major sugar. Radiolabeled tryptophan and sucrose applied to cotyledons were transferred through the epicotyl and into the collection medium. The pH profile for exudation shows half maximal exudation at pH 7. 2, indicating the promotion of exudation by EDTA is probably not due <b>simply</b> to <b>Ca</b> 2 + chelation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, Ca 2 + {{has emerged as the}} most {{versatile}} intracellular messenger. Its concentration within cells is controlled by reversible binding to specific classes of proteins that act as Ca 2 + sensors to decode its information before passing it on to targets. The decoding operation is based on specific conformational changes in the sensor proteins. Other proteins intrinsic to membranes <b>simply</b> control <b>Ca</b> 2 + concentration without processing its message, by transporting it across membrane boundaries. They are located in the plasma membrane and in the membranes of the organelles (the endo(sarco) plasmic reticulum, the mitochondria, the nuclear envelope), which play distinctive roles in the cellular homeostasis of Ca 2 +. Ca 2 + is an ambivalent signaling agent. It carries information to virtually all processes important to cell life (e. g., it couples excitation to contraction, secretion, gene transcription, and controls enzyme activity through protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation), but also transmits signals that promote the programmed demise of cells. When escaping control, Ca 2 + also precipitates toxic cell death...|$|R
40|$|Calmodulin (CaM) is one {{of several}} {{proteins}} regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. CaM is synthesized at the G 1 /S boundary and has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression. To elucidate the role of calmodulin in cell cycle control, clonal mouse C 127 cell lines transformed with one of four different bovine papilloma virus (BPV) -based vectors were studied. These vectors express a) a chicken CaM gene regulated by its own promoter (CM cells), b) the chicken CaM gene regulated by the inducible human metallothionein-IIa promoter (MCM cells), c) CaM antisense RNA using the Zn 2 + inducible mouse metallothionein-I (mMT-I) promoter (AS cells), or d) a rat parvalbumin gene using the chicken CaM promoter (PV cells). C 127 cells transformed by BPV- 1 alone (BPV cells) are used as a control in each case. Previous studies showed that a 4 -fold increase in CaM levels in CM cells shortened the cell cycle by reducing the length of the G 1 period. Expression of parvalbumin in PV cells has no effect on cell cycle length, suggesting that increased CAM, and not <b>simply</b> increased <b>Ca</b> 2 (+) -binding protein, accelerates proliferation. Zn 2 (+) -induced expression of the chicken CaM gene in MCM cells increased the rate of proliferation, while Zn 2 (+) -induced expression of high levels of CaM anti-sense RNA stops proliferation at Zn 2 + levels that do not affect the growth of BPV cells. In CM cells increased CaM affects cell cycle-dependent level of mRNAs for tubulin, vimentin, and c-myc relative to the levels in BPV cells. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Physiologically, {{apoptotic}} neutrophils are ingested {{before they}} undergo necrosis. However, failure of ingestion {{will lead to}} necrosis of neutrophils and the unregulated release of neutrophil-derived pathogenic molecules, such as protease and hydrolases. Understanding the mechanism of postapoptotic necrosis is thus clearly important. Here, we monitored the apoptotic-to-necrotic transition in individual-aged human neutrophils in vitro by imaging fluorescent probes for externalized PS, cytosolic Ca 2 +, and membrane integrity. This showed that prenecrotic-aged neutrophils with externalized PS had a significantly elevated cytosolic-free Ca 2 + level. A further unregulated Ca 2 + influx into PS-externalized neutrophils always preceded the necrotic transition. Ca 2 + elevation {{was not simply a}} consequence of aging, as PS externalization was not uniform in similarly aged neutrophil populations. PS-externalized neutrophils could be induced to undergo necrosis experimentally by <b>simply</b> elevating cytosolic <b>Ca</b> 2 + further with ionomycin. This effect was observed only in neutrophils that had externalized PS, and was independent of the time after their isolation from blood (i. e., in vitro age). As pharmacological inhibition of calpain- 1 inhibition significantly reduced this CAIN, it was concluded that the apoptotic-to-necrotic transition was a consequence of uncontrolled calpain activation that resulted from Ca 2 + overload in PS-externalized neutrophils...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} {{an analysis}} {{of some of the}} methodological practices of Conversation Analysis (CA); in particular, tape recording and transcription. The paper starts from the observation that, in the CA literature, these practices, and the analytic objects they create (the tape and the transcript), are accorded different treatment: <b>simply</b> put, for <b>CA</b> the tape is a "realist " object, while the transcript is a "constructivist " one. The significance of this difference is explored through {{an analysis of}} the dynamics of CA practice. We argue that the "constructivist transcript " is premised on an understanding of CA as predominantly concerned with maximising its "analytic utility": a concern of one distinct temporal stage of CA work: that of the "innocent " apprehension of objects in the "first time through". The "realist tape", in contrast, is based on a different aspect of the work of CA: its quest for greater "evidential utility", achieved by the "nostalgic " revisiting of previously produced objects for purposes of checking them against each other; work done in the "next time through". We further argue that both the ontology and the epistemology of CA's objects are changed in any next time encounter. We conclude with a cautionary speculation on the currently-projected, transcript...|$|R
40|$|In resting muscle, cytoplasmic Mg 2 + is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It is thought to inhibit calcium release channels (RyRs) by binding both to low affinity, low specificity sites (I-sites) and to high affinity Ca 2 + sites (A-sites) thus preventing Ca 2 + activation. We investigate the effects of luminal and cytoplasmic Ca 2 + on Mg 2 + inhibition at the A-sites of skeletal RyRs (RyR 1) in lipid bilayers, {{in the presence of}} ATP or modified by ryanodine or DIDS. Mg 2 + inhibits RyRs at the A-site in the absence of Ca 2 +, indicating that Mg 2 + is an antagonist and does not <b>simply</b> prevent <b>Ca</b> 2 + activation. Cytoplasmic Ca 2 + and Cs+ decreased Mg 2 + affinity by a competitive mechanism. We describe a novel mechanism for luminal Ca 2 + regulation of Ca 2 + release whereby increasing luminal [Ca 2 +] decreases the A-site affinity for cytoplasmic Mg 2 + by a noncompetitive, allosteric mechanism that is independent of Ca 2 + flow. Ryanodine increases the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the A-sites by 10 -fold, which is insufficient to explain the level of activation seen in ryanodine-modified RyRs at nM Ca 2 +, indicating that ryanodine activates independently of Ca 2 +. We describe a model for ion binding at the A-sites that predicts that modulation of Mg 2 + inhibition by luminal Ca 2 + is a significant regulator of Ca 2 + release from the SR. We detected coupled gating of RyRs due to luminal Ca 2 + permeating one channel and activating neighboring channels. This indicated that the RyRs existed in stable close-packed rafts within the bilayer. We found that luminal Ca 2 + and cytoplasmic Mg 2 + did not compete at the A-sites of single open RyRs but did compete during multiple channel openings in rafts. Also, luminal Ca 2 + was a stronger activator of multiple openings than single openings. Thus it appears that RyRs are effectively “immune” to Ca 2 + emanating from their own pore but sensitive to Ca 2 + from neighboring channels...|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + {{is known}} to have {{important}} roles in sperm chemotaxis, although the relationship between intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and modulation of the swimming and chemotactic behavior of spermatozoa has not been elucidated. Using a high-speed Ca 2 + imaging system, we examined the chemotactic behavior and [Ca 2 +]i in individual ascidian sperm cells exhibiting chemotactic responses toward sperm activating and attracting factor (SAAF), a chemoattractant released by eggs. In this study, we found that transient [Ca 2 +]i increased in the flagellum (Ca 2 + bursts) concomitantly with a change in the swimming direction in an SAAF gradient field. During the initial phase of the Ca 2 + bursts, the flagellum of the spermatozoon exhibited highly asymmetric waveforms enabling the quick turning of the swimming path. However, the flagellum subsequently changed to symmetric beating, causing the spermatozoon to swim straight. Interestingly, during such responses, [Ca 2 +]i remained higher than the basal level, indicating that the series of responses was not <b>simply</b> determined by <b>Ca</b> 2 + concentrations. Also, we found that Ca 2 + bursts were consistently evoked at points at which the spermatozoon attained around a temporally minimal value for a given SAAF concentration. We concluded that Ca 2 + bursts induced around a local minimal SAAF concentration trigger a sequence of flagellar responses comprising quick turning followed by straight swimming to direct spermatozoa efficiently toward eggs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Elementary Ca 2 + signals, such as ‘Ca 2 + puffs’, {{that arise}} from the {{activation}} of clusters of inositol 1, 4, 5,-trisphosphate (InsP 3) receptors are the building blocks for local and global Ca 2 + signalling. We previously found that one, or a few, Ca 2 + puff sites within agonist-stimulated cells act as ‘pacemakers’ to initiate global Ca 2 + waves. The factors that distinguish these pacemaker Ca 2 + puff sites from the other Ca 2 + release sites that <b>simply</b> participate in <b>Ca</b> 2 + wave propagation are unknown. Results: The spatiotemporal properties of Ca 2 + puffs were investigated using confocal microscopy of fluo 3 -loaded HeLa cells. The same pacemaker Ca 2 + puff sites were activated during stimulation of cells with different agonists. The majority of agonist-stimulated pacemaker Ca 2 + puffs originated in a perinuclear location. The positions of such Ca 2 + puff sites were stable for up to 2 hours, and were not affected by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. A similar perinuclear distribution of Ca 2 + puff sites was also observed when InsP 3 receptors were directly stimulated with thimerosal or membrane-permeant InsP 3 esters. Immunostaining indicated that the perinuclear position of pacemaker Ca 2 + puffs was not due to the localised expression of InsP 3 receptors. Conclusions: The pacemaker Ca 2 + puff sites that initiate Ca 2 + responses are temporally and spatially stable within cells. These Ca 2 + release sites are distinguished from their neighbours by an intrinsically higher InsP 3 sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The use of Conversational Agents (CAs) {{utilizing}} Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) {{has been}} studied {{in a number of}} disciplines. Previous research has shown a great deal of promise. It has also documented significant limitations in the abilities of these CAs. Many of these limitations are related specifically to the method employed by AIML to resolve ambiguities in the meaning and context of words. While methods exist to detect and correct common errors in spelling and grammar of sentences and queries submitted by a user, one class of input error that is particularly difficult to detect and correct is the malapropism. In this research a malapropism is defined a 2 ̆ 2 verbal blunder in which one word is replaced by another similar in sound but different in meaning 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 malapropism, 2 ̆ 2 2013). This research explored the use of alternative methods of correcting malapropisms in sentences input to AIML CAs using measures of Semantic Distance and tri-gram probabilities. Results of these alternate methods were compared against AIML CAs using only the Symbolic Reductions built into AIML. This research found that the use of the two methodologies studied here did indeed lead to a small, but measurable improvement in the performance of the CA in terms of the appropriateness of its responses as classified by human judges. However, it was also noted that in a large number of cases, the <b>CA</b> <b>simply</b> ignored the existence of a malapropism altogether in formulating its responses. In most of these cases, the interpretation and response to the user 2 ̆ 7 s input was of such a general nature that one might question the overall efficacy of the AIML engine. The answer to this question is a matter for further study...|$|R
40|$|BK (Maxi-K) channel {{activity}} is allosterically regulated by a Ca 2 + sensor, formed {{primarily by the}} channel's large cytoplasmic carboxyl tail segment, and a voltage sensor, formed by its transmembrane helices. As with other voltage-gated K channels, voltage sensing in the BK channel is accomplished through interactions of the S 1 –S 4 transmembrane segments with the electric field. However, the BK channel is unique in that it contains an additional amino-terminal transmembrane segment, S 0, which {{is important in the}} functional interaction between BK channel α and β subunits. In this study, we used perturbation mutagenesis to analyze the role of S 0 in channel gating. Single residues in the S 0 region of the BK channel were substituted with tryptophan to give a large change in side chain volume; native tryptophans in S 0 were substituted with alanine. The effects of the mutations on voltage- and Ca 2 +-dependent gating were quantified using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Three of the S 0 mutants (F 25 W, L 26 W, and S 29 W) showed especially large shifts in their conductance–voltage (G-V) relations along the voltage axis compared to wild type. The G-V shifts for these mutants persisted at nominally 0 Ca 2 +, suggesting that these effects cannot arise <b>simply</b> from altered <b>Ca</b> 2 + sensitivity. The basal open probabilities for these mutants at hyperpolarized voltages (where voltage sensor activation is minimal) were similar to wild type, suggesting that these mutations may primarily perturb voltage sensor function. Further analysis using the dual allosteric model for BK channel gating showed that the major effects of the F 25 W, L 26 W, and S 29 W mutations could be accounted for primarily by decreasing the equilibrium constant for voltage sensor movement. We conclude that S 0 may make functional contact with other transmembrane regions of the BK channel to modulate the equilibrium between resting and active states of the channel's voltage sensor...|$|R

As it is well established that there are considerable interindividual differences in radiosensitivity {{in the general population}} that can significantly influence clinical outcomes of radiotherapy, we evaluate the degree of these differences in the context of carbon ion therapy compared with conventional radiotherapy. In this study, we evaluate individual radiosensitivity following exposure to carbon- 13 ions or γ-rays in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals based on the frequency of ionizing radiation (IR) -induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that was either misrepaired or left unrepaired to form chromosomal aberrations (<b>CAs)</b> (<b>simply</b> referred to here as DSBs for brevity). Levels of DSBs were estimated from the scoring of CAs visualized with telomere/centromere-fluorescence in situ hybridization (TC-FISH). We examine radiosensitivity at the dose of 2 [*]Gy, a routinely administered dose during fractionated radiotherapy, and we determined that a wide range of DSBs were induced by the given dose among healthy individuals, with highly radiosensitive individuals harboring more IR-induced breaks in the genome than radioresistant individuals following exposure to the same dose. Furthermore, we determined the relative effectiveness of carbon irradiation in comparison to γ-irradiation in the induction of DSBs at each studied dose (isodose effect), a quality we term "relative dose effect" (RDE). This ratio is advantageous, as it allows for simple comparison of dose-response curves. At 2 [*]Gy, carbon irradiation was three times more effective in inducing DSBs compared with γ-irradiation (RDE of 3); these results were confirmed using a second cytogenetic technique, multicolor-FISH. We also analyze radiosensitivity at other doses (0. 2 - 15 [*]Gy), to represent hypo- and hyperfractionation doses and determined that RDE is dose dependent: high ratios at low doses, and approaching 1 at high doses. These results could have clinical implications as IR-induced DNA damage and the ensuing CAs and genomic instability can have significant cellular consequences that could potentially have profound implications for long-term human health after IR exposure, such as the emergence of secondary cancers and other pathobiological conditions after radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{experiments}} {{from our}} lab {{have suggested that}} the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) is required for sperm-induced egg activation inXenopus laevis. Here we measure the endogenous production of both Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 and PIP 2 during the sperm-induced and ionomycin-induced calcium wave in the egg and find that both increase following fertilization. Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 increases 3. 2 -fold from an unfertilized egg level of 0. 13 pmole per egg (0. 29 μM) to a peak of 0. 42 pmole per egg (0. 93 μM) as the calcium wave reaches the antipode in the fertilized egg. This continuous production of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 during the time that the Ca 2 +wave is propagating across the egg suggests the involvement of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 in wave propagation. This increase in Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 is smaller in ionomycin-activated eggs than in sperm-activated eggs, suggesting that the sperm-induced production of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 involves a PIP 2 hydrolysis pathway that is not <b>simply</b> raising intracellular <b>Ca</b> 2 +. While one might expect PIP 2 levels to fall as a result of hydrolysis, we find that PIP 2 actually increases 2 -fold. The total lipid fraction in unfertilized egg exhibits 0. 8 pmole PIP 2 per egg and this increases to 1. 5 pmole as the calcium wave reaches the antipode. The PIP 2 concentration peaks 2 min after the completion of the calcium wave at 1. 8 pmole per egg. The amount of PIP 2 in the animal and vegetal hemispheres of the egg was also measured by cutting frozen eggs in half. The vegetal hemisphere contained twice the amount of PIP 2 as the animal hemisphere but it also contained twice the amount of lipid. Thus, there was an equivalent amount of PIP 2 normalized to lipid in each hemisphere. Isolated animal and vegetal hemisphere cortices exhibit similar PIP 2 concentrations, suggesting that the 2 -fold higher total PIP 2 in the vegetal half is not due to a gradient of PIP 2 in the plasma membrane, but rather implies that cytoplasmic organelle membranes also contain PIP 2...|$|R
