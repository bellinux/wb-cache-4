40|$|Since February 1999 {{atmospheric}} absorption spectra using {{the sun as}} the source of radiation have been recorded by a ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed) spectrometer (Bruker IFS 120 M). Besides zenith column amounts (ZCA) of trace gases like O 3, H 2 O, HDO, N 2 O, CH 4, HF, HCl, ClONO 2, NO, NO 2, and HNO 3, profiles of gases with narrow absorption lines like O 3, NO, HCl and HF can be retrieved. First results of profiles of O 3 and HCl and of columns of O 3, HCl and NO 2 are shown. O 3 profiles are compared with ozone sonde and Brewer data. Column amounts of NO 2 are compared with DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) data. 1. Measurement Site The FTIR spectrometer was installed at Izaña Observatory (IZO) in February 1999. IZO is operated by the Instituto Nacional de Meteorología (INM) of Spain. Izaña is situated at 28 ° 18 ‘N and 16 ° 29 ‘W on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). It is mostly above a <b>subsidence</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> layer (sea cloud) due to its location {{on the top of a}} mountain plateau (2360 m a. s. l.).

There are sudden temperature drops and wind reversals in CTD events. CTDs are initiated as gravity currents in a 3 dimensional mesoscale numerical model {{in this research}} by cooling the model lower atmosphere near the shore. The RAMS model is used in a sensitivity testing mode to examine the influences of the following factors {{on the evolution of}} CTDs: 1. different initial synoptic wind speeds 2. initial cooling amount and cooling area 3. topography that descends in the direction of propagation 4. different valleys that dissect coastal mountains 5. sea surface temperature 6. the presence of a near-shore island such as Vancouver Island The results show that: 1. The larger the initial northerly wind is, the smaller the offshore scale of a CTD is. 2. CTDs are very sensitive to initial cooling conditions by which they are created. The larger the cooling amount is, the stronger a CTD is. The effect of cooling area depends on initial cooling amount. The influence of different cooling areas can be the opposite with different initial cooling amount. 3. The propagation speed of CTDs is greatly reduced in the case of descending topography. 4. Valleys which dissect the coastal mountains greatly reduce the off-shore scales of CTDs. 5. When the sea surface temperature is close to the potential temperature of the lower atmosphere after cooling, a front comes into being in the lower atmosphere and the propagation speed of CTDs is enhanced. 6. Simulations show that near-shore islands may split a CTD with trapped disturbances propagating along both the island and mainland.

Synoptic analyses of mid-tropospheric circulation patterns are combined with isentropic back trajectory calculations to describe the long-range (400 - 3000 km) atmospheric transport mechanisms and pathways of air masses to the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of North America during July and August 1988. Siberia and the northern Pacific Ocean {{were found to be}} the two most likely source areas for 3 -day transport to the study areas in Alaska. Transport to the Barrow region was frequently influenced by polar vortices and associated short-wave troughs over the Arctic Ocean, while the Bethel area was most often affected by lows migrating across the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska, as well as ridges of high pressure which built into interior Alaska. July 1988 was warmer and dryer than normal over much of Alaska. As a result, the 1988 Alaska fire season {{was one of the most}} active of the past decade. Airborne lidar measurements verified the presence of biomass burning plumes on many flights, often trapped in thin <b>subsidence</b> layer <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions.</b> Several cases of stratosphere/troposphere exchange were noted, based upon potential vorticity analyses and aircraft lidar data, especially in the Barrow region and during transit flights to and from Alaska...|$|R

In the first part, the concept of the ABL is defined and main theoretical aspects of air stratification are explored. The main part of the background research summarizes current knowledge of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions,</b> especially how the landscape pattern influences their development and parameters under different synoptic situations, and methods used for their detection, measurement and evaluation. Considering the theme of the thesis, main geographic factors influencing <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> in the area of Prague are also defined. The focus of actions is placed on inversions analysis based upon time series of Praha-Libuš rawinsonde station. Homogeneity of used data is tested and all inversions within the 2000 - meters-thick-layer close to the ground are derived. Diurnal, annual and interannual frequency variations are described.

40|$|Increase of {{temperature}} with height in the troposphere is called <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> Parameters such as strength and depth are characteristics of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> Inversion strength {{is defined as}} the temperature difference between the surface and the top of the inversion and the depth of inversion {{is defined as the}} height of the inversion from the surface. The common approach in determination of these parameters is the use of Radiosonde where these measurements are too sparse. The main objective of this study is detection and modeling the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> using MODIS thermal infrared data. There are more than 180 days per year in which the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> conditions are present in Kermanshah city. Kermanshah weather station was selected as the study area. 90 inversion days was selected from 2007 to 2008 where the sky was clear and the Radiosonde data were available. Brightness temperature for all thermal infrared bands of MODIS was calculated for these days. Brightness temperature difference between any of the thermal infrared bands of MODIS and band 31 was found to be sensitive to strength and depth of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> Then correlation coefficients between these pairs and the inversion depth and strength both calculated from Radiosonde were evaluated. The results showed poor linear correlation. This was found to be due to the change of the atmospheric water vapor content and the relatively weak <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> strength and depth occurring in Kermanshah. The polynomial mathematical models and Artificial intelligence algorithms were deployed for detection and modeling the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion.</b> A model with the lowest terms and highest possible accuracy was obtained. The Model was tested using 20 independent test data. Results indicate that the inversion strength can be estimated with RMSE of 0. 84 ° C and R 2 of 0. 90.

Five micrometeorological towers were located along an east-west cross section {{through the center of}} the crater. The analyses of 5 -min mean data from all the towers showed that a strong <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> formed inside the crater when ambient regional-scale flows were weak. Under these conditions, the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> was confined to the lowest 10 - 20 m above the basin floor, with the bulk of the basin atmosphere being nearly isothermal. Turbulence was intermittent within the <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion,</b> but was often nearly continuous in the isothermal layer above the shallow surface-based inversion. When the regional scale flows exceeded approximately 5 m/s, the basin atmosphere became fully coupled with the atmosphere above and little or no <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> formed inside the crater.

The analysis is focused on both historical series and future projections under climate change. Historical sounding data from two different Italian stations are used as well as future projections data, provided by CMCC-CCLM 4 - 8 - 19 regional climate model (MED-CORDEX initiative). A new method to detect layers of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> is also presented. The developed method computes the occurrence of a <b>temperature</b> <b>inversion</b> layer for a given day at 12 UTC without a detailed knowledge of temperature vertical profile. This method was validated using sounding data and applied to the model projections, under two different emissions scenarios (RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5). Under RCP 4. 5 intermediate emissions scenario, the occurrence of <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> is projected to increase by 12  days/year (around +  10 %) {{in the last decade}} of 21 st century compared to 1986 – 2005 average.

40|$|ABSTRACT] In the Nobi Plain, {{temperature}} profiles {{were measured}} in 41 observation wells in 1993 and 1994. There are many <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> in the vertical temperature profiles of recharge area. In the Nobi Plain, annual {{mean surface temperature}} increases about 2 ℃ during last 100 years, and {{it is assumed that}} this surface warming causes subsurface <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions.</b> A three-dimensional numerical model of heat transfer in the Nobi Plain is used to investigate the influence of surface temperature warming outside the discharge area, where inversions are evident in the measured temperature profiles. Simulated results show that subsurface <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are formed in recharge area at depth between 50 m- 130 m below sea level, because subsurface temperature has been cooled with the advective heat transfer by the downward groundwater flow from the surface. On the other hand, shallow subsurface temperatures in the center part of the plain have been heated more by upward regional groundwater flow than by the effect of surface warming, so that <b>temperature</b> <b>inversions</b> are not observed...|$|R

Wyniki zostały przedstawione w odniesieniu do dwóch charakterystyk warstw inwersyjnych – częstości i natężenia. Związek występowania inwersji termicznych z sytuacją synoptyczną określono za pomocą częstości i prawdopodobieństwa warunkowego wystąpienia dni z inwersją temperatury powietrza w poszczególnych typach cyrkulacji atmosfery. Przeprowadzona analiza wskazuje na występpowanie istotnego statystycznie dodatniego trendu zmian liczby dni z inwersją temperatury powietrza między poziomami 1000 hPa i 925 hPa oraz dodatnich trendów średniego rocznego natężenia zjawiska w warstwach 1000  –  925 hPa, 1000  –  850 hPa i 925  –  850 hPa.
