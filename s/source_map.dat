2500|$|There are {{possible}} literary references to Li's world map. [...] An important clue {{is provided by}} Wu Sidao (烏斯道)'s anthology titled Chuncaozhai Ji (春草齋集), where Wu states that [...] he had merged a map named Guanglun Tu (廣輪圖) and Li Rulin (李汝霖)'s Shengjiao Beihua Tu (聲教被化圖). Although his own map is not known today, Wu seems to have referred to Li's map concerned because the Shengjiao Beihua Tu would be an alias for Shengjiao Guangbei Tu (聲教廣被圖) and Rulin would have been Li Zemin's courtesy name. Wu states that Li's map was newer than the Guanglun Tu (circa 1360). Based on place names on the map, earlier studies presumed that the <b>source</b> <b>map</b> had been created around 1319 and revised sometime between 1329 and 1338. However, Wu suggests that Li's map was created sometime after 1360. Most importantly, Korea's attempt to merge Chinese maps {{had at least one}} precedent in the Mongol era.|$|E

50|$|A left Hopf algebroid (H, R) is a left bialgebroid {{together}} with an antipode: the bialgebroid (H, R) consists of a total algebra H and a base algebra R and two mappings, an algebra homomorphism s: R → H called a <b>source</b> <b>map,</b> an algebra anti-homomorphism t: R → H called a target map, such that the commutativity condition s(r1) t(r2) = t(r2) s(r1) is satisfied for all r1, r2 ∈ R. The axioms resemble those of a Hopf algebra but are complicated by the possibility that R is a non-commutative algebra or its images under s and t {{are not in the}} center of H. In particular a left bialgebroid (H, R) has an R-R-bimodule structure on H which prefers the left side as follows: r1 ⋅ h ⋅ r2 = s(r1) t(r2) h for all h in H, r1, r2 ∈ R. There is a coproduct Δ: H → H ⊗R H and counit ε: H → R that make (H, R, Δ, ε) an R-coring (with axioms like that of a coalgebra such that all mappings are R-R-bimodule homomorphisms and all tensors over R). Additionally the bialgebroid (H, R) must satisfy Δ(ab) = Δ(a)Δ(b) for all a, b in H, and a condition to make sure this last condition makes sense: every image point Δ(a) satisfies a(1) t(r) ⊗ a(2) = a(1) ⊗ a(2) s(r) for all r in R. Also Δ(1) = 1 ⊗ 1. The counit is required to satisfy ε(1H) = 1R and the condition ε(ab) = ε(as(ε(b))) = ε(at(ε(b))).|$|E
