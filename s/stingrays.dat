5|$|Hull <b>Stingrays</b> {{withdrew from}} the League on 11 August 2010, {{announced}} via the club's official website, and later confirmed on the BBC's site. However, after a takeover from Coventry Blaze on 17 August 2010, the Hull <b>Stingrays</b> confirmed that they would indeed be participating in the League for the 2010-11 season. The <b>Stingrays</b> again withdrew on 24 June 2015, as the club announced on its official website {{that it has been}} placed into liquidation.|$|E
5|$|This {{perceived}} {{problem with}} expenditure was given further credence when the Hull <b>Stingrays</b> announced on 11 August 2010 {{that they were}} ceasing operations immediately due to insufficient funds from sponsorship to guarantee completing the season. They were, however, taken over on 17 August 2010 by Coventry Blaze and therefore Hull <b>Stingrays</b> continued to operate.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), <b>stingrays</b> (including deepwater <b>stingrays,</b> pelagic <b>stingrays</b> and sixgill <b>stingrays),</b> and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the red <b>stingray</b> was published by Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen under the name Trygon akajei, based on an earlier account of [...] "Pastinaca akajei" [...] by Heinrich Bürger. Subsequent authors have placed the genus Trygon in synonymy with Dasyatis. A lectotype for this species was designated by Marinus Boeseman in 1947. Other common names for the red <b>stingray</b> include brown <b>stingray,</b> estuary stingaree, Japanese red <b>stingray,</b> Japanese <b>stingray,</b> red skate, whip ray, whip <b>stingray,</b> and yellow <b>stingray.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 2001 phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Lisa Rosenberger, based on morphology, {{found that the}} Atlantic <b>stingray</b> {{is one of the}} more basal members of its genus. It is the outgroup to a large clade that contains, amongst others, the southern <b>stingray</b> (D. americana), the roughtail <b>stingray</b> (D. centroura), the longnose <b>stingray</b> (D. guttata), and the pearl <b>stingray</b> (D. margaritella).|$|R
50|$|<b>Stingray</b> quits drinking, {{makes up}} with his brother and begins dating Sky. Kerry is {{diagnosed}} with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. <b>Stingray</b> is a match and becomes the donor. He undergoes surgery and Kerry recovers. The Timmins family celebrate Janelle's birthday with a street party. <b>Stingray</b> sits down after dancing and watches his family and friends. Janae and Bree think that <b>Stingray</b> has fallen asleep, but they fail to wake him and alert {{the rest of the}} family. They all realise that <b>Stingray</b> has died. <b>Stingray's</b> heart is donated to Caleb Maloney (Nick Russell). Following the funeral, <b>Stingray's</b> ashes are scattered across his favourite skate park.|$|R
5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small <b>stingrays</b> inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. <b>Stingrays</b> are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, <b>stingrays</b> avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous <b>stingrays</b> have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.|$|E

5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling <b>stingrays,</b> {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stingray</b> {{finds it}} hard to deal with Serena's death {{following}} a plane crash, but he begins to bond with Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey). Rachel kisses him, but <b>Stingray</b> is forced to let her down, pointing out that she is only fourteen. <b>Stingray's</b> confusion over Rachel and a new job at Scarlet Bar, gradually makes him become dependent on alcohol. Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) breaks up with Dylan and she and <b>Stingray</b> sleep together. <b>Stingray</b> then tells Rachel that he loves her and they begin dating. Sky discovers that she is pregnant and Rachel breaks up with <b>Stingray.</b> He then starts drinking again. Sky realises that <b>Stingray</b> could be the father of her child. <b>Stingray's</b> grandmother, Loris (Kate Fitzpatrick) confronts him about his drinking and she takes him to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. However, as soon as she leaves, <b>Stingray</b> walks away from the meeting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stingray's</b> mother, Janelle (Nell Feeney), {{arrives in}} Erinsborough and she informs <b>Stingray</b> {{that his father}} has run out on the family. <b>Stingray</b> leaves with his mother, but he finds a note from Serena and decides {{that he wants to}} go back. Janelle agrees and takes him back. <b>Stingray</b> tries to win back Serena, but he meets Sharon [...] "Shazza" [...] Cox (Emily Wheaton), who seems to be the perfect match for him. They come from the same home town and share similar interests. Shazza later dumps <b>Stingray</b> after announcing that she was using him to make her boyfriend jealous. <b>Stingray</b> then gets back {{together}} with Serena. <b>Stingray's</b> older brother, Dylan (Damien Bodie) arrives. Janelle also returns and the family, along with <b>Stingray's</b> sisters Janae (Eliza Taylor-Cotter) and Bree (Sianoa Smit-McPhee), move in with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha). <b>Stingray</b> breaks up with Serena when he finds out she kissed Boyd.|$|R
50|$|A Giganto {{was found}} in a {{shipwreck}} just off the Atlantic Ocean by <b>Stingray</b> and a salvage crew. Angered by this disturbance, it attacked <b>Stingray</b> who tried to defeat it with some grenades. Giganto then swallowed <b>Stingray</b> and seemingly choke to death on him. <b>Stingray</b> managed to survive.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} <b>stingrays</b> inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other <b>stingrays,</b> this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by {{the body of the}} ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
5|$|Several beaches dot Banton's coast {{including}} Macat-ang, Tabonan, Mahaba, Recodo, Togbongan, Mainit, and Tambak beaches. Some like Macat-ang, Tabonan, and Tambak {{are white}} sand beaches, while others, like Togbongan, are pebbled and rocky. The island's waters are also well-known dive sites, with corals {{that serve as}} breeding ground for groupers, snappers, sharks, and <b>stingrays.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2014 NHL Entry Draft was {{the third}} and final NHL draft that Walker was {{eligible}} for, and he was selected in the third round, 89th overall, by the Capitals. In doing so, Walker became the first Australian to be selected in an NHL draft. On 25 July 2014, Walker was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Capitals. Partway through the 2014–2015 season Walker was reassigned to the South Carolina <b>Stingrays</b> of the ECHL. After a two-game stint with the <b>Stingrays,</b> where he recorded two points, Walker was brought back to Hersey. Reassigned to South Carolina again in January, Walker was injured in a game on 28 January when he tore his ACL, ending his season. At the time of the injury Walker had appeared in 28 games for the Bears, where he scored 4 points, and a further 6 games for the <b>Stingrays,</b> also recording 4 points. His production improved in 2015–16, as he finished with 17 goals and 41 points for the Bears. Walker was awarded the Bears' team awards for the Most Improved Player, Unsung Hero, and was also named the team's Man of the Year for his community involvement. He played 58 games for Hershey in 2016–17, recording 23 points and was re-signed by the Capitals to a two-year contract after the season finished.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the roughtail stingray {{is not fully}} resolved, with the disjunct northwestern Atlantic, southwestern Atlantic, and eastern Atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology, found that the roughtail stingray is the sister species to the broad stingray (D. lata), and that they form a clade with the southern stingray (D. americana) and the longtail stingray (D. longa). The close relationship between the roughtail and southern <b>stingrays</b> was upheld by a genetic analysis published by Leticia de Almeida Leao Vaz and colleagues in 2006. The roughtail and broad <b>stingrays</b> {{are found in the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively, and therefore likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma).|$|E
5|$|Timothy G. Breslin (December 8, 1967 – February 9, 2005) was a {{professional}} ice hockey left wing. Breslin played eight seasons in the International Hockey League (IHL) with the Phoenix Roadrunners and Chicago Wolves {{and part of a}} season in the ECHL with the South Carolina <b>Stingrays.</b> He also played major league roller hockey in Roller Hockey International (RHI) with the Chicago Cheetahs.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other <b>stingrays.</b> Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other <b>stingrays</b> in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E

50|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} sister species of the longnose <b>stingray</b> is the sharpsnout <b>stingray</b> (D. geijskesi), and that two form a clade with the pale-edged <b>stingray</b> (D. zugei), the pearl <b>stingray</b> (D. margaritella), the {{sharpnose}} <b>stingray</b> (Himantura gerrardi), and the smooth butterfly ray (Gymnura micrura, {{included in the study}} as an outgroup). These results support the growing consensus that neither Dasyatis nor Himantura are monophyletic.|$|R
5|$|Based on morphology, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman {{determined}} in a 2004 phylogenetic study that Platyrhinoidis and Platyrhina together form the most basal clade {{of the order}} Myliobatiformes, and are thus the sister group to all {{other members of the}} order (encompassing <b>stingrays</b> and their relatives). This finding affirmed that the thornback guitarfish is not closely related to the true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae, a possibility that had long been considered by taxonomists.|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, <b>stingrays,</b> sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E
5|$|From the 2013–14 season onwards, {{the league}} has {{consisted}} of two conferences; each consisting of five teams. These are the Erhardt Conference and the Gardiner Conference. These can roughly be split into north and south, with the Erhardt featuring the teams from Belfast, Cardiff, Coventry, Nottingham, and Sheffield; and the Gardiner featuring the teams from Braehead, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Fife, along with Hull <b>Stingrays</b> until 2015, and their replacements Manchester Storm from 2015 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Generally, yellow <b>stingrays</b> pay little heed to divers {{and can be}} {{approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of <b>stingrays</b> and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|Other {{common names}} {{used for this}} species include bluespotted ray, bluespotted fantail ray, bluespotted lagoon ray, bluespotted stingray, fantail ray, lesser fantail ray, lagoon ray, reef ray, ribbon-tailed stingray, and ribbontail stingray. Morphological {{examination}} {{has suggested that the}} bluespotted ribbontail ray is more closely related to the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river <b>stingrays</b> (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched fantail ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.|$|E
