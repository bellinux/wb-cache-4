40|$|Background :andnbsp;Previously, {{we showed}} {{experimentally}} that <b>saturation</b> of slow-wave <b>activity</b> provides a potentially individualized neurophysiologic endpoint for perception loss during anesthesia. Furthermore, {{it is clear}} that induction and emergence from anesthesia are not symmetrically reversible processes. The observed hysteresis is potentially underpinned by a neural inertia mechanism as proposed in animal studies. Methods :andnbsp;In an advanced secondary analysis of 393 individual electroencephalographic data sets, we used slow-wave activity dose-response relationships to parameterize slow-wave <b>activity</b> <b>saturation</b> during induction and emergence from surgical anesthesia. We determined whether neural inertia exists in humans by comparing slow-wave activity dose responses on induction and emergence. Results :andnbsp;Slow-wave <b>activity</b> <b>saturation</b> occurs for different anesthetics and when opioids and muscle relaxants are used during surgery. There was wide interpatient variability in the hypnotic concentrations required to achieve slow-wave <b>activity</b> <b>saturation.</b> Age negatively correlated with power at slow-wave <b>activity</b> <b>saturation.</b> On emergence, we observed abrupt decreases in slow-wave activity dose responses coincident with recovery of behavioral responsiveness in ~ 33 % individuals. These patients {{are more likely to have}} lower power at slow-wave <b>activity</b> <b>saturation,</b> be older, and suffer from short-term confusion on emergence. Conclusions :andnbsp;Slow-wave <b>activity</b> <b>saturation</b> during surgical anesthesia implies that large variability in dosing is required to achieve a targeted potential loss of perception in individual patients. A signature for neural inertia in humans is the maintenance of slow-wave activity even in the presence of very-low hypnotic concentrations during emergence from anesthesia. </p...|$|R

The average Ca- 41 <b>saturation</b> <b>activity</b> recorded in four small iron falls is 24 +/- 1 dpm/kg.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to assess early solar system processes, particularly ancient proto-solar activity. This goal was addressed on two fronts. First, a model was developed to explain the provenance of now extinct radionuclides in early solar system materials, namely the refractory inclusions termed CAIs (Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusion) found in carbonaceous chondrites. As CAIs are {{believed to be the first}} solids to condense in the solar system and are also believed to have formed close to the proto-Sun, a model which explains the now extinct radionuclides found in CAIs constrains early solar system processes. Secondly, a series of measurements were performed on samples of the early solar system, namely chrondritic meteorites and the inclusions called chondrules, often contained within these meteorites. Chondrules, which are often a chief constituent of these meteorites, are believed to have originated close to the proto-Sun. As such, these materials should contain clues about solar processes at the beginning of the solar system. ^ We propose a model for the incorporation of SLRs (short lived radionuclide) within CAIs in primitive carbonaceous meteorites. In this model SLRs are produced by energetic particle reactions in the proto-solar atmosphere of a more active proto-Sun characterized by proton fluxes higher than contemporary particle fluxes. These SLRs are entrained in the solar wind that is then implanted into CAI precursor material. This production mechanism is operational in the contemporary solar system and is responsible for implantation of 10 Be, 14 C and other nuclides in lunar materials. We utilize contemporary experimental solar wind production rates for 10 Be and 14 C and theoretical ancient production rates for 7 Be, 10 Be, 14 C, 26 Al, 36 Cl, 41 Ca, and 53 Mn. Using a ∼ 105 enhancement in SEPs (solar energetic particles) and hence production rates in conjunction with an accepted refractory mass inflow rates close to the proto-Sun, we model the SLR concentrations in CAI precursors. The model predictions are consistent with measurements of 7 Be, 10 Be, 36 Cl, 41 Ca, and 53 Mn, but fails by two orders of magnitude to account for 26 Al. We also predict the 14 C content in CAIs, which to date has not been measured. The implantation model will be presented at the 2009 Meteoritical Society Conference in Nancy, France in July. ^ Several chondritic meteorites have been processed for ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry), AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry), and noble gas analysis. Bulk analysis has been performed on the chondritic meteorites Bjurbole, Dhajala, and Sena through the use of ICP-OES. The radionuclides 10 Be (T 1 / 2 = 1. 36 MYR), 26 Al (T 1 / 2 = 0. 71 MYR), and 36 Cl (T 1 / 2 = 0. 30 MYR) have been measured in chondrules and matrix material from Bjurbole and Dhajala using AMS at Primelab (Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Lab). In order to unravel the complex exposure scenario for these materials, especially chondrules, shielding information must be obtained. 10 Be data from AMS in conjunction with production rate calculations for three Bjurbole chondrules indicates that the location of the chondrule samples was close to the surface of the meteorite. 36 Cl data from AMS in conjunction with production rate calculations indicates the size of the meteoroid to be ∼ 35 cm in radius. For Dhajala, 26 Al <b>saturation</b> <b>activity</b> in concert with 26 Al production rate calculations indicate our samples were located inside the meteoroid of radius 3 ̆e 100 cm, at a depth of ∼ 60 cm.

40|$|From {{time to time}} various {{analytical}} methods have been applied to tooth substance to establish the content of so-called trace elements such as lead and tin. " 2 Other ex-perimental work has shown that these trace elements may play {{an important part in}} the formation and preservation of teeth. 3 - 6 As trace elements are present in very low concentrations, it has been necessary in previous investigations to use pooled material from many different subjects to provide an adequate sample for analysis by chemical, spectrographic, or colorimetric methods. The conclusions which may be drawn from such experiments are necessarily limited by the non-specific nature of the material. Radioactivation analysis is a technic by which many elements may be detected and estimated with a greater sensitivity than that of conventional analytical procedures. The essential basis of the method is that the element to be determined is made radio-active by exposing the sample to bombardment by neutrons inside a neutron reactor. The radioactivity induced in this way has properties which are characteristic of the element concerned. After suitable chemical separation of the element, if necessary, the amount of the induced radioactivity, the rate of its decay, and the energy of the associated nuclear radiations can be measured without much difficulty by instruments such as Geiger and scintillation counters.

The results showed a very good agreement between measured and calculated spatial flux distributions in the reactor core and are reported by Trkov et al [1]. To validate the neutron spectra in commonly used irradiation positions series of activation experiments was performed. A larger number of monitor materials were irradiated in two irradiation positions: the CC and one channel in the carrousel facility (IC 40). Monitors irradiated in the first experiment included gold, aluminium, zirconium, zinc, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and manganese. The second experiment was performed to confirm the estimated neutron spectra in the central channel (CC) and IC 40. Monitors irradiated in the second experiment included gold, aluminium, uranium, thorium and tungsten.

40|$|Introduction Liquid targets using top-of-foil loading concept {{have been}} succesfully {{employed}} for routine high current production of 18 F and 13 N at Cyclotope (Houston,TX), {{over the past}} ten years 1, 2. These targets are typically filled with 3. 5 ml of water, then pressurized with helium gas at 22 bar and bombarded with 18 MeV protons (70 – 100 µA). Average calculated saturation yield for produc-tion of 18 F is ~ 7. 8 GBq/µA (210 mCi/µA) using in-house recycled [18 O]-water at approximately 93 % enrichment. Reduction of beam power per unit of area is one of the advantages of a tilted entrance-foil geo-metry. Implementation of this target geometry on the ACSI TR 19 cyclotron 25 degrees upwards irradiation port results in an almost horizontal target entrance foil. A 6 ml total cavity volume target allows variable liquid fill volumes of 1. 2 – 4. 5 ml for beam current operation from 30 – 120 µA, resulting in a very efficient use of the costly 18 O-water. In a near horizontal installation as in the mayority of cyclotrons, the fill volume flexibility is drastically reduced, having a minimum fill volume of 3. 3 ml. At the requirement of Laboratorios Bacon, Cyc-lotope modified the target design with a front mounted collimator compatible with the IBA Cyclone 18 / 9 cyclotron. A second requirement was to reduce the minimum fill volume for horizontally mounted targets to 2. 5 ml or less, while maintaining saturation yield performance. To preserve compatibility with existing IBA targets, the target hardware was modified to operate in self-pressurization mode. This paper presents the results obtained with high and low volume Niobium target inserts (6 ml and 4 ml) mounted near horizontally on the IBA Cyclone 18 / 9 cyclotron and operated in self-pressurization mode. We present pressure/current characteristics, target performance (saturation yield, produced activities, maintenance frequency, FDG yields, etc.). Material and Methods The following targets manufactured by Cyclotope were tested and routinely used for production at Laboratorios Bacon: 1 -High Volume Target CY 2 model (“American Standard”), 6 ml Niobium cavity. 2 -Low Volume Target, CY 3 a model (“Traful”), 4 ml Niobium cavity. 3 - Low volume Target, CY 3 b model (“Ferrum”), 4. 1 ml Niobium cavity. Results and Conclusion The advantages of self-pressurization mode (Laboratorios Bacon setup) are: - Using the vapor pressure as a performance parameter - heat removal by boiling/condensation cycle starts at lower temperature (beam cur-rent). While, the advantages of the pre-pressurized targets (Cyclotope setup) are: - reduced pressure fluctuations - performance is basically unaffected by plumbing dead volume - flexibility to locate instrumentation farther away from radiation fields - less dependence on fill volume - potential target leaks can be detected before starting an irradiation No significant differences were found in target performance when operated in either pressu-rization mode. The self-pressurizing setup seems to require a sligthly lower fill volume (approxi-mately 5 %). The maximum beam current was limited by the foil rupture pressure (~ 40 bar). Safe maximum operating pressure was determined as 30 bar. No foil rupture was experienced during nine months of daily irradiation of these targets in self-pressurizing mode at Laboratorios Bacon. The irradiation parameters and target performance for the different targets are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below. The low volume Traful and Ferrum targets have the best <b>saturation</b> <b>activity</b> vs. fill volume, A(sat) /V, relation. Both targets produce 310 ± 31 GBq (8. 4 ± 0. 8 Ci) of high quali-ty fluoride (F- 18) in two hours of irradiation at 70 µA. The low volume targets have a low operation pressure (20 bar @ 70 µA) when compared to the IBA (NIRTA XL) targets. The typical <b>saturation</b> <b>activity</b> for the low volume targets was 592 ± 59 GBq (16 ± 1. 6 Ci) of F- 18 at 70 µA, 8. 5 GBq/µA (228 mCi/µA) using 2. 7 ml enriched O- 18 water (98 % +). The maintenance interval (> 10 mA. h) is very conveniente to reduce personnel radiation dose. No reduction in FDG yields was observed during that operation interval. In contrast, operation of the high volume targets in pre-presurization mode at the Cyclotope facility results in a higher maximum beam current limit (135 µA) for the same operating pressure (25 bar). Nevertheless, more O- 18 water will be required to irradiate at this high current (4. 5 ml vs. 3. 0 ml). In self-pressurizing mode, a higher filling volume will reduce the expansion volume and, in consequence, the maximum beam current...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Analysis of beat-to-beat {{heart rate}} {{variability}} (HRV) provides information of cardiac vagal outflow to the sinus node. Some methodological problems might, however, {{be involved in the}} analysis of cardiac vagal outflow from ambulatory Holter recordings, such as <b>saturation,</b> physical <b>activity,</b> and abrubt prolongations of R-R intervals unrelated to respiration. The purpose of this thesis was to assess the physiological basis of beat-to-beat HRV and to develop and assess new methods for the quantification of cardiac autonomic modulation from ambulatory Holter recordings. The study population consisted of 89 healthy volunteers (age 24  ±  4 years) and 590 patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI, age 61  ±  10 years). The relationship between R-R interval length and the high-frequency (HF) spectral power of the R-R intervals was assessed in 76 healthy subjects and 82 post-AMI patients. The effects of aerobic exercise training on the dynamics between R-R interval and HF power were evaluated by means of a controlled 8 -week training intervention (n =  17). The effects of sympathetic activation and concomitant sympathetic and vagal outflow on beat-to-beat HR dynamics were studied in laboratory conditions (n =  13). A new method for quantifying beat-to-beat HRV from the R-R interval lengths where the relationship between HF power and R-R interval is most linear was developed to avoid the confounding effects of possible <b>saturation,</b> physical <b>activity,</b> and random R-R interval dynamics. The clinical significance of the new method was assessed in a series of 590 post-AMI patients. Saturated HF R-R interval dynamics, expressed as a lack of increase in HF power despite an increased R-R interval, was observed in 35 healthy subjects and 9 post-AMI patients. In the training study, 7 subjects {{out of a total of}} 17 had saturated HF power before the intervention. After the training period, 5 new cases of saturated HF power were observed. In laboratory conditions, co-activation of sympathetic and vagal outflow resulted in random R-R interval dynamics. In post-AMI patients, HF power analyzed exclusively from the R-R intervals where the relationship between the R-R interval and HF power was most linear (Vindex) predicted independently the occurrence of SCD among post-AMI patients, while traditionally analyzed HF power did not. In conclusion, the saturation of beat-to-beat HRV in ambulatory conditions is a common phenomenon. The prevalence of saturated HF power increases due to enhanced cardiac vagal outflow induced by aerobic training. Finally, the novel analysis of vagally mediated HRV (Vindex) provides unique information that cannot be obtained by traditional analysis of HF R-R interval dynamics...|$|R

It depended on the O 2 concentration in the culture during the late logarithmic growth phase. Maximal activity was observed at an oxygen concentration of 26 % <b>saturation.</b> The <b>activity</b> could be recovered in cell extracts and was proportional to the protein concentration in the cell extracts. The specific activity was increased 125 -fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by reversed-phase and gel filtration column chromatographies.

The Mn(2 +) -oxidizing activity was sensitive to NaN 3 and HgCl 2. It was inhibited by KCN, EDTA, Tris, and o-phenanthroline. Although most data indicated the involvement of protein in Mn 2 + oxidation, the activity was slightly stimulated by sodium dodecyl sulfate at a low concentration and by treatment with pronase and V 8 protease.
