40|$|Over {{the course}} of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the United States {{developed}} a wealthy society on the basis of cheap and abundant fossil fuel energy. As fossil fuels have become ecologically and economically expensive in the twenty-first century, America has shown mixed progress in transitioning to a more <b>sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system.</b> From 2000 to 2006, energy and carbon intensity of GDP continued favorable long-term trends of decline. Energy end-use efficiency also continued to improve; for example, per-capita electricity use was 12. 76 MWh per person per year in 2000 and again in 2006, despite 16 percent GDP growth over that period. Environmental costs of U. S. energy production and consumption have also been reduced, as illustrated in air quality improvements.

40|$|The {{transition}} to a <b>sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> faces more challenges than a simple replacement of fossil energy carriers by renewable sources. Since current structures do not favour sustainable energy generation and use it is indispensable to change the existing infrastructure. A fundamental change of the energy system also requires re-organizing spatial structures and their according institutions and governance structures. Especially in Austria, urban sprawl and unsustainable settlement structures are {{regarded as one of}} the main developments leading to increased energy demand. One of the aims within the project E-Trans 2050 was to identify socio-economic constellations that are central to the further transformation of the energy system and to focus on actors and their socio-technical framework conditions. Based on a sustainable future vision for the year 2050 a backcasting workshop was conducted to identify necessary steps for the envisaged {{transition to}} a more <b>sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system.</b> The results shed light on the necessary changes for a transformation towards sustainability in the specific Austrian situation. Critical issues are region-specific production of energy and its use, settlement and regional structures and values and role models, which all have a determining influence on energy demand. Combining the knowledge of extensive energy use with available energy resources in spatial planning decisions is a main challenge towards a long term <b>sustainable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
