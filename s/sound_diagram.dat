40|$|Negotiation {{diagrams}} are a {{model of}} concurrent computation akin to workflow Petri nets. Deterministic negotiation diagrams, equivalent to the much studied and used free-choice workflow Petri nets, are surprisingly amenable to verification. Soundness (a property close to deadlock-freedom) can be decided in PTIME. Further, other fundamental questions like computing summaries or the expected cost, can also be solved in PTIME for <b>sound</b> deterministic negotiation <b>diagrams,</b> while they are PSPACE-complete in the general case. In this paper we generalize and explain these results. We extend the classical "meet-over-all-paths" (MOP) formulation of static analysis problems to our concurrent setting, and introduce Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis problems, which encompass the questions above and new ones. We show that any Mazurkiewicz-invariant analysis problem can be solved in PTIME for sound deterministic negotiations whenever it is in PTIME for sequential flow-graphs [...] -even though the flow-graph of a deterministic negotiation diagram can be exponentially larger than the diagram itself. This gives a common explanation to the low-complexity of all the analysis questions studied so far. Finally, we show that classical gen/kill analyses are also an instance of our framework, and obtain a PTIME algorithm for detecting anti-patterns in free-choice workflow Petri nets. Our result {{is based on a}} novel decomposition theorem, of independent interest, showing that <b>sound</b> deterministic negotiation <b>diagrams</b> can be hierarchically decomposed into (possibly overlapping) smaller <b>sound</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Comment: To appear in the Proceedings of LICS 2017, IEEE Computer Societ...|$|R

40|$|Inhomogeneities {{associated}} with the cosmological QCD and electroweak phase transitions produce hydrodynamical perturbations, longitudinal sounds and rotations. It has been demonstrated by Hindmarsh et al. that the sounds produce gravity waves (GW) well after the phase transition is over. We further argue that, under certain conditions, an inverse acoustic cascade may occur and move sound perturbations from the (UV) momentum scale at which the sound is originally produced to much smaller (IR) momenta. The weak turbulence regime of this cascade is studied via the Boltzmann equation, possessing stationary power and time-dependent self-similar solutions. We suggest certain indices for the strong turbulence regime as well, into which the cascade eventually proceeds. Finally, we point out that two on-shell sound waves can produce one on-shell gravity wave, and we evaluate {{the rate of the}} process using a standard <b>sound</b> loop <b>diagram.</b> Comment: 13 pages.

40|$|International audienceHydroacoustic {{methods are}} widely {{employed}} by fish scientists for assessing fish stocks. The method {{most often used}} is echosounding, beaming vertically. Nowadays the multibeam sonar, and therefore the 3 -D presentation of fish schools, has yielded better knowledge of school morphology. Using the data collected simultaneously by both sonar and echosounding in a lake, we have identified boat-induced behavioural changes in small pelagic fish schools. Using high resolution sonar data, we showed that the fish schools detected under the boat have a significantly larger volume than those alongside the boat. This finding is explained according to behavioural response due to the theoretical characteristics of the boat <b>diagram</b> <b>sound</b> pressure, {{and the existence of}} a strong thermocline. Then we compared two descriptors, the height of the fish school and the backscatter energy. We found significant differences, which reveal vertical fish school compression occurring simultaneously with the horizontal and sidelong escape behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Vocalization {{is a rich}} {{potential}} source {{of information on the}} internal state of animals. This information is necessary for assessing the animal behavior and ensuring the most favorable conditions for holding and breeding animals in captivity. The sound indicators of animal's behavioral and physiological well-being can be applied with-out traumatic manipulations, which is especially important for such a rare and endangered species as the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Bight types of sounds were distinguished and attributed to three classes: pulsed, tonal, and noisy. The classification proposed is discussed in relation to mechanisms for producing different kinds of <b>sounds.</b> A hypothetical <b>diagram</b> of the correlation between the sound structure and states of confidence/diffidence and ag-gressiveness/nonagressiveness in the cheetah is considered. Establishing a correlation between the sound struc-ture and internal state of animals during sound pro-duction is one of important issues both in theoretical and applied acoustics (Morton, 1977; Nikolskii, 1984; Hauser, 1996).

In this research band edge, energy levels and strain effects of cubic In_ 0. 4 Ga_ 0. 6 As-GaAs quantum dots are studied by 6 -band k. p model and their dependence to substrate index is investigated. It is shown that change of substrate index affects the band gap and transition energy of electrons and holes. Moreover, we show that components of strain tensor are strongly sensitive to surface index, and symmetry breaks along space. Our results appear to be in very good consonance with represented formula and similar researches. Keywords: substrate index, quantum dot laser, band edge, strain tensor.

40|$|Spider {{diagrams}} {{provide a}} visual logic to express relations between sets and their elements, extending the expressiveness of Venn <b>diagrams.</b> <b>Sound</b> and complete inference systems for spider diagrams {{have been developed}} and {{it is known that}} they are equivalent in expressive power to monadic first-order logic with equality, MFOL[=]. In this paper, we further characterize their expressiveness by articulating a link between them and formal languages. First, we establish that spider diagrams define precisely the languages that are finite unions of languages of the form K {black small square} Γ*, where K is a finite commutative language and Γ is a finite set of letters. We note that it was previously established that spider diagrams define commutative star-free languages. As a corollary, all languages of the form K {black small square} Γ* are commutative star-free languages. We further demonstrate that every commutative star-free language is also such a finite union. In summary, we establish that spider diagrams define precisely: (a) languages definable in MFOL[=], (b) the commutative star-free regular languages, and (c) finite unions of the form K {black small square} Γ*, as just described...|$|R
40|$|Spider {{diagrams}} are {{a recently}} developed visual logic that make statements about relationships between sets, their {{members and their}} cardinalities. By contrast, the study of regular languages {{is one of the}} oldest active branches of computer science research. The work in this thesis examines the previously unstudied relationship between spider diagrams and regular languages. In this thesis, the existing spider diagram logic and the underlying semantic theory is extended to allow direct comparison of spider diagrams and star-free regular languages. Thus it is established that each spider diagram defines a commutative star-free regular language. Moreover, we establish that every com- mutative star-free regular language is definable by a spider diagram. From the study of relationships between spider diagrams and commutative star-free regular languages, an extension of spider diagrams is provided. This logic, called spider diagrams of order, increases the expressiveness of spider di- agrams such that the language of every spider diagram of order is star-free and regular, but not-necessarily commutative. Further results concerning the expres- sive power of spider diagrams of order are gained through the use of a normal form for the <b>diagrams.</b> <b>Sound</b> reasoning rules which take a spider diagram of order and produce a semantically equivalent diagram in the normal form are pro- vided. A proof that spider diagrams of order define precisely the star-free regular languages is subsequently presented. Further insight into the structure and use of spider diagrams of order is demonstrated by restricting the syntax of the logic. Specifically, we remove spiders from spider diagrams of order. We compare the expressiveness of this restricted fragment of spider diagrams of order with the unrestricted logic. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|The plenum is {{the space}} between a {{suspended}} ceiling and the structural deck above it. Since most offices have such spaces, sound masking speakers are commonly added there. For open offices, uniformity of the sound masking in the inhabited area is important and is largely determined by the horizontal spacing of the masking speakers as described above. Speaker arrays are generally rectangular. They generally face upwards to reflect sound from the deck and broaden {{the distribution of the}} sound to create a more uniform <b>sound</b> field. The <b>diagram</b> on the right shows an example. For closed offices, uniformity of sound level is not an issue. Generally, ceiling tiles with a high transmission loss are recommended, those with CAC (Ceiling Attenuation Class) ratings of 30 or greater. This reduces the impact of sound masking in adjacent open areas which would have excessive levels in those offices. Typically the ceiling plenum is used as a return air duct requiring an open grill. Sound masking in the plenum above a closed office can generate excessive levels. There are simple metal covers that are placed above the grille to reduce the impact of the hole. Available ones are sufficiently large so do not impede air flow. The upper figure n the left shows a masking speaker that mounts directly on the ceiling tile grid. The two lower figures are examples of speakers that are hung in the ceiling plenum. If the ceiling plenum is shallow, a low profile speaker is required. This speaker radiates sound horizontally rather than vertically to improve the uniformity of the masking in the occupied area below. An example is shown in the lower left figure.|$|R

40|$|AbstractUML is the de-facto {{standard}} formalism {{for software}} design and analysis. To support {{the design of}} large-scale industrial applications, sophisticated CASE tools {{are available on the}} market, that provide a user-friendly environment for editing, storing, and accessing multiple UML diagrams. It would be highly desirable to equip such CASE tools with automated reasoning capabilities, such as those studied in Artificial Intelligence and, in particular, in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Such capabilities would allow to automatically detect relevant formal properties of UML diagrams, such as inconsistencies or redundancies. With regard to this issue, we consider UML class diagrams, which {{are one of the most}} important components of UML, and we address the problem of reasoning on such diagrams. We resort to several results developed in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, regarding Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that admit decidable reasoning procedures. Our first contribution is to show that reasoning on UML class diagrams is EXPTIME-hard, even under restrictive assumptions; we prove this result by showing a polynomial reduction from reasoning in DLs. The second contribution consists in establishing EXPTIME-membership of reasoning on UML class diagrams, provided that the use of arbitrary OCL (first-order) constraints is disallowed. We get this result by using DLRifd, a very expressive EXPTIME-decidable DL that has been developed to capture typical features of conceptual and object-oriented data models. The last contribution has a more practical flavor, and consists in a polynomial encoding of UML class diagrams in the DL ALCQI, which essentially is the most expressive DL supported by current state-of-the-art DL-based reasoning systems. Though less expressive than DLRifd, the DL ALCQI preserves enough semantics to keep reasoning about UML class <b>diagrams</b> <b>sound</b> and complete. Exploiting such an encoding, one can use current DL-based reasoning systems as core reasoning engines for a next generation of CASE tools, that are equipped with reasoning capabilities on UML class diagrams...|$|R
