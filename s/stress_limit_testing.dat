Testing sponsored by the PVRC over 20 years ago was done by pressurizing circular flat disks made from three different materials until failure by bursting. The purpose of this re-analysis is to investigate the use of finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the primary <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (1998) and to qualify the use of elastic-plastic (EP-FEA) for limit load calculations. The three materials tested represent the range of strength and ductility found in modern pressure vessel construction and include a low strength high ductility material, a medium strength medium ductility material, and a high strength low ductility low alloy material. Results of elastic and EP-FEA are compared to test data. Stresses from the elastic analyses are linearized for comparison of Code primary <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> to <b>test</b> results. Elastic-plastic analyses are done using both best-estimate and elastic-perfectly plastic (EPP) stress-strain curves. Both large strain-large displacement (LSLD) and small strain-small displacement (SSSD) assumptions are used with the EP-FEA. Analysis results are compared to test results to evaluate the various analysis methods, models, and assumptions as applied to the bursting of thin disks...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the growing need in a simulation-based design verification flow capable to analyze any design of 3 D IC stacks {{and to determine}} across-die out-of-spec variations in device electrical characteristics caused by layout and through-silicon-via (TSV) /packageinduced mechanical <b>stress.</b> The <b>limited</b> <b>test</b> and characterization capabilities of 3 D IC stacks and a strict "good die" requirement make this type of analysis really critical for the achievement of an acceptable level of functional and parametric yield and reliability. The paper focuses {{on the development of}} a design-for- manufacturability (DFM) type of methodology for managing mechanical stresses during a sequence of designs of 3 D TSV-based dies, stacks and packages. A set of physics-based compact models for a multi-scale simulation, to assess the mechanical stress across the device layers in silicon dies stacked and packaged with the 3 D TSV technology, is proposed. A strategy for a materials data genera tion to feed simulation and a respective materials characterization approach are proposed, with the goal to establish a database for multi-scale materials parameters of wafer-level and package-level structures. A proposal for model validation based and a calibration approach based on fitting the simulation results to measured local stress components and to electrical characteristics of the test-chip devices are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Understanding species {{distribution}} ecology is essential given the growing {{need to understand}} how species will react to climate change and invasion. Understanding the processes by which distribution limits are set is necessary to build accurate distribution models, yet the role of biotic interactions (e. g. competition, predation, disease, parasitism) in determining range limits is uncertain, despite evidence that incorporating biotic information improves the accuracy of these models. By examining the elevational variability of Afromontane, avian range limits across several communities, we add to reports indicating that environmental conditions are generally more important in determining both high and low <b>stress</b> range <b>limits</b> across an environmental gradient. However, we note that biotic interactions may still be more important at low <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> than they are at high <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> and that the processes that limit ranges appear to be different at low and high <b>stress</b> <b>limits.</b> High <b>stress</b> range <b>limits</b> appeared to be much more variable, stimulating new and unexpected questions. We go on to document how distribution limits of avifauna have shifted in two Ugandan national parks. We tentatively conclude that range shifts may have occurred over the last decade, at a rate faster than one would have expected species to move merely based on the warming that has occurred. This indicated that warming may not be the only factor that is causing species’ upper limits to shift upwards in elevation. ...|$|R
40|$|Nine asymmetrically spanned {{reinforced}} concrete deep beams were designed and tested to unreinforced web crushing failure in this experimental study {{to establish the}} appropriate shear <b>stress</b> <b>limit</b> for beam design. The lower bound and mean shear design limits associated with the concrete strut crushing in the web of the beam are identified, based on the better correlated concrete compressive strength parameter rather than its square root.

40|$|Increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> at {{release of}} {{prestressing}} has garnered significant interest recently. <b>Stress</b> <b>limits</b> {{are used to}} provide adequate serviceability performance and to prevent premature failure of the materials. As engineers continue {{to push the envelope}} on span length and girder spacing to reduce costs, bridge girders are subjected to increasingly higher levels of stress under service loading. The impact of increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> at release of prestressing would be {{to increase the amount of}} steel a given section can contain, to reduce or eliminate the need for draping or debonding of strands improving plant safety and to provide faster turn around for precast plants since prestressing could be released at lower concrete strengths. In addition to increasing the <b>stress</b> <b>limits,</b> an increasing number of precast plants would like to be able to reap the benefits of self-consolidating concrete, but are reluctant due to the relatively unknown behavior of the material in prestressing applications. For this program, six reduced scale prestressed concrete girders were cast with targeted release stresses between 60 % and 80 % of the initial concrete compressive strength. Time-dependant prestress losses were measured at regular intervals for 196 days, which was then followed by structural testing to failure. Three of the girders were designed and tested for flexural performance, while the other three were designed and tested for shear performance. This paper reports the results of six shear tests conducted in the Structural Engineering Research Laboratory at Missouri S&T on the high-strength self-consolidating concrete members...|$|R

The strain limits established are based on a fraction of the strain at ultimate stress obtained from an engineering stress/strain curve of the material.

The application of the elastic-plastic criterion provides a more accurate, less conservative design/analysis basis for structures than that used in elastic stress-based analysis criteria, while still providing adequate safety margins...|$|R

40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics interpretation of rolling bearing fatigue MWJ Lewis 1 and B Tomkins 2 In fatigue assessment of structures and components, {{it is now}} commonplace to use a defect-tolerant approach {{to account for the}} inevitable presence of surface and internal flaws, both detectable and undetectable. This approach has been applied to rolling bearings in an attempt to present contact <b>stress</b> <b>limits</b> as a function of defect size below which fatigue failure would not be expected. In essence, it is an extension to the existing rating life methods developed by Ioannides and Harris that incorporate a fatigue <b>limit</b> <b>stress</b> in the estimation of bearing life, a concept {{similar to that of the}} endurance limit in structural fatigue. Such a {{fracture mechanics}} approach to sub-surface initiated fatigue in rolling bearing steels containing non-metallic inclusions, based upon the work of Murakami, has led to an allowable contact <b>stress</b> <b>limit</b> as a function of maximum inclusion size (as estimated by extreme value analysis). An alternative, less conservative fracture mechanics based <b>stress</b> <b>limit</b> is the prevention of propagation of cracks formed on inclusions (termed ‘butterflies’) by shear (Mode II) loading. The approach has been developed by examination of butterflies formed in service in rolling element bearings manufactured in bainitic steel with maximum inclusion sizes in excess of 100 mm. The observed lack of micro-crack formation on inclusions and non-propagation of butterflies support the concept of a fatigue endurance limit that is related to the cleanliness of the bearing steel...|$|R

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 10, 000 hedge funds worldwide, managing assets of over USD 1. 5 trillion. Investment banking activities {{are more and}} more intertwined with hedge funds, as hedge funds obtain financing from banks through prime brokerage and are clients or counterparties of banks for all sorts of products. The development of hedge funds has therefore created many opportunities for investment banks. Bank benefit from hedge funds activities directly to the extent that hedge funds are their clients. All capital market activities benefit from it, from brokerage and research to derivatives. Prime brokerage has become a growing source of income. Banks have a very important business of providing derivatives and products, from vanilla products to more complex, customized and exotic products. Hedge funds are also possible underlyings for derivatives. Many banks, including Société Générale, have developed a business of writing options on hedge funds as well as providing leverage to funds of funds. Investment banks are not only making profits by transacting with hedge funds. They also benefi t indirectly through more trading: on certain specifi c specialized market, like structured complex derivatives, there would be no market at all without the availability of hedge funds that are willing to take the risks. Together, as two intertwined partners, hedge funds and investment banks have extended the reach and effi ciency of capital markets. The benefi ts that this system brings to {{the economy as a whole}} is widely recognized. Not only do hedge funds provide important benefi ts for the economy in general but their risks are manageable. The risks for investors are overplayed. Whatever the risk measure, hedge funds are clearly less risky than equities. As regards operational risks, the market itself is able to generate protection solutions. Academic research has shown that operational risks can be dealt in the most extensive way by using managed account platforms, such as the Lyxor platform. The risks for banks are under control and the move toward “risk-based margining” has improved very much their risk management. Banks in general invest a lot of resources in monitoring hedge funds qualitatively through due-diligences. They also put different types of limits in order to cover different aspects of risks: nominal <b>limits,</b> <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> <b>limits,</b> limits on delta, limits on vega, expected tail loss limits. Moreover, they regulate their capital requirements using not only Value at Risk, the usual tool used by banks to allocate capital to market risks, but also stress tests losses based on the worst possible scenarios. These very sophisticated models are quite convincing. There is no reason to believe that they will not work in practice under stress conditions. There are also general consideration about a systemic risk that would be something else than banking risks, but it has no real argument to back it up. Hedge funds are fi rst of all the result of a signifi cant improvement of asset management techniques. These improvements are here to stay, whatever the regulatory environment will become, since these techniques will be more and more part of the mainstream asset management world. Hedge funds {{are more and more}} institutionalized. They will eventually merge with “classical” asset management, while some forms of compromises between hedge funds and classical asset management, such as absolute return funds or 130 - 30 funds, are becoming more common. Hedge funds are just a nice new development of capital markets that, like all past capital market developments, will be irreversible and will contribute to a more effi cient fi nancial system. ...|$|R
