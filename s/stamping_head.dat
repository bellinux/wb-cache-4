DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a stamping machine comprising a <b>stamping</b> <b>head</b> with a tool holder, a machine table, an x-y or x-y-z displacement device with a workpiece-clamping device, {{and a control unit}} adapted to control the <b>stamping</b> <b>head</b> and displacement device to carry out a process as above. USE - The process can be used e. g. to form cooling fins, threads, cable recesses, fastenings, lettering, constructional recesses or specialist designs. ADVANTAGE - Various geometries can be created without changing tools...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} materials are becoming {{of great interest}} in many fields. Understanding the behavior of these materials under stress at micrometer scale is of great importance for this development. To determine local deformations in a material, an optical pattern may be attached on the material surface. A semi-automated device, able to print a suitable optical pattern on metallic surface using microcontact printing, was manufactured. Good precision in placing the <b>stamping</b> <b>head</b> on the surface, {{in order to avoid}} smearing of the pattern was reached. Despite posing challenges in handling of the ink and in the consistency of the patterns, this method proved viable for effective and fast creation of optical patterns. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the properties and behaviour of material is of fundamental importance in modern engineering. In recent years a breakthrough method for measuring surface deformation has been represented by digital image correlation. To determine local deformations in a material, an optical pattern is usually reproduced on the material surface. The reproduction of such patterns, especially at microscopic scale, is usually a slow and expensive procedure. A semi-automated device, able to print a suitable optical pattern on the metallic surface using micro-contact printing, was manufactured. Precision placing of the <b>stamping</b> <b>head</b> on the surface {{in order to avoid}} smearing of the pattern was reached. Specifically the stamp was placed with tolerances of some micrometres. Despite posing challenges in the handling of the ink and in the consistency of the patterns, this method proved viable for effective and fast creation of optical patterns. Peer reviewe...|$|E

2500|$|The hammers or [...] "stamps" [...] in a {{stamping}} mill {{consisted of}} vertical balks of timber, iron-shod at the bottom, which were lifted by cams {{attached to the}} waterwheel drive shaft, and repeatedly dropped onto the ore which lay on a block of granite known as a mortarstone. There were usually {{two or three of}} these stamps in a row, powered by the same drive and operating in sequence. At first this process operated on the dry ore, which was shovelled in and removed by hand. However, in a 16th-century innovation from Europe, the <b>stamp</b> <b>heads</b> were surrounded by a wooden box with a finely perforated grill at one end and the ore was washed into the box by a stream of water which also washed out the crushed ore once it was just fine enough to pass through the grill. This was a vast improvement over dry stamping because it was a continuous process that also stopped the production of unwanted very fine dust.|$|R
