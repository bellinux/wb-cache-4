5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round: Indy's eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick, {{who drives}} the 1936 Auburn Boat Tail Speedster which allows Indy to escape {{during the opening}} sequence. Quan was chosen {{as part of a}} casting call in Los Angeles. Around 6000 actors auditioned {{worldwide}} for the part: Quan was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Spielberg liked his personality, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indy of cheating during a card game. He was credited by his birthname, Ke Huy Quan.|$|E
5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt altered {{his story}} later on, telling John H. Flood {{that he did}} not see Brocius's pistol {{on the ground in the}} dark until afterward. The pistol {{contained}} one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was {{in position to}} not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he {{was enrolled in a}} cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E

5|$|Lehnsherr learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X-Men {{arrive at}} the Grey home {{at the same time}} as the Brotherhood. Lehnsherr and Xavier go in alone, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before leaving with Lehnsherr. The Brotherhood decides to strike Worthington Labs, and the {{government}} sends multiple teams to attack the Brotherhood's base in the forest, with information gained from Darkhölme, furious over Lehnsherr's betrayal. However, the life forms in the camp are all copies of Multiple Man, and Lehnsherr uses his powers to move the Golden Gate Bridge <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his army can get to Alcatraz and facilitate the attack on Worthington Labs. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, 1964, Nguyễn Khánh and {{the senior}} {{officers}} in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials—led by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor—in Vietnam, as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Khánh put his rival General Dương Văn Minh—who he had deposed in a January 1964 coup—in charge of picking the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him. The HNC then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state, which would likely be Minh, given their sympathy towards him. Khánh did not want his rival taking power, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the Americans convinced the HNC to dilute {{the powers of the}} position to make it unappealing to Minh, who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene. However, Minh was back in South Vietnam after a few months and the power balance in the junta was still fragile.|$|E
5|$|While {{the comics}} are set during the Sonic X timeline, their plot is original. Eggman imprisons humans inside robots {{and tries to}} use them to kill the animals, but the animals destroy the robots. Eggman uses {{malicious}} Chao to destroy Station Square, but Tikal and Chaos arrive from the past, return the Chao to normal, and bring them back to the past. Soon, Sonic finds a machine in the desert and thinks nothing of it, but after fighting with Eggman in Paris and a bizarre world created by the doctor, Eggman reveals the desert machine was his and it begins to wreck Station Square. Sonic defeats it, but he is accused of working with Eggman, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Eggman are both locked up. Nelson bails Sonic out of jail, and he saves Cream and Chris from some ghosts.|$|E

5|$|In early 2010, Nomura {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} if Square Enix would release an international Final Mix of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, to which he replied he would like to, as he enjoyed the work from the English voice casting done in the previous games. However, he stated {{that one of the}} main reasons for the popularity of the Final Mix version of Kingdom Hearts II was because it was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the staff would think on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011. Final Mix was released for the first time outside Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix.|$|E
25|$|The band sent several demos {{to record}} companies, but {{were told that}} in order to be {{published}} they had to cut their hair and sing in Swedish. Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by John Levén. Just a couple of months later, Levén joined Yngwie Malmsteen's band Rising Force, and Malmsteen's former bassist, Marcel Jacob, joined Force. This only lasted for three months, though; Levén apparently had issues with Malmsteen, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Jacob traded places again.|$|E

But Homura realizes that Madoka will {{eventually}} remember the truth and regain her divinity, accepting that they might become enemies should that time come. A post-credits scene shows Homura seated in a chair while watching over Mitakihara City and a badly-beaten Kyubey in the vicinity. After staring into the horizon, Homura leans over and falls off a cliff.|$|E

Having done <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> others soon discovered {{over the course of}} a few years, those equations of motion did not predict some orbits very well or even correctly. Newton realized it was because gravitational interactive forces amongst all the planets was affecting all their orbits.|$|E

25|$|On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White {{was trying}} {{to break up a}} group of late revelers {{shooting}} at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. He attempted to confiscate the pistol of Curly Bill Brocius and was shot in the abdomen. Wyatt Earp buffaloed Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt told his biographer many years later that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time and had not noticed that Brocius' pistol was already on the ground. The pistol contained only one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. White died two days after his shooting, changing Brocius' charge to murder.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, Seddon {{bought a}} fourteen-room house at 63 Tollington Park, near London's Finsbury Park area {{and worked as}} a Superintendent of Collectors for a {{national}} insurance company. He had an obsession with making money; he ran a second-hand clothes business in his wife's name and also speculated in real estate. At some stage he had the idea of duping money out of another person, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his wife advertised to let out the second floor of their London home. A near-neighbour, Eliza Mary Barrow (born 1863), a 47-year-old somewhat eccentric spinster responded to this advertisement, moving in with her ward Ernest George Grant, the eight-year-old orphaned son of her friend, on 26 July 1910. Previously, she had shared lodgings with her cousin, Frank Vonderahe, but she apparently hoped the new arrangement with Seddon would be cheaper.|$|E
25|$|When {{he finally}} finds the Bane, he learns {{that it is}} not an adult monster, as was assumed, but instead a baby whose parents have just died.

After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa has just been crowned queen due to the crown princess's apparent death. The flier Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who explains how it is good Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth. The two then return to the surface world.|$|E
