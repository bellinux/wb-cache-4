40|$|Based on {{previous}} knowledge {{on the use}} of acoustics to assess hake larvae, a study was conducted in the Galician shelf (NW Spain) during winter (February-March 2012). An echosounder operating with 18, 38, 70, 120 and 200 kHz split-beam, hull-mounted transducers was employed. We analyzed the acoustic records in order to describe vertical and horizontal distribution patterns of fish larvae aggregations (mainly of the gadoid <b>species</b> <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> Micromesisitius poutassou and European hake Merluccius merluccius). Net sampling revealed that acoustic back-scattered energy at 38 and 70 kHz was roughly proportional to the density of Micromesistius poutassou larvae of 3. 5 mm and larger, while scattering due to zooplankton appear to be negligible at those frequencies. The results described herein suggest that echo-sounding data may provide a viable methodology for the study of spatial and temporal changes and trends in abundance of gadoid larvae, in particular blue whiting. In addition, the characterization of fish larvae aggregation will allow the mapping of their distribution by the analysis of previous acoustic databases...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of mesh configuration from 55 mm diamond to 55 turn square mesh on the size selectivity of four by-catch species (the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and the <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> Micromesistius poutassou) commonly captured in the crustacean fishery off the Portuguese south coast, were evaluated. Selectivity parameters for <b>blue</b> <b>whiting,</b> the most abundant species in the catches, were estimated taking into account between-haul variation, while for the remaining species, captured in much lower quantities, the selectivity estimates were based on pooled data by length class for all hauls within the same cod end.

The results suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 - 70 mm would be advisable to be compatible with the minimum landing sizes (MLSs) of 29 mm carapace length and 27 cm total length for red shrimp and hake, respectively, while it would greatly reduce the amount of discards, particularly those for <b>blue</b> <b>whiting,</b> that accounted for approximately 50 % of the total catch weight.

40|$|Echo {{integration}} is an established method for stock estimation. However, {{this method is}} not free of errors like every other measuring method. Especially the variation between day and night behaviour of fish may lead to large measuring errors. A new method is represented detecting such systematic errors, exemplified by investigations during the international hydroacoustic survey on the spring spawning herring in the Norwegian Sea. For this method all measured sA-values are sorted by starting time of the measuring unit distance. In order to reduce random influences a moving average over five time intervals is computed. When displaying these values in a diagram makes {{it is very easy}} to detect systematic errors based on the differences in day-night behaviour. For both <b>species,</b> herring and <b>blue</b> <b>whiting,</b> stock estimations are calculated based on the measured sA-values and the results of the analysed trawl catches. The influence of the differnt day and night behaviour of herring on the results of its biomass estimation is rather low.

The concern is higher for deep-sea organisms, as the Hg concentration in their tissues is commonly high.

Mean Hg concentrations ranged from 1. 30 ± 0. 61 to 7. 13 ± 7. 09 μg g− 1 dry mass, with maximum values observed for small-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula.

Measured concentrations increased with increasing trophic levels. Carbon isotopic ratios measured for these organisms demonstrated that settling phytoplanktonic organic matter is not only the main source fueling trophic webs but also the carrier of Hg to this habitat.

They {{play an important role}} in these ecosystems not only in term of abundance but also in the food chain. The abundance of the <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> stock is now estimated annually by acoustic methods. Traditionally, <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> was separated from other targets using catch information. Therefore, it often becomes problematic when only a few net samples are to be conducted. Multi-frequency method with an approach of measuring frequency response, r(f), is a reliable method for distinguishing between species recorded in echograms. Acoustic data collected during <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> surveys in 2005 and 2006 were used to calculate r(f) of <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> and myctophids. The r(f) of <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> and myctophids were estimated for each “trawl-polygon” and for schools recorded along the survey tracks. The results showed significantly differences in r(f) for <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> and myctophid groups. It is evidently believed that r(f) are reliable variables used to discriminate between these species. Two approaches were deployed to separate <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> and myctophids; the discriminant function analysis and the classification tree. The r(f) at 18, 38 and 70 kHz, the echo strength at 38 kHz, sA(38), and the depth of fish schools (school depth) were used as independent variables. Both discriminant function analysis and classification tree were successfully used to separate between species with a relatively high accuracy. r(18), r(70) and sA(38) were the most important variables in the discriminant function analysis while r(18) and r(38) were the most powerful variables in the classification tree method. During the survey in 2006, target strength, TS, of <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> was measured in situ using the TS probe method. The TS were estimated to be from - 37 dB to - 34 dB for 38 kHz and from - 39 dB to - 38 dB for 120 kHz. The relationship between target strength and length of fish was TS= 20 log(L) - 64. 2; L= 26. 0 cm. No significant relationship between TS and depth was found. The change in densities (tonnes/nmi 2) of <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> in 2005 and 2006 were about + 11. 8 %. Total biomass estimated for the 2005 survey was about 1. 8 million tonnes within an area of 75, 899 nmi 2. In the 2006 survey, it was estimated around 1. 0 million tonnes for an area of 38, 131 nmi 2...|$|R
