5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and {{semi-arid}} areas. Nests {{are found}} in Acacia, Agathis, Banksia, Casuarina and Eucalyptus woodland, in pastures, Callitris forests, city parks, farmlands, grasslands, heath, sand dunes, <b>savanna</b> <b>woodland,</b> swamps, urban gardens, wet rain-forests, wet and dry sclerophyll woodland, and even in buildings such as hotels and houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, <b>savanna</b> <b>woodland,</b> sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
25|$|The current {{estimate}} {{for the development}} of the site is estimated to be around 400 AD as a farming community on the southern coast of Mozambique. Contemporary annual and seasonal rainfall reveals very high variability in the region with most of the rainfall arriving in December and February, averaging 832mm/per year. The summer rainfall season experiences decadal cycles of wet and dry phases. The high variability of rainfall appears to have remained consistent throughout the last 1600 years. Pollen evidence from the surrounding lakes of Nhaucati and Xiroche suggests a lengthy period of drought between 1400 and 1700, peaking in 1700. This drought accompanied a dramatic change in vegetation cover from forest savanna mosaic to forest <b>savanna</b> <b>woodland.</b> Furthermore, the surrounding area contains relatively nutrient poor dunal sand, susceptible to erosion.|$|E
