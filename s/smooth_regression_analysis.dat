40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} strong uniform {{consistency}} of a weighted average of artificial data points. This is especially useful when information is incomplete (censored data, missing data [...] .). In this case, {{reconstruction of the}} information is often achieved nonparametrically by using a local preservation of mean criterion for which the corresponding mean is estimated by a weighted average of new data points. The present approach enlarges the possible scope for applications beyond just the incomplete data context and can also be useful to treat the estimation of the conditional mean of specific functions of complete data points. As a consequence, we establish the strong uniform consistency of the Nadaraya - Watson [Nadaraya, E. A., 1964. On estimating regression. Theory Probab. Appl. 9, 141 - 142; Watson, G. S., 1964. <b>Smooth</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analysis.</b> Sankhya Ser. A 26, 359 - 372] estimator for general transformations of the data points. This result generalizes the one of Hardle et al. [Strong uniform consistency rates for estimators of conditional functionals. Ann. Statist. 16, 1428 - 1449]. In addition, the strong uniform consistency of a modulus of continuity will be obtained for this estimator. Applications of those two results are detailed for some popular estimators.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{proposed}} for the computation of friction factors of commercial pipes. The first method applies the mean value of the zero velocity point (MZVP) to a theoretical friction factor equation, and the other directly computes the mean friction factor (MFF) by averaging the friction factor of both the smooth and rough walls while considering their relative contribution. The MFF method is preferred, because it is simple but covers all the flow characteristics of commercial pipes. Both MFF and MZVP methods consider two parts of a wall with different roughness heights: One part is rough {{and the other is}} <b>smooth.</b> A <b>regression</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed to determine optimum values of the roughness height and probability of encountering each part, using several sets of field data, including galvanized iron, wrought iron, cast iron, concrete, riveted steel, and concrete.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging has become a standard technology in human brain mapping. Analyses of the massive spatiotemporal functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging data sets often focus on parametric or non-parametric modelling of the temporal component, whereas spatial smoothing is based on Gaussian kernels or random fields. A weakness of Gaussian spatial smoothing is underestimation of activation peaks or blurring of high curvature transitions between activated and non-activated regions of the brain. To improve spatial adaptivity, we introduce a class of inhomogeneous Markov random fields with stochastic interaction weights in a space-varying coefficient model. For given weights, the random field is conditionally Gaussian, but marginally it is non-Gaussian. Fully Bayesian inference, including estimation of weights and variance parameters, can be carried out through efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Although motivated by the analysis of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} data, the methodological development is general and can also be used for spatial <b>smoothing</b> and <b>regression</b> <b>analysis</b> of areal data on irregular lattices. An application to stylized artificial data and to real {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} data from a visual stimulation experiment demonstrates the performance of our approach in comparison with Gaussian and robustified non-Gaussian Markov random-field models.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} glaucomatous structural damage assessed by the Cirrus Spectral Domain OCT (SDOCT) and functional loss as measured by standard automated perimetry (SAP). Methods: Four hundred twenty-two eyes (78 healthy, 210 suspects, 134 glaucomatous) of 250 patients were recruited from the longitudinal Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and from the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. All eyes underwent testing with the Cirrus SDOCT and SAP within a 6 -month period. The relationship between parapapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) sectors and corresponding topographic SAP locations was evaluated using locally weighted scatterplot <b>smoothing</b> and <b>regression</b> <b>analysis.</b> SAP sensitivity values were evaluated using both linear as well as logarithmic scales. We also tested the fit of a model (Hood) for structure-function relationship in glaucoma. Results: Structure {{was significantly related to}} function for all but the nasal thickness sector. The relationship was strongest for superotemporal RNFL thickness and inferonasal sensitivity (R(2) = 0. 314, P < 0. 001). The Hood model fitted the data relatively well with 88 % of the eyes inside the 95 % confidence interval predicted by the model. Conclusions: RNFL thinning measured by the Cirrus SDOCT was associated with correspondent visual field loss in glaucoma.

40|$|S-PLUS is a {{powerful}} environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been {{made possible by the}} widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as {{a powerful}} and graphical system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS, and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear and non-linear regression models, robust and <b>smooth</b> <b>regression</b> methods, survival <b>analysis,</b> multivariate analysis, tree-based methods, time series, spatial statistics, and classification. This second edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 3. 3, 4. 0, or later. It covers the recent developments in graphics and new statistical functionality, including bootstraping, mixed effects, linear and non-linear models, factor <b>analysis,</b> and <b>regression</b> with autocorrelated errors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to test empirically the {{existence}} of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), using existing and new Panel <b>Smoothing</b> Transition <b>Regressions</b> (PSTR) in the city of London. More specifically, two new PSTR are proposed, the Gaussian and the Generalized Bell function used in Fuzzy Logic. Moreover, two air pollutants are examined using social data from the British Household Panel Survey. The air pollutants are the carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2). In particular the paper uses three regime <b>smoothing</b> transition <b>regressions.</b> More specifically, because the definition of the two regime <b>smoothing</b> <b>regressions</b> is not very clear, as three income classes exist, three regime <b>smoothing</b> <b>regressions</b> are proposed. Thus, the three regimes include the low, middle and high income. In the case of CO a negative relationship between air emissions and income is reported in low and high income classes, while midlle income households present a positive relation. On the contrary regarding SO 2, individuals and households with middle income pollute more, followed by high income class, while a negative association is presented to low income. Therefore, EKC should be examined for a number of various air pollutants in micro-economic level too, because the patterns derived from the estimations are varied using different air pollutants...|$|R
