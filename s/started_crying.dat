25|$|Thorfinn, {{having no}} other choice, follows Eskil and Vrage to meet Vagn. Surprisingly, when Vagn sees Thors’s son Thorfinn, he <b>started</b> <b>crying</b> publicly. Thorfinn finally learns {{that the person}} who ordered for Thors’s death was Floki, as Thors was the mostly likely {{candidate}} to be the third chieftain. Rage crossed Thorfinn’s mind but leaves to sort himself out. Alone, he questions if he can still change for the better and become a kinder person. Thorfinn also meets one of his old crewmates, Atli who is arrested for thievery. Atli says he has a family back home and “will find an honest line of work”. Vagn warns Thorfinn that people like Atli will return to stealing and killing people instead of field labor, so killing him is better than releasing him. Hild leaves after questioning Vagn on the same thing since he is also enjoying an extravagant meal when there are no animals or fields around. Thorfinn wishes to not go to Jomsborg nor fight anyone, not even to meet Floki again. Thorfinn states that King Canute will oversee the affairs of Thors’s murder while Thorfinn will complete his own mission without needless bloodshed. Later, Vagn is puzzled when Thorfinn and Hild are trying to stop Vagn’s men from sexually assaulting the slave girls.|$|E

He argued that, through the application of this theory, the beating that killed Cancellor had been a necessary one.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she <b>started</b> <b>crying,</b> but I left it on the record." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} of [...] "The Power of Three" [...] {{took place}} at Roath Lock, Cardiff on 27 April 2012. It was filmed by itself in the series' third production block. Because of this schedule, it was the final episode Gillan and Darvill filmed as Amy and Rory. Their last scene filmed together was getting into the TARDIS with the Doctor after saying farwell to Brian; when the doors closed Gillan, Darvill, and Smith hugged and <b>started</b> <b>crying.</b> Some exterior scenes at Amy and Rory's house were re-shot in June and July 2012, with Darvill briefly returning for the June re-shoot. Producer Marcus Wilson stated that a [...] "hundred" [...] individual cube props were made, with [...] "many more" [...] added with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Amy and the Doctor's conversation outside the Tower of London could not be filmed at the genuine location due to the London Olympics, so it was shot on studio in Cardiff and the live action was combined with other footage to create the illusion. The episode also features cameos from physicist Brian Cox and Lord Sugar, {{both of whom were}} long-time fans of the program. Sugar's cameo was in fact filmed on the set of The Apprentice, with director Douglas Mackinnon standing in for the person who was fired.|$|E

I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved."
