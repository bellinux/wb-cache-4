40|$|A {{previously}} developed methodology {{to model}} the hydrologic performance of stock ponds is modified and tested using data from Arizona chaparral watersheds. The modified method uses stochastic computer models to generate time series' of daily precipitation and temperatures, then transforms this synthetic data into daily streamflow using a soil moisture accounting model. The streamflow model, called a Generalized Streamflow Simulation System, is used to simulate the long "baseflow" recessions typical of chaparral watersheds. Generated streamflow is routed through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>stock</b> ponds to yield statistics and probability distributions for the following annual pond performance criteria: runoff retention, spillage, and pond dry days. A case study of pond performance on a chaparral watershed is performed using the calibrated simulation model. Simulation results {{are discussed in the}} context of previous case studies for other areas of Arizona. Simulation results, computer program listings, and sample outputs are included in the report...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} a local search heuristic and a genetic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size bin packing problem. The problem consists <b>of</b> placing a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> pieces represented as 2 D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2 D irregular bin packing consider single size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied in a number <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> size <b>stock</b> sheets as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange {{them in order to}} minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite <b>set</b> <b>of</b> angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict the orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and the genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good solutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes...|$|R

50|$|The final build <b>of</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Stock</b> was a {{small batch}} of 26 motor cars ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell in 1934, after the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in the previous year. The Piccadilly line was extended from South Harrow to Uxbridge, and this required an extra eight seven-car trains. These were made up from the new motor cars and some reshuffling of stock between other lines. Although very similar to the 1931 build, there were some minor differences. The 1931 build had used motors with roller bearings for the first time, and ten of the new motor cars were also fitted with roller bearing axle boxes, {{to reduce the amount of}} maintenance required with white metal bearings. With the completion of the 1934 build, the total number <b>of</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Stock</b> cars was 645 motor cars, 551 trailers and 270 control trailers.|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the 1938 Stock released considerable numbers <b>of</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Stock</b> trains, which were scheduled {{to make up the}} shortfall on the Central line resulting from the extensions to the line. However, this process was interrupted by the Second World War, and although much <b>of</b> the <b>Standard</b> <b>Stock</b> had been through Acton Works for refurbishment, it was stored, as the opening of the extensions was delayed. Further refurbishment was carried out as the extensions opened between 1946 and 1949, but the stock proved to be unreliable after such a long period of storage. With the Piccadilly line also needing more trains, a plan for new rolling stock was formulated in 1948.|$|R
50|$|This build was not {{initially}} compatible with other builds, {{because it was}} fitted with an electro-pneumatic braking system, {{as well as the}} Westinghouse air brake.
