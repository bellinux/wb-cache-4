40|$|Open loop {{frequency}} acquisition {{performance is}} discussed for suppressed carrier binary phase shift keyed signals {{in terms of}} the probability of detecting the carrier frequency offset when the arms of the Costas loop detector have one pole filters. The approach, which does not require symbol timing, uses fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) to detect the carrier frequency offset. The detection probability, which depends on both the 3 dB arm filter bandwidth and the received <b>symbol</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio, is derived and is shown to be independent of symbol timing. It is shown that the performance of this technique is slightly better that other open loop acquisition techniques which use integrators in the arms and whose detection performance varies with symbol timing...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} benefit {{of using a}} smoothing filter to estimate carrier phase over use of phase locked loops (PLL) is determined. Numerical results are presented {{for the performance of}} three possible configurations of the deep space network advanced receiver. These are residual carrier PLL, sideband aided residual carrier PLL, and finally sideband aiding with a Kalman smoother. The average <b>symbol</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio (CNR) after losses due to carrier phase estimation error is computed for different total power SNRs, symbol rates and symbol SNRs. It is found that smoothing is most beneficial for low symbol SNRs and low symbol rates. Smoothing gains up to 0. 4 dB over a sideband aided residual carrier PLL, and the combined benefit of smoothing and sideband aiding relative to a residual carrier loop is often in excess of 1 dB...|$|E
40|$|Aiming at {{the digital}} {{quadrature}} modulation system, a mathematical Pan-function {{model of the}} optimized baseband symbol signals with a symbol length of 4 T was established {{in accordance with the}} minimum out-band energy radiation criterion. The intersymbol interference (ISI), symbol-correlated characteristics, and attenuation factor were introduced to establish the mathematical Pan-function model. The Pan-function was added to the constraints of boundary conditions, energy of a single baseband <b>symbol</b> <b>signal,</b> and constant-envelope conditions. Baseband symbol signals with the optimum efficient spectrum were obtained by introducing Fourier series and minimizing the Pan-function. The characteristics of the spectrum and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the obtained signals were analyzed and compared with the minimum shift keying (MSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals. The obtained signals have the characteristics of a higher spectral roll-off rate, less out-band radiation, and quasi-constant envelope. We simulated the performance of the obtained signals, and the simulation results demonstrate that the method is feasible...|$|E
40|$|A Weighted Integrate and Dump Filter (WIDF) is {{presented}} {{that results in}} reducing those losses in telemetry <b>symbol</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio (SNR) which occur in digital Integrate and Dump Filters (IDFs) when the samples are not phase locked to the input data symbol clock. The Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criterion is used to derive a set of weights for approximating the analog integrate and dump filter, which is the matched filter for detection of signals in additive white Gaussian noise. This new digital matched filter results in considerable performance improvement compared to unweighted digital matched filters. An example {{is presented}} for a sampling rate of four times the symbol rate. As the sampling offset (or phase) varies {{with respect to the}} data symbol boundaries, the output SNR varies 1 dB for an unweighted IDF, but only 0. 3 dB for the optimum WIDF, averaged over random data patterns. This improvement in performance relative to unweighted IDF means that significantly lower sampling and processing rates can be used for given telemetry symbol rates, resulting in reduced system cost...|$|E

40|$|The linearized {{tracking}} {{errors of}} three Manchester (biphase coded) symbol tracking loops are compared {{to determine which}} is appropriate for Block 5 receiver applications. The first is a nonreturn to zero (NRZ) symbol synchronizer loop operating at twice the symbol rate (NRZ x 2) so that it operates on half symbols. The second near optimally processes the mid-symbol transitions and ignores the between symbol transitions. In the third configuration, the first two approaches are combined as a hybrid to produce the best performance. Although this hybrid loop is the best at low <b>symbol</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratios (SNRs), it has about the same performance as the NRZ x 2 loop at higher SNRs (greater than 0 -dB E sub s/N sub 0). Based on this analysis, it is tentatively recommended that the hybrid loop be implemented for Manchester data in the Block 5 receiver. However, the high data rate case and the hardware implications of each implementation must be understood and analyzed before the hybrid loop is recommended unconditionally...|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{relevance}} of semantic and linguistic description to translation, theory and practice. It is aimed towards a practical model of approach to texts to translate. As literary texts [poetry mainly] {{are the focus of}} attention, so are stylistic matters. Note, however, that 'style', and, to some extent, the conclusions of the work, are not limited to so-called literary texts. The study of semantic description reveals that most translation problems do not stem from the cognitive (langue-related), but rather from the contextual (parole-related) aspects of meaning. Thus, any linguistic model that fails to account for the latter is bound to fall short. T. G. G. does, whereas Systemics, concerned with both the 'Iangue' and 'parole' (stylistic and sociolinguistic mainly) aspects of meaning, provides a useful framework of approach to texts to translate. Two essential semantic principles for translation are: that meaning is the property of a language (Firth); and the 'relativity of meaning assignments' (Tymoczko). Both imply that meaning can only be assessed, correctly, in the relevant socio-cultural background. Translation is seen as a restricted creation, and the translator's encroach as a three-dimensional critical one. To encompass the most technical to the most literary text, and account for variations in emphasis in any text, translation theory must be based on typology of function Halliday's ideational, interpersonal and textual, or, Buhler's <b>symbol,</b> <b>signal,</b> symptom, Functions 3. Function Coverall and specific] will dictate aims and method, and also provide the critic with criteria to assess translation Faithfulness. Translation can never be reduced to purely objective methods, however. Intuitive procedures intervene, in textual interpretation and analysis, in the choice of equivalents, and in the reception of a translation. Ultimately, translation, theory and practice, may perhaps constitute the touchstone as regards the validity of linguistic and semantic theories...|$|E

One such requirement is to achieve high rate communications between clients. e. g. terminals or sensors, in the network while hiding information about the transmitted <b>symbols,</b> <b>signal</b> activity, or other sensitive data from an unintended receiver, e. g. an eavesdropper. For wireless links the single user capacity advantages of deployment of multiple antennas at the transmitter is well known.

In particular, we show that signicant gains are achievable when the transmitter and the client receiver are both informed about their channel while the transmitter and eavesdropper receiver are uniformed about their channel. More generally, we compare capacity limits for both informed and uninformed transmitter and informed receiver scenarios subject to low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) constraints. For several general cases we can characterize the LPI- and LPD-optimal transmitted source distributions and compare them to the standard optimal source distribution satisfying a power constraint.
