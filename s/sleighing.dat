5|$|The use of Korketrekkeren for tobogganing {{created a}} {{conflict}} with the local residents—especially at the guest house in Sverdrupstuen, which was often blocked on Sundays. There was also a conflict between cross-country skiing and tobogganing, as both groups wanted priority on the road. Akeforeningen proposed holding a tournament in 1921, but this {{was rejected by the}} municipal council. However, an auto race was held on the track that year. Permission for the <b>sleighing</b> race was given the following season, resulting in regular tournaments. Construction of Heftyebakken took place in 1930. The track was constructed between Frogerseteren to Svendstuen, including a concrete curve which allowed it to connect to Korketrekkeren. Heftyebakken had a poor profile as it was not steep enough in the lower areas. In 1950, Heftyebakken was converted to a skiing trail and Korketrekkeren became a pure tobogganing trail.|$|E

25|$|During {{winter of}} 1862, {{several months after}} the start of the Civil War, Edmonia Lewis was {{attending}} Oberlin when an incident occurred between her and two classmates, Maria Miles and Christina Ennes. The three women, all boarding in Keep's home, planned to go sleigh riding with some young men later that day. Before the <b>sleighing,</b> Lewis served her friends a drink of spiced wine. Shortly after, Miles and Ennes fell severely ill. Doctors examined them and concluded that the two women had some sort of poison in their system, apparently cantharides, a reputed aphrodisiac. For a time it was not certain that they would survive. Days later, it became apparent that the two women would recover from the incident, and, because of their recovery, the authorities initially took no action. There is no evidence that Lewis actually poisoned the two students, or that doctors actually found any traces of poison in the bodies of Miles and Ennes.|$|E

500|$|Louise's {{first few}} months in Canada were tinged with sadness as her {{favourite}} sister, the Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, died on 14 December 1878. Although homesick over that first Christmas, Louise soon grew accustomed to the winter climate. <b>Sleighing</b> and skating were two of her favourite pastimes. In Canada, as the monarch's direct representative, Lorne always took precedence over his wife, so that at the Opening of the Parliament of Canada on 13 February 1879, Louise was ranked no differently from others in attendance. She had to remain standing with the MPs, until Lorne asked them to be seated. In order for Lorne to meet every Canadian member of Parliament, he held bi-weekly dinners for 50 people. However, some of the Canadian ladies responded negatively to the British party. One of her ladies-in-waiting reported that some had an [...] "'I'm as good as you' sort of manner when one begins a conversation." [...] Court entertainments were open; anyone who could afford the clothing to attend functions was simply asked to sign the visitor's book. Louise's first state ball was given on 19 February 1879, and she made a good impression on her guests when she ordered the silk cordon, separating the viceregal party from the guests, be removed. However, the ball was marred by various mishaps, including a drunken bandsman nearly starting a fire by pulling a curtain over a gas lamp. The open house practice was criticised by guests who complained about the low social status of other guests. One attendee was horrified to find the attendee's grocer dancing in the same set.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1850s Dickens began to {{contemplate}} a second {{visit to the}} United States, tempted by the money that he believed he could make by extending his reading tour there. The outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. Over {{two years after the}} war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool on 9 November 1867 for his second American reading tour. Landing at Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and his American publisher, James Thomas Fields. In early December, the readings began. [...] He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868. Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the [...] "true American catarrh", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some <b>sleighing</b> in Central Park.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{idea of the}} bucolic {{nature of}} the place that would become Woodside {{can be seen in}} {{descriptions}} of an ancient central landmark, a great chestnut tree. [...] The tree was hundreds of years old when it finally came down in {{the last decade of the}} 19th century. [...] It stood on high ground near a junction of three dirt roads and [...] "was of great diameter, some 8 or 10 feet"—perhaps 30 feet in circumference. [...] Its size and central location made it a natural a meeting place, a surface on which to tack public notices, and strategic point of considerable military significance during the Revolutionary War. [...] A 19th-century antiquarian wrote of the great tree as it stood during the American Revolution and in doing so named the families of the local landowners: Around the roots of the old tree were the huts and stables of the cavalry: with a number of settler's huts ranged in woods... Great festivities too were constant in the spacious rooms of the old Moore house, during the winter months when the snow was deeper and the frost more cold than now-a-days. To the streaming lights from the ball room, and the lanterns hung on the trees, were wont to assemble the gay <b>sleighing</b> parties from the Sacket , Morrell, Alsop, Leverich and other houses; for the soldiers were all over and had come to Newtown to recruit [...] themselves after the yearly campaigns... Is there any relic more associated with Newtown [...] than its old chestnut tree?... not been for two centuries the [...] "Legal Notice" [...] centre of Newtown, for all vendues, real estate transfers, town meetings, lost [...] "creeturs" [...] and runaway slaves? ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} we {{will examine}} a nonholonomic system with Lie group symmetry: the Chaplygin <b>sleigh</b> coupled to an oscillator moving through a potential fluid in two dimensions. This example is chosen to illustrate several general features. The <b>sleigh</b> {{system in the}} plane has SE(2) symmetry. This group symmetry {{will be used to}} separate the dynamics of the system into those along the group directions and those not. The oscillator motion is not along the group and so acts as an additional configuration space coordinate that plays the role of internal "shape. " The potential fluid serves as an interactive environment for the <b>sleigh.</b> The interaction between the fluid and <b>sleigh</b> depends not only on the <b>sleigh</b> body shape and size but also on its motion. The motion of the <b>sleigh</b> causes motion in the surrounding fluid and vice-versa. Since the <b>sleigh</b> body is coupled to the oscillator, the oscillator will have indirect interaction with the fluid. This oscillator serves as internal shape and interacts with the external environment of the <b>sleigh</b> through its coupling to the <b>sleigh</b> body and the nonholonomic constraint; it will be shown that this interaction can produce a variety of types of motion depending on the <b>sleigh</b> geometry. In particular, when the internal shape of the system is actively controlled, it will be proven that the <b>sleigh</b> can be steered through the plane towards any desired position. In this way the sleigh-fluid-oscillator system will demonstrate how a rigid body can be steered through an interactive environment by controlling things wholly within the body itself and without use of external thrust...|$|R

Schlittenfahrt means [...] "Sleigh Ride"; the use of <b>sleigh</b> bells in the piece clearly emphasises this.

The topography of the dynamics of the tuned <b>sleigh</b> bells make the piece seem like a <b>sleigh</b> ride, as the dynamics rise and fall like a <b>sleigh</b> would over snow. This is followed by a beautiful but simple posthorn solo that gives a very peaceful and clear atmosphere to the piece, like a winter's day.
