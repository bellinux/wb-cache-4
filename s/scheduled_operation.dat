5|$|Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took {{command of}} No.467 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancasters {{in the air}} war over Europe. He led his unit through the Battle of Berlin from November 1943 to March 1944. In April {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Flying Cross, and the {{following}} month promoted to temporary group captain. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation</b> of his tour as No.467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have been shot down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside Brussels.|$|E

25|$|On 26 July 1957, Eagle {{formed an}} {{overseas}} subsidiary, named Eagle Airways (Bermuda), {{in preparation for}} the launch of transatlantic scheduled services between Bermuda and New York, using Viscount 800 turboprop aircraft.

25|$|In February 1949, Silver City {{established}} a French sister airline headquartered in Paris to operate vehicle ferry flights from Le Touquet Airport. The new company was registered {{under the name}} Société Commerciale Aérienne du Littoral (SCAL). A number of Silver City aircraft were registered to this company. These were transferred onto the French aircraft register. In addition, an agreement was reached to appoint the Automobile Club de France as Silver City's and SCAL's official representative in France. These steps were necessary to secure French approval to turn the seasonal charter flights Silver City had operated on this route into a full-fledged <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
25|$|BIA's {{corporate}} headquarters was located at Redhill, Surrey, Southeast England. The airline's main engineering base was at Blackpool, Lancashire, Northwest England, while its {{main operating base}} was at London Gatwick. Other airports that used to receive BIA's regular scheduled passenger services {{in the early to}} mid-1970s included Antwerp, Belfast, Blackpool, Dublin, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Manchester, Newcastle, Paris Orly and Southampton. Many of the services to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were operated on a seasonal basis — exceptions being year-round operations linking Gatwick with Guernsey, Southampton with both Channel Islands and the Isle of Man with Blackpool and Belfast. BIA's scheduled route network was considerably enlarged in 1979 when it assumed the entire <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation</b> of British Air Ferries (BAF).|$|E

25|$|BOAC countered Eagle's move to {{establish}} {{itself as a}} full-fledged scheduled transatlantic competitor on its Heathrow—JFK flagship route by forming BOAC-Cunard as a new £30 million joint venture with Cunard Steamship Co. BOAC contributed 70% of the new company's capital and eight Boeing 707s. Cunard Eagle's long-haul <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation</b> — including the two new 707s — was absorbed into BOAC-Cunard before delivery of the second 707, in June 1962. BOAC-Cunard leased any spare aircraft capacity to BOAC to augment the BOAC mainline fleet at peak times. As part of this deal, BOAC-Cunard also bought flying hours from BOAC for using the latter's aircraft {{in the event of}} capacity shortfalls. This maximised combined fleet utilisation. The joint fleet use agreement did not cover Cunard Eagle's European scheduled, trooping and charter operations.|$|E
25|$|Pan Am ceased {{operations}} on December 4, 1991 following {{a decision by}} Delta's CEO, Ron Allen, and other senior executives not {{to go ahead with}} the final $25million payment Pan Am was scheduled to receive the weekend after Thanksgiving. As a result, some 7,500 Pan Am employees lost their jobs, thousands of whom had worked in the New York City area and were preparing to move to the Miami area to work at Pan Am's new headquarters near Miami International Airport. Economists predicted that 9,000 jobs in the Miami area, including jobs at companies not connected to Pan Am that were dependent on the airline's presence, would be lost after it folded. The carrier's last flown <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation</b> was Pan Am flight 436 which departed that day from Bridgetown, Barbados at 2pm (EST) for Miami under the command of Captain Mark Pyle flying Clipper Goodwill, a Boeing 727–200 (N368PA).|$|E
25|$|Eagle {{along with}} British United Airways (BUA) — its {{principal}} contemporary independent competitor — had successfully lobbied the Government {{to bring about}} a change in legislation that had given their state-owned counterparts a virtual monopoly on scheduled services. This resulted in the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act of 1960, which abolished BEA's and BOAC's statutory monopoly on principal domestic and international scheduled routes and — theoretically — gave the independents equal opportunities to develop such routes in their own right. Eagle concurred with BUA and Caledonian Airways — an independent upstart that would subsequently compete with it head-to-head for a licence to operate transatlantic scheduled services — that running a fully fledged <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation</b> {{was the only way to}} build an airline with a long-term, stable future. It argued that the non-scheduled nature of its business — mainly trooping, ad hoc charters and IT flying — made planning ahead difficult because of extreme seasonality and generally low margins. Therefore, Eagle saw its future primarily as an international scheduled passenger and freight carrier with transatlantic ambitions.|$|E

25|$|On 7 July 1948, a Silver City Bristol Freighter {{operated}} the first cross-Channel air ferry service, between Lympne near Folkestone in Kent and Le Touquet on France's northern Côte d'Opale coast, with good road connections from and to London and Paris respectively. The new service, which initially operated on a seasonal charter basis, became a year-round <b>scheduled</b> <b>operation</b> in 1949. In the beginning, {{there was a}} flat £32 one-way fare to take a group of four passengers along with their car across the Channel. Once opposition from British European Airways (BEA) to the carriage of passengers travelling without vehicles was overcome, a new fare structure was introduced. For example, a group of four travelling with a small car was charged only £27, while the comparable fare for four people travelling with a large car remained at £32. By the end of 1949, this operation fully utilised five Freighters, which carried 2,700 cars and 10,000 passengers. These figures represented a significant increase {{over the previous year}} when only 178 cars and their occupants, as well as some motorcycles and bicycles had been carried {{until the end of the}} season in September.|$|E
2500|$|Caledonian's {{rapid growth}} as a {{profitable}} charter carrier did not satisfy the ambitions of its founders.
