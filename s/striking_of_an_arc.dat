50|$|The {{selection}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{shielding gas}} depends on several factors, including {{the type of}} material being welded, joint design, and desired final weld appearance. Argon is {{the most commonly used}} shielding gas for GTAW, since it helps prevent defects due to <b>a</b> varying <b>arc</b> length. When used with alternating current, argon shielding results in high weld quality and good appearance. Another common shielding gas, helium, is most often used to increase the weld penetration in a joint, to increase the welding speed, and to weld metals with high heat conductivity, such as copper and aluminum. A significant disadvantage is the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> with helium gas, and the decreased weld quality associated with <b>a</b> varying <b>arc</b> length.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The shapes <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> and {{scoliosis}} are the same. Therefore, {{the geometry}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> can reveal {{the relationship between}} the angles within and around a scoliotic spine. OBJECTIVE: To look for angles which are functions of the geometry <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> and can also be used for assessment of curve progression in scoliosis. DESIGN: Review of the geometry <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> and that <b>of</b> scoliosis. METHOD: English literature on scoliosis (from 1930 to date), searched manually, via Internet and from colleagues, was reviewed. RESULTS: Methods of curve measurement in use presently are functions of the geometry of scoliosis. Three additional methods are proposed for assessment of curve progression in scoliosis. These methods are geometrically related with the previously known ones. CONCLUSION: All methods of assessment of curve progression in scoliosis are fundamentally the same and interchangeable. There is no reason for preference of one method over another method of curve measurement...|$|R

40|$|The motion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> plasma in <b>a</b> {{quenching}} chamber has {{a significant}} influence on the interruption performance of low-voltage switching devices (LVSDs). It is necessary to build <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> modelling tool, which can predict <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> behavior during <b>an</b> interruption process, to save development cost and time. This paper presents <b>a</b> numerical model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> plasma in LVSDs, which can reduce complexity and calculation load <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> simulation by avoiding fully coupled modelling between fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism. There are two steps in the proposed arc modelling; {{the first is the}} finite element analysis of Lorentz force generated by nonlinear ferromagnetic material and current path in a quenching chamber, the second is the finite volume analysis of arc motion with consideration for fluid dynamics and heat transfer. This arc modelling also takes into account a contact motion, potential drops in the sheath layers of splitter plates and plasma radiation. It is shown that the simulated result has a similar trend with experimental data in terms of the arc motion as well as current and voltage waveforms...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{technical report}} describes {{the development and}} testing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) for DC circuits operating primarily at 48 volts. We have identified an effective method for determining when arcing is occurring. Our method is primarily based on comparing the frequency spectrum of current flowing through the circuit during an arcing event to a known characteristic spectrum. Once <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> has been identified, our interrupter is capable of responding adequately to eliminate the arc. Hardware tests show the AFCI developed in this thesis responded, in all test cases, within 2 seconds <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> fault occurrence.

In fact we show that the (simple) description of f given by Zalcman for the case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> also holds in the general case...|$|R
