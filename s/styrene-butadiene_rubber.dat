25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>rubber.</b> Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the rubber-carbon black filler interaction, {{different}} <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> were adsorbed from solution on carbon black.

Moreover, the ToF-SIMS data showed that the parameters related to the polymer aromaticity and unsaturation decreased after adsorption. These results indicated a change in polymer chain conformation at the surface upon adsorption on carbon black. This was explained by a preferential interaction between phenyl (and in a weaker manner, 1, 2 -vinyl) groups with the carbon black surface. Indeed, when these groups tend to orientate toward the filler surface, their surface concentration seen by ToF-SIMS is expected to decrease...|$|R

Material softening is shown to increase with the loading intensity, the amount of carbon-black fillers and the decrease of the crosslink density.

ABSTRACT: This work presents a rheometric {{molecular weight distribution}} technique (RMWD) to estimate molecular parameters of low and high poly-dispersity samples of elastomers and polymer melts. Samples of polystyrene, polybutadiene, polyethylene and <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> are considered in this study. Important conclusions are obtained concerning the elimination of experimental information with glassy modes that are not relevant for the RMWD technique. A discussion on the calibration of this technique is pre-sented involving an interplay with size exclusion chromatography and capil-lary rheometry. Estimation of molecular weights Mw and Mn, and polydisper-sity Po through rheometry is a promising technique, which when comple-mented with rheological theories of polymer melts, may give additional infor-mation into the chemical architecture of polymer chains. Correlations between rheological and molecular parameters are also presented.

First, the results show that no mechanical (intrinsic) dissipation is detected for weakly filled SBR, meaning that the heat produced and absorbed over one mechanical cycle is the same whatever the stretch ratio reached. Second, the mechanical dissipation in highly filled is significant. The quantitative analysis carried out highlights the fact that it increases quasi-linearly with the stretch ratio. Finally, a simplified framework is proposed to discuss the identification of the heat sources, in particular the mechanical dissipation...|$|R
