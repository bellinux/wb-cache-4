This wine niche is now intended for export to Northern Europe, a region that consumes a high proportion of white wine.|$|E
25|$|After {{creating}} Yūko, Clamp {{believed her}} character was <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> {{she could be}} the only main character in the series. However, they then wondered it would more interesting if they created another character who, like Yūko, would also be connected with the spirits and across the story would see Yūko's life and often ask her about the supernatural events. They compared Yūko and Watanuki with Doraemon and Nobita Nobi, respectively, from the manga series Doraemon. Unlike Yūko, Watanuki's personality and design were not difficult to write and illustrate. He {{was based on a}} real beautician who has not been identified by the authors.|$|E
25|$|St. Ann's Church, a rusticated-stone {{structure}} with a Romanesque Revival tower on East 12th Street that dated to 1847, {{was sold to}} NYU {{to make way for}} a 26-story, 700-bed dormitory. After community protest, the university promised to protect and maintain the church's original facade; and so it did, literally, by having the facade stand alone in front of the building, now the tallest structure in the area. According to many residents, NYU's alteration and demolition of historic buildings, such as the Peter Cooper Post Office, is spoiling the physical and socio-economic landscape that makes this neighborhood <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> and attractive.|$|E

25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E

500|$|Oni Press {{released}} a graphic novel, Jumper: Jumpscars, that portrays several backstories {{related to the}} film. The novel was released on February 13, 2008, one day before the film's wide release. A publisher for Oni Press commented on the tie-in to the film, stating: [...] "The world that was being built around these characters was so well-realized and the mythology <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> that other stories about this conflict would be plentiful and add to what the filmmakers were building." [...] The novel was written by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir and illustrated by Brian Hurtt.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} set in the DC Universe but is non-canon, similar to an Elseworlds story. The content is divided into 60chapters which mostly {{alternate}} between the (third person) points-of-view of the two protagonists, Batman/Bruce Wayne and Superman/Clark Kent, though several chapters follow antagonists (Lex Luthor and Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov). While the novel is based on comic book characters, it consists solely of prose. Anderson commented on the difficulty in writing comics as prose stating, [...] "in the comics, several pages of superpowered action can propel the story, but when you read it in a book, it's not quite <b>so</b> <b>interesting.</b> You need more parts to the story..." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{too often}} forget the {{humanity}} of doctors and nurses. They become godlike {{to most of us}} and yet it is their humanity that makes them <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> and enjoyable.

[...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live.

500|$|Birdy {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} mainstream film critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 25 reviews, {{and gave the}} film a score of 88%, with an average score of 7.4 out of 10. Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four stars out of four, writing, [...] "Birdy... tells a story so unlikely... and yet a story <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> {{it is impossible to}} put this movie out of my mind." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Parker has for the most part directed the film deftly and unobtrusively. Every so often, though, he introduces the kind of overstatement Birdy didn't need... Fortunately, the heavy-handedness is in limited supply. Most of Birdy is enchanting." [...] Film critic Emanuel Levy called it [...] "a powerfully dramatic chronicle of postwar trauma." ...|$|E
500|$|Haynes {{had first}} heard about the film in 2012 from costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her production company Dirty Films Ltd., had {{been involved with the}} project for [...] "a long time". Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> to me when I first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind." [...] Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's <b>so</b> <b>interesting,</b> {{part of the reason why}} I think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England." [...] Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said he {{was particularly}} interested in the Marie and Jesse characters this episode, and called it a credit to the show's evolution that the supporting cast subplots can be <b>so</b> <b>interesting</b> without Walt. He also praised David Slade's direction, particularly during the jumpshots in Jesse's scenes. Seth Amitin of IGN called it a [...] "great episode" [...] and an improvement over the previous two, [...] "Box Cutter" [...] and [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub". He praised the way Skyler's character proved herself to both Walter and Saul, and praised Betsy Brandt's performance, claiming her subplot provided much-needed comic relief and reminded him of the works of David Sedaris. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz praised the development of Skyler's character and said the episode touched upon a common theme in Breaking Bad about masculinity. With Skyler asserting herself in Walter's work, and Hank taking out his insecurities about being disabled on Marie, Maerz said the script raises the question, [...] "What {{does it mean to be}} a strong man?" [...] Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff called it [...] "one of the best episodes this show has ever done", despite diverting the attention from Walter to the support cast members. VanDerWerff said the episode well demonstrated how Walter's actions affected others around him and said Marie's character was more interesting than in the past.|$|E
