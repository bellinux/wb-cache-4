5|$|Washington's {{victory over}} Cornwallis at the Battle of Yorktown was commemorated with a two-cent <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battle's 150th anniversary on October 19, 1931. The 150th {{anniversary of the}} signing of the Constitution with George Washington as {{presiding}} officer was celebrated with a three-cent issue on September 17, 1937, adapted from the painting by Julius Brutus Stearns. Washington's presidential inauguration at Federal Hall in New York City was celebrated on its 150th anniversary on April 30, 1939.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This {{had the effect of}} a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Keen gets to {{the girl}} first but loses her in a daring raid by Zamani's forces. Now aware of Keen, Zamani attacks her husband, Tom, in their home, gravely {{wounding}} him. Keen notes a <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man’s hand and deduces the attack {{will take place at}} a zoo. Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is not what he appears to be.|$|E

5|$|Other {{examples}} include Russborough, designed by Richard Cassels, an architect of German origin, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and Florence Court, County Fermanagh. Irish Palladian Country houses often feature robust Rococo plasterwork, frequently {{executed by the}} Lafranchini brothers, an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin {{was built in the}} 18th century that it set a Georgian <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin {{was one of the few}} cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei has had {{a complex}} taxonomic history. Although the first {{specimen}} was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, a formal scientific description was not published until 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they {{believed to be a}} new species—Boletus murraii—although this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their Boletus spraguei. Although Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, the date <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming. However, in 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898).|$|E

The Dodgers celebrated the Golden Anniversary of Dodger Stadium, their home since 1962. It was a transitional {{year as the}} sale of the team from Frank McCourt to Guggenheim Baseball Management was not finalized until May 1. The new ownership group put their <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team quickly by making a number of big trades and putting more money into the team than McCourt did.

25|$|On {{his return}} to Richmond, Hafey found the team had {{acquired}} a number of young, high quality players. He later recalled feeling some apprehension about his youth {{and that he would}} be coaching some ex-teammates. Even so, he quickly put his <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> club, bringing intensity and desire to reach the top. Although he acknowledged the ideas and tactical approach of Len Smith (who remained at the club as a selector and consultant), Hafey opted for what became his trademark style: kick the ball long and quickly into the forward line. He raised the bar for fitness among his players, extending pre-season training and introducing a third training night during the week. Richmond quickly became known for being the fittest team in the competition.|$|E
25|$|Bob Clarke {{returned}} to the general manager position prior to the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and immediately began putting his <b>stamp</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team. New Head Coach Terry Murray replaced Kevin Dineen as team captain with Lindros {{prior to the start}} of training camp. In order to shore up the defense, Ron Hextall was re-acquired from the Islanders and high-scoring winger Recchi was traded to Montreal for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair early in the abbreviated season. The Flyers initially struggled out of the gate, going only 3–7–1 through their first 11 games while being outscored 34–22. Lindros and LeClair then teamed with Renberg to form the Legion of Doom line, a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation. In their 37 games (including the 3–1 victory on February 11, 1995, against the New Jersey Devils), the Flyers went 25–9–3 and outscored their opponents 128–98 en route. Lindros tied Jaromir Jagr for the regular season scoring lead (though Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy with more goals), and captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. The playoff drought came to an end as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference. After dispatching Buffalo in five and sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, the Flyers were upset in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in six games.|$|E
