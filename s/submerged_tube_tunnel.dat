30|$|In China, {{research}} on immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> started late but {{progress has been}} rapid. Research on an immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> was conducted in Shanghai in the early 1960 s, and an underwater sewage tunnel was built in 1976 [63]. Research was also conducted in Guangzhou on immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> in 1974 [63]; the road tunnel crossing Victoria harbor was built in Hong Kong in 1972, and the Gaoxiong immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> was built in Taiwan in 1984 [63]. The Guangzhou Zhujiang tunnel, built in 1993, was the first underwater tunnel for a city road and railway using the immersed tube method in China, and set a precedent for large immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> [64]. The second immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> was built in Ningbo Yongjiang in 1995, a project that overcame the disadvantages of a soft soil foundation and used the piecewise connection of precast method [65]. The Ningbo Changhong tunnel, built in 2002, used pile foundations required by the special geological hydrology conditions, providing insights on immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> construction in soft soil [66]. The successful construction of the Shanghai outside ring <b>tunnel</b> took immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> construction technology {{to a new level}} [67]. The immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> of the Hongkong–Zhuhai–Macao bridge project has a length of 6.753  km, and is the longest immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> in the world. This <b>tunnel</b> adopts sectional <b>tubes</b> of long lengths, buried under deep water, with a soft and uneven soil foundation [68].|$|R

The MTR corporation {{has set up}} an Immersed <b>Tube</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Casting Yard {{at the site of}} the former Shek O Quarry at the south side of the Hong Kong Island to pre-assemble sections of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>tubes,</b> which will be then transported by sea and immersed in place. As June of 2017, the first Immersed <b>Tube</b> <b>Tunnel</b> units was installed in Victoria Harbour, marking as the beginning of the fourth harbour-crossing railway tunnel in Hong Kong. 11 <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> units in total will be constructed and placed for the harbour crossing section ...|$|R

30|$|Research on {{the impact}} of ground {{movement}} on the underground structure can be divided into two methods: one is the interaction method which is based on solving the structural motion equation, where the surrounding ground medium damping is reflected by the interaction effect. The other is the wave method which is based on solving the wave and stress field, through large-scale computer simulation. This method sets up a three-dimensional model, including the foundation soil, immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and soft joints, but there are disadvantages such as a larger workload and poor adaptability of the super-long immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> [77, 78]. Because the topography and geological conditions change along the tunnel direction, when the structure length is equal to or exceeds one fourth of an earthquake wave length, the wave caused by vibration in the tunnel longitudinal direction differs. The structure presents a nonuniform motion, and the motion phase difference between the nodes, namely the wave effect, is ineligible. Hence, research on the earthquake response of super-long immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the nonuniform seismic excitation condition should be conducted. Factors such as the dynamic properties of tube section joints and seasonal change have a great influence on the tunnel structural seismic response. Therefore, setting up a dynamic analysis model of earthquake response of super-long immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> that can simulate the multi nodes under the nonuniform seismic excitation conditions and present an effective calculation method is among the technical difficulties of super-long immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> seismic design [79].|$|R

30|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} technologies in every country have their own characteristics, and the ideas are different.

5000|$|The twin <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{will have}} length of almost 1 {{kilometer}} (...) , while the width and height would be 14 and 10 m, respectively. The tunnels would {{be located in}} a gap of 20 m. There are two emergency crossovers inside the tunnel.|$|R
30|$|The {{joint of}} tube {{sections}} {{is one of}} the key elements of the immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and the joint must be designed to withstand changes in temperature, earthquake loads, and other conditions to ensure the tunnel joint has good water tightness. The location, spacing, and type of joint should be in accordance with geotechnical conditions, foundation type, seismic resistance, and machinability. In addition, the joint strength, deformation characteristics, water proofing material, and construction detail must be considered [72]. In regions with high water pressure and large earthquake load, immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> should be adopted. The rubber water stop will take large loading and deformation, so water stops with larger deformation capacity and bearing capacity (pressure and transverse load) are required [73].|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{immersed}} <b>tube</b> <b>tunnels</b> in Yangtze river delta {{region are}} affected severely by back-silting. Back-silting {{is difficult to}} control during construction and the consequences are hard to evaluate as well. In this study, sedimentation experiment was conducted incorporating back-silting soil solutions with different concentration ratios, and compression tests on the initial sedimentation layers was also conducted based on back-silting soil specimens taken from the back-silting soil sedimentary layers located in the surrounding area of Shenjiamen harbor undersea immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Zhoushan City. The undersea back-silting was assessed from the aspect of sedimentation speed {{and the strength of}} initial sedimentary layers. Results from the study are essential for further study of back-silting load and the effect of back-silting on settlement...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Civil Engineering, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 109 - 112) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxi, 112 leavesIn this study, {{a preliminary}} design {{and analysis of}} an immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> is presented. The <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> will connect the two coasts of the İzmir Bay and whereby will ease the transportation of the city. The reason to suggest an immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{is due to the}} shallow water depth (< 25 m) and that the soil profile of the İzmir Bay is made up of silty-sand. Hence, the Bay is appropriate for an immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel.</b> First, a possible alignment was assigned for the tunnel. The technical, geometric properties of the tubes were determined, and the detailed drawings of them were made. The allowable bearing capacity of the seabed was calculated and it was determined that the soil has not enough capacity to withstand the design load. The liquefaction risk of the soil was investigated as well, and it was shown that the soil has high liquefaction potential. A static analysis of the tunnel was made in Calculix, a finite element program. The vertical displacement of the tube unit under static loads was calculated to be above the permissible settlement value. Afterwards, the seismic analysis was made to investigate stresses developed due to both racking and axial deformation of the tunnel during an earthquake. It was found that, the max stress due to the racking effect is less than the compressive strength of the concrete, and max stress due to the axial deformation is larger than compressive strength of the concrete. The high in the tube occur, because of the tubes high stiffness. This problem was solved by releasing the rigid connections in between two tube units. If these connections are made by using same form of elastomer joints, the deformation will occur in these joints, releasing the tubes internal stresses. Considering these drawbacks, ground improvement was recommended for the seabed and an increased value of the standard penetration of the soil was estimated. Then, the analyses were repeated and it was found that all drawbacks were eliminated. As a conclusion, it was decided that if suggested improvements are made in the seabed soil, the immersed <b>tube</b> <b>tunnel</b> can be constructed across the İzmir Bay...|$|R
