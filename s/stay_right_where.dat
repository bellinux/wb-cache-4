6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} best thing for me to do is to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> I am," [...] said he, [...] "for here I am safe under this {{friendly}} old bramble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No use of trying--some of {{the fellows}} in the tops would pick us off in no time. No, we've got to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> we are an' take what comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't, then; <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> there <b>where</b> you are. Oh-um!" [...] gaped Hartley, {{stretching}} himself; [...] "it's {{about time}} f'r breakfast, I guess. Want y'r hands washed and y'r hair combed?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Whitefoot didn't {{appear at}} all anxious to go. She {{began to make}} excuses for <b>staying</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> they were. You see, she had a great love for that old home. They were sitting just outside the doorway talking about the matter when Whitefoot {{caught a glimpse of}} a swiftly moving form not far off. It was Shadow the Weasel. Neither of them breathed. Shadow passed without looking in their direction. When he was out of sight, Mrs. Whitefoot shivered.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Aunt Eliza; I won't move without you! Don't {{you think}} it!" [...] cried the girl. [...] "You've {{got to come}} {{straight}} away or else we both <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> here <b>where</b> we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|Happy Jack laughed. [...] "You're {{welcome to}} {{stay as long as}} you like, Unc' Billy," [...] he said. [...] "You better <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are, and I'll go tell old Mrs. Possum where you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{can you be}} {{thinking}} of? You do keep my hands full! You have to be watched all the time, like a little child, {{to keep you from}} walking into the fire. You'll <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are, Henry, {{and make}} {{yourself}} comfortable," [...] said Gif. [...] "As long as you're {{willing to do}} your share of the work around here, you shall have your share of whatever there is to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hobson {{turned to}} the speaker with a {{whimsical}} grin. [...] "The Chicago Irishmen <b>stayed</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> they were," [...] he said. [...] "I don't know what they did with the money, but they bought no rifles--they weren't blame fools. The moral is that what an Irishman looks at twice is too big a thing for us. No, sir, you wouldn't raise ten dollars in a month down there. America has all the trouble she has any use for already. What {{we want to do}} is to put up a good big bluff--and no more than that--on the British Empire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, if you're {{going to}} talk that way, I won't stand in with you any longer!" [...] cried Jackson, in a rage. [...] "That {{money is going to}} <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> here, <b>where</b> I {{and all the rest of}} us can keep our eyes on it!" ...|$|R
60|$|Peter <b>stayed</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> {{he was and}} waited. Nearer and nearer came Longlegs. When he {{was right}} {{opposite}} Peter he suddenly dropped his long legs, folded his great wings, and alighted {{right on the edge}} of the Smiling Pool across from where Peter was sitting. If he seemed to have no neck at all when he was flying, now he seemed to be all neck as he stretched it to its full length. The fact is, his neck was so long that when he was flying he carried it folded back on his shoulders. Never before had Peter had such an opportunity to see Longlegs.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't any use {{for us to}} try to do anything," [...] said Dick, disconsolately. [...] "Newcombe will <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> he {{is until}} we go out, and the best {{thing we can do is}} give the thing up for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{need for}} you to rush," [...] drawled the man, much as if he enjoyed keeping the boys in suspense, [...] "for if you <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are, you will see them. They've got to come back this way, sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we've got one {{advantage}} over those fellows," [...] put in Colton, after the firing {{had come to}} an end, and the warship was fast getting out of range. [...] "We can run away, while they have got to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you don't!" [...] {{declared}} Jimmy Skunk. [...] "You {{are going}} to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> here <b>where</b> we {{can take care of}} you. It wouldn't be safe for you to try to go to the Old Briar-patch now, because if you should meet Old Man Coyote or Reddy Fox or Whitetail the Marshhawk, you {{would not be able to}} run fast enough to get away. I will go down and tell Mrs. Peter, and you will make yourself comfortable in the old house behind that stump where I was hiding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> {{here and}} watch until his dinner is {{brought out to}} him," [...] said she to Reddy. [...] "As soon as whoever brings it {{has gone back to}} the house you walk <b>right</b> out <b>where</b> Bowser will see you. At the sight of you, he'll forget all about his dinner. Sit <b>right</b> down <b>where</b> he can see you and stay there until you see that I have got that dinner, or until you hear {{somebody}} coming, for you know Bowser will make a great racket. Then slip around back of the barn and join me back of that shed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then you may <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are, {{and take}} care of my daughter. If she wants to climb {{mountains}} or shoot rapids, it's to be done; but you'll fix things so it can be done safely. You're in charge of this outfit, and not that major man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Slavin said, [...] "I guess I hear them, and I'll <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> I am. They can't {{see me in}} the shadow, and if {{they knew}} I was hanging round it might worry them. You don't want to hang out a red rag {{when you have a}} {{difference}} of opinion with a bull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, youse," [...] he shouted, [...] "get further back, you're in the picture. Or, say, no, <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are. You," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to me, [...] "stay {{right where you}} are and I'll give you a dollar to just hold that horror; you understand, just keep on registering it. Don't do another thing, just register that face." ...|$|E

6000|$|Miss Sally Steel, {{for it was}} my neighbor's sister, {{shouted to}} {{somebody}} through the window, {{and then turned to}} the man who rose from a corner. [...] "You just <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are. When I call cookie I'll see he comes. I've been running this place as it ought to be run, and you won't know Gaspard's when you get about, Rancher Ormesby." ...|$|E
6000|$|At once Peter was all ears. [...] "I've {{never heard}} about that," [...] said he. [...] "Tell me about it, Mrs. Grouse. We've got to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> we {{are for a}} long time to make sure that Yowler has given us up and gone away, so you will have plenty of time to tell me the story. Where was Turkey Wood, and how did old Mr. Bob-cat happen to leave his honor there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it {{will make}} it easier for Hetty, and I'm glad of it. Slaving away at that bakery isn't the kind of thing for her. It's going to the opera at Vancouver with the best of them she ought to be doing. I guess that would suit most young women quite as well as baking bread; but it's a little rough on me that Hetty Leger would sooner <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> she is." ...|$|E

60|$|She waited just {{a minute}} longer {{to make sure that}} Peter was where he could see her, and then she thumped the ground very hard, which, you know, is the way Rabbits signal to each other. Peter heard it right away and thumped back that he would <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> he was, though right down in his heart Peter thought that little Mrs. Peter was just nervous and foolish, for he was sure that Old Man Coyote had given up and gone away long ago.|$|E
6000|$|At first Granny {{decided to}} <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> {{she was and}} find out what this thing was, but the nearer it got, the {{stranger}} and more terrible it seemed. It was just a great ball all covered with dried leaves, and yet somehow Granny felt sure that it was alive, although she could see no head or tail or legs. The nearer it got, the stranger and more terrible it seemed. Then Granny forgot her dignity. Yes, Sir, she forgot her dignity. In fact, she quite lost it altogether. Granny Fox ran just as Reddy had run! ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] said he. [...] "Now {{you have}} seen poor men frozen out of their ranches and claims by men with money {{in other parts of}} this country as well as across the frontier, and there's usually only one end to the battle when the man without the dollars kicks against the man with plenty. <b>Stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>where</b> you are with {{mortgages}} held open, timber rights that are lapsing because you've done nothing, and undeveloped mineral claims, and the man who sits scheming while you're resting will squeeze you out one by one." ...|$|E
