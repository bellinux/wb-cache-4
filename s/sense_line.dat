'To stem a torrent--or, the current of a river,' is a well-known expression, indicating one sort of material force in opposition to another. Hence {{we come to the}} figurative expression, 'to stem the torrent of his grief,' &c. Shelley seems to have yielded to a certain analogy in the sentiment, and also to the convenience of a rhyme, and thus to have permitted himself a phrase which is neither English nor consistent with <b>sense.</b> <b>Line</b> 8 seems to me extremely feeble throughout.|$|E

This main line is electromagnetically coupled to two smaller <b>sense</b> <b>lines</b> (directional couplers) which are terminated with resistors at one end, and diode rectifiers at the other. Sometimes {{a printed circuit board}} using three parallel traces is used to make the transmission line and the two <b>sensing</b> <b>lines.</b> The resistors are chosen to match the characteristic impedance of the <b>sense</b> <b>lines.</b> The diodes convert the magnitudes of the forward & reverse waves to FWD and REV DC voltages, respectively, which are then smoothed by the capacitors.|$|R
40|$|A {{reactor vessel}} level {{monitoring}} system measures {{the water level}} in a reactor during normal operation and abnormal conditions. A drop in the water level can expose nuclear fuel, which may lead to fuel meltdown and radiation spread in accident conditions. A level monitoring system mainly consists of a <b>sensing</b> <b>line</b> and pressure transmitter. Over {{a period of time}} boron sediments or other impurities can clog the line which may degrade the accuracy of the monitoring system. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine blockage in a <b>sensing</b> <b>line</b> using the energy of the composite signal. An equivalent Pi circuit model is used to simulate blockages in the <b>sensing</b> <b>line</b> and the system's response is examined under different blockage levels. Composite signals obtained from the model and plant's unblocked and blocked channels are decomposed into six levels of details and approximations using a wavelet filter bank. The percentage of energy is calculated at each level for approximations. It is observed that the percentage of energy reduces as the blockage level in the <b>sensing</b> <b>line</b> increases. The results of the model and operational data are well correlated. Thus, in our opinion variation in the energy levels of approximations can be used as an index to determine the presence and degree of blockage in a <b>sensing</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

This style of valve is installed downstream of the pump/valve that creates the surge. The valve is controlled by an external, normally closed pilot valve. The pilot will be set to the desired set point of the system, with a <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> that runs up stream of the valve. When the upstream process conditions start to exceed the pilot set point, the valve begins to open and relieve the excess pressure until the correct pressure is met causing the valve to close.|$|E

Passive AC’97 analog front panel dongles (ones which leave the 5V Analog pin-7 line unconnected on the dongle) may be used with the Intel HD Audio analog front panel header. But note that the front panel jack detection and re-tasking functionality will be lost as the AC’97 jacks cannot support connection to the <b>SENSE</b> <b>line.</b> In addition, software must be aware that an AC’97 dongle is being used with an Intel HD Audio analog header since the software might need to dedicate codec ports that are connected to the header to meet the product’s intended functionality.|$|E
50|$|Missile 8B on September 14 {{continued}} the streak of pneumatic system difficulties when the LOX tank pressure regulator went full open for five seconds starting at T+210 seconds, {{resulting in a}} surge in tank pressure. The problem {{in this case was}} suspected to be caused by above-normal helium bottle temperatures. In addition, vernier hydraulic pressure failed again during vernier solo phase. Missile 6B broke the streak of successful flights on September 18 when it exploded 82 seconds after liftoff. The cause of the failure was traced to a seized turbopump, which resulted in abrupt termination of B-1 engine thrust at T+80 seconds. LOX regulator pressure fell off, resulting in gas generator flameout and complete shutdown of both booster engines, followed by missile pitch-up and structural breakup. It was suspected that flying debris from the turbopump had ruptured the LOX regulator <b>sense</b> <b>line.</b> At liftoff, one of the launcher hold-down arms had also not retracted properly, which resulted in holes being torn in the B-1 thrust structure, however this was quickly ruled out as a cause of the failure.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{inaccuracy}} of existing editions of the Vulgate, the Oxford University Press accepted in 1878 a proposal from classicist John Wordsworth (later Bishop of Salisbury) to produce a new critical edition of the Vulgate New Testament. This was eventually published as Nouum Testamentum Domini nostri Iesu Christi Latine, secundum editionem sancti Hieronymi in three volumes between 1889 and 1954; the Codex Amiatinus being a primary source for the entire text; which also followed this manuscript in presenting the text in <b>sense</b> <b>lines,</b> cola et commata without any other indication of punctuation. In 1907 Pope Pius X commissioned the Benedictine monks in Rome to prepare a critical edition of Jerome's Vulgate, entitled Biblia Sacra iuxta latinam vulgatam versionem, which was eventually published as a counterpart Old Testament to the Oxford New Testament, following largely the same critical principles, and according similar primary status to the Codex Amiatinus text and its <b>sense</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{threading}} individual {{ferrite cores}} on wires, thin-film memory consisted of 4 micrometre thick dots of permalloy, an iron-nickel alloy, deposited on small glass plates by vacuum evaporation techniques and a mask. The drive and <b>sense</b> <b>lines</b> were then added using printed circuit wiring over the alloy dots. This provided very fast access {{times in the}} range of 670 nanoseconds, but was very expensive to produce.|$|R
5000|$|Diagnosing {{hardware}} {{problems in}} core memory required time-consuming diagnostic programs to be run. While a quick test checked if every bit could contain a {{one and a}} zero, these diagnostics tested the core memory with worst-case patterns and had to run for several hours. As most computers had just a single core memory board, these diagnostics also moved themselves around in memory, {{making it possible to}} test every bit. An advanced test was called a [...] "Schmoo test" [...] in which the half-select currents were modified along with the time at which the <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> was tested ("strobed"). The data plot of this test seemed to resemble a cartoon character called [...] "Schmoo," [...] and the name stuck. In many occasions, errors could be resolved by gently tapping the printed circuit board with the core array on a table. This slightly changed the positions of the cores along the wires running through them, and could fix the problem. The procedure was seldom needed, as core memory proved to be very reliable compared to other computer components of the day.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The GALAXY {{computer}} is a large, high speed, general purpose, digital computer {{intended to be}} used for solving scientific problems. It requires a random access memory system of 16, 384 words of 59 bits each with a cycle time of one microsecond or less. A memory system capable of meeting these requirements has been designed for ferrite core storage elements and transistor active elements. It consists of four sections of 4, 096 words each, with the initial installation consisting of two sections. Each section has its own associated current drivers and sense amplifiers while the memory register, decode circuits, and timing unit are used in common by the whole system. An experimental investigation of the memory system gave evidence that the requirements could be met by using presently available commercial components. A linear selection system was selected and investigated by using a 64 core word line and a 4, 096 <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> to simulate a core stack. The experimental results showed that a minimum cycle time of 700 nanoseconds could be obtained. The results of an investigation of the system com ponents were used to select the type of cores and plane configuration. Ferroxcube type 6 F 2 cores were used with a word line configuration of two turns per core and a <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> configuration of one turn per core. Distri buted capacitance was added to the <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> to achieve a purely resistive characteristic impedance and thus sub stantially reduce the post-write disturb voltage. The investigation and design of the associated elec tronic circuits are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{blockage}} of the <b>sensing</b> <b>lines</b> of a differential-pressure (DP) {{flow sensor}} {{has been found}} to be the main cause of a malfunction of a flow measurement system in many industrial applications. In this paper, the blockage of the <b>sensing</b> <b>lines</b> under dynamic process conditions is investigated using wavelet transform techniques. The results obtained show that the blockage in a fast changing process is only detectable when the severity of the blockage is over 90 %. This outcome differs from that when the sensor operates under a slow varying process. The main reason resulting in the discrepancy between slow and fast varying processes is that a process with high flow rates produces more noise energy in the output of the sensor than a process with low flow rates does. This means that the noise energy generated by the blockage of the sensor under low flow-rate conditions is indistinguishable with that from the output of the sensor working under the sensor normal operating conditions but a process with high flow rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{survey is}} devoted to line graphs and a new multivalued {{function}} L called the line hypergraph. This function generalizes two classical concepts at once, namely the line graph and the dual hypergraph. In a certain <b>sense,</b> <b>line</b> graphs and dual hypergraphs are extreme values of the function L. There are many publications about line graphs, but our considerations are restricted to papers concerning Krausz’ global characterization of line graphs or Whitney’s theorem on edge isomorphisms. The survey covers almost all known results on the function L because they are concentrated around Krausz’ and Whitney’s theorems. These results provide evidence {{that the notion of}} the line hypergraph is quite natural. It enables one to unify the classical theorems on line graphs and to obtain their more general versions in a simpler way...|$|E

To measure the actual impedance, an antenna analyzer or other similar RF measuring device is required.

The Cundill pollen traps represent the modern pollen rain data from one year whereas the moss cushions represent the pollen rain of several years. The comparative study reveals some main {{differences between the two}} pollen entrapment media. The one-year entrapment medium (pollen trap) appears to be more sensitive for local (releve area 10 x 10 m) and regional (100 - 500 m, or a few kilometres for Olea europaea) vegetation. Pollen spectra of moss cushions are dominated by high pine pollen percentage values and hardly <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> vegetation structures. The conclusion of this comparative modern pollen study allows to interpret fossil sediment spectra from the Near East in a more critical way.

40|$|Previously, we {{identified}} a peptide transport gene, AtPTR 2 -B, from Arabidopsis thaliana that was constitutively expressed in all plant organs, suggesting an important physiological role in plant growth and development. To evaluate {{the function of}} this transporter, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were constructed expressing antisense or sense AtPTR 2 -B. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that four independent antisense and three independent sense AtPTR 2 -B transgenic lines were obtained, which was confirmed by analysis of the segregation of the kanamycin resistance gene carried on the T-DNA. RNA blot data showed that the endogenous AtPTR 2 -B mRNA levels were significantly reduced in transgenic leaves and flowers, but not in transgenic roots. Consistent with this reduction in endogenous AtPTR 2 -B mRNA levels, all four antisense lines and one <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> exhibited significant phenotypic changes, including late flowering and arrested seed development. These phenotypic changes {{could be explained by}} a defect in nitrogen nutrition due to the reduced peptide transport activity conferred by AtPTR 2 -B.

40|$|Case StudyA dry screw {{compressor}} skid was fabricated for offshore service that included oil buffered mechanical seals on the compressor. During shop testing, excessive seal oil piping vibration was observed {{that resulted in}} pipe component failures. The oil system was designed to include a common lube and seal oil system with a pump design pressure of 590 psi. There were six oil control valves on the system, including a lube oil pressure control valve, one flow control valve on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow control valve on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure control valve for the oil system. Vibration and pressure pulsation measurements indicated that the response was at the pocket pass frequency of 206 Hz. The source was determined to be at the compressor. Arrangement of the control valves and control <b>sensing</b> <b>lines</b> were likely contributors to the severity of the response. Modification to the seal oil system included addition of several volumes at strategic locations to change the acoustical characteristics of the oil system to reduce the shaking forces in the pipe system.

CR 600, a transorb prevents negative voltages and extremely high positive voltages from damaging the radio by conducting and blowing the 12 A in-line fuse. The main antenna {{is connected to the}} PA board through J 630, a mini-UHF connector. The transmitter output and main receiver input are provided through this 50 Ω connector.

The continuous discovery of genetic markers that correspond to particular cancer types and subtypes offers a large potential for non-invasive patient screening. Early and accurate diagnosis {{has the potential to}} lead to tailored treatments and a better patient prognosis. The research undertaken here at the Stokes Institute aims to develop a diagnostic tool through current advancements in genomics and microfluidics, for the accurate and early diagnosis of paediatric leukaemia. Applying microfluidics to the current molecular diagnostic protocols offers a decrease in costs through a reduction in consumable reagents and an increase in speed and consistency through {{integration of}} all the functional steps of qPCR. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the hydrodynamics of biphasic flow. Encapsulating the genetic material and PCR reagents into a micro-reactor (microfluidic plug) allows for individual and contamination-free processing. The pressure drop of individual plugs under a range of operational conditions is measured and presented. An analysis of the effect of the concentration of surfactant that is employed has on the biphasic hydrodynamics is examined. The data is subsequently analysed and compared to a theoretical approximation that is present in the literature. The ratio of biphasic fluidic resistance to single phase fluidic resistance is presented as a means to measure empirically the effect a second immiscible phase has on the hydrodynamics. A train of immiscible plugs is shown to have a lower pressure drop than a single plug of similar total length when the inter-plug spacing is sufficiently large. Three microfluidic manifolds were tested as microfluidic circuit elements. Fluidic manifolds provide a controllable means of distributing a single flow across numerous microfluidic capillaries and circuit elements. Two prototype manifolds were designed and compared to a commercially available product. The sensitivity of a manifold to changes in fluidic resistance and air contamination is also presented. Liquid bridges were employed as circuit elements and pressure taps. This is, to the best knowledge of the author, the first use of liquid bridges as pressure taps. The liquid bridges isolated the aqueous plugs from the pressure port taps preventing <b>sense</b> <b>line</b> contamination. A pressure transient analysis was carried out to determine the effect of the liquid bridges on biphasic flow. The incorporation of the three microfluidic elements into a single circuit was analysed under biphasic flow conditions. Two analytical models of microfluidic circuits are presented for the queuing and mixing of aqueous plugs prior to processing. The pressure drop data was used to validate the employment of a modified single phase analytical model for the design of biphasic microfluidic circuits for low Capillary and Reynolds number flows...|$|E
