40|$|AbstractFor the {{construction}} of a new design of mechanical heart valve a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was selected and coated with TiO 2 due to it corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. A required feature on surfaces in contact with blood it is a low level of roughness (Ra ≤ 50 nm) that not favor the formation of blood clots. One technique that can be used to obtain smooth coatings of TiO 2 is the electrochemical anodic oxidation technique using pre-spark oxidation voltage. The phenomenon of spark produces porous oxides and roughness higher than desired. The beginning of the spark voltage depends on the electrolyte used. The present work compares the coatings obtained by anodic oxidation of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy applying different voltages (from 10 V to 50 V), using as electrolyte an aqueous based alkaline solutions of NaOH and KOH, at different concentrations (0. 1 M, 1 M and 2 M) and Ca(OH) 2 at a concentration of 0. 02 M, using a constant current of 50 mA to achieve the desired voltage. Morphological analysis of the different oxides is performed using optical microscopy, and roughness measurements using a profilometer. The phases present were analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique with a glancing angle of 1 °. By varying the applied voltage coatings of different interference colors were obtained.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study the field {{emission}} properties of single multi-walled carbon nanotubes. In the sample-making, we use a Topcon SM- 350 SEM in our department to locate and make electrodes. Sample measurement was performed in a high vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10 ^- 7 Torr. The <b>start</b> <b>voltage</b> of a closed-tipped multi-walled carbon nanotubes is 140 volt. As the voltage increase 140 to 155 volts the corresponding current increase from 2 x 10 ^- 8 A to 1 x 10 ^- 7 A. We then use the Folwer-Nordheim theory to fit 1 /V -log(I/V^ 2) and obtain a straight line with the slope yielding the enhancement factor β equal to 88. 2 and the intercept yielding the emission area 3. 4 X 10 ^- 16 m^ 2. The range of the emission area and β are 1. 6 x 10 ^- 20 m^ 2 - 8. 3 x 10 ^- 15 m^ 2 and 167. 2 - 77. 8, respectively. The most interesting results are that the emission area increases whereas β decreases with the cycling number and both approaches the theoretical values after repeated cycling. 論文以探討單根多層奈米碳管在高壓時的場發射特性為主。在樣品製作方面，我們以系上的SEM（Topcon SM- 350 ）作定位以及電極製作。 在樣品的測量方面，我們用ALCATEL公司所製作的真空腔體，在約 10 ^- 7 Torr的環境下進行量測，並外接KEITHLEY 2400 作為量測的工具。 支持理論的部分，為 1928 年Fowler及Nordheim所共同提出的理論，此理論主要探討金屬針尖在外加電場時的電子穿隧情形。 最後我們得出閉口型多層奈米碳管最低起始電壓大約在 140 伏特左右，並且在電壓增高至 155 伏特時電流由 2 x 10 ^- 8 A 增加到 1 x 10 ^- 7 A ，我們可由F-N理論fitting出一條直線，並利用得到的斜率及截距計算出一組場發射面積 3. 4 x 10 ^- 16 m^ 2 以及場增強因子β= 88. 2 。理論的場發射面積以及場增強因子β分別為 以及 60 左右，而實驗所得到的面積以及β會依測量次數增加而接近理論值。abstract	 1 摘要	 2 第一章 前言	 3 1 — 1 實驗背景與動機	 3 1 — 2 奈米碳管簡介	 4 1 — 3 實驗儀器與技術	 6 1 — 3 — 1 掃描式電子顯微鏡(Scanning Electron Microscope;SEM) 	 6 1 — 3 — 2 電子束微影術(Electron-Beam Lithography) 	 7 1 — 3 — 3 熱蒸鍍（Thermally Evaporation）鍍膜系統	 8 1 — 3 — 4 真空測量（Electrical Feedthroughs）系統	 9 第二章 實驗步驟與測量	 10 2 — 1 樣品的製程	 10 2 — 1 — 1 基底的介紹	 10 2 — 1 — 2 單根奈米碳管樣品製程	 12 2 - 2 場發射特性的量測	 20 第三章 實驗理論	 22 3 — 1 電子發射種類	 22 3 — 1 — 1 熱電子	 22 3 — 1 — 2 場發射電子	 22 3 — 1 — 3 二次電子	 23 3 — 1 — 4 光電子	 23 3 — 2 Fowler—Nordheim模型[5][7]	 23 第四章 實驗結果與討論	 27 4 — 1 基板漏電測試	 27 4 — 2 電極尖端放電測試	 27 4 — 3 正式樣品量測	 28 第五章 結論	 75 參考文獻	 7...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Under {{partially}} shaded conditions, the P-U {{characteristic of}} the photovoltaic (PV) array is characterized by multiple peaks. The presence of multiple peaks reduces {{the effectiveness of the}} existing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes, which refers only to the tracking of a single peak on the P-U characteristic. This paper proposes a novel method for the global MPPT. The new method starts at the <b>starting</b> <b>voltage</b> which is 80 % of the open-circuit voltage of the PV array, and finds the first local maximum power point (MPP) using the perturb and observe (P&O) approach. Then the second search finds the next local MPP based on the P&O approach starting from the new <b>starting</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is determined by increasing the rate of slope of the current line at the first local MPP. The new algorithm follows this searching procedure until the global MPP is found. The new algorithm avoids searching the turning-point voltage between the two local MPP, and the voltage range swept is shortened significantly with the result of fast searching speed. Simulations validates that under partially shaded conditions the proposed new algorithm can track the global MPP with the fast tracking speed and the high precision. Photovoltaic energy generation has become increasingly important as a renewable source due t...|$|R

NDR in the I–V curves of ZnO nanowires bridging the interdigitated Au electrodes has been observed. NDR performance can be controlled by the bias voltage. The NDR peak voltage and peak current are influenced strongly by the value of <b>starting</b> <b>voltage.</b> The origin of this NDR is the charging and discharging effect between ZnO nanowires and metal electrodes rather than the conventional resonant tunneling mechanism. The weak nanoscale contact between ZnO nanowires and metal electrodes forms the parasitic capacitor.

Such NDR effect in the metal/nanowires/metal structure has important potential applications in nanowire-based switches, oscillators, and resonators.|$|R
40|$|Pseudospark-sourced {{electron}} beam is a self-focused intense {{electron beam}} which can propagate without any external focusing magnetic field. This electron beam can drive a beam-wave interaction directly or after being post-accelerated. It is especially suitable for terahertz (THz) radiation generation {{due to the}} ability of a pseudospark discharge to produce small size in the micron range and very high current density and bright electron beams. In this paper, a single-gap pseudospark discharge chamber has been built and tested with several electrode gap separations to explore the dependence of the pseudospark-sourced electron beam current on the discharge voltage and the electrode gap separation. Experimental results show that the beam pulses have similar pulse width and delay time from the distinct drop of the applied voltage for smaller electrode gap separations but longer delay time for the largest gap separation used in the experiment. It has been found that the electron beam only starts to occur when the charging voltage is above a certain value, which is defined as the <b>starting</b> <b>voltage</b> of the electron beam. The <b>starting</b> <b>voltage</b> is different for different electrode gap separations and decreases with increasing electrode gap separation in our pseudospark discharge configuration. The electron beam current increases with the increasing discharge voltage following two tendencies. Under the same discharge voltage, the configuration with the larger electrode gap separation will generate higher electron beam current. When the discharge voltage is higher than 10 kV, the beam current generated at the electrode gap separation of 17. 0 mm, is much higher than that generated at smaller gap separations. The ionization of the neutral gas in the main gap is inferred to contribute more to the current increase with increasing electrode gap separation...|$|R
