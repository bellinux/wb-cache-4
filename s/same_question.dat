5|$|In {{the third}} round, one {{contestant}} from each team faces the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> simultaneously. Contestants {{have their own}} money countdown, which starts at $1,000 and decreases by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult question, with an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads the question to the contestants during this round. After this second question, the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E
5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> individually. While the first {{contestant}} is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

When {{asked in a}} Gallup poll in July 1984 whether their sympathies lay mainly with the employers or the miners, 40% said employers; 33% were for the miners; 19% were for neither and 8% did not know. When asked the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> during 5–10 December 1984, 51% had most sympathy for the employers; 26% for the miners; 18% for neither and 5% did not know. When asked in July 1984 whether they approved or disapproved of the methods used by the miners, 15% approved; 79% disapproved and 6% did not know. When asked the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> during 5–10 December 1984, 7% approved; 88% disapproved and 5% did not know.

25|$|The Kenzeiki further {{states that}} he found no answer to his {{question}} at Mount Hiei, {{and that he was}} disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of Onjō-ji Temple (園城寺), asking him this <b>same</b> <b>question.</b> Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Chán in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist Myōan Eisai, Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (建仁寺), under Eisai's successor, Myōzen (明全).|$|E

25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, {{there are a number of}} methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the <b>same</b> <b>question.</b> It is well known that in Islam there are four schools of thought, and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, it is important to know that these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the Day of Judgment.|$|E
500|$|San Miguel has {{admitted}} to being offended by criticism of her response. In {{an interview with}} entertainment commentator Ricky Lo {{a week after the}} event, she explained that she did not comprehend the question clearly when she was on stage at the pageant, due to the softness of the questioner's voice. When given another opportunity to answer the <b>same</b> <b>question,</b> she smiled and said, [...] "My family is my inspiration".|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, Ceitlin McNeill, {{a friend}} of the bride and groom {{and a member of the}} Scottish folk music group Canach, {{performed}} with her band at the wedding on Colonsay. Even after seeing that the dress was [...] "obviously blue and black" [...] in real life, the musicians remained preoccupied by the photograph; they said they almost failed to make it on stage because they were caught up discussing the dress. A few days later, on 26 February, McNeill reposted the image to her blog on Tumblr and posed the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> to her followers, which led to further public discussion surrounding the image.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the desert environment of Area 51, production was temporarily relocated to [...] "Club Ed", a movie ranch located {{on the outskirts of}} Lancaster, California. Club Ed was two hours drive and almost 100 miles away from the Fox Studios, so most of the cast and crew camped out in motels in the desert. Because Club Ed was outside the 30-mile zone around Los Angeles, overtime, meal allowances, and per diem expenses had {{to be added to the}} budget. In the middle of filming, Duchovny was reported as saying, [...] "When is this show moving back to Los Angeles?" [...] Within days, T-shirts were made for the crew that featured exactly the <b>same</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, {{the action}} starts over. Mulder wakes {{to find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his landlord for water damage. To the audience, time itself is stuck in a loop. Everyone is oblivious to the repetition of events except for one person, Pam (Carrie Hamilton), Bernard's girlfriend. [...] Over multiple iterations of the events, Pam does everything in her power to save the agents, including trying to prevent them from entering the bank, trying to inform them of the time loop, and even begging Skinner not to let the police into the building. It is implied that she has lived these events many times, as she refers to having had Mulder ask her the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> over fifty times. There are subtle changes in the events, and Mulder and Scully's conversation is worded differently each time, but the results are always the same: Bernard detonates the bomb, usually after shooting Mulder, and they all die.|$|E

500|$|The board report stated that, [...] "There is no {{indication}} that the AWACS Senior Director (Wang), the Mission Crew Commander (Tracy) and/or the DUKE (Martin) made any radio calls throughout the intercept, or that they issued any guidance to either the AWACS crew or the F-15 pilots." [...] Although the OPC ROE did task the AWACS with controlling and monitoring helicopter operations in the TAOR, the board found that the AWACS crew believed that they had no responsibility for controlling U.S. Army Black Hawks or ensuring that other coalition aircraft were aware of Black Hawks operating in the TAOR. When questioned by board investigators as to who was responsible for tracking the helicopters, Tracy said, [...] "I cannot tell you that. I honestly don't know." [...] When Wang was asked the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> by the investigators, he replied, [...] "No one is responsible." [...] When the investigators asked Martin what action he took when the F-15s called a visual identification on two Hind helicopters, Martin stated, [...] "I did nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Cena {{was interviewed}} for the CNN Special Investigations Unit documentary, Death Grip: Inside Pro Wrestling, {{which focused on}} steroid and drug use in {{professional}} wrestling. When {{asked if he had}} taken steroids he was heard to reply, [...] "I can't tell you that I haven't, but you will never prove that I have". The day after the documentary aired, WWE accused CNN of taking Cena's comments out of context to present a biased point of view, backing up their claim by posting an unedited video of Cena answering the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> [...] filmed by WWE cameras from another angle [...] in which he is heard beginning the same statement with [...] "absolutely not". A text interview on the website with Cena later had him saying the news outlet should apologize for misrepresenting him, which CNN refused, saying they felt the true answer to the question began with the phrase [...] "my answer to that question". They did, however, edit the documentary on subsequent airings to include the [...] "absolutely not".|$|E
500|$|Darkness set {{in before}} the ships were within hailing distance, and Rodgers hailed twice, {{only to have the}} <b>same</b> <b>question</b> {{returned}} to him: [...] "What ship is that?" [...] According to Rodgers, immediately after the exchange of hails, Little Belt fired a shot that tore through Presidents rigging. Rodgers returned fire. Little Belt promptly answered with three guns, and then a whole broadside. Rodgers ordered his gun crews to fire at will; several accurate broadsides heavily damaged Little Belt in return. After five minutes of firing, Presidents crew realized their adversary was much smaller than a frigate and Rodgers ordered a cease fire. However, Little Belt fired again and President answered with more broadsides. After Little Belt became silent, President stood off and waited overnight. At dawn it was obvious that Little Belt was greatly damaged from the fight; Rodgers sent a boat over from President to offer assistance in repairing the damage. Her Captain, Arthur Bingham, acknowledged the damage; declining any help, he sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. President had one sailor slightly wounded in the exchange, while Little Belt suffered 31 killed or wounded.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the script}} {{of the episode}} does not specify the {{identity}} of an unseen person who slides a file about Gibson Praise under Doggett's door, Kim Manners later had to ask the writers who the mysterious visitor was; the director was told by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz that the unseen person was actually Kersh. Robert Patrick asked the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> of Manners, around this time, but the director – not yet sure of the answer and hoping to avoid looking foolish – never gave the actor an answer. Patrick thought the reason that Manners was being purposefully secretive was that the director wanted Patrick to still be in wonderment as to the mysterious visitor's identity, as a device for the actor to aid his performance. Manners later teased Patrick that the reason he had not answered the question {{was that he had}} not liked Patrick at the time, prompting the actor to ask what he had done to annoy Manners on the first night of filming the episode. Eventually, the director finally admitted to Patrick what had actually happened. Kersh's actions are later revealed and explained in the ninth season premiere [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today".|$|E
500|$|Bruce visits Vicki at her apartment, {{prepared}} {{to tell her}} about his alter-ego. The Joker interrupts their meeting, asking Bruce, [...] "(Have you) Ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?" [...] before shooting him. Bruce uses a bended serving tray as body armor and plays dead. He remembers that the mugger who killed his parents asked the <b>same</b> <b>question,</b> and realizes that Napier was his parents' killer. Vicki is brought to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, who has been coaxing their relationship because Vicki brings out Bruce's human side. After telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker terrorizing Gotham, Bruce departs as Batman to destroy the Axis plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the citizens of Gotham to a parade with the promise of free money, but while throwing cash at the crowd as promised, also attacks them with Smilex gas released from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives and tows the balloons above the clouds with the Batwing. The Joker shoots the Batwing using a long-barreled gun, causing it to crash, and takes Vicki {{to the top of a}} cathedral.|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{survey of}} {{residents}} living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found {{high levels of}} community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer {{the majority of their}} electric power to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy. A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. When people were asked the <b>same</b> <b>question</b> in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are [...] "ugly and a blot on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant. Regarding tourism, query responders consider power pylons, cell phone towers, quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms. Scotland is planning to obtain 100% of electric power from renewable sources by 2020.|$|E
