40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the conditions for}} reactivity enhancement of a catalytic cracking process in porous crystalline solids using the concept of molecular traffic control (MTC). Using dynamic Monte Carlo simulations we obtain a quantitative description of the MTC effect for a bimodal network of intersecting size-selective channels {{over a wide range}} of grain parameters, diffusivities and reaction constants, and external operating conditions. The results are compared with those obtained on a similar network but with only one type of channels, called the reference system. We find significant reactivity enhancement in the MTC system with respect to the reference system. This effect is observed to increase with the grain size, and also with longer <b>segments</b> between <b>lattice</b> intersections. We find that in certain regions of the microscopic reaction rate the reactivity enhancement is up to 68 %. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

However, ring polymers continue to present {{a challenge to the}} theoretical community as the polymers lack of ends represents a severe topological constraint on the polymer configurations. This constraint is even more important when the rings are forced to diffuse through a gel. Polymers in the melt have often been compared with single chains diffusing trough a background of obstacles. However, a comprehensive description of dynamics of ring polymers moving in a gel is not yet available. We performed Molecular Dynamics simulations of a concentrated solution of un-knotted, un-linked rings in a background gel made up of a three dimen-sional cubic lattice of static polymer <b>segments</b> with <b>lattice</b> spacing equal to the chains Kuhn length.

The novel aspect of this work is focused on the strategy employed to identify inter-ring penetrations. We take advantage of the ordered architecture of our gel to identify the inter-ring penetrations via linking of closed curves (Fig. (b)).
