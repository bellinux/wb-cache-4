40|$|Some {{experimental}} studies on skin homograft were performed between A and C 57 BL or Db strain of mice, {{to investigate the}} influence of qualitative and quantitative difference of graft antigen upon homograft rejection reaction. In this study, difference in amount of graft antigen in homograft rejection was tested in the experiment with two kinds of different size of normal skin (1. 0 cm. × 2. 0 cm. and 2. 0 cm× 4. 5 cm.). The normal skin was kept frozen either simply or in 15 % glycerin in saline for 3 to 24 hours to have physical denaturation of the graft, {{and to have a}} biologically deteriorated graft, atrophied skin was harvested from mice, which were administered with 1 mg. of prednisolone intraperitoneally daily for 3 to 9 weeks. The results obtained were as follows, 1) The larger piece of skin survived longer than the smaller piece, although no significant difference in time before onset of rejection was observed. The rejection of the <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>graft</b> was accerelated, regardlessly {{of the size of the}} first graft. This suggested that the longer survival of the larger graft was due merely to requirement of excess time to complete the rejection process after its onset. 2) There was no significant difference in the survival time of the first graft between the frozen and normal skin, and the same was also observed between the grafts which were simply frozen and were frozen in 15 % glycerine in saline. No second set phenomenon was observed when the skin simply frozen for 3 to 24 hours was used as the first graft. However, the accerelation rejection of the <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>graft</b> was clearly observed in mice who received the first graft which was kept frozen in 15 % glycerine saline for 3 to 6 hours. This indicated that freezing storage of skin in 15 % glycerine saline for up to 6 hours could saved enough antigen of the skin to sensitize the mice for the second set phenomenon with its first graft. 3) The atrophied skin obtained from prednisolone-treated mice survived longer than the healthy skin from untreated mice in its first graft. When the <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>graft</b> was made on mice who received and rejected the skin from prednisolone-treated mice, the rejection was accerelated as equally as in mice who received and rejected the normal skin as first graft, indicating that in skin showing simple atrophy, though it was macroscopically and histologically demonstrable, no qualitative deterioration of transplantation antigen might occur, in contrast to the occurrence of quantitative reduction of the antigen according to the grade of atrophy. 4) The results were also obtained from the study in the analysis of the serum γ-globulin and tissue amino acid in the skin, to support the above statements...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit {{antisera}} against normal {{guinea pig}} lymph node, when injected into guinea pigs, produced transient {{depression of the}} level of blood lymphocytes. It had no effect on other circulating cellular elements. Repeated injection over several days produced lymphopenia, which became progressively less marked with continued treatment, and clear-cut depletion of small lymphocytes in lymph nodes, whether draining an inoculation site or remote. In guinea pigs treated with lymphocyte antiserum, there was marked suppression of the tuberculin and contact allergic reactions and the "delayed" skin reaction to purified diphtheria toxoid, and a relative suppression of allergic encephalomyelitis and the rejection of first set skin homografts. There was a slight effect on <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>graft</b> rejection and no effect on PCA or the reversed passive Arthus reaction. Non-specific reactions to intradermal turpentine or to concentrated dinitrochlorobenzene placed on the skin were moderately reduced. The suppression of these reactions (except allergic encephalomyelitis) was closely correlated with the degree of lymphopenia. Lymphocyte antiserum absorbed with normal blood white cells lost both its lymphopenic effect and its ability to suppress the tuberculin reaction. It is tentatively concluded that a circulating mononuclear cell, probably the small lymphocyte, is the primary reactant in the various types of delayed hypersensitive reactions...|$|E
40|$|Signaling through Fas/FasL is {{critical}} to immune homeostasis and tolerance to self-antigens. SA-FasL is a chimeric protein of FasL and streptavidin. SA-FasL exists as oligomers with potent apoptotic function on Fas expressing immune cells and tightly binds to biotinylated surfaces. Islet grafts engineered to transiently display SA-FasL on their surface established tolerance in allogeneic recipients with a short course of rapamycin. We hypothesized that SA-FasL on the islet allograft will induce apoptosis in alloreactive T effector (Teff) cells and phagocytes clearing apoptotic bodies will produce tolerogenic molecules, such as TGF-β, {{that will lead to}} the generation and/or expansion of Treg cells at the induction phase. Treg cells will then home to allografts in response to inflammatory cues and will be maintained in the graft by alloantigens for long-term graft protection. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated reduced alloreactive T cells in the draining lymph nodes of SAFasL- engineered grafts as compared to controls. Depletion of phagocytes or blocking TGF-β peri- and immediate post-transplantation of allogeneic SA-FasLislet grafts abrogated tolerance as the grafts were rejected acutely. Systemic nature of the tolerance at the induction phase was shown by demonstrating that both un-engineered as well as SA-FasL-engineered islet grafts simultaneously transplanted under the contralateral kidney capsules survived indefinitely. SA-FasL-islets had characteristics of immune privilege as chemical destruction of the long-term graft followed by the transplantation of an un-engineered graft at the same location 4 days later resulted in the protection of the <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>graft.</b> We also tested whether tolerance to allografts requires physical presence of SA-FasL on the graft. To investigate this, we engineered biotinylated poly ethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel or poly(lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds with SA-FasL and co-transplanted with unmanipulated allogeneic islets under the kidney capsule or epididymal fat pad, respectively, resulted in indefinite (3 ̆e 200 days) islet survival. Flow cytometry revealed increased amounts of Tregs in the graft and draining lymph nodes in the PEG model. Mice rejected these grafts when Tregs were depleted. Taken together, the studies presented herein elucidate the mechanistic basis of SA-FasL-mediated tolerance and show that SA-FasL-engineered biomaterials are also effective in inducing tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous donor antigen in {{the form}} of spleen cells can {{significantly}} potentiate the effects of ALS in prolonging the survival of skin allografts exchanged across both weak and strong histocompatibility barriers. This effect depends on the proper timing of antigen administration and can result in immunologic unresponsiveness of sufficient strength to permit acceptance of <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>grafts.</b> The skin allograft itself apparently plays a role in the establishment of this unresponsive state since ALS and antigen alone followed by delayed allografts at 21 days resulted in normal graft rejection times...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet B {{radiation}} initiates a {{suppression of}} the delayed-type hypersensitivity response accompanied by a generation of antigen-specific suppressor cells and an alteration of antigen-presenting function. In previous studies we and other investigators could achieve a prolongation of graft survival by a treatment of the recipient with UVB light or 8 -methoxypsoralen plus UVA light (PUVA). One of the mediators of the systemic immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet light or PUVA may be urocanic acid, which is isomerized in the skin by ultraviolet light from its cis- to the trans-isomer. In this work we present evidence that cis-urocanic acid, generated in vitro by a treatment with UVB light or PUVA, is able to prolong the survival of allogeneic MHC disparate skin grafts in mice. In contrast, the rejection of <b>second</b> <b>set</b> <b>grafts</b> was not suppressed. Unirradiated (trans-urocanic acid) {{had no effect on}} allograft rejection. In a murine model cis-, but not trans-urocanic acid, prevented or delayed an acute lethal graft-versus-host disease. These experiments demonstrate the potent systemic immunomodulatory effects of cis-urocanic acid in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Immunological and {{histological}} evaluations {{were carried}} out to determine the applicability of pericardium tanned with 1 % glutaraldehyde (GA) and preserved in 0. 35 % GA as the intraatrial baffle prosthesis. In the skin tests, rats sensitized with subcutaneously implanted fresh procine showed an accelerated <b>second</b> <b>set</b> skin <b>graft</b> rejection {{and an increase in}} the number of medium to large lymphocytes in the local lymphnodes. In contrast, rats implanted with GA treated porcine pericardium did not show an acceleration of the <b>second</b> <b>set</b> skin <b>graft</b> rejection, and there was a weed response in the local lymphnodes. In the lymphocyte transformation tests, the stimulation index (S. I.) showed a low value in all of the GA treated procine pericardium imolanted and inoculated dogs. Conversely, S. I. was high in the fresh porcine pericardium inoculated dogs. In the macroscopic observatio, it was found that the surface of the implanted GA treated procine pericardium was covered with fibrous sheath on both right and left sides after 3 - 12 months period following the implantation, and no thrombus was seen. In the histopathological studies, the structure of the GA-treated porcine pericardium was found to be well-maintained with minimum sign of the degeneration. Sic months after the implantation, the surface of the fibrous sheath was completely covered with a layer of new endothelial cells. This layer of new endothelial cells became denser with time laose. It was suggested that GA-treated procine pericardium is applicable for the use as intra-atrial baffle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate how various sizes and densities of pores in Dacron tubing might enhance its utility as a tracheal prosthesis. MethodsA vascular prosthesis made of knitted external velour polyester was prepared for pore formation with a laser. The first set compared different pore sizes (300, 500, and 700 μm) and pore densities (25 /cm 2 or 100 /cm 2). Grafts were reinforced with an externally heat-sealed silicone ring. The <b>second</b> <b>set</b> tested <b>grafts</b> with a pore density of 64 /cm 2 and a pore size of 500 μm internally reinforced with a stainless-steel spiral stent. In all experiments, a canine mediastinal trachea 10 cartilage rings in length was resected, and the prosthesis was then implanted with an omental flap. ResultsLower pore size and density (300 μm, 25 pores/cm 2) led to essentially no tissue ingrowth. Larger pore size (700 μm) and low density (25 pores/cm 2) led to rapid and excessive ingrowth of granulation. Midrange pore size (500 μm) and high density (100 pores/cm 2) invited steady tissue ingrowth, but marked luminal stenosis eventually developed. Stent-reinforced prostheses with 500 -μm pores at 64 pores/cm 2, as used in the <b>second</b> <b>set,</b> maintained an average patency rate of 60 % or more (range, 20 %- 100 %) at least 12 months after implantation. ConclusionOur data show that porosity is a key factor for tissue growth through our Dacron tracheal prostheses. This artificial trachea model has led to long-term survivors up to 27 months after the operation and seems promising as a basic model for clinical tracheal repair...|$|R
40|$|Corneal allografts contain {{few or no}} Ia+ Langerhans' {{cells and}} {{consistently}} fail to elicit allospecific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). The present study examined {{the hypothesis that the}} inability of corneal allografts to induce allospecific DTH was the result of active suppression. However, the results indicated that an initial exposure to corneal allografts provided a subthreshold stimulus for the induction of DTH because hosts that received a second pair of corneal grafts 7 days later developed DTH. By contrast, hosts that received all four corneal allografts simultaneously, failed to display DTH to donor alloantigens. Hosts that received a single set of corneal allografts did not display DTH to donor alloantigens, yet their spleen cells were capable of transferring DTH to hosts subsequently stimulated with a single <b>set</b> of corneal <b>grafts.</b> The capacity of Langerhans' cell-free corneal grafts to prime the host so that a <b>second</b> <b>set</b> of corneal <b>grafts</b> stimulated DTH to donor alloantigens was termed 'subthreshold stimulation of DTH'. The ability of sequential <b>sets</b> of corneal <b>grafts</b> to induce DTH was abolished by fixation with 0. 2 % paraformaldehyde. Surprisingly, the single cell-layered corneal endothelium was found to be the crucial corneal component necessary for the induction of allospecific DTH. This unique spectrum of corneal alloimmunogenicity may contribute to the immunological privilege and high success rate of corneal allografts...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation of islets of Langerhans in {{patients}} with type 1 diabetes allows for improved metabolic control and insulin independence. The need for chronic immunosuppression limits this procedure to selected patients with brittle diabetes. Definition of therapeutic strategies allowing permanent engraftment {{without the need for}} chronic immunosuppression could overcome such limitations. We tested the effect of the use of protoporphyrins (CoPP and FePP), powerful inducers of the cytoprotective protein heme-oxygenase 1 (HO- 1), on allogeneic islet graft survival. Chemically induced diabetic C 57 BL/ 6 mice received DBA/ 2 islets. Treatment consisted in peritransplant administration of CoPP or saline. Islets were either cultured in the presence of FePP or vehicle before implant. Short-course administration of CoPP led to long-term islet allograft survival in a sizable proportion of recipients. Long-term graft-bearing animals rejected third-party islets while accepting a <b>second</b> <b>set</b> donor-specific <b>graft</b> permanently, without additional treatment. Preconditioning of islets with FePP by itself led to improved graft survival in untreated recipients, and provided additional advantage in CoPP-treated recipients, resulting in an increased proportion of long-term surviving grafts. Preconditioning of the graft with protoporphyrins prior to implant resulted in reduction of class II expression. Administration of protoporphyrins to the recipients of allogeneic islets also resulted in transient powerful immunosuppression with reduced lymphocyte proliferative responses, increased proportion of regulatory cells (CD 4 +CD 25 +), decreased mononuclear cell infiltrating the graft, paralleled by a systemic upregulation of HO- 1 expression. All these mechanisms {{may have contributed to the}} induction of donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in a proportion of the protoporphyrin-treated animals...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a substrain of BB rats, BB/Pfd, {{characterized by a}} loss of autoimmune potential soon after onset of diabetes. When fresh syngeneic (BB/Pfd) islets (6 islets/g body weight) were transplanted under the kidney capsule of diabetic BB/Pfd rats 1 - 2 weeks after diabetes onset (n = 14), no recurrence of diabetes occurred. When, however, islets were transplanted {{on the day of}} diabetes diagnosis (n = 16), 10 animals were able to destroy the transplant (P < 0. 005 vs. previous group). Pancreatic biopsies taken at the moment of transplantation in both groups showed an almost complete disappearance of beta cells and also insulitis in the pancreata of the 1 - to 2 -week diabetic rats, while the acutely diabetic rats still conserved a certain amount of beta cells and a florid insulitis. The development of a general immune defect was not the cause of this nonrecurrence, since allogeneic islet grafts were easily rejected (7 of 8), nor was there a general defect in mounting immune memory, since <b>second</b> <b>set</b> skin <b>grafts</b> could be rejected in an accelerated manner (9. 7 vs. 15. 8 days). The development of suppressor mechanisms as cause for nonrecurrence could not be demonstrated, since transfer of lymphocytes taken from 1 - to 2 -week diabetic rats into acutely diabetic rats at the moment of syngeneic islet transplantation was unable to prevent recurrence of disease (6 recurrences in 10 animals). We conclude that in the BB/Pfd substrain, the autoimmune capacity wanes rapidly after the onset of diabetes. This loss of autoimmune potential is parallelled by a disappearance of insulitis in the native pancreas, but the exact mechanisms of the spontaneous reestablishment of self-tolerance remain unclear. status: publishe...|$|R
