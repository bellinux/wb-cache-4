5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Modibo Adama led Fulani <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> a jihad {{in the north}} against non-Muslim and {{partially}} Muslim peoples and established the Adamawa Emirate.

5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 <b>soldiers.</b> <b>On</b> 1 August 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers of {{the brigade}} were also {{some of the}} first to use the MRAP, or Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle.

5|$|To provide {{shelter for}} small {{detachments}} of <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> overnight patrols, the army constructed soldier and snowshoe cabins in remote and isolated spots and at popular tourist locations.

5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, {{the village was}} attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While {{on the way to}} hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.|$|E

5|$|Ala can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition {{has it that}} an ala sneaked into St. Simeon, which made him voracious, but St. Sava took her out of him. In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the ala destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours the <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> watch.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} {{to push for}} an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E

5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 30 November, the Austrian advance guard {{occupied}} Ampfing. At dawn on 1 December, Johann Riesch left the town with 12 battalions of infantry and 12 squadrons of cavalry, or approximately 14,000 men. Ludwig Baillet de Latour-Merlemont led nine battalions and 18 squadrons, or 12,000 <b>soldiers,</b> <b>on</b> Riesch's right flank. Latour quickly overran the French outposts and nearly surprised Michel Ney's division in its camp. Despite odds of four-to-one, the (French) 19th Cavalry Regiment charged their attackers, which included the Latour Dragoon Regiment # 11.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the <b>soldiers</b> <b>on</b> a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
