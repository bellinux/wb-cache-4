5|$|Padayappa {{launched}} {{production at}} the Ragavendra Kalyana Mandapam on 1 October 1998. The film's climax scene {{was one of the}} first to be shot, and was filmed in one take using two cameras. Around 2,000 extras were used for the scene. The car that was used in the scene which introduced Neelambari in the film belonged to Ravikumar. Ravikumar used the newly purchased car in the film at Rajinikanth's insistence. Filming also took place in Mysore. The Vadapalani-based shop, D. V. Nehru wigs, supplied the wigs that were sported by Ganesan in the film. In an August 2016 interview with Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu, Ravikumar mentioned that a scene where Padayappa uses his dupatta to pull down a swing from the ceiling on which he sits after not being given a chair to <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> Neelambari, was inspired by a sequence in the Indian epic Ramayana. The sequence features the Hindu god Hanuman making a seat using his tail after Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, does not provide the former a chair to sit.|$|E

25|$|Reduplication (morphological repetition) is {{extremely}} common in ASL. Generally {{the motion of}} the sign is shortened as well as repeated. Nouns may be derived from verbs through reduplication. For example, the noun chair is formed from the verb to <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> repeating it with a reduced degree of motion. Similar relationships exist between acquisition and to get, airplane and to fly (on an airplane), also window and to open/close a window.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E

In an interview for Billboard, Sia said, [...] "She [...] was just excited {{to get to work}} with the artists she loves. There's this misconception that she's a middle-America kind of person.

It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E

[...] Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a [...] "Jerry West Night", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: [...] "Jerry, you are, {{in every sense of}} the word, truly a champion… If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy." ...|$|E

[...] While the parents gesticulate wildly at their son, the lifeguard and instructor calmly <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> the pool, watching the boy's smooth progress. [...] This scene is contrasted with Lat's own experience {{at the hands of}} his father, who casually tosses the terrified boy into a river, letting him either swim or flounder.

500|$|Heylin {{heard in}} the {{composition}} Dylan's admission that in 1971 he felt uninspired about writing lyrics and had no specific ideas he wanted to voice. The biographer placed this avowal {{in the context of}} changing, polarized critical estimates of Dylan's work in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In June 1970, Dylan had released Self Portrait, an album that received very negative reviews; Dylan's next album that year, New Morning, was viewed much more favorably by critics, and Ralph Gleason declared [...] "We've got Dylan back again!" [...] For Heylin, Dylan's assertion in the song that he does not have any particular message to express, is an attempt to subvert critics like Gleason. Heylin wrote that both [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] and [...] "When I Paint My Masterpiece" [...] discuss Dylan's professed lack of inspiration at the time in an honest and satisfying way. Pointing to the fact that Dylan made no attempt to record either a single or an album in the following year of 1972, he commented that [...] "Dylan had now concluded that he must simply <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> that bank of sand and await [...] return." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] {{was written}} by Noel Behn, who became {{consulting}} producer with the series. That episode featured a subplot {{about a man who}} killed another man over a pen, which was inspired by a real-life murder in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in which a 23-year-old man shot another man 10 times in a doughnut shop when the victim refused to sell the shooter his pen. Since NBC had not decided on whether to renew Homicide until after the four episodes aired, the screenwriters did not start working on any scripts for the third season until after the second season concluded. As a result, once NBC was committed to renewal, the scripts had to be written later and the Homicide producers were not able to turn around new shows until the fall. Additionally, Fontana [...] was working on other projects, including Philly Heat, an ABC miniseries about members of the Philadelphia Fire Department. Some media outlets criticized NBC for not commissioning Fontana and Levinson to write back-up scripts, which prevented Homicide from starting earlier once the show was renewed. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News wrote, [...] "Understandably, Fontana didn't <b>sit</b> <b>by</b> idly and wait for NBC to make its decision on Homicide." ...|$|E
