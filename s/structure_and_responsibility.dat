Inaugurated in 1962 and expanded greatly in the past twenty years, the system 2 ̆ 7 s goals are laudatory. However, a lack of <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> has seriously compromised the effectiveness of counsel. Representation is frequently characterized by perfunctory preparation and a waiver of substantive and procedural rights. Moreover, the system is needlessly bifurcated and incapable of providing the education, experience and assistance required for effective counsel. The Bar Association study provides a blueprint for improvement. Legislative restructuring to establish an independent board and office capable of establishing policies and monitoring the system, as well as providing educational and support services, is one priority. In addition, use of the appellate process must be encouraged and standards of representation adopted through guideline promulgation and appellate review. The objective is to improve and augment the level of representation while preserving the current system of an individualized representation...|$|E

The relationship between the service buyer and provider companies is a constituent playing a significant role in IT outsourcing success or failure. The questions in this research is" {{what is the role of}} organizational culture in ITO (IT Outsourcing) relationships?" This research has a focus on the influence of organizational culture of buyer companies on the specific factors of trust, cooperation, communication and commitment in their relationship with the IT service provider. A qualitative approach has been used and six global companies using ITO are selected to have interviews with their relevant managers which revealed the presence of organizational culture effect.

Additionally there were some external factors found after the analysis phase which were out of the scope of the research theoretical framework such as previous experience of buyer company in outsourcing, IT governance and the value of IT in the buyer company. These extra issues can be linked to the organizational culture of the buyer company and affect their IT outsourcing relationships...|$|E
40|$|In early 1997 Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) {{discovered}} that the spent fuel pool of their High Flux Beam Reactor was leaking tritium into the groundwater. Community members, activist groups, politicians and regulators were outraged with the poor environmental management practices at BNL. The reactor was shut down and the Department of Energy (DOE) terminated the contract with the existing Management Company. At this same time, a major new scientific facility, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), was {{nearing the end of}} construction and readying for commissioning. Although environmental considerations had been incorporated into the design of the facility; some interested parties were skeptical that this new facility would not cause significant environmental impacts. RHIC management recognized that the future of its operation was dependent on preventing pollution and allaying concerns of its stakeholders. Although never done at a DOE National Laboratory before Brookhaven Science Associates, the new management firm, committed to implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) and RHIC managers volunteered to deploy it within their facility on an extremely aggressive schedule. Several of these IS 0 requirements contribute directly to preventing pollution, an area where particular emphasis was placed. This paper describes how Brookhaven used the following key IS 0 14001 elements to institutionalize Pollution Prevention concepts: Environmental Policy, Aspects, Objectives and Targets, Environmental Management Program, <b>Structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>Responsibility,</b> Operational Controls, Training, and Management Review. In addition, examples of implementation at the RHIC Project illustrate how BNL's premiere facility was able to demonstrate to interested parties that care had been taken to implement technological and administrative controls to minimize environmental impacts, {{while at the same time}} reduce the applicability of regulatory requirements to their operations...|$|E
40|$|Fraud in the EU, {{comparison}} analysis {{between the}} structures and responsibility relationships of the OLAF and a traditional corporate governance layout in private organizations in regards of fraud prevention and detection. Since the recent increase in fraud scandals, companies had to adapt themselves to more scrutiny from the shareholders {{and to the}} toughing of company law that was so far regulated by the theft act 1968 and disclosure through information. Hence in the UK, the Parliament launched in march 2005 the fraud bill. On the European level, this quest for transparency has been translated by {{the implementation of a}} European Anti fraud Office in 1999, the OLAF. The OLAF (or Office Europen de Lutte Anti-Fraude) has been charged by the European Union with protecting the interests of the European Union, to fighting fraud, corruption and any other irregular activity, including misconduct within the European Institutions, in an accountable, transparent and cost-effective manner. OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations. It also organizes close and regular co-operation between the competent authorities of the Member States in order to co-ordinate their activities. OLAF supplies Member States with the necessary support and technical know-how to help them in their anti-fraud activities. It contributes to the design of the anti-fraud strategy of the European Union and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation. This dissertation is analyzing the analogy {{of the structure of the}} OLAF with the traditional corporate governance. The question is here to evaluate the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> relationships of the Olaf in comparison with the monitoring model based on corporate governance. The outcome of this comparison should give us an understanding of functioning of the Olaf and might give more insight of the issues/conflicts faced by this institution...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{developments}} in police oversight {{in the last}} decade in Australia's eight jurisdictions. Significant variation remains in the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of oversight agencies, but there has been an ongoing trend towards replacing an ombudsman model with a public sector-wide commission model. There has also been a general convergence in terms of increased powers and an enlarged range of anti-corruption tactics. Change has been driven by ongoing revelations of misconduct or concerns about potential misconduct by police, public servants and politicians. Despite improvements it is argued that there is considerable room for better practice, especially in enlarging the scope of independent investigations and adjudication by integrity commissions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
