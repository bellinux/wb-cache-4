40|$|General EcologyThe {{purposes}} of this study were to determine if scavenging of aquatic insects in a dune ecosystem is density dependent, and from where in the dunes scavengers prefer to obtain their food. Dead aquatic insects were placed out in different density groupings and habitats within the dune ecosystem. Samples were weighed before and after a <b>scavenging</b> <b>period</b> of 24 hours. The difference between these values was used as the amount scavenged from a given sample. Our data showed a trend of scavengers having a slight preference for higher densities of aquatic insects, however this trend was not found to be statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{different}} {{internal and external}} EGR strategies, combined with extreme Miller cycles, were analyzed {{by means of a}} one dimensional CFD simulation code for a Wartsila 6 cylinder, 4 strokes, medium speed marine diesel engine, to evaluate their potential in order to reach the IMO Tier 3 NOx emissions target. By means of extreme Miller cycles, with Early Intake Valve Closures (EIVC up to 100 crank angle degrees before BDC), a shorter compression stroke and lower charge temperatures inside the cylinder can be achieved and thanks to the cooler combustion process, the NOx specific emissions can be effectively reduced. EIVC strategies can also be combined with reductions of the <b>scavenging</b> <b>period</b> (valve overlap) {{to increase the amount of}} exhaust gases in the combustion chamber. However, the remarkably high boost pressure levels needed for such extreme Miller cycles, require mandatorily the use of two stage turbocharging systems. Despite two stages turbocharging, combined with extreme Miller timings, may allow up to 50 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, further NOx emissions reductions are necessary to meet the IMO Tier 3 NOx limit. Higher EGR percentages, which could be achieved by means of external circuits, were therefore also evaluated. However, it should be pointed out that, although the external EGR technology is well established for automotive and heavy duty diesel engines, it is not yet state of the art for marine diesel engines, and its application to a highly boosted engine using extreme Miller timings is not straightforward. Several different complex EGR routes were thus investigated, and for the preliminary assessment of their NOx emissions abatement potentialities, the use of numerical simulation allowed a detailed and extensive evaluation of the effects on engine performance, fuel consumption, NOx emissions and thermal and mechanical loads on engine components of the combination of different intake valve profiles, intake valve closure timings and scavenging periods with different external exhaust gas recirculation solutions. Percentages of exhaust gases recirculated in the combustion chamber up to 20 % were evaluated that combined with extreme Miller timings (up to 100 crank angle degrees before BDC) allowed up to 90 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, with only moderate BSFC increas...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates {{the details of}} mixture preparation and combustion in a two-stroke, small-scale research engine with a numerical methodology based on large eddy simulation (LES) technique. A major motivation to study such small-scale engines is their potential use in applications requiring portable power sources with high power density. The investigated research engine has a rectangular planform with a thickness very close to quenching limits of typical hydrocarbon fuels. As such, the combustor has a high aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of surface area to volume) that makes it different than the conventional engines which typically have small aspect ratios to avoid intense heat losses from the combustor in the bulk flame propagation period. In most other aspects, this engine involves all the main characteristics of traditional reciprocating engines. A previous experimental work has identified some major design problems and demonstrated the feasibility of cyclic combustion in the high aspect ratio combustor. Because {{of the difficulty of}} carrying out experimental studies in such small devices, resolving all flow structures and completely characterizing the flame propagation have been an enormously challenging task. The numerical methodology developed in this work attempts to complement these previous studies by providing a complete evolution of flow variables. Results of the present study demonstrated strengths of the proposed methodology in revealing physical processes occurring in a typical operation of the high aspect ratio combustor. For example, in the scavenging phase, the dominant flow structure is a tumble vortex that forms due to the high velocity reactant jet (premixed) interacting with the walls of the combustor. LES gives the complete evolution of this flow structure, from its beginning to its eventual decay after the <b>scavenging</b> <b>period</b> is over. In addition, LES is able to predict the interaction between the bulk flow at top dead center (TDC) and the turbulent flame propagation. The success of this depends on the ability of the model in predicting turbulent flow structure including its length and velocity scales. Ph. D.

40|$|Samples {{collected}} by two sediment traps located southwest of Crete {{in the eastern}} Mediterranean (EMED) [48 A (1953 m) and 48 B (950 m) ] from June 2005 to May 2006 were used to study fluxes of organic carbon, carbonate and coccolithophores {{in combination with the}} variations of Sr/Ca ratios in different individually picked coccolith species. Considering the complexity of the EMED, we validate the use of Sr/Ca ratios as productivity proxy and unravel the varied processes which may influence it. We examined the relationship between the seasonal peaks in export fluxes and the Sr/Ca ratio in coccoliths of three upper photic zone coccolithophores species collected in the traps, Calcidiscus leptoporus, Helicosphaera carteri and Emiliania huxleyi. We aimed at testing whether high export fluxes are correlated with high Sr/Ca ratios, suggestive of higher nutrient-stimulated production, or Sr/Ca ratios are unchanged during high export periods, suggestive of increased export efficiency or <b>scavenging.</b> <b>Periods</b> of enhanced trap fluxes in March and June result from surface water blooms recognized in satellite imagery. An additional peak flux was found in January, but this peak represents re-suspended or recycled material in the water column. The amplitude of seasonal variations in the Sr/Ca ratios of the three investigated species is small in both traps. In the shallow trap, a decrease in the Sr/Ca ratio of C. leptoporus occurred synchronously with minimal fluxes. The other two species were not measured for this period. In the deep trap, no such decrease in Sr/Ca was observed during minimal fluxes, in either C. leptoporus or H. carteri, probably due to a long residence of coccoliths in the water column, recycling and low export efficiency. Absolute Sr/Ca ratios for all species are lower than in other more productive environments like the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, or Sargasso Sea. We conclude that Sr/Ca ratios in coccoliths of surface sediments in the EMED reflect mainly spring-summer bloom conditions averaged over hundreds to thousands of years. In addition, the origin of varying calcite thickness in H. carteri was investigated. The similarity of average Sr/Ca ratios in differently-calcified specimens confirms that coccolith thickness variations in this species result from primary biomineralization processes and not from variable overgrowth by (low Sr) abiogenic calcite in the water column or the sediments. © 2009 Elsevier B.

50|$|When {{a pocket}} mouse has found {{sufficient}} seeds, {{it will begin}} to store these resources in its fur-lined cheeks. These pockets can vary in length from three inches (76 mm) to twelve. The sizes of the pockets {{are determined by the}} ratio of body length and jumping span. These pockets aid the mouse by trimming the amount of time and energy needed to <b>scavenge</b> over a <b>period</b> of time. Its pouches also allow the mouse to survive when there is limited food or predation risk. Once the pocket mouse has filled its cheeks with the seeds, it will scurry down into its burrow to unload its provisions. These seeds are then stored in certain compartments within its burrow. When the time comes, these seeds will be taken out of storage and used as food for the pocket mouse. If supplies are low, a pocket mouse will leave the burrow to refill its supply. Also, during the spring and autumn months, pocket mice will savage more often in order to prepare for the coming of summer and winter when it will be harder to find food.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the months}} of June and July 2013, over the Euro–Mediterranean area, the ADRIMED (Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the {{regional}} climate in the MEDiterranean region) project was dedicated to characterize the ozone and aerosol concentrations in the troposphere. It is first shown that this period was not highly polluted compared to previous summers in this region, with a moderate ozone production, no significant vegetation fire events and several precipitation <b>periods</b> <b>scavenging</b> the aerosol. The period is modeled with the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) and CHIMERE models, {{and their ability to}} quantify the observed pollution transport events is presented. The CHIMERE model simulating all kinds of sources (anthropogenic, biogenic, mineral dust, vegetation fires); the aerosol speciation, not available with the measurements, is presented: during the whole period, the aerosol was mainly constituted by mineral dust, sea salt and sulfates close to the surface and mainly by mineral dust in the troposphere. Compared to the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) size distribution, it is shown that the model underestimates the coarse mode near mineral dust sources and overestimates the fine mode in the Mediterranean area, highlighting the need to improve the model representation of the aerosol size distribution both during emissions, long-range transport and deposition...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{sources are}} among the largest {{contributors}} of NOx in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park region (GSMNP). In 2001, these sources contributed 45 % of NOx emissions. From 1990 to 2001, the growth of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) increased 60 % and 55 % in neighboring Sevier and Blount counties respectively. These emissions combined with the high volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions in the Southeast area have caused the ozone ground level concentration to {{be as high as}} some major metropolitan areas in the summer season. In 2001, the maximum 8 -hr ozone concentration inside the park was 103 parts per billion. In response to high ozone levels in other areas, federal, state, and local governments are promoting the use of alternative, clean, and reformulated fuel vehicles as a means to improve local air pollution. One of these fuels is compressed natural gas (CNG). The purpose of this project was to use USEPA's CMAQ system in order to model the air quality and compare the ozone ground level formation in the GSMNP from light duty vehicles (LDVs) operating with 100 % CNG within 100 miles around GSMNP. A severe southeast ozone episode between August and September 1999 was used as a reference and 2004 was used as a future case. Results showed that LDVs fueled with 100 % CNG in the domain could reduce ozone level by 10 % and 8 % for 1 -hr and 8 -hr ozone formation respectively in the GSMNP on the modeled time <b>period.</b> <b>Scavenging</b> occurred around the GSMNP in the morning time during the selected episode...|$|R
