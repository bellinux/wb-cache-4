To achieve the {{purpose of the}} present study, thirty intercollegiate level jumpers were selected from Tirunelveli district, Tamilnadu were selected as subjects at random and their ages ranged from 18 to 25 years. The study was formulated as a true random group design, consisting of a pre-test and post-test.

40|$|<b>Step</b> <b>aerobics</b> with a {{standard}} 8 inch step, performed at around 128 beats min- 1, requires relatively high knee flexion angles and is considered high impact. Injuries are common among participants, in particular patella pain syndrome (Hoose et al., 1998 : Clinical Kinesiology, 52, 52 ± 57). This {{has been attributed to}} an imbalance between vastus medialis and vastus lateralis activity, where repetitive stronger activation of lateral relative to medial muscles leads to muscle imbalance and the development of patella femoral pain. Cases are reportedly higher in women because of a relatively larger lateral pull from the vastus lateralis owing to a larger Q-angle.

Balance was measured by four different methods (modified Clinical Test for the Sensory Interaction on Balance - mCTSIB; Unilateral Stance with Eyes Open - US-EO or Eyes Closed - US-EC; Tandem Walk - TW; Step Quick Turn - SQT) using the NeuroCom Balance Master. A 2 -way (Group and Trial) repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni Pair-wise Comparisons were used to evaluate changes in the dependent variables used to describe stability and balance (sway velocity, turn sway, speed, and turn time). Measures of static postural stability and dynamic balance were similar for the three groups prior to training. Following the different exercise interventions, sway velocity on firm and foam surfaces (mCTSIB) with eyes closed (p < 0. 05) increased for the Ballates group while the other two exercise groups either maintained or decreased their sway velocity following the training, therefore suggesting that these two groups either maintained or improved their balance. There were significant improvements in speed during the TW test (p < 0. 01), and turn time (p < 0. 01) and sway (p < 0. 05) during the SQT test for each of the three groups.
