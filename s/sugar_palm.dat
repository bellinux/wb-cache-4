The farmers, who formed {{the majority of}} kingdom's population, planted rice near {{the banks of the}} lake or river, in the irrigated plains surrounding their villages, or in the hills when lowlands were flooded. The rice paddies were irrigated by a massive and complex hydraulics system, including networks of canals and barays, or giant water reservoirs. This system enabled the formation of large-scale rice farming communities surrounding Khmer cities. <b>Sugar</b> <b>palm</b> trees, fruit trees, and vegetables were grown in the orchards by the villages, providing other sources of agricultural produce such as palm <b>sugar,</b> <b>palm</b> wine, coconut, various tropical fruits, and vegetables.|$|E
