In {{order to create a}} picture of {{exchange and}} <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> of animals and animal products in the Early Medieval period, the animal remains from the Merovingian settlement of Oegstgeest were analysed to determine whether exchange and <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> took place at this settlement. A theoretical framework was set up in order to determine how exchange and <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> can be recognised in the archaeozoological record. A number of aspects were deemed important in establishing whether exchange and <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> took place in the past, including age and sex distributions, metrical- and non-metrical variation, skeletal element abundance and also stable isotope and aDNA analysis. Several of these aspects of the Oegstgeest faunal assemblage were researched. Results show that there was no large scale exchange and <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> of animals and animal products at Oegstgeest. Results do, however, indicate that pork, beef and sea fish may have been brought into the settlement from elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} of two {{companion}} articles, a 54 -year time series for the oyster population in the New Jersey waters of Delaware Bay is analyzed to examine how the presence of multiple stable states affects reference-point–based management. Multiple stable states are described by four types of reference points. Type I is the carrying capacity for the stable state: each has associated with it a type-II reference point wherein <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> reaches a local maximum. Type-II reference points are separated by an intermediate <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> low (type III). Two stable states establish a type-IV reference point, a point-of-no-return that impedes recovery to the higher stable state. The type-II to type-III differential in <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> {{is a measure of}} the difficulty of rebuilding the population and the sensitivity of the population to collapse at high abundance. <b>Surplus</b> <b>production</b> projections show that the abundances defining the four types of reference points are relatively stable over a wide range of uncertainties in recruitment and mortality rates. The <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> values associated with type-II and type-III reference points are much more uncertain. Thus, biomass goals are more easily established than fishing mortality rates for oyster populatio...|$|R
40|$|Conventional <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> models {{indicate}} that {{destruction of fish}} populations by overfishing is difficult, if not impossible, but catastrophic declines in abundance of exploited populations are common. <b>Surplus</b> <b>production</b> models also do not predict large continuing fluctuations in yield, but large fluctuations in yield are common. Conventional <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> models assume that fisheries do not impact the population's capacity to increase, but changes in age structure or a decrease in age-specific fecundity resulting from fishing can decrease the coefficient of increase. A <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> model is developed in which fishing reduces the capacity of a population to increase; the model is applied to describe the fluctuations observed in yield of lake herring (Coregonus artedii) from the upper Great Lakes. The fisheries of the Great Lakes were decimated by the combined effects of heavy fishing and a changing environment. For some species, yield increased to high levels and then the fisheries collapsed; for other species, yield and effort fluctuated greatly...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surplus</b> <b>production</b> {{models have}} been used in {{fisheries}} analysis for over 40 years. The traditional <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> model incorporates the assumption that catch per unit of effort is constant for a given stock size. As a result, effort can be indefinitely applied to the fishery in the short term, and catch would indefinitely increase at a constant rate. In this paper, a <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> bioeconomic model is developed using a nonlinear form of the short-run catch equation based on the Spillman production function. Two long-run models were derived using the logistic and exponential growth models. The parameters for the long-run equilibrium models are estimated from catch and effort data using a disequilibrium form of the model. The models were applied to data for the Hawaiian lobster fishery used in the analysis by Clarke, Yoshimoto, and Pooley (1992). The results were compared with the results derived from conventional forms of the <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> model. The key parameter values were similar to those reported by Clarke, Yoshimoto, and Pooley, but the amount of variation in the data explained by the new formulation of the models was generally higher.

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} approach of several countries, {{including those in}} the Indian Ocean region, has been generally on a species-to-species basis. It has been realized now that this approach has severe limitations, especially for the tropical, multispecies fisheries.

The West Nordic stock of Greenland halibut (where limited data are available) was assessed using three different fittings (equilibrium, linear and nonlinear) with a <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> model and length based methods for estimating Z. The data analysed were: CPUE indices from (1) the Icelandic bottom trawl fleet 1985 - 2006, (2) the Icelandic fall survey 1996 – 2006, and (3) the Greenlandic fall survey 1998 – 2006 (2001 missing), along with total landings from the fishery and length frequency data sampled from the commercial fishery. The three fittings of the <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> model produced r„s (~ 0. 4) and q„s(~ 0. 005) that were similar but K„s and MSY„s that were different.
