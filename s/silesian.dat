5|$|An {{additional}} {{reason for}} a quick end to this conflict among the <b>Silesian</b> princes was the personal intervention of King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who in preparation for his final confrontation with King Rudolph I of Habsburg German needed to calm the situation in Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1741, at {{the onset}} of the First <b>Silesian</b> War, Zieten was a major and {{squadron}} leader. On 10 May 1741 he distinguished himself in a fight with the Austrians at the Battle of Strehlen. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in the Life hussar regiment and received the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E

25|$|Modern Silesia is {{inhabited}} by Poles, <b>Silesians,</b> Germans, and Czechs. The last Polish census of 2002 {{showed that the}} <b>Silesians</b> are the largest national minority in Poland, Germans being the second; both groups are located mostly in Upper Silesia. The Czech part of Silesia is {{inhabited by}} Czechs, Moravians, <b>Silesians,</b> and Poles.|$|R
50|$|After the {{election}} Adam Napieralski, editor of Polish-language newspaper Katolik (The Catholic), established a law office to defend Polish-speaking Upper <b>Silesians</b> in German Upper Silesia. The office was managed by Joseph Musiol, {{chairman of the}} Union of Upper <b>Silesians</b> and former deputy of the Prussian parliament (who had just lost his seat). He represented the Catholic People's Party, after being expelled from the German Centre Party in April 1921 for his independence activities. Musiol sent questionnaires about discrimination against Polish-speaking Upper <b>Silesians</b> {{on behalf of the}} Union of Upper <b>Silesians</b> and was its chairman until 1924, when it dissolved.|$|R
50|$|Between 1955 and 1959, {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Red Cross, some of the remaining <b>Silesians</b> were able to emigrate to West and East Germany to reunite with their families in Germany. But some had to wait for years. Until 1989, nearly 600,000 <b>Silesians</b> emigrated to Germany.|$|R
5|$|Prussia became anxious at Austrian {{advances}} on the Rhine frontier, and Frederick again invaded Bohemia, {{beginning a}} Second <b>Silesian</b> War; Prussian troops sacked Prague in August 1744. The French plans fell apart when Charles Albert died in January 1745. The French overran the Austrian Netherlands in May.|$|E
5|$|The Allied powers {{referred}} {{the problem}} of Upper Silesia to the League after they {{had been unable to}} resolve the territorial dispute. After the First World War, Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two <b>Silesian</b> Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 percent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third <b>Silesian</b> Uprising in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{difference of}} interests between Przemysł II and his uncle Bolesław the Pious in the <b>Silesian</b> and Czech affairs, didn't disturb their good relations. Evidence {{of this was}} the common issuance of documents, such as 6 January 1278.|$|E

50|$|The area in Upper Silesia {{east of the}} Oder was {{dominated}} by ethnic Poles, {{most of whom were}} working class. Most spoke a dialect of Polish, but many felt they were a Slavic group of their own called <b>Silesians.</b> In contrast, most of the local middle and upper classes - the landowners, businessmen, factory owners, local government, police and Catholic clergy - were ethnic Germans. There was a further division along religious lines. The German <b>Silesians</b> were almost all Protestant, while the Polish <b>Silesians</b> were invariably Roman Catholic.|$|R

Six years later, {{after the death of}} his uncle, he also obtained the Duchy of Kalisz.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1404, Władysław held {{talks at}} Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław {{supported}} {{him in his}} power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire. Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and <b>Silesian</b> nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious {{in a very}} uncomfortable situation, because he {{being a member of}} Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could not remain indifferent to this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other <b>Silesian</b> princes also belonged).|$|E
5000|$|According to Robert Koehl, [...] "By the {{introduction}} of the registration procedure known as the German National List (DVL) some 900,000more 'Germans' were discovered, most of them semi-Polish minorities such as the Kassubians, the Masurians, and the local Upper <b>Silesians</b> whom the Germans called 'Wasserpolen'. A few thousand 're-Germanizeables' ...had also been shipped back to the Reich." [...] By October 1943, around 90 percent (1,290,000) of <b>Silesians</b> signed the DVL.|$|R

50|$|At {{the onset}} of the Hussite wars, the town was sacked and burnt by the Catholic <b>Silesians</b> on May 27, 1421. Men were slaughtered, women raped, 40 boys had their right feet and left hands severed and their noses cut off. Some burgesses sought refuge in the rock {{labyrinth}} on the nearby Ostaš mountain but the <b>Silesians</b> went even there to murder. The monastery was not renewed until after the Hussite wars.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the <b>Silesian</b> region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, coined the term Mujo for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an oath of allegiance to both Hitler and Pavelić.|$|E
5|$|Casimir, who {{formally}} gave up {{his rights}} to several <b>Silesian</b> principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the House of Luxembourg (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the Gniezno Archdiocese by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third <b>Silesian</b> War and sparked the wider Seven Years' War. Empress Maria Theresa and Kaunitz wished {{to exit the}} war with possession of Silesia. Austria was aligned with France and Russia, Great Britain with Prussia and Portugal. Giving Austria huge subsidies came back to haunt France. It could not bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was another group living in the area, the Ślązakowcy, who claimed a distinct <b>Silesian</b> national identity.
