5000|$|Foster's clear yet {{detailed}} panels, uncluttered by word balloons, were {{appreciated by}} contemporaries {{of his generation}} such as Lynd Ward, but perhaps his greatest impact was on the young artists who drove the Golden Age of Comics. Foster was {{a major influence on}} this generation, many of whom went on to become iconic and influential artists themselves. Joe Kubert called Foster, Raymond and Milton Caniff the “three saints” of comic art in the 1930s and 40s. <b>Several</b> <b>sources</b> <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> early work by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby and Bob Kane as swipes from Foster, and Kirby claimed that he [...] "cannibalized" [...] Foster's style, among others. Kirby also stated that the character design for Etrigan the Demon was an homage to Foster, taken from a Prince Valiant strip. Wally Wood was [...] "obsessed" [...] with Foster's work, and began copying his newspaper strips at the age of two. Frank Frazetta called Foster's work on Tarzan “perfection, a landmark in American twentieth-century art that will never be surpassed." [...] Among the many other artists who have cited Foster as an important influence are Carl Barks Steve Ditko, Mark Schultz, William Stout, Bill Ward, and Al Williamson. Williamson, who met Foster on a few occasions, described him as [...] "a very stern gentleman, very stern, no nonsense. You could never call him Hal or Harold, it's Mr. Foster. ... you don't see that kind of people anymore, the ones that really command your respect." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{unidentified}} gamma-ray signal {{found in the}} region around the BL Lac object 1 ES 0229 + 200. It was recognized serendipitously in our analysis of 6. 2 years of Fermi-LAT data at a distance less than 3 away from the blazar. The observed excess of counts manifests itself as an unexpected local maximum in the test statistic map. Although <b>several</b> Fermi-LAT <b>sources</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> in this area {{we were not able}} to link them to the position of this residual signal. A clear association with sources visible in other wavebands was not successful either. We briefly discuss characteristics of this unresolved phenomenon. Our results suggest a steep energy spectrum and a point-like nature of this candidate gamma-ray emitter.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{considerable}} interest concerning the role of oxygen radicals in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. The sequential univalent reduction of oxygen gives rise to very reactive intermediate products. Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is limited and the aerobic myocardium survives because of the existence of a delicate balance between the generation of the various oxidants and the maintenance of the antioxidant defense mechanism. <b>Several</b> possible <b>sources</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> for the production of active oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion and these sources may be mutually interactive. The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, including vitamin E, to improve mechanical, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic-reperfusion injury also suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial damage in these models, although caution in the interpretation of these data is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{data from}} the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite's All Sky Monitor {{instrument}} for <b>several</b> X-ray binary <b>sources</b> <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> a recurrent 2 ̃ 4 h period. This period is sometimes highly significant, giving rise {{to the possibility of}} it being identified as an orbital or super-orbital period. Further analysis has revealed the same period {{in a number of other}} X-ray sources. As a result this period has been discounted as spurious, described variously as arising from daily variations in background levels and beating between the sampling period and long-term secular trends in the light curves. We present here an analysis of the spurious periods and show that the dominant mechanism is in fact spectral leakage of low-frequency power present in the light curves.

Two factors that come up in literature often are the class teacher and science curriculum (Yan et al. 2015; Christensen et al. 2014). <b>Several</b> <b>sources</b> <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> the quality of the educational experience provided by the teacher in class as a key factor determining engagement (Osborne et al., 2003; Bennett and Hogarth 2005). Many science teachers are required to teach sciences outside their own specialism (Murray and Reiss 2005). Research emphasized the importance of good specialists and enthusiastic teachers highlighted in an earlier research by Osborne and Collins (2001). The science curriculum was generally thought to be content heavy with too much repetition (Osborne and Collins 2000, 2001) as well as including too much written work (Owen et al. 2008), factors that many young people were said to find dampening. There was much evidence within the literature of the preference of young people for more practical, hands-on, and interactive activities and the potential of this type of activity for encouraging engagement with science education (Osborne and Collins 2000; Cleaves 2005; Murray and Reiss 2005; Owen et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, many fungal {{species have}} been used for their {{medicinal}} properties by various cultures for centuries. Major challenges with cancer chemotherapy, which includes toxicity, non-specificity and several adverse effects have motivated researchers to search for novel anti-cancer compounds from natural <b>sources.</b> <b>Several</b> studies <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> various anti-cancer compounds from mushrooms {{in many parts of the}} world, but mushrooms occurring in British Columbia remain unstudied for their anti-cancer activities. In this thesis, five mushroom species were collected, extracted, and assessed for anti-proliferative and immuno-stimulatory activities. Eleven extracts from these species showed anti-proliferative or immuno-stimulatory activity or both. Sodium hydroxide extract from Paxillus obscurisporus exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity and was further purified using size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography. Analysis of the relatively pure anti-proliferative fractions suggests the presence of protein and glycoprotein moieties. Further purification and characterisation is needed before these compounds can be tested for biomedical purposes in the future. fungiPaxillus obscurisporuanti-cancer compound...|$|R
40|$|In {{the next}} quarter-century, global demand for energy is {{expected}} to increase more than 25 %, while some analysts are predicting that output of petroleum will soon peak. This reality of increasing demand in the face of diminishing fossil supplies is spurring interest in renewable energy sources. An array of biomass-for-bioenergy resources has been proposed, with perennial, lignocellulosic feedstocks showing the greatest potential. Assessment of potential biomass energy resources is difficult, however, as uncertainties over available land and crop yields swing reported estimates from 35 to 1135 EJ/year. In the USA, {{it has been suggested that}} more than 1 billion tonnes (910 million Mg) of biomass could be sustainably harvested, but these estimates are dependent on continued gains in plant productivity, nutrient use efficiency and soil and water conservation. Variables of population growth and increased standards of living will also affect the availability of land for these energy-producing endeavours. <b>Several</b> biofuel <b>sources</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> to include waste streams, microalgae and woody biomass plantations.

40|$|Preliminary {{experience}} with clinical hepatocyte transplantation {{during the past}} decade has provided proof of concept that cell therapy can be effective for the treatment of some liver diseases. Recent progress in cell biology resulting in the isolation and characterization of hepatic stem cells and progenitor cells further increased the expectation for a new approach to the treatment of genetic and chronic liver disease. <b>Several</b> potential <b>sources</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> of hepatic stem/ progenitor cells exhibiting both differentiation towards the hepatic lineage in vitro and hepatic parenchymal repopulation with liver-specific metabolic activity in liver-injured animal models. However, a few of these results proved to be poorly reproducible in different laboratories, and it was recognized that some initial optimistic conclusions were drawn from incorrect interpretation of experimental data or from insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration. Moreover, only modest results have emerged so far from ongoing clinical experience involving the use of putative stem cells in liver disease. There is much need for a joined effort to concentrate the resources on a specific cell population, in order to better characterize its function, to assess its safety and to develop better focused clinical trials. In conclusion, while the biological features of stem cells still justify the hope for future clinical applications, hepatic stem cell therapy has still {{a long way to go}} from bench to bedside...|$|R
