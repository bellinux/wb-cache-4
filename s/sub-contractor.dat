5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased <b>sub-contractor</b> pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E

40|$|What {{contributes}} {{to the success of}} <b>sub-contractors</b> is a key concern of the construction industry as the performance of sub-contracting firms is far from satisfactory. While certain studies have been carried out to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for <b>sub-contractors,</b> it is unrealistic to assume that these CSFs are relevant to all types of <b>sub-contractors.</b> Hence, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to establish a set of CSFs for those construction <b>sub-contractors</b> which are labour-intensive in nature. To achieve that, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong. A set of CSFs pertinent to labour-intensive <b>sub-contractors</b> are first identified through descriptive statistics. The CSFs are then compared with those pertinent to equipment-intensive trade specialists. Finally, the identified CSFs are grouped into three components through a factor analysis. Through the survey, nine factors are identified as critical to the success of labour-intensive <b>sub-contractors,</b> and these CSFs are grouped into three components viz. the managerial performance, financial performance, and labour-intensive specific factors. The findings of this study provide a good basis for labour-intensive <b>sub-contractors</b> to improve their success at project and organisational levels. The identified CSFs will also provide a solid foundation for future research into the key performance indicators and benchmarks for labour-intensive <b>sub-contractors.</b> © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|In 1997, Fluor's {{revenues}} fell almost 50 percent, in {{part due}} to the Asian financial crisis and a decrease in overseas business. Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a <b>sub-contractor</b> to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project. Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing. In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T.

25|$|Building {{awareness}} {{to the new}} Metro Red Line required a massive public relations and advertising campaign. Several agencies were awarded contracts to supply information, create signage and billboards, and produce radio, newspaper and television advertising. Coronado Communications, in alliance with <b>sub-contractor</b> Pangea Corporation, worked out a creative strategy to communicate to the Latino, Korean and Chinese communities. Under the direction of Coronado Communications' Fernando Oaxaca and Pangea's Cheryl Ann Wong, the campaign reached the target audience months before the Metro opened by utilizing traditional media and hosting special minority community events. As the Metro Red Line extended to the West Side of Los Angeles, another campaign was enacted by UltraSystems Environmental and Hintz and Balvin Communications, who put together a team to handle all the collateral and public relations.|$|E

25|$|Still believing {{this could}} be improved, and after {{examining}} more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability {{would make it easier}} to evade fighters and ground fire. The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German schnellbomber. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a <b>sub-contractor.</b>|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1570s, there was open discontent among the less wealthy {{members of the}} Stationers' Company about Day's {{extensive}} patents.

Among those brought to trial was Roger Ward, who admitted to pirating 10,000 copies of ABC with Catechisms in a font which imitated Day's. Day's former apprentice and <b>sub-contractor</b> John Wolfe admitted in court that he had pirated The Whole Booke of Psalmes but justified his actions on the grounds that Day's monopolies were a restraint of trade. It was Wolfe who led a group of [...] "poor printers", as they called themselves, in a campaign against the patents in the late 1570s.

The Air Ministry eventually selected the EE P.17A and the Vickers-Armstrongs Type 571 for further consideration. The Ministry was particularly impressed with the Vickers submission, which included not only the aircraft design, but a [...] "total systems concept" [...] outlining all the avionics, support facilities and logistics needed to maintain the aircraft in the field. Official opinions of English Electric's management found it decidedly lacking in comparison to Vickers, but the combination of the two was felt by officialdom to be a useful marriage and accordingly the development contract was awarded to Vickers, with English Electric as <b>sub-contractor.</b>|$|E
40|$|The intense {{competition}} between the Iranian construction companies has led them to take all appropriate measures to decrease the costs as much as possible. Hence, due to the pivotal role of human resources in construction projects cost, {{a major part of}} Iranian construction companies seek their profitability and survival in maximizing the productivity of their operatives. Because of the widespread belief among contractors about the low productivity of daily workers and operatives with basic salary, they commit a major part of their projects activities to <b>sub-contractors.</b> Deployment of <b>sub-contractors</b> by construction firms has become largely conventional in country 2 ̆ 7 s construction projects. The aims of this paper is defined as determining the factors and grounds affecting <b>sub-contractors</b> productivity and evaluate their overall negative side effects on project productivity via a structured questionnaire. A total of 31 factors selected and were divided into 7 broad categories. The perceptions of companies managers were asked about the level of effect brought about by the mentioned factors and groups upon productivity on a time based criterion. The analysis indicated that the most important grounds affecting <b>sub-contractors</b> productivity in descending order include: Materials/Tools, Construction technology and method, Planning, Supervision system, Reworks, Weather, and Jobsite condition. Project managers should focus on the identified major grounds and relevant factors in order to improve productivity as long as they commit construction activities to <b>sub-contractors.</b> © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika...|$|R
40|$|Sub-contracting in {{clinical}} trials proves to have privileges in comparison to other projects. In Horizon 2020 projects, core activities cannot be sub-contracted. When it comes to peripheral activities, although {{it is possible to}} assign work to <b>sub-contractors</b> (while ensuring “best value for money”), it is still known to be frowned upon by the EC. The rationale behind this is rather simple – the official beneficiaries are responsible and liable to their own financial management vis-à-vis the EC via a contractual relationship (the Grant Agreement). But when it comes to <b>sub-contractors</b> the situation is different: The EC does not have a direct contractual relationship with them, hence limited ability to monitor their performance. Therefore, in most areas of Horizon 2020 it is highly recommended to avoid or reduce the work delegated to <b>sub-contractors...</b>|$|R
