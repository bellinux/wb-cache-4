40|$|Introduction Disassembly of {{automobiles}} prior to recycling {{has been an}} important issue for the automotive industry due to increasing environmental constraints from legislation and consumers. Since most recycling processes for complex products require disassembly of the product, automation of the disassembly process is an important challenge. An explosion of costs arising from the disposal of remains can be avoided and high-quality raw materials can be reused for production. At the Fraunhofer-Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) a disassembly strategy for scrap cars has been developed to reduce car <b>shredder</b> <b>waste</b> by increasing the disassembly depth. The strategy is based upon the integration of automation in the disassembly process using industrial robots for stripping of the automobile. For the investigation of major disassembly operations a flexible disassembly test bed for all scrap cars is being developed.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research is to study the potential of turning the agricultural waste and waste paper into a sound absorption panel. For the purpose of this study, combination of two materials was under studied; coconut coir fibre from agriculture <b>waste</b> and <b>shredded</b> <b>waste</b> paper from the office. There were two main objective of the research; first is to develop absorption panels from coconut coir powder that available locally with a combination of shredded paper at different percentage of mixture. Second objective is to identify the absorption rate of the panels. The study encompasses the fabrication of the particle board using the coconut husk powder mix with <b>shredded</b> <b>waste</b> paper and using the gypsum powder as the binder for the two materials. Four acoustic panels of size 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m and 0. 012 m thick were fabricated with different mix ratio; 25 % of coconut coir powder mixed with 75 % of <b>shredded</b> <b>waste</b> papers for sample 1, 50 % both of the material for sample 2, 75 % of coconut coir powder mixed with 25 % of <b>shredded</b> <b>waste</b> paper for sample 3, and lastly 100 % of coconut coir powder for sample 4. The absorption coefficient of the panels was tested in a reverberation chamber and in accordance with ISO 354 : 1985 standards. Based on the results, sample 1 gave the highest absorption coefficient compared to sample 2, 3 and 4. It can be concluded that the acoustic panel made from a mixture of 25 % coconut coir powder with 75 % <b>shredded</b> <b>waste</b> paper provided higher absorption coefficient compared to the performance of the other samples. This might be caused {{by the size of the}} coir powder which is very small, creating less void space in between the panel and thus causing it to absorb less sound. Since sound absorption is very much affected by the availability of void space of the panel, further studies on other potential materials from waste should be conducted...|$|R

40|$|Zero-emission {{processes}} {{are at the}} core of a resources recycling society. However, the increasing technological advances and specialization of functions demand the use of composite or combined materials in the production of goods, making it difficult to achieve a high degree of recycling. As these metallic alloys and metallic parts present in discarded goods and broken components are almost impossible to separate, they end up in waste filling areas. It has become imperative, then, to develop new material processes that allow the effective use of the metallic impurities contained in the materials to be recycled which are currently impossible to separate. Currently, the final step in the recycling process for disposed vehicles is the dismantling and shredding of the automobile, resulting in 10 % to 25 % of waste material. The annual amount of <b>shredder</b> <b>waste</b> is on the order of 700, 000 tons, which is used for land refilling [1]. This waste product includes iron scrap with a high copper content from components, such as the cores of small motors.

40|$|Waste biomass {{is often}} a {{liability}} to many municipalities. Technologies exist that can turn this biomass into energy which can then be sold. Anaerobic digestion {{is one of the}} important technologies that utilises this biomass to turn it into biogas. One of the factors that affects the rate that biogas can be produced is the speed that suitable organic compounds can be delivered to methanogenic microorganisms. These organic compounds such as sugars and amino acids are released from plant material at different rates depending on their availability. A portion of the compounds are readily soluble in water and are immediately available, some of the compounds are locked up inside the plant cells and some of the compounds such as cellulose are not soluble and need to be hydrolysed into sugars before they can be converted into methane. Hydrolysis is usually the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion. Leaching of green waste was investigated as a form of pre-treatment to externalise the initial stages in anaerobic digestion that makes soluble organic compounds available for the consecutive mthanogenic stages of anaerobic digestion. The added benefit of leaching is it removes the complexity of solids handling from inside anaerobic digester. Many various forms of leaching technologies that are coupled to anaerobic digesters have been trialled with grass and silage, little research was found on leaching green waste and few trials had used the simplified unheated flooded tank system as tested here. Pilot and laboratory leaching trials were conducted on <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> as well as grass clippings to establish the efficiency of leaching by measuring the COD yields in the leachate. Additionally, rumen contents from cattle rumen were added to grass clippings in order to investigate if the leaching efficiency from the grass could be improved. Leaching was tested at a pilot scale in an open to the air reactor tank in ambient temperature in a temperate climate. Hydraulic retention times ranging from 4 hours to 7 days were tested to establish the most effective leaching strategy. The laboratory trials were conducted with the temperature controlled at 25 °C to simulate ambient environmental conditions in a temperate climate. The effect of storing feedstock was tested to see how changes in handling times affected the process. Gas production from the leachate was tested using 2 L CSTR (Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor) anaerobic digesters to confirm the usability of the leachate as a feedstock in an anaerobic digester. Pilot scale trials of <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass clippings gave maximum COD concentrations of 5. 4 ± 0. 5 and 47 ± 4 g COD / L of leachate respectively. Pilot trials of <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass leachate reached a maximum total COD yields of 53 ± 2 and 410 ± 20 kg COD / tonne VS respectively. Laboratory scale trials of <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass clippings gave maximum COD concentrations of 7. 0 ± 0. 1 and 49 ± 2 g COD / L of leachate respectively. Laboratory trials of <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass leachate reached a maximum total COD yields of 132 ± 8 and 410 ± 20 kg COD / tonne VS respectively. Laboratory trials are indicative of how pilot trials will behave and differences are likely to be due to an increased bulk density in solids in pilot trials. <b>Shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass leachate gave maximum 3. 7 and 7. 8 g BOD / L respectively. Nutrients in the leachate were tested: nitrogen levels in <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass leachate reached maximum levels of 51 and 460 mg / L respectively; DRP (Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus) levels in the <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass leachate reached maximum levels of 6 and 85 mg / L respectively. The leaching tanks produced gas while leaching was taking place; a sample of this gas was captured and the levels of CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 were measured as 0 %, 25. 5 % and 5. 0 % respectively. Gas production from anaerobic digestion of <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> and grass in a CSTR at 35 °C produced 0. 23 ± 0. 01 and 0. 534 ± 0. 005 m 3 biogas / kg COD respectively. Use of grass that is fresh gives much higher yields of dissolved organic compounds in the leachate than when the grass is stored in covered area for 30 days. Leaching grass with an HRT (Hydraulic Retention Time) of 1 day gave optimal results in terms of concentration and yields of dissolved organic compounds in the leachate compared to leaching trials with an HRT of 4 hours or 7 days. Green waste gave much lower concentration and yields of COD than grass and an HRT of 7 days was the most suitable for gaining the best concentration and yield of dissolved organic compounds compared to a 4 hour or 1 day HRT. The overall mass transfer of organic compounds when leaching freshly <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> is most likely limited by a combination of hydrolysis and the rate that soluble compounds are released from within plant cells as the cell membranes degrade. In trials of fresh and stored grass and stored <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste,</b> shortening the HRT increases the total yield of dissolved organic compounds leached into the leachate; however, this is at the expense of increased concentrations of dissolved organic compounds within the leachate. The lower leachate concentrations with the shorter HRTs means that the leachate is less suitable to uses as a feedstock for an anaerobic digester. Anaerobic digestion of grass leachate produced much more biogas / kg COD than anaerobic digestion of <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> leachate, this may be a result of an inhibiting compounds such as tannins, additionally to this the material that the <b>shredded</b> green <b>waste</b> is composed of will have higher levels of lignocellulose materials that are not readily soluble. The leachate was found not to degrade when stored at 25 °C in an open top container, this maybe a result of low pH inhibiting degrading micro-organisms, this has significant benefit as the leaching process can be separated from the anaerobic digestion process without degrading the quality of the leachate while it is being stored...|$|R

The drain down value decreases with an increase in plastic content and the value is only 0. 09 % at 10 % plastic content and proves to be an effective stabilizing additive in SMA mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Recycling and reuse {{of waste}} {{materials}} for various civil engineering applications will not only ease problems associated with their disposal but also help preserve dwindling granular materials. In this study, a composite material made up of <b>shredded</b> <b>waste</b> tires and sand is proposed as a fill material {{in the construction of}} reinforced retaining walls and reinforced embankments. Accordingly, the pullout resistance of different reinforcements (ribbed metal strip, geogrid, and ladder-type metal) embedded in sand is obtained. In addition, the shear strength characteristics of the mixtures are obtained. Three sizes of tire shreds equal to 9. 5 mm in nominal size, and 50 – 100 mm and 100 – 200 mm in length are considered. Different mixing ratios of tire shreds in the mixtures are evaluated in the study. For test conditions considered in the study, the pullout resistance factors of metal strips, ladder-type metal, and geogrid reinforcements are proposed. The shear strength of tire shred-sand mixtures in terms of friction angle is found to be in the range 30 °– 33 ° in comparison to the end-of-test friction angle for clean Ottawa sand equal to 32 °...|$|R
