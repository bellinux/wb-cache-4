Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted {{back to the top}} flight in unusual circumstances. Sunderland lost to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated {{on the final day of}} the following season.|$|E

25|$|Wexford, {{particularly}} the baronies of Bargy and Forth, <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most heavy concentrations of medieval English settlements in Ireland. This area was {{once known as}} the 'Wexford Pale'. An old dialect of English, known as Yola, was spoken uniquely in Wexford up until the 19th century.

25|$|After {{the second}} World War, sentimental depictions of ghosts were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which was later adapted to {{television}} with a successful 1968–70 TV series. Genuine psychological horror films {{from this period}} include 1944's The Uninvited, and 1945's Dead of Night. The film Blithe Spirit, based on a play by Noël Coward, was also produced in this period. 1963 <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first major adaptations of a ghost novel, The Haunting, based on the well known novel The Haunting of Hill House.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Paraguay {{at the time}} was not {{completely}} isolated, Francia welcomed political refugees from various countries. José Artigas, hero of Uruguay's independence, was given asylum in 1820 along with 200 of his men. He stayed in Paraguay even after Francia's death on a pension of $30 a month. He was pursued by Francisco Ramírez, who <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his warships also desert to Paraguay. In 1820, Francia ordered that runaway slaves were to be given refuge and refugees from Corrientes were to have canoes and land. In 1839, a whole company of Brazilian deserters were welcomed. Many ex-slaves were also sent to guard the penal colony of Tevego.|$|E

After briefly exploring the land south of present-day St. Augustine, the expedition sailed south to the bottom of the Florida peninsula, through the Florida Keys, and up the west coast as far north as Charlotte Harbor, where they briefly skirmished with the Calusa before heading back to Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|The British Indian territories gained {{independence}} in 1947, after being partitioned into the Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. Following the controversial division of pre-partition Punjab and Bengal, rioting broke out between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in these provinces and spread to several {{other parts of}} India, leaving some 500,000 dead. Also, this period <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern history, {{with a total of}} 12million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively).

25|$|While {{maintaining}} {{his university}} position, Sim also taught private pupils and later founded {{and ran his}} own drama school for children in Edinburgh. This developed his skills as a director and occasional actor. One of his pupils, Naomi Merlith Plaskitt, aged twelve when they met, became his wife six years later. The dramatist John Drinkwater <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Sim's productions for the school and encouraged {{him to become a}} professional actor. Through Drinkwater's influence, Sim was cast in his first professional production, Othello at the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1930; he understudied the three principal male roles (played by Paul Robeson, Maurice Browne and Ralph Richardson) and played the small role of the messenger.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinion of}} the Everest {{climbing}} community began to challenge the location Odell claimed to have seen the two climbers. Many thought the Second Step, if not unclimbable, was at least not climbable in the five minutes Odell says he <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two surmount it. Based on their position, both Odell and Norton believed that Mallory and Irvine had {{made it to the}} summit, with Odell sharing this belief with the newspapers after the expedition. The expedition report was presented to Martin Conway, a prominent politician and mountaineer, who expressed the opinion that the summit had been reached. Conway's opinion was based on their location on the mountain and Mallory's exceptional mountaineering skill.|$|E

25|$|During Blair's 10 {{years in}} office there were 40 {{successive}} quarters of economic growth, lasting until {{the second quarter of}} 2008, helped by Labour's decision to keep taxes relatively low and abandon traditional Labour policies, including public ownership of industries and utilities. GDP growth, which had briefly reached 4% per year in the early 1990s, gently declining thereafter, was relatively anaemic compared to prior decades, such as the 6.5% per year peak in the early 1970s, although growth was smoother and more consistent. Annual growth rates averaged 2.68% between 1992 and 2007, with the finance sector accounting for a greater part than previously. The period <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the highest economic growth rates of major developed economies and the strongest of any European nation.|$|E
25|$|The Caledon Bay {{crisis of}} 1932–34 <b>saw</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last {{incidents}} of violent interaction on the 'frontier' of indigenous and non-indigenous Australia, which {{began when the}} spearing of Japanese poachers who had been molesting Yolngu women {{was followed by the}} killing of a policeman. As the crisis unfolded, national opinion swung behind the Aboriginal people involved, and the first appeal on behalf of an Indigenous Australian to the High Court of Australia was launched. Following the crisis, the anthropologist Donald Thomson was dispatched by the government to live among the Yolngu. Elsewhere around this time, activists like Sir Douglas Nicholls were commencing their campaigns for Aboriginal rights within the established Australian political system and the age of frontier conflict closed.|$|E

The series was almost a German benefit that season as the main contenders were the Porsche 935s and BMW 3-litre CSLs (common known as the 'Batmobiles'). Porsche had had {{the upper hand in}} the opening rounds of the series, but at Silverstone things were different. John Fitzpatrick and Tom Walkinshaw kept their BMW ahead to win by 197 yards (1.18secs) from the Bob Wollek/Hans Heyer Porsche 935 Turbo. Third was a Porsche 934 Turbo in the hands of Leo Kinnunen and Egon Evertz.|$|E
