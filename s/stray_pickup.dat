40|$|Since the Galactic {{center is}} ~ 1000 times {{brighter}} than {{fluctuations in the}} Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), CMB experiments must carefully account for <b>stray</b> Galactic <b>pickup.</b> We present the level of contamination due to sidelobes for the year one CMB maps produced by the WMAP observatory. For each radiometer, full 4 pi sr antenna gain patterns are determined {{from a combination of}} numerical prediction, ground-based and space-based measurements. These patterns are convolved with the WMAP year one sky maps and observatory scan pattern to generate expected sidelobe signal contamination, for both intensity and polarized microwave sky maps. Outside of the Galactic plane, we find rms values for the expected sidelobe pickup of 15, 2. 1, 2. 0, 0. 3, 0. 5 uK for K, Ka, Q, V, and W bands respectively. Except at K band, the rms polarized contamination is << 1 uK. Angular power spectra of the Galactic pickup are presented.

40|$|Stray {{cats are}} a common feature of urban landscapes and are {{associated}} with issues of animal welfare and negative environmental impacts. Management, planning and decision-making require readily accessible information on stray cats. However, much of the existing data is not immediately useful for a geographic information system (GIS) in terms of format, content and explicit location information. Spreadsheets we obtained from a single large shelter in the Auckland region. They contained records of <b>stray</b> cat <b>pickups</b> and admissions {{for an entire year}} (n = 8573) of which 56. 4 % (n = 4834) contained data that could be processed to derive relevant spatial information. The resulting data consisted of identified roads and areas of Auckland where the stray cats were found. Published census databases and shapefiles were matched with the data to build a GIS of stray cats. Global and local regression analysis was employed to discover spatial distribution characteristics including the identification of areas with relatively high and low concentrations of stray cats and to explore relationships between socioeconomic condition and stray cat density. Significant clustering is more evident in South Auckland than elsewhere in the region. Specific geographical information is valuable, not only for understanding population dynamics of stray cats, but also to allow spatial and temporal targeting of resources to minimise their impact and promote responsible ownership...|$|R
40|$|Op amps {{are very}} high gain {{amplifiers}} with differential inputs and single-ended outputs. They are often used in high precision analog circuits, so {{it is important to}} measure their performance accurately. But in open-loop measurements their high open-loop gain, which may be as great as 107 or more, makes it very hard to avoid errors from very small voltages at the amplifier input due to <b>pickup,</b> <b>stray</b> currents, or the Seebeck (thermocouple) effect. The measurement process can be greatly simplified by using a servo loop to force a null at the amplifier input, thus allowing the amplifier under test to essentially measure its own errors. Figure 1 shows a versatile circuit that employs this principle, employing an auxiliary op amp as an integrator to establish a stable loop with very high dc open-loop gain. The switches facilitate performance of the various tests described in the simplified illustrations that follow. Figure 1. Basic op amp measurement circuit. The circuit of Figure 1 minimizes most of the measurement errors and permits accurate measurements {{of a large number of}} dc—and a few ac—parameters. The additional "auxiliary " op amp does not nee...|$|R
