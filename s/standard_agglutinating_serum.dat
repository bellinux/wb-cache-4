40|$|Agglutination by {{monovalent}} serum is {{the method}} customarily employed {{to establish the}} type diagnosis of meningococcus. The test is simple and, in certain of its modifications, quite rapid. It is even applied by some bacteriologists directly to any gram-negative diplococci encountered in primary culture of the upper respiratory tract before their species has been determined by sugar fermentation tests. Re-examination of all phases of the method seemed, therefore, to be warranted. This was done {{in a series of}} experiments recently carried out, the results of which are described below, together with some data bearing on the subject of agglutinin-production gathered from a long series of experiments that-have been in progress for a number of years.

40|$|Currently, the {{laboratory}} diagnosis of typhoid fever {{is dependent upon}} either the isolation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhi from a clinical sample or the detection of raised titers of <b>agglutinating</b> <b>serum</b> antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (O) or flagellum (H) antigens of serotype Typhi (the Widal test). In this study, the serum antibody responses to the LPS and flagellum antigens of serotype Typhi were investigated with individuals from a region of Vietnam in which typhoid is endemic, and their usefulness for the diagnosis of typhoid fever was evaluated. The antibody responses to both antigens were highly variable among individuals infected with serotype Typhi, and elevated antibody titers were also detected in {{a high proportion of}} serum samples from healthy subjects from the community. In-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of specific classes of anti-LPS and antiflagellum antibodies were compared with other serologically based tests for the diagnosis of typhoid fever (Widal TO and TH, anti-serotype Typhi immunoglobulin M [IgM] dipstick, and IDeaL TUBEX). At a specificity of > or = 0. 93, the sensitivities of the different tests were 0. 75, 0. 55, and 0. 52 for the anti-LPS IgM, IgG, and IgA ELISAs, respectively; 0. 28 for the antiflagellum IgG ELISA; 0. 47 and 0. 32 for the Widal TO and TH tests, respectively; and 0. 77 for the anti-serotype Typhi IgM dipstick assay.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of anti-IgG antibodies (rheumatoid factors, RF) in body fluids (sera, synovial fluids and aqueous humor) selected from 62 normal and 275 diseased dogs was studied. Fluids were assayed by canine versions of <b>standard</b> <b>agglutinating</b> and/or precipitating RF assays with routine application in human practice. The number of RF detected by dog IgG-coated particles was substantially higher by {{latex fixation test}} (LFT) than by modified Rose-Waaler (RW) test (61 / 144 vs. 14 / 144). This did not result from false positives by LFT since latex activity was completely inhibited by aggregated dog IgG. Some evidence is presented indicating that results obtained by standard RW in particular, but also those obtained by standard LFT, might be improved by modifying testing conditions currently used. Body fluids were further studied {{for the presence of}} precipitins to aggregated dog IgG in 0. 6 % agarose (gel precipitation test (GPT)). The frequency of RF was higher by GPT than by LFT, both in normal control fluids (for sera 26 / 52 vs. 19 / 52) and patient material (for sera 135 / 197 vs. 95 / 197). Thus, the canine RF appear to be a serum component with an unexpectedly high frequency in both normal and diseased dogs, but grossly underestimated by the recommended routine RF assays based on agglutination. The GPT, which combines a superior detection rate of theoretically also agglutinating RF with an inability to detect RF quantitatively, seems an ideal RF ‘indicator’ test to dictate improvements to the quantitative LFT/RW assays so as to facilitate RF detection at clinically relevant concentrations.

The antibody evaluation has been performed with different fish species, and is considered a reliable method {{that can be applied}} to confirm several hypothesis regarding acquired immunity, even in conjunction with precise methods to describe immune mechanisms. In order to provide appropriate analytical methods for future studies on the specific immune system of native fish, the present study standardized on assay to measure the <b>serum</b> <b>agglutinating</b> antibody titer produced after immunization with inactivated A. hydrophila and levamisole administration in pacu. It was possible to determine the agglutinating antibodies titer in a satisfactorily way in pacu immunized with inactive A. hydrophila, and the highest titers were observed on fish fed with levamisole...|$|R
40|$|The {{soluble antigen}} of myxoma is a heat-labile protein {{which has an}} isoelectric point near pH 4. 5 and is precipitated from half {{saturated}} solutions of ammonium sulfate. It can be partially purified by methods of differential precipitation based on variations in the pH and electrolyte concentration. Rabbits receiving the labile, soluble substance of myxoma develop homologous precipitins and their <b>serum</b> <b>agglutinates</b> elementary bodies of myxoma, provided the dermal pulp from which the bodies are obtained contains the soluble substance; neutralizing antibodies do not appear, however, and the animals are not resistant to infection with the virus of myxoma. Elementary bodies of myxoma {{appear to have a}} heat-stable agglutinogen that operates when brought in contact with serum from animals recovered from myxoma, but little, if at all, when in contact with anti-soluble substance serum...|$|R
40|$|Twenty two {{patients}} were followed {{up for a}} mean of 10. 7 years after acute yersinia arthritis. Their clinical course, agglutination antibodies, antibodies against plasmid coded yersinia proteins, and laboratory parameters of inflammation were analysed. The clinical findings were unremarkable. <b>Serum</b> <b>agglutinating</b> antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica were not found in any patient. Ten patients had no antibodies against plasmid coded bacterial proteins. Five patients showed IgG antibodies, one patient had an IgA and IgG result of questionable significance, and six patients had IgA and IgG antibodies in the immunoblot reaction. No evidence of systemic inflammation was found. The persistence of IgA or IgG antibodies, or both, {{did not have a}} discernible influence on the clinical course. The development of erosive changes in the sacroiliac joints occurred independently of yersinia infection...|$|R
40|$|A {{specific}} agglutination of Plasmodium knowlesi detectable both by macroscopic and by microscopic methods is described. Agglutinins for Plasmodium knowlesi {{appear in}} the sera of monkeys between 15 and 45 days after {{the onset of the}} infection and become progressively stronger as the malarial infection gradually subsides. Agglutinins persist in the sera of chronically infected animals for a year or longer. The sera of animals which have been repeatedly superinfected agglutinate parasites at dilutions as high as 1 : 1, 000. Sera from normal monkeys, from monkeys acutely ill with malaria, and from monkeys chronically infected with a different species of malarial parasite (Plasmodium inui) do not agglutinate Plasmodium knowlesi. Immune <b>serum</b> <b>agglutinates</b> mature intracellular or extracellular parasites but does not agglutinate unparasitized cells or cells containing immature parasites. The relation of these observations to the mechanism of active and passive immunity in monkey malaria is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{agglutination}} with antiserum against lateral flagella (H-agglutination) for {{the identification}} of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was studied. Sucrose-negative bacteria were isolated from seawater, and their characterization {{was carried out by}} traditional biological tests and slide agglutination with antiserum specific to lateral flagella of V. parahaemolyticus. Of 135 strains isolated, 78 were identified as V. parahaemolyticus by biological tests and were agglutinated with the above serum. Fifty-five strains did not <b>agglutinate</b> with the <b>serum,</b> and their biological characteristics were different from those of V. parahaemolyticus. Two strains also differed from V. parahaemolyticus in some biological characteristics but agglutinated with the antiserum. All clinically isolated V. parahaemolyticus strains also agglutinated with the above serum. These results suggest that our serological method is useful for {{the identification of}} V. parahaemolyticus, especially for samples in which there are many organisms related to V. parahaemolyticus, because many biological tests can be omitted...|$|R
40|$|Intraperitoneal {{injection}} of slime glycolipoprotein (GLP) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced leukopenia {{and death of}} mice, similar {{to the effect of}} infection with viable organisms. Differential counts established that the leukopenia was characterized by a {{decrease in the number of}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by death of mice. Mice immunized with GLP survived challenge and responded with a leukocytosis that had a substantial increase in circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukocytes from GLP-injected mice were <b>agglutinated</b> by anti-GLP <b>serum,</b> indicating an association between GLP and leukocytes. Other results indicated that 14 C-labeled GLP is deposited mainly in the liver. Normal leukocytes labeled with 51 Cr were injected intravenously into mice receiving an intraperitoneal {{injection of}} GLP. As with GLP, the 51 Gr-labeled leukocytes were sequestered in the liver. These results indicate that GLP enters the blood stream and becomes associated mainly with neutrophils, and that the neutrophil-GLP complex is deposited in the liver, possibly accounting for the leukopenia in mice...|$|R

Development of specific reagents for seven serological factors. J. Bacteriol. 84 : 735 – 741. 1962 —Fluorescent antibody reagents for identifying seven antigenic factors of staphylococci have been prepared. The fluorescent staining reactions of these reagents were compared to the agglutination reactions with diagnostic cultures of coagulase-positive staphylococci. Correlation between the two serological tests was almost complete with factors a, b, i, and k. The c fluorescent antibody reagent had a somewhat broader spectrum of activity than the corresponding agglutination serum, whereas the m fluorescent antibody reagent stained fewer strains than were <b>agglutinated</b> in m <b>serum.</b> The fluorescent antibody reagent for h factor stained strains possessing h 1 factor but not strains possessing only h 2 factor. Fluorescent antibody reagents for specific staphylococcal factors did not stain strains of group A streptococci...|$|R
