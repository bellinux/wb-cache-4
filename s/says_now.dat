500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen <b>says</b> <b>now</b> that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I felt I could never admit a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... I have learned a great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Arthur and Zelena {{return to}} Camelot, Arthur {{wants to come}} up with a plan of action, with Arthur telling her that they would have to go to a place called DunBroch. Over in DunBroch, Merida puts a flower on her father’s grave and tells him she saved the boys and proved she’s fit to be queen. She <b>says</b> <b>now</b> it’s even harder since she has to rule and her father made it look easy. She says she wishes he was here so she could ask him how he did it. Her mother is there and says her father is always with her then says she misses him too. She tells Merida it’s not a day for sadness since she’s got her coronation. They leave the grave of King Fergus.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kat has a {{one-night stand}} with Mark Garland as Alfie is showing no {{interest}} in her. An insider said: [...] "The trouble is that while Alfie is busy playing that game, a delivery driver who calls at the Queen Vic makes a big play for Kat – and soon she's facing serious temptation." [...] The insider added: [...] "Kat is vulnerable, insecure and at odds with Alfie. It's {{exactly the sort of}} state that could see her do something very stupid indeed. Alfie has done serious damage to their marriage but Kat could destroy it completely." [...] Another source added: [...] "In accusing her of cheating on him, Alfie has undone years of good work in building up Kat's self-esteem. No matter what he <b>says</b> <b>now,</b> she feels as though he still sees her as a woman of loose morals. He cooks up a hare-brained plan to keep Kat by treating her mean – and starts ignoring her, basically." ...|$|E

2500|$|A tired-looking Nixon {{spoke with}} a quavering voice, {{delivering}} what {{was described as a}} [...] "15-minute monologue." [...] He spent most of the talk criticizing the press, his remarks interrupted only by brief interjections from reporters, though he acknowledged well into his remarks that the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 did not allow his campaign to get his message across during the final two weeks in his election bid. Nixon began his remarks stating that [...] "now that {{all the members of the}} press are so delighted that I have lost, I'd like to make a statement of my own." [...] Nixon insisted that the press had attacked him since 1948 following the Alger Hiss case. He accused the press of printing articles supporting their favored candidates, stating that they should [...] "give... the shaft" [...] to future candidates, but should have [...] "one lonely reporter on the campaign who will report what the candidate <b>says</b> <b>now</b> and then". Nixon reserved praise for Carl Greenberg of The Los Angeles Times who he felt [...] "wrote every word I said". Also praised was Edwin Tetlow of The Daily Telegraph of London.|$|E
2500|$|I later learned, {{a copy of}} my {{personal}} credit report– with detailed information about my bank accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number– had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union. The sham company that received it, [...] "Educational Funding Services" [...] of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop {{a few blocks from}} Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys [...] "had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them." [...] He <b>says</b> <b>now,</b> [...] "These are vicious people. These are vipers." [...] Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. … [...] After that, however, an attorney subpoenaed me, while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). [...] A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me– an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained {{my personal}} phone records. [...] Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME's lawyers as [...] "proof" [...] of my bias against Scientology.|$|E
