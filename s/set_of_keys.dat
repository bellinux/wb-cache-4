Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor directs Amy to write the note {{that led him to}} Craig's house, using a red pen in his jacket; she rummages around and finds the {{engagement}} ring from her husband-to-be, Rory, whom she had forgotten after he was consumed by the crack in space and time and erased from existence. A similar crack appears behind Craig's refrigerator, and widens.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other thumbstick or another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b> These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} information theory to identify <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> players in social networks. First, we define two entropy measures that we use to analyze the structural properties of a social network. Then, we propose a new method aimed at finding a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> players that solves the KPP-Neg and KPP-Pos problems. Our preliminary experimental {{results indicate that the}} entropy measures can be used effectively to identify a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> players in a social network...|$|R

He returned for his Isuzu the following day, with a second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both {{consistent}} hashing and rendezvous hashing {{have the}} essential property that removal or addition of one node changes only the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> {{owned by the}} nodes with adjacent IDs, and leaves all other nodes unaffected. Contrast this with a traditional hash table in which addition or removal of one bucket causes nearly the entire keyspace to be remapped. Since any change in ownership typically corresponds to bandwidth-intensive movement of objects stored in the DHT from one node to another, minimizing such reorganization is required to efficiently support high rates of churn (node arrival and failure).|$|E

25|$|While being {{deported}} to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner {{as it was}} turning onto a taxiway at New York's JFK International Airport. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes {{and pick up a}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a Mac's Milk, he was apprehended by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing in line at the ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.|$|E
25|$|Cuckoo hashing, another {{technique}} for implementing hash tables, guarantees constant time per lookup (regardless of the hash function). Insertions into a cuckoo hash table may fail, causing the entire table to be rebuilt, but such failures are sufficiently {{unlikely that the}} expected time per insertion (using either a truly random hash function or a hash function with logarithmic independence) is constant. With tabulation hashing, on the other hand, the best bound known on the failure probability is higher, high enough that insertions cannot be guaranteed to take constant expected time. Nevertheless, tabulation hashing is adequate to ensure the linear-expected-time construction of a cuckoo hash table for a static <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> that does not change as the table is used.|$|E
25|$|Priesthood {{keys are}} conferred upon all {{the presidents of}} the quorums. A quorum is a group of priesthood holders who hold the same priesthood office. For a priesthood holder to {{exercise}} ecclesiastical power or authority, Latter Day Saints believe that a priesthood holder must have a specific <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> or be authorized by one who holds those keys. Thus, even though a priesthood holder is called and ordained with general priesthood power, to formally lead others in the church or to conduct specific rites may also require specific keys not held by all priesthood holders. The existence of keys makes possible a church hierarchy, in which particular priesthood holders specialize in a particular ecclesiastical function organized in a top-down manner.|$|E
40|$|Tries are data {{structures}} for representing <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> string <b>keys.</b> Although tries {{can be readily}} adapted to represent unrestricted <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> the analysis <b>of</b> tries built from sets that include prefixing keys (which are keys that are prefixes <b>of</b> other <b>keys</b> in the set) appears to have remained untouched until now. The exact expectations {{of the time and}} space requirements of the retrieval algorithms of several trie varieties built from unrestricted finite <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> are computed in this paper. We present a unified approach to the derivation of these expectations which are computed with respect to a probabilistic model that takes into account sample sets containing prefixing keys...|$|R

25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys,</b> which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E
