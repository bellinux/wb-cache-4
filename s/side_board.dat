The couch had a sort of <b>side</b> <b>board,</b> which passed along the front side of it, and which was higher somewhat than the one forming the front of the berth. This board was made movable, so that it could be shifted from the front to the back side, and vice versa, at pleasure. By putting this <b>side</b> <b>board</b> back, the place became a sort of sofa or couch, and it was usually in this state during the day; but by bringing it forward, which was done at night, it became a berth, and one somewhat larger and more comfortable than the permanent berths on the other side.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of wood polymeric system are {{defined in terms}} of viscous elastic materials. These properties have an impact on relaxation processes for both wooden specimens and wooden articles. In this paper the method of estimation of dynamic modulus of elasticity and coefficient of damping based on resonance vibration is presented. All sorts of trees by wood structure may be classified into leaf and coniferous tree. The structure of wood determines their different properties. Therefore in many cases leafy and coniferous trees are used in different purposes. Spruce (coniferous tree) and oak (leaf tree) wood specimens have been used in the investigation and the viscous elastic properties of these wood types were compared together. The specimens were sawn from three places of central and <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> and they were relatively called “butt-end”, “center ” and “top-end”. It was found that modulus of elasticity in central and <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> of oak and spruce varied conversely – in center of oak boards the modulus of elasticity is highest, in center of spruce boards the modulus of elasticity is lowest. The coefficient of damping in both central and <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> of oak and <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> of spruce varied analogically...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The work {{presented}} in this paper deals with the use of green gluing (also known as wet gluing) as a mean to overcome the difficulties in making use of <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> for structural applications. By manufacturing laminated beams from unseasoned <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> several advantages are obtained. Beams were manufactured from <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> of approximately 25 mm thickness. The board width was 120 mm. The boards were glued together with a 1 -component polyurethane adhesive to form a beam cross-section of approximately 120 × 315 mm 2. After curing, the beams were split into two halves, each approximately 55 mm wide. These 55 × 315 mm 2 beams were then dried in a conventional kiln dryer. Finally, the beams were planed to target size, 50 × 300 mm 2. Tests performed included beam bending tests for strength and stiffness, tests of the shape stability of the beams, tests of the integrity of the adhesive bond lines (delamination) and tests on the strength and fracture energy of the adhesive bond lines. The main results obtained show that there is a potential for the production of green-glued laminated beams with good technical performance...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of dynamic excitation as a method for stiffness and strength grading of wet <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> of narrow dimensions. The need for such an investigation has previously been identified in an ongoing research project in which the possibility to use <b>side</b> <b>boards</b> as lamellae in wet glued glulam beams is investigated.      The assessment of the dynamic excitation method was carried out by means of experimental work and measurements [...] The approach was quantitative {{in the sense that the}} data was collected through experiments performed on a rather large population and that the results were analyzed using statistical methods.      To investigate the effect of moisture content on stiffness of narrow dimension, <b>side</b> <b>boards,</b> the stiffness was measured in three states: - in wet state, before splitting the boards, - in wet state, after splitting the boards, and - in dry state (splitted boards).      The conclusion, after calculations and analysis of all the results, was that the natural frequency and stiffness of wet boards could, with a high degree of reliability, be predicted by use of the dynamic excitation method. There was a strong correlation in stiffness between wet state split boards and dry state split boards, with a coefficient of determination of 0. 93...|$|R

40|$|Transport of {{commercial}} broiler chickens {{from the farm}} to the processing plant is perceived to compromise welfare under some circumstances. Research has been conducted using European standard equipment to characterize the environment experienced by poultry during broiler transport. In contrast no studies have been reported on the environment experienced by broilers under United States standard industry practices during transport. Moreover, microenvironment temperatures within industry trailers have not been reported. The present study characterized the thermal micro-environment experienced by broiler chickens during transport across different seasons. The temperatures were influenced by temperature mitigation practices (plastic wrap, double <b>side</b> <b>board,</b> single <b>side</b> <b>board,</b> open side, and heat mitigation) and by ambient temperatures. Temperatures measured within transporters {{were found to have}} less variation compared to studies using other transport systems. Temperatures were found to decrease (p= 0. 05) for the second half of transport duration during low ambient conditions (- 16. 4 to 2. 80 0 C). For moderate ambient conditions (6. 22 to 23. 35 0 C) significant (p= 0. 05) yet small (3 ̆c 2 oC) changes in temperature were seen. For transport within high ambient temperature ranges (29. 05 to 40. 14 0 C) an increase (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in temperature was seen from the first to second half of transport duration. While temperature mitigation practices do provide improved thermal environments compared to that of ambient conditions, improvements are still needed. Further research is needed to develop new mitigation practices at high (29. 05 to 40. 14 0 C) and low (- 16. 4 to 2. 80 0 C) ambient temperatures. Research is also needed to expand current indexes that consider the effects of temperature, humidity, air velocity, and duration to ensure welfare is not compromised by the transport environments experienced by poultry...|$|E
