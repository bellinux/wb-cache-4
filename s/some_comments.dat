5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the game}} has been positive. The average score in Metacritic is of 82 out of 100. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 36/40, earning the magazine's Platinum award and becoming the highest-ranking review score that week. The reviewers were generally positive about their experience: despite <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> about a lack of polish in environments, the game's character design, aesthetics, gameplay and story all came in for general praise, with multiple reviewers calling it a worthy part of the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s Nevinson {{painted a}} number of cityscapes in London, Paris and New York which were {{generally}} well received. The most notable of these is The Strand by Night from 1937. His post-war work generally included landscapes in a more naturalist style. His large painting of 1932 and 1933, The Twentieth Century used futurist devices to attack Fascism and Nazism. He also produced large historic allegories which were considered inferior to his World War One paintings. Kenneth Clark, then the Director of the National Gallery, made <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on these lines and, in return, Nevinson became a fierce critic of Clark. Nevinson was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur in 1938 and was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate in}} the cricketing world as to whether this {{constitutes}} poor sportsmanship or good-humoured banter. Sledging is sometimes interpreted as abuse, and it is acknowledged <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> aimed as sledges do sometimes cross the line into personal abuse, however, {{this is not always}} the case. Sledging can sometimes be a humorous attempt at distraction. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh referred to the practice as 'mental disintegration'.|$|E
25|$|The Letter {{begins by}} Rousseau {{establishing}} the respect {{he has for}} his friend D'Alembert. But after quoting a passage from D'Alembert's letter, Rousseau writes that {{it is imperative to}} discuss the potential disasters that a theatre could bring. He also responds to <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> D'Alembert makes praising the tolerance of the Geneva clergy while criticizing the intolerance of French Roman Catholicism. Rousseau is, however, reluctant to engage this discussion in depth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>comments</b> by Ottawa speaker Andrew J. Blackbird “…in {{which he}} recalls his father Mackadepenessy ‘making his own {{alphabet}} {{which he called}} ‘Paw-pa-pe-po’” and teaching it to other Ottawas from the L'Arbre Croche village on the Lower Peninsula of Michigan have been interpreted as suggesting use of a syllabic writing system by Ottawas earlier in the nineteenth century, although Blackbird was not himself a user of the script. Blackbird’s Ottawa writings use a mixture of French and English-based characteristics, but not those of Great Lakes script. There are no known Odawa texts written in the script.|$|E

25|$|According to Human Rights Watch {{annual report}} 2016, Emirates {{authorities}} forcibly disappeared and detained people who criticized {{the government or}} its allies. February 2015, Human Rights Watch documented {{a case in which}} three Emirati sisters, Asma, Mariam, and Al Yazzyah al-Suweidi, were forcibly disappeared by Emirates authorities. They released them without charge after spending 3 months in incommunicado detention. The three sisters had arrested after posting comments criticizing government for arresting their brother Dr. Issa al-Suweidi. In August 2015, Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith was arrested after posting <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on social media in which he criticized the mass killing of Rab'a protesters in Cairo in 2013. Bin Ghaith's fate still unknown at time of writing.|$|E
25|$|The {{public in}} Boston and Lowell {{continued}} to attribute Kinney and Freeman's deaths to Hanson despite the court declaring her not guilty, and rumors had {{even begun to}} attribute the death of Freeman's father to Hanson as well. Hanson's father-in-law, Mr. Freeman had died suddenly while Hanson and Freeman had been visiting him following their wedding. In 1841, Kinney published her autobiography, A Review of the Principal Events of the Last Ten Years in the Life of Mrs. Hannah Kinney: Together with <b>Some</b> <b>Comments</b> upon the Late Trial, Written by Herself to combat rumors of her guilt. In response, her ex-husband Ward Witham, published a biography of Hannah, entitled Life of Mrs. H. Kinney, for Twenty Years in 1842. He accused her of adultery and slander, but publicize an opinion on the murder trial.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps having extra time, Brasseur de Bourbourg began a {{programme}} {{of research}} {{of the history of}} the archdiocese of Quebec, and in particular of its 17th-century founder, François de Laval, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec (after whom the seminary's later incarnation as a University, the Université Laval, is named). The results of his archival investigations were published during early 1846 as a biography of Laval. The contents of this pamphlet seemed to displease his Canadian colleagues somewhat, for a dispute began which made his job there uncertain, or at least uncomfortable. Also, he apparently disliked the harsh winter climate (to judge by <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> he made in the dedication of his later History of Canada), and may also have been a factor in his departure which was soon to ensue.|$|E

25|$|Addenda and {{corrigenda}} sheet issued with Italy 1915–1919, Falls commissioned for {{the volume}} 1939 but resigned to take job with The Times {{and replaced by}} Wynne. Draft chapters circulated and received strenuous objections from General Sir Hubert Gough to being blamed for failures, noting that GHQ had planned much of the offensive and should receive {{a share of the}} blame. Wynne rewrote certain passages, adding <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> from Gough; Edmonds, Wynne and Gough corresponded during the writing which Wynne finished in 1946. Edmonds rewrote parts in 1948, correcting in a fourth draft what he judged to be errors by Wynne who declined to be named as author of the work. for reason of economy, there was no map case, large maps were supplied in a folder on the back cover.

25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1900s through the 1960s, {{mechanical}} calculators dominated the desktop computing market (see History of computing hardware). Major suppliers in the USA included Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. (<b>Some</b> <b>comments</b> about European calculators follow below.) These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were full — each digit {{that could be}} entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.)One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, {{as well as some}} rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as Olivetti, did make printing calculators.|$|E

500|$|When Miller {{pitched the}} show to the various networks, network {{executives}} compared the series to New Amsterdam. [...] New Amsterdam, a short-lived drama which aired on Fox in 2008, featured a 400-year-old male NYPD detective and a female partner. [...] Miller stated {{that he had not}} heard about the series until he read <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on an industry website. [...] Television critics also took notice of the similarities between New Amsterdam and Forever. USA Todays Robert Bianco thought that Forever took a [...] "smarter, lighter approach to the subject" [...] of immortality than New Amsterdam did. [...] Lowery, Roush, and Busis all noted the similarities between the two series in their reviews of Forever.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway gave <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on the {{phenomenon}} to Wired reporter Adam Rogers. Before they hung up, Rogers warned him, [...] "your tomorrow {{will not be}} the same". Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of what was about to happen. Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} track ends, the song moves into avant-garde territory, with Yoko Ono reciting some prose over an unknown, vaguely operatic {{recording}} (possibly captured {{live from the}} radio). Ono's piece begins with the words [...] "Maybe, it's not that…", with her voice trailing off at the end; Harrison jokingly replies, [...] "It is 'that'!" [...] As the piece continues, Lennon quietly mumbles [...] "Gonna be alright" [...] a few times. Then follows a brief piano riff, <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> from Lennon and Ono on how well the track has preceded, and final appearances of the tape loops. Most of this coda was lifted {{for the end of}} [...] "Revolution 9", with a little more piano at the beginning (which monitor mixes reveal was present in earlier mixes of [...] "Revolution") and minus Lennon's (or Harrison's) joking reply.|$|E
50|$|Commentators on {{the episode}} gave mixed to {{positive}} reviews, with <b>some</b> <b>commenting</b> positively on Gilmore and Kay's roles, but others commenting negatively on the show's dependency on flashbacks. Upon airing, the episode {{also saw a}} slight increase in ratings, with 6.94 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 2.1.|$|R
50|$|Napier married firstly Catherine Warham, by {{whom he had}} a daughter, Anne and {{secondly}} Magdalen Denton, {{the mother of his}} only son and heir Nathaniel. The marriage of Nathaniel to Elizabeth Gerrard caused <b>some</b> <b>comment</b> since even for the time the couple, at eleven and nine, were exceptionally young.|$|R
5000|$|This {{development}} led to <b>some</b> <b>comment.</b> Law {{school professor}} Jeffrey Rosen wrote that [...] "it's a fascinating truth that we've allowed religion {{to drop out}} of consideration on the Supreme Court, and right now, we have a Supreme Court that religiously at least, by no means looks like America".|$|R
500|$|In 2000, {{shortly before}} the {{publication}} of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the previous three Harry Potter books topped the New York Times fiction best-seller list {{and a third of}} the entries were children's books. The newspaper created a new children's section covering children's books, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only hardback sales. The move was supported by publishers and booksellers. In 2004, The New York Times further split the children's list, which was still dominated by Harry Potter books into sections for series and individual books, and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books. The split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move. Time suggested that, on the same principle, Billboard should have created a separate [...] "mop-tops" [...] list in 1964 when the Beatles held the top five places in its list, and Nielsen should have created a separate game-show list when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? dominated the ratings.|$|E
500|$|In their 2009 {{review of}} western Mexican Oryzomys, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales {{classified}} Oryzomys albiventer {{as a separate}} species from lowland mexicanus {{on the basis of}} clear morphometric differentiation and offered <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on the status of crinitus, regillus, and aztecus, including the holotypes of the three forms in their morphometric analyses. The holotypes of regillus and aztecus were at {{the upper end of the}} range of variation in their large series of mexicanus from the western lowlands, and crinitus clustered with specimens of O.peninsulae from the tip of the Baja California Peninsula. They suggested that regillus and aztecus may represent no more than robust upland populations of mexicanus, but could not exclude the possibility that they represent a different species. That crinitus, which occurs at over [...] altitude in the Valley of Mexico, was the same species as peninsulae from the lowlands of the Baja California Peninsula they could not accept and they recommended further research to determine the relationships of crinitus. A specimen from inland Michoacán has Cytb data characteristic of mexicanus, but Hanson and colleagues did not have data for other interior Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E
500|$|By {{the fifth}} orbit, Schirra {{had begun to}} relax, commenting {{that it was the}} first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small bungee cord {{exercise}} device for [...] "a little bit of stretching", before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on [...] "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made <b>some</b> <b>comments</b> on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery [...] "Buenos Dias, y'all!" [...] Schirra later noted that he was [...] "furious" [...] at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.|$|E
