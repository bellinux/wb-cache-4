50|$|Quantitative {{investment}} analysis can trace its origin back to Security Analysis (book) by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd {{in which the}} authors advocated detailed analysis of objective financial metrics of <b>specific</b> <b>stocks.</b> Quantitative investing replaces much of the ad-hoc financial analysis used by human fundamental investment analysts with a systematic framework designed and programmed by a person but largely executed by a computer {{in order to avoid}} cognitive biases that lead to inferior investment decisions. In a 1978 interview, Benjamin Graham admitted that even by that time ad-hoc detailed financial analysis of single stocks was unlikely to produce good risk-adjusted returns. Instead, he advocated a rules-based approach focused on constructing a coherent portfolio based on a relatively limited set of objective fundamental financial factors.|$|E
5000|$|The SEC {{is charged}} with the {{regulation}} of the mutual fund industry in the United States. Following the announcement of Spitzer's complaint, the SEC launched its own investigation of the matter which revealed the practice of [...] "front running". The SEC claimed that certain mutual fund companies alerted favored customers or partners when {{one or more of}} a company's funds planned to buy or sell a large stock position. The partner was then in a position to trade shares of the stock in advance of the fund's trading. Since mutual funds tend to hold large positions in <b>specific</b> <b>stocks,</b> any large selling or buying by the fund often impacts the value of the stock, from which the partner could stand to benefit. According to the SEC, the practice of front-running may constitute insider trading.|$|E

"Instead of {{spending}} millions on listening {{and learning about}} the market," [...] Brooks wrote of Fords executives, [...] "it spent millions on a campaign to launch the product it had developed in isolation.

Among the first of a new breed of financial journalist, unafraid to lift the manhole covers to peer underneath, Brookss copy was, at the time, revolutionary.

50|$|Another {{method is}} via a {{so-called}} 130/30 strategy. The idea is relatively simple: the manager shorts some fixed {{percentage of the}} portfolio (in this case, 30%), and uses the proceeds for further purchases. The purchase of additional assets with the full capital from the short sale is made possible by what is called an enhanced prime brokerage structure. This raises the long portion of the portfolio to 130% of the original investment capital. The net effect of this strategy is to separate the portfolio into two portions: the first portion is long only, yielding beta returns; the second is long/short and market neutral, yielding alpha returns. The strategy allows managers to bet against <b>specific</b> <b>stocks</b> {{they believe to be}} over-valued, rather than being restricted only to stocks they believe will increase in value (as is the case in a long-only portfolio). For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s model global long-only portfolio invests in around 200 stocks; by comparison its Global Flex model portfolio (following a 130/30 strategy) invests in approximately 250 stocks and shorts about 100 - giving a total of some 350 names.|$|E
