40|$|Four {{detailed}} field {{experiments were}} conducted in the Goondiwindi district (Queensland, Australia) over the summers of 2000 - 01 and 2001 - 02 {{to examine the effects}} of row configuration (single skip row, double skip and solid planted) on yield, yield components, biomass production, canopy architecture and light interception, water use and patterns of soil water extraction in grain sorghum hybrid MR Buster. Grain yield in skip row treatments was equal to or greater than that of solid plant treatments at yield levels below about 2. 5 t/ha. Soil water measurements confirmed that this effect was due to the conservation of soil water in the centre of the skip areas for use by the crop after anthesis. A root front velocity of 2 cm/day was observed in all directions from the base of the sorghum plant. Light interception in skip row configurations was shown to be the same as in solid plant configurations between pairs of rows and up to 50 cm into the <b>skip</b> <b>area.</b> Further into the <b>skip</b> <b>area,</b> light interception was effectively nil. These results provide the basis to refine the APSIM Sorghum model to allow simulation of the effect of various row configurations over a range of climatic and soil conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Hirschsprung's {{disease is}} characterised by the {{congenital}} absence of ganglion cells {{beginning in the}} distal rectum and extending proximally for varying distances. 'Zonal aganglionosis' is a phenomenon involving a zone of aganglionosis occurring within normally innervated intestine. 'Skip segment' Hirschsprung's disease (SSHD) involves a 'skip area' of normally ganglionated intestine, surrounded proximally and distally by aganglionosis. While Hirschsprung's disease {{is believed to be}} the result of incomplete craniocaudal migration of neural crest-derived cells, the occurrence of SSHD has no clear embryological explanation. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of SSHD, reported in the literature between 1954 and 2009, in order to determine the clinical characteristics of this rare entity and its significance. METHODS: The first reported case of SSHD was published in 1954. A systematic review of SSHD cases in the literature, from 1954 to 2009, was carried out using the electronic database 'Pubmed'. Detailed information was recorded regarding the age, gender, presenting symptoms and location of the skip segment in each patient. RESULTS: 24 cases of SSHD have been reported in the literature to date. 18 / 24 (75 %) of these cases were males and 6 / 24 (25 %) were females. Of these, 22 / 24 (92 %) were cases of total colonic aganglionosis (TCA), and 2 / 24 (8 %) were rectosigmoid Hirschsprung's disease. Of the 22 TCA cases, 9 (41 %) had a skip segment in the transverse colon, 6 (27 %) in the ascending colon, 2 (9 %) in the caecum and 5 (23 %) had multiple skip segments. In both rectosigmoid Hirschsprung's disease cases, the skip segment was in the sigmoid colon. Overall, the length of the skip segment was variable, with the entire transverse colon ganglionated in some cases. CONCLUSION: SSHD occurs predominantly in patients with TCA. The existence of a <b>skip</b> <b>area</b> of normally innervated colon in TCA may influence surgical management, enabling surgeons to preserve and use the ganglionated <b>skip</b> <b>area</b> during pull-through operations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} bright liver echo pattern (BLP) on ultrasonography and its correlation with liver steatosis (LS), and fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The usefulness of detecting <b>skip</b> <b>areas</b> for steatosis diagnosis has also been evaluated. Methods: The study included 88 patients with chronic hepatitis C (55 men, 33 women, average age 45. 7 ± 11. 2 years). Ultrasound examination was performed in all patients before liver biopsy. The presence of BLP was assessed and graded from 1 to 3. Hypoechogenic <b>areas</b> (<b>skip</b> <b>areas)</b> around the gallbladder or near the portal vein were also evaluated. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed using the Ishak fibrosis score. Steatosis was graded as follows: 1, 2, 3 (70 % of hepatocytes affected, respectively). Results: Fifty-three of the 88 patients (60 %) showed BLP (40 grade 1, 13 grades 2 or 3). <b>Skip</b> <b>areas</b> were found in 14 patients (16 %). Histological steatosis was observed in 40 patients (45 %) and in 10 of them (25 %) was grades 2 and 3 (4 and 6 patients, respectively). As regards fibrosis, 2 patients showed F 0, 34 F 1, 28 F 2, 20 F 3, 4 F 4, none of them F 5 and F 6. BLP of grades 2 or 3 and presence of <b>skip</b> <b>areas</b> were strongly correlated with LS (P = 0. 00007 and P = 0. 00003, respectively). No correlation was found between BLP and fibrosis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of BLP for LS were 75, 50, 56, 68 and 61 %, respectively. When BLP of grades 2 and 3 and LS of 30 % or more were correlated, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of BLP were 72, 96, 61, 96 and 90 %, respectively. As regards <b>skip</b> <b>areas</b> the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy for LS were 35, 100, 100, 64 and 70 %, respectively. Conclusions: In a well-defined group of patients with chronic hepatitis C, the detection of BLP grades 2 and 3 has a good sensitivity and high specificity for high grades of steatosis. A high specificity but low sensitivity for liver steatosis was also found for <b>skip</b> <b>areas,</b> whereas mild fibrosis {{does not seem to}} correlate with the hyperechogenicity of the live...|$|R

In particular, {{the improvement of}} the position, velocity, and time accuracy, and the realization of autonomous functions require the ISL distance measurement data as the original input. For building a high-performance ISL, the ranging consistency between navigation satellites becomes a crucial problem to be addressed. Considering the frequency aging drift and the relativistic effect of the navigation satellite, the frequency and phase adjustment (FPA) instructions for the 10. 23 MHz must be injected from the ground station to ensure the time synchronization of the navigation constellation. Moreover, the uncertainty of the initial phase each time the onboard clock equipment boots also results in a pseudo-range offset. In this Ref., we focus on the inﬂuence of the frequency and phase characteristics of the onboard clock equipment on the ranging consistency of the ISL and propose a phase compensation sensor design method for the phase offset. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method not only realized a phase compensation for the pseudo-range jitter, but, when the 1 PPS (1 pulse per second) falls in the 10. 23 MHz <b>skip</b> <b>area,</b> also overcomes the problem of compensating the ambiguous phase by directly tracking the 10. 23 MHz to ensure consistency in the ranging...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to document the clinical and pathological features of HD in Kuwait, which has an estimated consanguinity rate of 54 &#x 0025;. Methods: We analyzed all rectal and colonic biopsies (n= 268) for suspected HD identified from the records in the Pathology Department of Al-Sabah Hospital for the period between 1994 and 2004. Results: One hundred and two patients (87 males and 15 females) had histologically confirmed HD. Fifty-eight (57 &#x 0025;) were neonates (&# 60; 1 month of age), while 21 &#x 0025; were more than 4 months old. The diagnosis was based on open biopsy in 11 cases and rectal biopsies in 91 cases. Nine patients with open biopsies presented as intestinal obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis, or perforation. The extent of the disease was unknown in 13 patients. There were 67 males and 3 females with short segment HD. Nine had long segment, two ultra-short segment and eight total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). Five TCA cases involved the small intestine. A <b>skip</b> <b>area</b> was observed in two cases. Six patients had other anomalies. A positive family history for HD was established in three patients. Two of these were male siblings from a consanguineous marriage and had Waardenburg syndrome. Conclusion: This study has highlighted an exceptionally strong male predominance of short segment and a relatively high frequency (5. 6 &#x 0025;) of small intestinal involvement in HD in Kuwait.

Thus, if the 8 [*]×[*] 8 block mode is selected, then 8 [*]×[*] 8 blocks are further decomposed into smaller modes, {{but we do}} not use any smaller size pattern mode (e.g., 16 -pixel patterns) in the decomposition for {{the proposed}} scheme. The pattern size is 64; thus, if we let parts (i.e., 64 pixels) of the 16 [*]×[*] 16 block to be inter-predicted and the others are skipped, the setting can be used to approximate any of the patterns. The main difference is that in the pattern mode, a 16 [*]×[*] 16  MB (i.e., 256 -pixel block) is represented by a smaller block, i.e., one of the 64 -pixel patterns; on the other hand, H. 264 treats the MB as a 256 -pixel block by signaling zero motion vector and zero residual errors for the <b>skipped</b> <b>areas.</b> In the PVC scheme, we need to send some bits for the pattern index; on the other hand, the H. 264 needs to send some bits to signal the zero motion vectors and zero residual errors for the <b>skipped</b> <b>areas.</b> The experimental results reveal that ultimately the pattern mode is the winner for significant times through Lagrangian optimization.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews our five years' {{clinical}} experience (1987 to 1991) of 22 patients with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). There were 12 patients with Crohn's disease and 10 patients with ulcerative colitis. The mean age at diagnosis was 8. 7 years (2 to 14 years). Clinical impressions before referral were chronic diarrhea in 11, irritable bowel syndrome in 5, colon polyp in 4, lymphoma in 3, intestinal tuberculosis in 2, amoebic colitis in 2, ulcerative colitis in 2 children and other diseases. The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of IBD was 18 months. Diagnosis of Crohn's disease was delayed for more than 13 months in 8 (67 %), whereas that of ulcerative colitis was delayed for more than 13 months in 4 (40 %). Diarrhea (50 %), abdominal pain (36 %) and rectal bleeding (36 %) were the three most frequent presenting complaints of IBD. Moderately severe abdominal pain was a more common chief complaint in Crohn's disease (58 %) than in ulcerative colitis (10 %). Hematochezia (90 % vs 17 %) and moderately severe diarrhea (90 % vs 75 %) were more common gastrointestinal manifestations in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. The associated extraintestinal manifestations were oral ulcer in 7, arthralgia in 11 and arthritis in 4, skin lesions in 2, eye lesions in 2 and growth failure in 9 patients. Of 12 children with Crohn's disease, granuloma was found in 5, aphthous ulcerations in 8, cobble stone appearance in 8, <b>skip</b> <b>area</b> or asymmetric lesions in 6, transmural involvement in 7, and perianal fistula in 3. Among 10 children with ulcerative Colitis, there were crypt abscess in 8, granularity or friability in 10 and rectosigmoid ulcerations with purulent exudate in 8 children. The main sites of involvement in children with Crohn's disease were both the small and large bowels in 7 (58 %), small bowel only in 2 (16 %), and colon only in 3 (25 %). Terminal ileum involvement was seen in 75 % of Crohn's disease cases. The main sites of involvement in children with ulcerative colitis were total colon in 4 (40 %), up to the splenic flexure in 2 (20 %), rectosigmoid in 3 (30 %) and rectum only in one (10 %). Medical treatment including sulfasalazine, and systemic or topical steroid was administered initially in most patients.

40|$|The {{observation}} of bright liver echo pattern on ultrasound is commonly considered {{a sign of}} hepatic steatosis. However, the interference of liver fibrosis on sensitivity and specificity of bright liver echo pattern has caused many to question its effectiveness as a diagnostic tool. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of bright liver echo pattern for liver steatosis. We studied 235 consecutive patients suspected of having liver disease of various aetiologies. Median age was 52 years (range, 17 - 72 years), and there was a male/female ratio of 1 : 18. All patients underwent ultrasound examination before liver biopsy and was performed by two operators. The presence or absence of bright liver echo pattern and posterior attenuation or areas with different patterns of fat infiltration were noted. Histologic evaluation was performed and graded by Ishak score. Steatosis was categorised as absent, 0 - 2 %, 3 - 29 % to 30 - 49 % or > 50 %. Interobserver concordance was high. Bright liver echo pattern was found in 67 % of patients with steatosis of any degree and 89 % of patients with steatosis of >or= 30 %. Only three patients without steatosis, who had a low Ishak score, demonstrated bright liver echo pattern on ultrasonography. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of bright liver echo pattern for steatosis were 64 %, 97 %, 96. 0 % and 65 %, respectively. Among the subgroup of patients who had steatosis of >or= 30 %, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of bright liver echo pattern were 91 %, 93 %, 89 % and 94 %, respectively.

A total of 45 eyes of 23 infants were subjected to treatment of threshold ROP. 26. 1 &#x 0025; of these infants had a birth weight of &#x 0026;gt;l, 500 gm. The preferred modality of treatment was laser indirect photocoagulation, which was facilitated by scleral depression. Cryopexy was done in cases with nondilating pupils or medial haze and was always under general anaesthesia. Retreatment with either modality was needed in 42. 2 &#x 0025; eyes; in this the <b>skip</b> <b>areas</b> were covered. Total regression of diseases was achieved in 91. 1 &#x 0025; eyes with no sequelae. All the 4 eyes that progressed to stage 5 despite treatment had zone 1 disease. Major treatment-induced complications did not occur in this series. This study underscores the importance of routine screening of infants upto 2, 000 gm birth weight for ROP and the excellent response that is achieved with laser photocoagulation in inducing regression of threshold ROP. Laser is the preferred method of treatment in view of the absence of treatment-related morbidity to the premature infants...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} role of {{adhesion}} molecules in mediating mononuclear cell localisation, development of the granulomatous reaction, and cell mediated damage to the arterial wall in giant cell arteritis, 17 temporal artery biopsy specimens were examined. Eleven showed the histological features of giant cell arteritis and six showed no evidence of arteritis. All were examined {{for the expression of}} LFA- 3, ICAM- 1 and its receptor LFA- 1, and HLA-DR. Temporal arteries with early features of arteritis, as well as histologically unaffected <b>skip</b> <b>areas,</b> showed a regional induction of ICAM- 1 expression, but not HLA-DR, on smooth muscle cells of the media. ICAM- 1 expression was detected in areas where a clinically important mononuclear cell infiltrate had not yet developed. In more florid cases of giant cell arteritis there was an additional widespread induction of ICAM- 1 expression on intimal myofibroblasts. Strong expression of ICAM- 1, HLA-DR, and LFA- 3 was found on macrophages, epithelioid cells, and giant cells comprising the granulomatous lesion. The pattern of expression of these adhesion molecules suggests that they have a role in leucocyte traffic into the vascular lesion as well as in mediating the intercellular interactions which constitute the granulomatous response...|$|R
50|$|Bountiful, {{named after}} an ancient American city {{referenced}} in the Book of Mormon, {{was the second}} settlement. Shortly after the Mormon’s arrival, Perrigrine Sessions was sent by Young to explore the area just north of Salt Lake City. In September 1847 Sessions gathered his family into their wagon and herded 300 head of cattle into the South Davis Valley. Other families moved into the area and began planting crops the following year. Fifty-three families had established farms in the area by 1850. The process of “leapfrogging,” or <b>skipping</b> <b>areas</b> to settle more distant ones, was used for further settlement. In the first decade, some ninety settlements were founded. Tribes such as the Utes and Shoshone occupied parts of the Great Basin and the ever expanding settlement of the Saints pushed the Indians from their fertile lands. While the Saints did offer some food to help compensate, their relations with the Indians were less than ideal. This continual encroachment on their land caused conflict that led to some violence {{between the two groups}} but eventually many of the Indians left for reservations and other lands.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the intraoperative {{use of the}} Heidelberg Spectralis for ultra-widefield fundus fluorescein angiography in infants. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series. METHODS: A modified Heidelberg Spectralis was used to perform ultra-widefield fundus fluorescein angiography in infants undergoing an examination under general anesthesia {{for a range of}} retinal vasculopathies. Peripheral angiographic findings, angiographic image acquisition time, and any complications were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 22 eyes of 11 infants underwent intraoperative ultra-widefield fundus fluorescein angiography using the modified Heidelberg Spectralis. Ultra-widefield fundus fluorescein angiography was successfully performed in all infants and permitted capture of the posterior pole as well as the peripheral retina in a single shot centered on the macula. Peripheral retinal pathologies captured include neovascularization, capillary nonperfusion, and <b>skip</b> <b>areas</b> from previous laser treatment. Capturing of angiographic images took a mean time of 7. 09  minutes. Image artifact from condensation of the ultra-widefield lens was noted during imaging of 1 infant. CONCLUSIONS: The modified Heidelberg Spectralis is an effective and reliable imaging tool for performing ultra-widefield fundus fluorescein angiography in infants. It is capable of capturing wide-angle images of high quality. The technique has advantages as an alternative to RetCam fluorescein angiography in infants undergoing an examination under general anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Background: Histopathologic {{evaluation}} of colonoscopic mucosal biopsy {{remains one of}} the earliest modalities of investigation in patients clinically suspected of ulcerative colitis. Pathologists should be aware of classical histomorphological features to avoid misdiagnosis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate histopathologic features as well as to determine possible atypical presentation. Materials and Methods: Forty newly diagnosed cases of ulcerative colitis were included in the study. Colonoscopic biopsies taken from rectum as well as various areas of colon and ileum depending upon clinical extent of involvement were submitted for histopathological evaluation. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made by correlating clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic findings. Results: Out of 47 cases suspected of ulcerative colitis, histopathologic features were consistent with Ulcerative colitis in 40 cases. Almost all cases (97. 5 %) showed diffuse active colitis. Cryptitis (100 %), crypt abscesses (75 %) and basal plasmacytosis (85 %) along with crypt architectural abnormalities (75 %) and goblet cell depletion (70 %) were classical histological changes associated with ulcerative colitis in active phase.   Atypical presentations noticed were focal active colitis (2. 5 %), backwash ileitis (2. 5 %), rectal sparing (2. 5 %) and <b>skip</b> <b>areas</b> (5 %). Conclusion: Accurate diagnosis of ulcerative colitis requires elaborate knowledge of histopathologic features along with awareness of possible atypical presentation. </p...|$|R

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Crohn’s disease affects {{any part of the}} GI tract, commonly the terminal ileum. To decrease radiation exposure we developed a low-radiation-dose unenhanced CT (modified small Bowel CT, MBCT) to evaluate the small bowel using hyperdense oral contrast. Technique. MBCT was investigated in patients with pathologically proven Crohn’s disease presenting with new symptoms from recurrent inflammation or stricture. After ethics board approval, 98 consecutive patients were retrospectively evaluated. Kappa values from two independent reviewers were calculated for presence of obstruction, active inflammation versus chronic stricture, and ancillary findings. Forty-two patients underwent surgery or colonoscopy within 3 months. Results. Kappa was 0. 84 for presence of abnormality versus a normal exam and 0. 89 for differentiating active inflammation from chronic stricture. Level of agreement for presence of <b>skip</b> <b>areas,</b> abscess formation, and fistula was 0. 62, 0. 75, and 0. 78, respectively. In the subset with “gold standard ” follow-up, there was 83 % agreement. Conclusions. MBCT is a low-radiation technique with good to very good interobserver agreement for determining presence of obstruction and degree of disease activity in patients with Crohn’s disease. Further investigation is required to refine parameters of disease activity compared to CT enterography and small bowel follow through. 1...|$|R
40|$|The pattern-based video coding (PVC) outperforms the H. 264 through better {{exploitation}} of block partitioning and partial block skipping. In the PVC scheme the best pattern is determined against the moving regions (MRs) in a macroblock (MB) {{of the current}} frame against the co-located MB in the reference frame; motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC) are carried out using the pattern covered MRs, {{and the rest of}} the regions are treated as <b>skipped</b> <b>areas.</b> The MRs can be due to the object areas and the uncovered background (UCB) areas. Thus, the ME & MC by the pattern for the MRs of the UCB would not be accurate if there is no similar region in the reference frame. As a result no coding gain can be achieved for the UCB. Recently a dynamic background frame termed as the McFIS (the most common frame of a scene) has been generated using Gaussian mixture models for object detection. In this paper we propose a new PVC technique which will use the McFIS as a reference frame to determine the MRs where only object areas will be captured as the MRs. Thus, the proposed technique overcomes the mismatch problem of the UCB for ME&MC. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in comparison with the existing PVC and McFIS-based methods by achieving significant image quality gain.
