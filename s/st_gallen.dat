5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to <b>St.</b> <b>Gallen</b> and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in <b>St.</b> <b>Gallen</b> in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E

Ebringen again became {{the centre of the}} <b>St</b> <b>Gall</b> administration in the Breisgau. The abbey's possessions consisted of the direct rule over Ebringen and Norsingen and easements and properties in other locations in the Breisgau. Ebringen was next to <b>St</b> <b>Gall,</b> Wil, Rorschach and Neu St. Johann residence of a governor of the Princely Abbey.|$|R

5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at <b>St</b> <b>Gallen</b> University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009.

On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Bern disputation, Zwingli was {{canvassing}} for {{an alliance of}} reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, das Christliche Burgrecht (the Christian Civic Union) was created. The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Zurich on 5–6 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, Biel, Mülhausen, Schaffhausen, and <b>St</b> <b>Gallen,</b> eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed die Christliche Vereinigung (the Christian Alliance) with Ferdinand of Austria on 22 April 1529.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{and urban}} cantons {{had the same}} {{standing}} in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The diet and central council of the federation, the Tagsatzung, held no real power and served more {{as an instrument of}} coordination. The reformation in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss cantons including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and also the city of <b>St.</b> <b>Gallen</b> had become Protestant. The Tagsatzung was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong factions of the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E

His only league goal came in the second round of matches against <b>St.</b> <b>Gallen,</b> but he also scored in both the first two rounds of the Swiss Cuphis first games in the cup since Vaduz were not eligible for the competitionbefore they were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties. His form with Aarau won Burgmeier the Liechtensteiner Footballer of the Year award, one point ahead of fellow international Mario Frick, and also earned him a move to Basel, for whom he signed a three-year contract.|$|E
50|$|The local <b>St</b> <b>Gall</b> authorities, {{headed by}} the governor, were the supreme local executive, {{representing}} both the secular and ecclesiastical power. They were appointed directly by the Abbey of <b>St</b> <b>Gall,</b> independently from the Austrian government. The citizens were until 1782 de jure serfs of <b>St</b> <b>Gall.</b> During the second <b>St</b> <b>Gall</b> rule this meant, that the people had to pay local taxes instead of a corvée of three days per year, as corvée labour wasn't very efficient. Other forms of socage were still in use. In official documents the term Leibeigener (serf) was more and more replaced by Burger (citizen).|$|R

5|$|The Baden disputation {{exposed a}} deep rift in the Confederation {{on matters of}} religion. The Reformation was now {{emerging}} in other states. The city of <b>St</b> <b>Gallen,</b> an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, Joachim Vadian, and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Zurich. In Basel, although Zwingli had {{a close relationship with}} Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Zurich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, Berchtold Haller, the priest at St Vincent Münster, and Niklaus Manuel, the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito from Strasbourg, Ambrosius Blarer from Constance, and Andreas Althamer from Nuremberg. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the Münster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.|$|E

50|$|The {{interesting}} story of Ekkehard concerning Petrus and Romanus is not now credited, but a certain Petrus, according to Notker, {{was sent to}} Rome by Charlemagne and at the Abbey of <b>St.</b> <b>Gall</b> trained the monks in the Roman style. Besides Metz and <b>St.</b> <b>Gall,</b> other important schools of chant were founded at Rouen and Soissons. In {{the course of time}} new melodies were added, at first characterized by the simplicity of the older tradition, but gradually becoming more free in extended intervals. With respect to German manuscripts, the earliest are found in a style of neumatic notation different from that of <b>St.</b> <b>Gall,</b> while the <b>St.</b> <b>Gall</b> manuscripts are derived not directly from the Italian but from the Irish-Anglo-Saxon. It is probable that before the tenth and eleventh centuries (at which period the <b>St.</b> <b>Gall</b> notation began to triumph in the German churches) the Irish and English missionaries brought with them the notation of the English antiphonary.|$|R
