500|$|On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. [...] Officially {{known as}} the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy, she acted as a {{coordinator}} for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government. [...] Her position was sometimes informally described as the [...] "Energy Czar" [...] or the [...] "Climate Czar". [...] It did not require Senate confirmation. Her participation on the Commission for a <b>Sustainable</b> <b>World</b> Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress, but the Obama transition team said {{there was nothing wrong}} with it. In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: [...] "I don't have any independent policymaking authority. It's not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was argued}} at the World Summit on the Information Society {{and has been}} {{advocated}} by academics that global communication between individuals over the internet {{should be regarded as}} part of the Common Heritage of Mankind. From a spiritual or natural law perspective, {{it has been argued that}} for world peace to be achieved, laws and government policies should create the social preconditions whereby conscience, properly understood, can be delinked from (often destructive) fundamentalist religious ideologies, and associated with a universal consciousness, access to which is the Common Heritage of Humanity. Such thinking with associated implications about how a <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> in the future should be regulated is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network. Equatorial countries have proposed that the geostationary orbit over the high seas should be declared the common heritage of mankind. It has been argued that a World government would manage common heritage areas according to principles of planetary democracy. The international law concept of common heritage of humanity has also been linked with cosmopolitanism. Common heritage of humanity as a concept of international law is supported by many of the principles in the Earth Charter civil society Initiative ...|$|E
