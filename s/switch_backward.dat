40|$|Executive {{functions}} describe some of {{the most}} important human abilities that allow flexible and stable processing and behaviour at the same time. A commonly used paradigm to examine such cognitive control processes is the task-switching paradigm. It allows calculating two measures: <b>switch</b> costs and <b>backward</b> inhibition. <b>Switch</b> costs are supposed to reflect the processing demands and endogenous task-set reconfigurations that are necessary to flexibly switch between multiple tasks. Backward inhibition is said to be a measure for inhibition of recently abandoned task-sets that makes task switching possible. The aim of the study was to examine influences of affective stimulation on executive functions in form of <b>switch</b> costs and <b>backward</b> inhibition. In a first block of experiments positive, neutral, and negative valent pictures were used on a trial by trial basis before every task as affective stimulation. However, even after making the valent content of the pictures more important for the tasks, a consistent pattern of affective modulation of <b>switch</b> costs and <b>backward</b> inhibition could not be found. In a second block of experiments valent feedback after every task was used as affective stimulation. Feedback is supposed to be a stronger affective element because it is relevant for example with regard to goals. Again, an affective modulation of <b>switch</b> costs and <b>backward</b> inhibition was also not found with this method. Considering the results of the current study executive functions represented by <b>switch</b> costs and <b>backward</b> inhibition do not seem to be modulated by affect...|$|R

The trans-former {{in the proposed}} converter is utilized as an isolation inter-face for transferring both energy and data. Power delivery and forward data transfer are conducted simultaneously by modifying the full-bridge <b>switching</b> phase. <b>Backward</b> data transfer is realized by manipulating the amplitude of the resonant signal through modulating the impedance of the resonant tank at the secondary side of the transformer.

40|$|Most land animals {{normally}} walk forward but <b>switch</b> to <b>backward</b> walking upon sensing {{an obstacle}} or {{danger in the}} path ahead. A change in walking direction {{is likely to be}} triggered by descending “command” neurons from the brain that act upon local motor circuits to alter the timing of leg muscle activation. Here we identify descending neurons for backward walking in Drosophila—the MDN neurons. MDN activity is required for flies to walk backward when they encounter an impassable barrier and is sufficient to trigger backward walking under conditions in which flies would otherwise walk forward. We also identify ascending neurons, MAN, that promote persistent backward walking, possibly by inhibiting forward walking. These findings provide an initial glimpse into the circuits and logic that control walking direction in Drosophila...|$|R
40|$|Fast-recovery from link {{failures}} is a well-studied {{topic in}} IP networks. Employing fast-recovery in Ethernet networks is complicated as the forwarding {{is based on}} destination MAC addresses, which {{do not have the}} hierarchical nature similar to those exhibited in Layer 3 in the form of IP-prefixes. Moreover, <b>switches</b> employ <b>backward</b> learning to populate the forwarding table entries. Thus, any fast recovery mechanism in Ethernet networks must be based on undirected spanning trees if backward learning is to be retained. In this paper, we develop three alternatives for achieving fast recovery from single link failures in Ethernet networks. All three approaches provide guaranteed recovery from single link failures. The approaches differ in the technologies required for achieving fast recovery, namely VLAN rewrite and/or mac-in-mac encapsulation. We study the performance of the approaches developed on five different networks...|$|R
30|$|Similarly to automobiles, robotic {{vehicles}} cannot move laterally. Therefore, {{the traveling}} direction of robots {{needs to be}} <b>switched</b> <b>backward</b> and forward when parking in a narrow space with obstacles. The controller based on the time-state control form, which switches {{the direction of the}} time axis, seems to be adequate to control vehicles that have to switch their traveling direction. Accordingly, we apply the control method to the auto-parking problem of a car-like robot. The controller proposed in this study involves the switching of not only the traveling direction but also a parameter value, which is allowed to switch to an arbitrary value at an arbitrary time while theoretically maintaining the stability of the system. Oyama and Nonaka [20] applied the predictive control method to the time-state control-form system to determine the switching points of the traveling direction under the restriction that the direction is switched only once. In this study, the robot measures the distance to obstacles and switches its traveling direction to avoid collisions as many times as necessary. Although the switches occur aperiodically depending on the shapes of the obstacles and the robot, the robot that employs the proposed controller can reach a given target position without pre-calculating the optimal paths for a given map. However, in numerical simulations, a problem arises because of the shape of the robot. We use the switchable parameter included in the proposed controller to solve this problem. Switching the parameter not only provides the solution but also enables the robot to reach the target position quickly. The time required to reach the target position also depends on the timing for switching the traveling direction. Consequently, a genetic algorithm is introduced to search the appropriate values of the parameter and the switching points of the traveling direction when the obstacle map is known. In the auto-parking experiments that incorporate the search results, the robot can reach the target position faster.|$|R

In order to accommodate forward and backward rotor fluxes in the presented controller, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with two different forward and backward currents that are switched interchangeably (<b>switching</b> forward and <b>backward</b> EKF), is proposed.

The presence of simultaneous illumination by blue and green light is necessary for the oscillating behavior to occur, suggesting that the dynamics of continuous forward and <b>backward</b> <b>switching</b> are causing the observed effect.

Twelve Chinese college students who were learning English were scanned when they performed language switching tasks (naming pictures in their first [L 1, Chinese] and second [L 2, English] languages according to response cues). Compared to non-switching conditions, language switching elicited greater activation in the right superior prefrontal cortex (BA 9 / 10 / 32), left middle and superior frontal cortex (BA 8 / 9 / 46), and right middle cingulum and caudate (BA 11).

The advantage of using the backward ASE feedback technique is that the ASE source design is simpler whereas the power of L-band ASE is lower, and the notable advantage of using the compound pump technique is that the output powers of the two selective bands (C- or L-band) are balanced though the configuration is a little complicated.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on task switching has been confounded by inhibitory control mechanism {{and there has}} been debate on the source of switch costs and how and when the inhibitory control occurs during task switching. In order to circumvent this problem, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of inhibition in task switching by examining switch costs, alternating switch costs and congruency effect in three tasks when two preparation intervals (short and long) are given. Task switching experiments in the present study captured both flexibility (changes in task) and anticipatory control (preparation interval between cue and target) and provided the measurement for inhibitory control, 'backward inhibition' by alternating <b>switch</b> cost. <b>Backward</b> inhibition was manifest in longer reaction times (and/or more errors) to alternating switch trials (ABA) than to double switch trials (CBA). Reaction time and error in the present study also reflected whether the task in the current trials were easy when it requires the same response as the task in the previous trials, i. e., whether the required response were congruent. The results in the thesis provided the strong evidence for switch costs as one of cognitive control mechanism and it was reduced by the long preparation interval through all the experiments. When the cues were arbitrarily matched for each task, switch costs were increased, suggesting that high working memory load and the effort for interpretation of the cues might cause more additional process during switching tasks. On the other hand, the change of the cue type was insensitive to backward inhibition since {{there were no significant differences}} on the size of alternating switch costs. The results imply that the occurrence of backward inhibition is more prone to the type of task you perform and level of congruency. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The faster response to light and the faster dark recovery of the new mutants observed in bulk also hold at the single-molecule level. Analysis of the single-molecule traces allows us to extract the efficiencies and rate constants of the pathways involved in the forward and <b>backward</b> <b>switching,</b> and we find important differences when comparing the mutants to Dronpa. We rationalize our results in terms of a higher conformational freedom of the chromophore in the protein environment provided by the P-can. This thorough understanding of the photophysical parameters has allowed us to optimize the acquisition parameters for camera-based sub-diffraction-limit imaging with these photochromic proteins. We show that Dronpa and its mutants are useful for fast photoactivation-localization microscopy (PALM) using common wide-field microscopy equipment, as individual fluorescent proteins can be localized several times.

Films showed a polycrystalline pervoskite structure upon annealing at 650 degrees C for 5 - 10 min. Dielectric properties were investigated {{as a function}} of temperature and frequency. The dielectric constant of PZ films was 220 at 100 kHz with a dissipation factor of 0. 03. The electric field induced transformation from the antiferroelectric phase to the ferroelectric phase was observed through the polarization change, using a Sawyer-Tower circuit.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five scientific papers dealing with equations {{related to the}} optimal <b>switching</b> problem, mainly <b>backward</b> stochastic differential equations and variational inequalities. Besides the scientific papers, the thesis contains {{an introduction to the}} optimal switching problem and a brief outline of possible topics for future research. Paper I concerns systems of variational inequalities with operators of Kolmogorov type. We prove a comparison principle for sub- and supersolutions and prove the existence of a solution as the limit of solutions to iteratively defined interconnected obstacle problems. Furthermore, we use regularity results for a related obstacle problem to prove Hölder continuity of this solution. Paper II deals with systems of variational inequalities in which the operator is of non-local type. By using a maximum principle adapted to this non-local setting we prove a comparison principle for sub- and supersolutions. Existence of a solution is proved using this comparison principle and Perron's method. In Paper III we study backward stochastic differential equations in which the solutions are reflected to stay inside a time-dependent domain. The driving process is of Wiener-Poisson type, allowing for jumps. By a penalization technique we prove existence of a solution when the bounding domain has convex and non-increasing time slices. Uniqueness is proved by an argument based on Ito's formula. Paper IV and Paper V concern optimal switching problems under incomplete information. In Paper IV, we construct an entirely simulation based numerical scheme to calculate the value function of such problems. We prove the convergence of this scheme when the underlying processes fit into the framework of Kalman-Bucy filtering. Paper V contains a deterministic approach to incomplete information optimal switching problems. We study a simplistic setting and show that the problem can be reduced to a full information optimal switching problem. Furthermore, we prove that the value of information is positive and that the value function under incomplete information converges to that under full information when the noise in the observation vanishes...|$|R
