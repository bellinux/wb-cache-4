500|$|Cadmium [...] {{makes up}} about 0.1mg kg−1 (ppm) of Earth's crust. [...] Compared {{with the more}} {{abundant}} 65ppm zinc, cadmium is rare. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and <b>steel</b> <b>scrap.</b> Production in the United States began in 1907, but not until after World War I did cadmium come into wide use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of a hedge-breaching device is generally credited to Curtis G. Culin, a sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division's 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. However, military historian Max Hastings notes that Culin {{was inspired by}} [...] "a Tennessee hillbilly named Roberts", who during a discussion about how to overcome the bocage, said [...] "Why don't we get some saw teeth {{and put them on}} the front of the tank and cut through these hedges?" [...] Rather than joining in the laughter that greeted this remark, Culin recognized the idea's potential. A prototype tusk-like assembly was created by welding <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> (from destroyed [...] "Czech hedgehogs") to the front of a tank to create a hedge cutter. The teeth helped prevent the vulnerable underside of the tank from being exposed while it knocked a hole in the hedgerow wall. On 14 July, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley inspected the tank and [...] "watched in awe as a hedgerow exploded... to make way for the Sherman bursting through". According to Hastings, Culin, [...] "an honest man", attempted to give credit to Roberts, but this was forgotten in the publicity surrounding the invention. Hastings concludes: [...] " [...] became a very American kind of national hero".|$|E
40|$|Since 1994, most of {{the major}} steel {{industries}} in Taiwan have installed portal monitor to detect the abnormal radiation in metal scrap feed. As a result, the discovery of NORM (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material) has increased in recent years. In order to save the natural resources and promote radiation protection, an experimental melting process for the NORM contaminated <b>steel</b> <b>scraps</b> was carried out by the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) Taiwan, ROC. The experimental melting process has a pretreatment step that includes a series of cutting and removal of scales, sludge, as well as combustible and volatile materials on/in the <b>steel</b> <b>scraps.</b> After pretreatment the surface of the <b>steel</b> <b>scraps</b> are relatively clean. Then the scraps are melted by a pilot-type induction furnace. This experiment finally produced seven ingots with a total weight of 2, 849 kg and 96. 8 % recovery. All of the surface dose rates are of the background values. The activity concentrations of these ingots are also below the regulatory criteria. Thus, these NORM-bearing <b>steel</b> <b>scraps</b> are ready for recycling. This study has been granted by the regulatory authority...|$|R

2500|$|West Virginia enthusiastically {{supported}} World War II, with 67,000 men {{and about}} 1000 women donning uniforms. Unemployment ended as the mines, railroads. mills and factories worked overtime {{to create the}} [...] "Arsenal of Democracy" [...] that supplied the munitions to win the war. However, repeatedly John L. Lewis called his United Mine Workers union [...] out on strike, defying the government, outraging public opinion, and strengthening the hand of anti-union Congressmen. In the postwar years he continued his militancy; his miners went on strikes or [...] "work stoppages" [...] annually. Edwards (2008) explores the roles of women volunteers in West Virginia during World War II. Women volunteered for farm and home economics training programs, United Service Organizations (USO) clubs that provided entertainment and assistance to servicemen, salvage campaigns to produce <b>steel</b> <b>scrap,</b> and civil defense training that taught first aid and emergency response techniques. Middle-class women made {{up the majority of}} volunteers; many programs were not open to African American and lower-class white women. Some West Virginia women also volunteered for military service, which was available to African American women. In spite of sexism, racism, and class distinctions that women faced in volunteering, thousands responded to the national war effort.|$|E
