40|$|The {{recently}} completed irradiation of capsule HFR-B 1 in the high-flux reactor at the Pitten Establishment in The Netherlands provided some excellent data for fission-product release. The {{data were obtained}} under irradiation and temperature conditions close to those expected during normal operation of the Modular High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (MHTGR). Some of the tests at Petten were designed to measure release of fission gases during hydrolysis of failed fuel. Hydrolysis was initiated by injecting known amounts of water vapor into the capsule sweep gas. The measured concentrations of CO and CO{sub 2 } in the capsule sweep gas indicated that a non-negligible amount of graphite corrosion was also occurring during the <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>tests.</b> Hence, these measurements provide some unique data for in-pile corrosion of grade H- 4541 graphite by steam. In the present report, an analysis of graphite corrosion during the Petten <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>tests</b> is described. The calculations were performed using the REACT program, {{which is based on}} an improved corrosion model. The REACT program was developed as part of a research program at the University of California, San Diego, and is in operational status in the General Atomics (GA) Production Code Library. Predictions obtained with REACT show excellent agreement with the Petten graphite-corrosion data. This good agreement indicates that the currently used correlation for the steam-graphite reaction rate, which was obtained from out-of-pile measurements, may also be used to predict in-pile corrosion with good accuracy. 8 refs., 19 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

40|$|Biotyping of Haemophilus influenzae {{into five}} type and H. parainfluenzae into three types based on indole production, {{ornithine}} decarboxylase, and urease {{has been reported}} (M. Kilian, Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. Sect. B 82 : 835 [...] 842, 1976). A commercially available test system designed for the 4 -h identification of Enterobacteriaceae. Micro-ID, proved efficacious for the rapid biotyping of these two Haemophilus species. The nitrate reductase, indole production, ornithine decarboxylase, urease, and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>tests</b> in Micro-ID correlated over 99 % with conventional methodology. By utilizing the indole and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside tests it was possible, with 261 of 272 (96. 1 %) isolates, to distinguish H. influenzae from H. parainfluenzae. Cerebrospinal fluid isolates were over 90 % H. influenzae biotype I, and conjunctival isolates were approximately 70 % biotype II. Type b H. influenzae were predominantly biotypes I and II; these type b isolates were also overwhelmingly indole producers. Although over 90 % of biotypes I and II {{have been reported to}} produce beta-lactamase, this was not confirmed by the small number of beta-lactamase producers encountered here. The 4 -h Micro-ID should prove a useful mechanism, amenable to the routine clinical laboratory, for the further exploration of the association of Haemophilus with the site of isolation, antigenicity, and antibiotic resistance...|$|R
40|$|Literature reports {{disagree}} concerning esculin hydrolysis in {{the family}} Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 2, 490 strains of the family were investigated for esculin hydrolysis by two methods, the esculin spot test and the PathoTec incubation strip, which measures constitutive enzyme, and five growth-supporting methods, which determine both constitutive and inducible enzymes. The five growth-supporting media studied were: Vaughn-Levine, the standard esculin hydrolysis medium (P. R. Edwards and W. H. Ewing, Identification of Enterobacteriaceae, 3 rd ed., 1972); Vaughn-Levine without iron; Vaughn-Levine without Andrade's indicator; and bile-esculin medium. Growth media were incubated at 35 degrees C and checked every 24 h for 120 h. On growth media, 0. 3 % of Escherichia coli were positive in 24 h, 34 % in 48 h, and 61 % in 120 h. No strains were positive on the "nongrowth" tests. It appeared that the esculin hydrolysis enzyme(s) of E. coli was inducible rather than constitutive. All esculin hydrolyzers, which yielded positive tests on "constitutive tests" and 24 -h tests, were limited to the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia and species of Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus. When used with standardized inoculum size and incubation time, the esculin <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>test</b> is very useful for differentiation with{{in the family}} Enterobacteriaceae...|$|R
