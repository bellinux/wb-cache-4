25|$|Although it manifests {{differently}} in different animals, REM sleep or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> occurs in all land mammals {{as well as}} in birds. The primary criteria used to identify REM are the change in electrical activity, measured by EEG, and loss of muscle tone, interspersed with bouts of twitching in phasic REM. The amount of REM sleep and cycling varies among animals; predators enjoy more REM sleep than prey. Larger animals also tend to stay in REM for longer, possibly because higher thermal inertia of their brains and bodies allows them to tolerate longer suspension of thermoregulation. The period (full cycle of REM and non-REM) lasts for about 90 minutes in humans, 22 minutes in cats, and 12 minutes in rats. In utero, mammals spend more than half (50–80%) of a 24-hour day in REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier {{taught that}} {{scientific}} research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm {{was active in the}} Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.|$|E

25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what {{there is to know about}} it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Jolie next starred {{opposite}} Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), {{the first}} of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with [...] "soft-core nonsense." [...] The romantic comedy Life or <b>Something</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salons Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance [...] "doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'". Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress; in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.|$|E
500|$|Jolie's first role in 1999 was in Pushing Tin, a {{critical}} and commercial failure; however, her next film The Bone Collector {{emerged as a}} commercial success. In the 1999 drama Girl, Interrupted, Jolie played a sociopathic mental patient, a role which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. A role opposite Nicolas Cage in the heist film Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) proved to be her highest-grossing to that point. Jolie achieved worldwide recognition as the eponymous archaeologist in [...] (2001), an action film based on the Tomb Raider video game series. Despite negative reviews, the film had the biggest opening weekend for a film featuring an action heroine. This was followed by roles in two box-office failures—the 2001 erotic thriller Original Sin and the 2002 romantic comedy Life or <b>Something</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It.</b> Jolie reprised the role of Lara Croft in the sequel [...] (2003).|$|E

500|$|In March 2006, {{when the}} {{structural}} {{part of the}} narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes {{that needed to be}} kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say [...] "Snow and Hope reconcile". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a [...] "reliable and calm leader type" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was [...] "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.|$|E

2500|$|Just as he {{challenged}} the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also {{took aim at}} traditional normative epistemology. [...] According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs.: [...] "Epistemology, or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output {{a description of the}} three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology."

2500|$|Inimitability of the Quran (or [...] "I'jaz") is {{the belief}} that no human speech can match the Quran in its content and form. The Quran is {{considered}} an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: [...] "If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another." [...] So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations at the individual level and in history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science. The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Burke did not {{condemn the}} French Revolution. In {{a letter of}} 9 August 1789, he wrote: [...] "England gazing with astonishment at a French {{struggle}} for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner". The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In {{a letter to his}} son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: [...] "This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable". On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken [...] "as no more than the expression of doubt" [...] but he added: [...] "You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom". In the same month he described France as [...] "a country undone". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, Jeacocke was {{involved}} in another incident, the details of which are vague. Surrey played Essex County Cricket Club at Leyton Cricket Ground. The rules for the time at which the lunch interval began had just been standardised, and Fender rejected a request from the Essex captain, Johnny Douglas, to keep the old time for the interval on the Leyton ground, preferring to [...] "stick to MCC rules". This possibly aggravated what followed, and during this period Fender and Douglas had a difficult relationship. After two days' play, Surrey had scored 431 and Essex had replied with 333 for seven wickets. Before {{the third and final}} day, one of the umpires informed the captains that none of Surrey's professional players had arrived in time for the start of play. Douglas refused to postpone the start, stating [...] "Strict MCC rules, Fender—the side refusing to play loses the match." [...] Fender elected to continue, and when play began, only he and Jeacocke were present and these two went out to field alone. They had driven to the ground together, while the professionals were delayed in traffic. The Essex batsmen, possibly embarrassed by their captain's stance, did not appear until Fender sent a message saying that he could claim victory in the match if they did not come out to bat. They did so, and Fender and Jeacocke bowled from opposite ends until the remainder of the team arrived. The two men bowled wide and the batsmen made no attempt to score. Later in the day, the crowd jeered Fender for refusing to declare his innings closed, unaware of what had passed earlier. Whether the press were unaware of what happened, or if they agreed to keep it quiet, the incident was not reported, although several accounts hinted that something unusual had occurred. The play which took place was not recorded by the match scorers until the full Surrey team arrived, but several players who took part remembered it happening. In later years, rumours persisted that <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had taken place.|$|E
