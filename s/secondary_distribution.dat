40|$|The {{sound field}} {{reproduction}} problem is formulated as an inverse problem, {{in which the}} reproduction of a target sound field is attempted, {{in the interior of}} a given control region, with an array of loudspeakers (referred to as a <b>secondary</b> source <b>distribution).</b> The determination of the loudspeaker gains represents an ill-posed problem. This paper studies under what circumstances the said inverse problem allows for a unique solution. The general solution of the problem is derived, and it is shown that nonuniqueness arises when the wave number is one of the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the control region. It is shown that, when this is not the case, the solution of the problem is unique. Numerical simulations illustrate the effect of nonuniqueness of the solution for the case of spherical <b>secondary</b> source <b>distribution</b> and control region. The case is also studied of the wave number being one of the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the region bounded by the <b>secondary</b> source <b>distribution...</b>|$|R

For a subsample of secondary issuers in which the seller is an insider, however, both three- and five-year post-issue abnormal stock returns are significantly negative. The operating performance of these firms also declines subsequent to the issue. This supports the hypothesis that the negative performance of secondary equity offerings can partly be attributed to managers exploiting “windows of opportunity ” by issuing overvalued shares...|$|R

50|$|Electric power {{distribution}} {{is the final}} stage {{in the delivery of}} electric power; it carries electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV with the use of transformers. Primary distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the customer's premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through <b>secondary</b> <b>distribution</b> lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the <b>secondary</b> <b>distribution</b> lines through service drops.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} physical reproduction of sound fields via planar and linear <b>distributions</b> of <b>secondary</b> sources (i. e., loudspeakers). The presented approach employs a {{formulation of the}} reproduction equation in spatial frequency domain which is explicitly solved for the secondary source driving signals. Wave field synthesis (WFS), the alternative formulation, can {{be shown to be}} equivalent under equal assumptions. Unlike the WFS formulation, the presented approach does not employ a far-field approximation when linear <b>secondary</b> source <b>distributions</b> are considered but provides exact results. We focus on the investigation of the spatial truncation and discretization of the <b>secondary</b> source <b>distribution</b> occurring in real-world implementations and present a rigorous analysis of evanescent and propagating components in the reproduced sound field.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{derivation}} and investigation of analytical expressions for the loudspeaker driving signals for higher order Ambisonics.

For source-free volumes enclosed by the <b>secondary</b> source <b>distribution,</b> this formulation of Ambisonics leads to {{what is known as}} simple source approach. Since the simple source approach is theoretically well documented, we will depart from it and concentrate on the special case of a circular <b>distribution</b> of <b>secondary</b> point sources and derive analytical expressions for the driving signals.

Given dichotomous data simulated to be multidimensional, this study shows how varying the ability distributions affects the results obtained from DIMTEST, a nonparametric statistical procedure based on the theory of essential unidimensionality. Results indicate that the power of DIMTEST decreased as the mean of the <b>secondary</b> ability <b>distribution</b> approached the extremes and/or as the standard deviation of the sec-ondary ability distribution approached zero. This has important implications for both researchers and practitioners because although a test may measure additional dimensions from a substantive viewpoint, these dimensions may not be detected statistically...|$|R

40|$|The Chinese {{government}} has been pursuing economic growth {{under the guidance of}} “growth is a hard principle”. In the context of the Chinese political and economic governance system, local governments have employed the overtaking strategy (placing primary emphasis on the development of capital and technology-intensive industries) and the real estate development strategy to push for economic growth and fiscal revenue growth. This has led to a repressed labor share and an elevated capital and government share in primary and <b>secondary</b> income <b>distribution</b> structure. Using the empirical strategy of Acemoglu et al.

40|$|Sound field {{reproduction}} methods like {{higher order}} Ambisonics {{which are based}} on orthogonal expansions always introduce a limitation of the spatial bandwidth of the secondary source driving function.
