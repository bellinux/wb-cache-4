40|$|In many cities, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - 1 seroprevalence among drug injectors stabilizes at 30 – 70 % for many years without secondary outbreaks that increase seroprevalence by 15 % or more. The authors considered how HIV- 1 incidence can remain moderate at seroprevalence levels that would give maximum incidence. Previously suggested answers include behavioral risk reduction and network saturation within high-risk subgroups. Among 767 drug injectors studied in 1991 – 1993, {{during a period of}} stable high seroprevalence in New York City, risk behaviors remained common, and networks were far from saturated. The authors suggest a different network-based mechanism: in stable high-prevalence situations, the relatively small sizes of subnetworks of linked <b>seronegatives</b> (within larger networks containing both infected and uninfected persons) may limit infectious outbreaks. Any primary infection outbreak would probably be limited to members of connected subcomponents of <b>seronegatives,</b> and the largest such subcomponent in the study contained only 18 members (of 415 <b>seronegatives).</b> Research and mathematical modeling should study conditions that may affect the size and stability of subcomponents of <b>seronegatives.</b> Finally, if the existence of small, connected components of <b>seronegatives</b> prevents secondary outbreaks, this protection may weaken, and vulnerability to new outbreaks increase, if HIV- 1 seroprevalence falls. Thus, in situations of declining prevalence, prevention programs should be maintained or strengthened. Am J Epidemiol 2000; 152 : 913 – 22...|$|R

40|$|Background-: Very {{few studies}} have {{measured}} disease penetrance and prognostic factors of Chagas cardiomyopathy among asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi-infected persons. Methods and Results-: We performed a retrospective cohort study among initially healthy blood donors with an index T cruzi-seropositive donation and age-, sex-, and period-matched <b>seronegatives</b> in 1996 to 2002 in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo and Montes Claros. In 2008 to 2010, all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and echocardiograms. ECG and echocardiogram results were classified by blinded core laboratories, and records with abnormal results were reviewed by a blinded panel of 3 cardiologists who adjudicated the outcome of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Associations with Chagas cardiomyopathy were tested with multivariate logistic regression. Mean follow-up time between index donation and outcome assessment was 10. 5 years for the seropositives and 11. 1 years for the <b>seronegatives.</b> Among 499 T cruzi seropositives, 120 (24 %) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among 488 T cruzi <b>seronegatives,</b> 24 (5 %) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence difference of 1. 85 per 100 person-years attributable to T cruzi infection. Of the 120 seropositives classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy, only 31 (26 %) presented with ejection fraction < 50 %, and only 11 (9 %) were classified as New York Heart Association class II or higher. Chagas cardiomyopathy was associated (P < 0. 01) with male sex, a history of abnormal ECG, {{and the presence of}} an S 3 heart sound.

500|$|The risk of {{transmission}} from mother to baby is highest {{if the mother}} becomes infected {{around the time of}} delivery (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child.

To prevent neonatal infections, <b>seronegative</b> women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy.

Twenty participants with hsCRP more than 1 mg/dl {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Those with hsCRP more than 0. 1 mg/dl were defined as high hsCRP individuals.

This research is of particular importance in developing countries where infant formula is not widely available or safe to prepare. In fact, the World Health Organization recommended breastfeeding in 1987 and 1992 for seropositive and <b>seronegative</b> women in areas where malnutrition and infectious diseases are the major cause of infant mortality.

We assessed the association of assay seropositivity and risk of subsequent HPV 16 infection over four years of follow-up by calculating sampling-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and HPV 16 seropositivity based on standard cutoff from the cLIA was significantly associated with protection from subsequent HPV 16 infection (OR = 0. 48, CI = 0. 27 - 0. 86, compared with <b>seronegatives).</b> Compared with <b>seronegatives,</b> the highest seropositive tertile antibody levels from the direct ELISA (OR = 0. 53, CI = 0. 28 - 0. 90) as well as the SEAP-NA (OR = 0. 20, CI = 0. 06, 0. 64) were also significantly associated with protection from HPV 16 infection.
