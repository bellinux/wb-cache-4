40|$|The {{future of}} {{electric}} power distribution systems (DSs) {{is one that}} incorporates extensive amounts of advanced metering, distribution automation, and distributed generation technologies. Most DSs were designed to be radial systems and the major philosophies of their protection, namely, selectivity and sensitivity, were easily achieved. Settings for overcurrent protective devices (OCPDs) were static {{and based on the}} maximum load downstream of its location, with little concern of major configuration changes. However, the integration of distribution generators (DGs) in radial distributions systems (RDSs) causes bidirectional power flows and varying short circuit currents to be sensed by protective devices, thereby affecting these established protection principles. Several researchers have investigated methods to preserve the selectivity of overcurrent protection coordination in RDSs with DGs, but at the expense of protective device sensitivity due to an inherent change in system configuration. This thesis presents an investigation to adapt the pickup settings of the <b>substation</b> <b>relay,</b> based on configuration changes in a DS with DGs, using smart meter data from the prior year. An existing protection scheme causes the faulted areas of DSs with DGs to revert to a radial configuration, thereby allowing conventional OCPDs to isolate faults. Based on the location of the fault, the created radial segments are known and vary in length. The proposed methodology involves using demand information available via smart metering, to determine the seasonal maximum diversified demands in each of the radial segments that are formed. These seasonal maximum diversified demands are used to yield several pickup settings for the <b>substation</b> overcurrent <b>relay</b> of the DS. The existing protection approach enables the selectivity of radial overcurrent protection coordination to be maintained; the sensitivity of the <b>substation</b> <b>relay</b> is improved by adapting its pickup settings based on seasonal demand and system configuration changes. The results of the studies are reported through simulation in EMTP? /PSCAD? using a multi-feeder test system that includes DGs and smart meters located at the secondary distribution load level. The results show that using seasonal settings for the <b>substation</b> <b>relay</b> based on configuration changes in a DS with DGs can improve the sensitivity of the <b>substation</b> <b>relay...</b>|$|R
30|$|Under the {{construction}} of smart <b>substation,</b> <b>relay</b> protection technology is undergoing a thorough and extensive reform. The last similar reform was occurred in 1990 when the microcomputer-based protection was developed {{to be the main}} solution. With a broader scope, this reform takes digitalized protection as the main solution, and includes instrument transformers and secondary circuits besides protection device itself [4].|$|R

40|$|Smart radial {{distribution}} grids will include {{advanced metering infrastructure}} (AMI) and significant distributed generators (DGs) connected close to loads. DGs in these {{radial distribution}} systems (RDS) introduce bidirectional power flows (BPFs) and contribute to fault current. These BPFs may cause unwanted tripping of existing overcurrent (OC) protection devices and result in permanent outages for {{a large number of}} customers. This thesis presents a protection approach that modified an existing overcurrent protection scheme {{to reduce the number of}} customers affected by faults in RDS with DGs. Further, a technique is presented that utilizes customers loading information from smart meters in AMI to improve the sensitivity of <b>substation</b> OC <b>relays</b> by adaptively changing the pickup settings. The modified protection approach involves predefining zones in RDS with DGs and installing directional OC relays and circuit breakers at the zonal boundaries. Zonal boundary relays determine faulted zones by sharing information on the direction of detected faults current using binary state signals over a communication medium. The technique to adapt the <b>substation</b> <b>relay</b> pickup settings uses the demand measurements from smart meters for two 12 -hour intervals from the previous day to determine the maximum diversified demand at the relay?s location. The pickup settings of the <b>substation</b> <b>relay</b> for the two 12 -hour intervals during the following day for the zone supplied by the substation are adaptively set based on the current that corresponds to the maximum diversified demand from the previous day. The techniques were validated through simulations in EMTP/PSCAD using an expanded IEEE 34 node radial test feeder that included DGs and a secondary distribution level. By decentralizing the control of the zonal boundary breakers, the single point of failure was eliminated in the modified protection approach. The cases studied showed that the modified protection approach allows for selective identification and isolation of the faulted zones. Also, the sensitivity of the <b>substation</b> OC <b>relay</b> was improved by at least 24 % by using the pickup settings for the two 12 -hour intervals from the smart meter demand measurements compared to the pickup settings computed using the conventional methodology based on the maximum loading of the zone...|$|R

5|$|Around the 1990s, {{the station}} was modernized. After water shorted out old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era <b>relay</b> <b>room,</b> which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> was rebuilt.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was another}} {{mezzanine}} somewhere {{south of the}} present station, but it was closed, [...] "stranded," [...] and converted into a <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> when the present ramps from the West End Line were built and the station was extended northward.|$|R
50|$|A fire {{broke out}} in the <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> {{on the west side of}} the station at 4am on 24 July 2011. At 6am, water was cut from five neighbourhoods in order to {{facilitate}} efforts by the fire brigade to fight the fire. The metro line B was also temporarily closed between Castro Pretorio and Monti Tiburtini. As the {{fire broke out}} in the <b>relay</b> <b>room,</b> most controls for tracks and traffic signals were rendered unusable, leaving a vital part of the Italian rail network disabled with significant train delays throughout the country. The damage to the structure rendered the building in danger of collapse, with problems and delays going on for a long time after the accident.|$|R

50|$|The 1951 box was at {{the time}} one of the largest route-relay {{interlockings}} in the world, its <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> 46 metres long by 10 metres wide, containing nearly 3,000 relays. It replaced seven mechanical boxes containing a total of 868 levers - the largest of which was Locomotive Yard, the largest mechanical signal box in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The centre {{drives a}} number of Solid State Interlockings (SSI) and older Route Relay Interlockings (RRI), for example some of the <b>relay</b> <b>rooms</b> {{provided}} for the 1983 Selby Diversion, which was controlled from a separate mosaic panel inside the old 1951 box before the area was controlled by the IECC. There is also a Westlock interlocking controlling the Moorthorpe/Hickleton area.|$|R
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper, more {{powerful}} <b>substation</b> <b>relays,</b> now {{commonly known as}} Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), will have a substantial impact on Powerco information systems. Their impact is two-fold; {{the sheer volume of}} information associated with modern relays will require a more capable relay management system than the one currently being used. The second effect is the amount of data that can be gathered and used for network improvement. Improper management of both types of information will lead to worse outcomes for Powerco reliability performance, and ultimately its financial performance. This report details two projects concerned with the management of IED information. The first project is concerned with a proposed upgrade of the Powerco relay management system. This involved requirements engineering, investigation of database systems and a commercial tendering process. It was found that the data schema had a large effect on efficiency and efficacy of relay management systems. The optimal solution would be to procure a proven relay management system from an established vendor, given resource constraints and proven-for-purpose data schema. The second project is focused on the deployment of automated event report collection software. The impetus of this project was the inefficiencies that arise from manual collection and processing of network event data from <b>substation</b> <b>relays.</b> These hamper the network improvement process, negatively affecting Powerco network reliability. A Cost-Benefit Analysis was performed to determine if such functionality was worth deploying across the network. It was found that automated event report collection produced operational savings from reduced technician dispatch frequency. Other benefits include greater data captured, faster fault response time, and a transformation of the existing reactive network improvement engineering process to one that is proactive. This will require additional engineering resources to be dedicated to event analysis. A deployment schedule was formulated based on historical reliability and agreed service levels. The larger implications of this report are that additional resourcing, and careful consideration of the information management processes are required {{to take advantage of the}} greater volume of data generated by IEDs...|$|R
50|$|Few {{parts of}} the station survive. The {{northern}} platform has almost disappeared completely and the southern platform is used by Network Rail, although no buildings remain and the buildings used by Network Rail are only small portable cabins, including a <b>relay</b> <b>room.</b> New buildings have been built around the site. The most noticeable is the bail depot {{on the site of}} the northern platform. One nearby public house, the Prince of Wales, was burnt down in 1999 and the site has been levelled.|$|R
50|$|The Stellwerk {{operated}} a type GS II DR point control {{system and the}} structure was designed by the building department of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The building consists of a block containing the control centre with radial viewing windows and a separate part containing the electrical <b>relay</b> <b>rooms.</b> The construction of all walls, floors and roofs is predominantly from pre-cast or in-situ cast steel reinforced concrete with a rendered outer coating on the walls; building materials and method which were fashionable during that period in the GDR.|$|R
50|$|Before the new City Hall master {{tower was}} built, {{there was a}} {{provision}} {{at the north end}} of the upper level for a diamond crossover (which has existed since the construction of this station, when the upper level platform was to be a terminal) which is now occupied by a <b>relay</b> <b>room.</b> Strangely, at the south end of the station, the uptown track curves away from the wall; this dates from the original construction when the upper level was converted from a terminal, with presumably a straight line, to a through station with a single two-track tunnel.|$|R

50|$|The station {{opened on}} 16 December 1868 at a {{junction}} formed between two existing railway lines - the Hammersmith & City Railway (owned by the Great Western Railway and running between Westbourne Park and Hammersmith stations) and the West London Railway (WLR) (between Willesden Junction and Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)) stations). Services to Addison Road were originally provided via the junction to the WLR tracks {{but these were}} discontinued in 1940 and the junction no longer exists. The line between Latimer Road and Uxbridge Road was then closed and the raised train track demolished.

5000|$|The nearby {{junction}} {{between the}} Crewe and Stoke routes {{is an important}} one on the West Coast Main Line, as such during the 1960s modernisation of the line, the junction and some of the surrounding main lines were placed under the control of a new power signal box built to a similar design to that still standing at Wolverhampton. The Norton Bridge signal box was notable for its use of an experimental Westinghouse solid-state interlocking system for some years, later being converted to a conventional relay-based interlocking; this signal box features briefly in the British Transport Films production [...] "Thirty Million Letters". It closed altogether in 2004, control passing instead to the signal control centre at Stoke, although the lower storey still remains in situ as a <b>relay</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Protective relays detect {{intolerable}} or unwanted conditions {{within an}} assigned area, and then trip or open {{one or more}} circuit breakers to isolate the problem area before it can damage or otherwise interfere with the effective operation {{of the rest of}} the power system. It often happens that a <b>substation</b> feeder <b>relay</b> and supply-side relay both trip for the same feeder fault. This occurrence, known as over-trip is undesirable, and is usually blamed on poor relay coordination. The relay and breaker nearest to the point of fault must be able to see the fault and operate before other relays in the system so that healthy parts of the system will not be interrupted. How to achieve this is the subject of this paper...|$|R
5000|$|Three of {{the four}} lines at Kishanganj station were {{non-operational}} because a doubling of lines was in progress. Only one line was being used {{to carry the load}} usually carried by four: 31 trains per day. Track circuiting and interlocking were also not correctly functioning at the station, because of the work in progress. Track circuiting is an electrical procedure by which the station master, and consequently the train driver, can know that the track ahead is occupied. The signals will remain red, interlocking the track, which effectively means that the series of signals cannot be turned green unless the station master allows. The signals can be changed from the <b>relay</b> <b>room</b> which can only be opened by jointly by the station master and the signal inspector. In such a situation, the points in the track have to be set manually by the [...] "cranking" [...] procedure. A crank handle, available at stations, has to be rotated manually on the orders of the station master for setting the points which are then clamped and locked. The entire process takes around 30 minutes.|$|R
25|$|Electrical power {{transmission}} networks are protected {{and controlled by}} high-voltage breakers. The definition of high voltage varies but in {{power transmission}} work is usually thought to be 72.5kV or higher, {{according to a recent}} definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. In <b>substations</b> the protective <b>relay</b> scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{cooperative}} communications in cognitive radio systems where the secondary user has limited <b>relaying</b> <b>room</b> for the overheard primary packets. More specifically, we characterize the stable throughput region of a cognitive radio network with a finite relaying buffer at the secondary user. Towards this objective, we formulate a constrained optimization problem for maximizing the secondary user throughput while guaranteeing {{the stability of the}} primary user queue. We consider a general cooperation policy where the packet admission and queue selection probabilities, at the secondary user, are both dependent on the state (length) of the finite relaying buffer. Despite the sheer complexity of the opti-mization problem, attributed to its non-convexity, we transform it to a linear program. Our numerical results reveal a number of valuable insights, e. g., it is always mutually beneficial to cooperate in delivering the primary packets in terms of expanding the stable throughput region. In addition, the stable throughput region of the system, compared to the case of infinite relaying queue capacity, marginally shrinks for limited relaying queue capacity.
