50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1800 by Edward Charles Howard {{in his research}} project to prepare a large variety of fulminates. Along with mercury fulminate, {{it is the only}} fulminate stable enough for commercial use. Detonators using <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> were used to initiate picric acid in 1885, but since have only been used by the Italian navy. The current commercial use has been in producing non-damaging novelty noisemakers as children's toys and tricks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>fulminate,</b> {{often in}} {{combination}} with potassium chlorate, is used in trick noise-makers known as [...] "crackers", [...] "snappers", [...] "whippersnappers", [...] "pop-its", or [...] "bang-snaps", a popular type of novelty firework. They contain approximately 200 milligrams of fine gravel coated with a minute quantity (approximately 80 micrograms) of <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate.</b> When thrown against a hard surface, the impact is sufficient to detonate the tiny quantity of explosive, creating a small report from the supersonic detonation. Snaps {{are designed to be}} incapable of producing damage (even when detonated against skin) due to the buffering effect provided by the much greater mass of the gravel medium. It is also the chemical found in Christmas crackers. The chemical is painted on one of two narrow strips of card, with abrasive on the second. When the cracker is pulled, the abrasive detonates the <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> {{occurs in}} two {{polymorphic}} forms, an orthorhombic {{one and a}} trigonal one with a rhombohedral lattice. The trigonal polymorph consists of cyclic hexamers, (AgCNO)6.|$|E
50|$|This {{compound}} can {{be prepared}} by pouring a solution of silver nitrate in nitric acid into ethanol, under careful control of the reaction conditions, to avoid an explosion. The reaction is usually done at 80-90 deg C; at 30 deg C, the precipitate may not form. Only very tiny amounts of <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> should be prepared at once, as even {{the weight of the}} crystals can cause them to self-detonate.Another way to make <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> is to react silver carbonate with ammonia in solution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> is {{a primary}} explosive, but has limited use as such due to its extreme {{sensitivity}} to impact, heat, pressure and electricity. The compound becomes progressively sensitive as it is aggregated, even in small amounts; {{the touch of a}} falling feather, the impact of a single water droplet or a small static discharge are all capable of explosively detonating an unconfined pile of <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> no larger than a dime and no heavier than a few milligrams. Aggregating larger quantities is impossible due to the compound's tendency to self-detonate under its own weight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> can be {{prepared}} unintentionally, when an acidic solution of silver nitrate comes in contact with alcohol. This is a hazard in some formulations of chemically silvering mirrors.|$|E

50|$|Ever since seeing {{fireworks}} as a child, another German chemist, Justus von Liebig, {{had become}} obsessed with trying {{to better understand the}} elements by creating explosive combinations. Specifically, he was interested in the explosive compound <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> can be {{prepared}} in a similar way, but this salt is even more unstable than mercury fulminate; it can even explode under water and is impossible to accumulate in large amounts because it detonates under its own weight.|$|E
50|$|In the 1820s, {{the organic}} chemist Justus Liebig {{discovered}} <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> (Ag-CNO) and Friedrich Wöhler discovered silver cyanate (Ag-OCN).

5000|$|Silver nitride was {{formerly}} {{referred to as}} fulminating silver, but this can cause confusion with <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> or silver azide, other compounds which have also been referred to by this name. The fulminate and azide compounds do not form from ammoniacal solutions of Ag2O. [...] Fulminating silver was first prepared in 1788 by the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet.|$|E
50|$|In 1825 he read a paper {{written by}} Friedrich Wöhler {{in which he}} {{describes}} a compound called silver cyanate, made in equal parts of silver, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which he described as harmless and stable. Von Liebig immediately wrote back a furious letter condemning Wöhler as a hopeless analyst: those elements combined in equal proportions were exactly what made the explosive <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{inorganic}} compounds include the inorganic salts and complexes of the carbon-containing cyanide, cyanate, fulminate, thiocyanate and cyanamide ions. Examples of cyanides are copper cyanide (CuCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN), examples of cyanates are potassium cyanate (KNCO) and silver cyanate (AgNCO), examples of fulminates are <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> (AgOCN) and mercury fulminate (HgOCN) and {{an example of}} a thiocyanate is potassium thiocyanate (KSCN).|$|E
50|$|In 1830, {{at the age}} of 23, Hearder's {{vision was}} {{severely}} damaged during an accidental explosion while experimenting with the explosive compound <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate.</b> He was frequently described by many (including himself) as totally blind, although John Charles Bucknill in his book The Medical Knowledge of Shakespeare relates a demonstration given by Hearder in which Hearder claimed to be able to perceive a particularly bright flash of electrical light.

5000|$|Chlorate-based {{propellants}} {{are more}} efficient than traditional gunpowder and are less susceptible to damage by water.

Chlorate propellants must be used only in equipment designed for them; failure to follow this precaution is a common source of accidents.

5000|$|A {{detonator}} {{contains an}} easy-to-ignite primary explosive {{that provides the}} initial activation energy to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include mercury fulminate, lead azide, lead styphnate and tetryl and DDNP. Blasting caps and some detonators are stored separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe. Early blasting caps also used <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> {{but it has been}} replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives.Silver azide is still used sometimes,but very rarely due to its high price.|$|E

50|$|Isomerism {{was first}} noticed in 1827, when Friedrich Woehler {{prepared}} silver cyanate and discovered that, although its elemental composition was identical to <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> (prepared by Justus von Liebig the previous year), its properties were quite different. This finding challenged the prevailing chemical {{understanding of the}} time, which held that chemical compounds could be different only when they had different elemental compositions. After additional discoveries of the same sort were made, such as Woehler's 1828 discovery that urea has the same atomic composition as the chemically distinct ammonium cyanate, Jöns Jacob Berzelius introduced the term isomerism in 1830 to describe the phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|One of Liebig's {{frequent}} collaborators was Friedrich Wöhler. They met in 1826 in Frankfurt, after independently {{reporting on}} the preparation of two substances, cyanic acid and fulminic acid, that apparently had the same composition but very different characteristics. The <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> investigated by Liebig, was explosive, whereas the silver cyanate found by Wöhler, was not. After reviewing the disputed analyses together, they agreed that both were valid.

50|$|Christmas crackers—also {{known as}} bon-bons—are part of Christmas {{celebrations}} {{primarily in the}} United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the central chamber, making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize.

One chemical used for the friction strip is <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fulminates {{are very}} toxic, {{about the same}} as cyanides. When pure, <b>silver</b> <b>fulminate</b> is {{chemically}} very stable, not decomposing after years of storage. Like many silver salts, it darkens with light exposure. It is only slightly soluble in cold water and can be recrystallized using hot water. It can also be recrystallized from a 20% solution of ammonium acetate. It is not hygroscopic and can explode when moist or under water; it was reported to remain explosive after 37 years under water. It explodes upon contact with concentrated sulfuric acid or chlorine or bromine, but not when contacting iodine. It is insoluble in nitric acid, but dissolves in ammonia, alkali chlorides, alkali cyanides, aniline, pyridine, and potassium iodide by forming complexes. Concentrated hydrochloric acid decomposes it non-explosively with a hissing noise; thiosulfate also decomposes it non-explosively, and can be used for disposal.|$|E

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of pressure and temperature on relative phase stability of the polymorphs using planewave pseudopotential approaches based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). van der Waals interactions {{play a significant role}} in predicting the phase stability and they can be effectively captured by semiempirical dispersion correction methods incontrast to standard DFT functionals. Based on our total energy calculations using DFT-D 2 method, the Cmcm structure is found to be the preferred thermodynamic equilibrium phase under studied pressure and temperature range. Hitherto Cmcm and R 3 ̅ phases denoted as α and β-forms of AgCNO, respectively. Also a pressure induced polymorphic phase transition is seen using DFT functionals and the same was not observed with DFT-D 2 method. The equation of state and compressibility of both polymorphic phases were investigated. Electronic structure and optical properties were calculated using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential. The calculated electronic structure shows that α, β phases are indirect band gap insulators with a band gap values of 3. 51 and 4. 43 eV, respectively. The nature of chemical bonding is analyzed through the charge density plots and partial density of states. Optical anisotropy, electric-dipole transitions and photo sensitivity to light of the polymorphs are analyzed from the calculated optical spectra.

40|$|Mercury Fulminate (MF) {{is one of}} the {{well-known}} primary explosives since 17 th century and it has rendered invaluable service over many years. However, the correct molecular and crystal structures are determined recently after 300 years of its discovery. In the present study, we report pressure dependent structural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of MF. Non-local correction methods have been employed to capture the weak van der Waals interactions in layered and molecular energetic MF. Among the non-local correction methods tested, optB 88 -vdW method works well for the investigated compound. The obtained equilibrium bulk modulus reveals that MF is softer than the well known primary explosives <b>Silver</b> <b>Fulminate</b> (SF), silver azide and lead azide. MF exhibits anisotropic compressibility (b>a>c) under pressure, consequently the corresponding elastic moduli decrease in the following order: C 22 >C 11 >C 33. The structural and mechanical properties suggest that MF is more sensitive to detonate along c-axis (similar to RDX) due to high compressibility of Hg [...] . O non-bonded interactions along that axis. Electronic structure and optical properties were calculated including spin-orbit (SO) interactions using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within recently developed Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential. The calculated TB-mBJ electronic structures of SF and MF show that these compounds are indirect bandgap insulators. Also, SO coupling is found to be more pronounced for 4 d and 5 d-states of Ag and Hg atoms of SF and MF, respectively. Partial density of states and electron charge density maps were used to describe the nature of chemical bonding. Ag-C bond is more directional than Hg-C bond which makes SF to be more unstable than MF. The effect of SO coupling on optical properties has also been studied and found to be significant for both of the compounds. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
