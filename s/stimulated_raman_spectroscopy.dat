5000|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{stretching and}} amplification {{is also known}} as amplified time stretch dispersive Fourier transformation (TS-DFT). [...] The amplified time stretch technology was developed earlier to demonstrate analog-to-digital conversion with femtosecond real-time sampling rate [...] and to demonstrate <b>stimulated</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> in single shot at millions of frames per second. Amplified time stretch is a process in which the spectrum of an optical pulse is mapped by large group-velocity dispersion into a slowed down temporal waveform and amplified simultaneously by the process of stimulated Raman scattering. Consequently, the optical spectrum can be captured with a single-pixel photodetector and digitized in real-time. Pulses are repeated for repetitive measurements of the optical spectrum. Amplified time stretch DFT consists of a dispersive fiber pumped by lasers and wavelength-division multiplexers that couple the lasers {{into and out of the}} dispersive fiber. Amplified dispersive Fourier transformation was originally developed to enable ultra wideband analog to digital converters and has also been used for high throughput real-time spectroscopy. The resolution of STEAM imager is mainly determined by diffraction limit, sampling rate of the back-end digitizer, and spatial dispersers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Femtosecond {{broadband}} <b>stimulated</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FSRS) is a {{new technique}} that produces lifetime-limited (time-resolved) vibrational spectra from either the ground or excited electronic states of molecules, free from background fluorescence with very short data acquisition times. The semiclassical coupled-wave and quantum-mechanical descriptions of FSRS will be presented and {{the connection between the}} two will be discussed. A new technique, femtosecond <b>stimulated</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FSRS), has been developed [1 - 4] that (a) circumvents the traditional transform limit which restricts spontaneous Raman to the ps time domain, (b) is free from background fluorescence, and (c) enables observation of vibrational spectra of either the ground or ultrafast (~ 100 fs) excited electronic states with lifetime limited spectral resolution. FSRS uses two NIR-pulses: a narrow bandwidth (1 - 3 ps, ~ 803 nm, 30 - 1500 nJ) Raman pump, and a continuum Stokes probe pulse (30 - 50 fs, 840 - 950 nm, < 20 nJ) to the red of the pump covering vibrations in the range 450 - 2100 cm- 1. When both pump and probe pulses are incident on the sample simultaneously, sharp Raman gain features are observed on top of the continuum probe spectrum, as exemplified in Fig. 1 for ground electronic state FSRS of cyclohexane...|$|E
