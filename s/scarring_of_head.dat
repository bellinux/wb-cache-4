Some of these may be of sufficient size, as for example most tumours, cirsoid angiomas, poren-cephalic cysts, and the <b>scars</b> <b>of</b> penetrating <b>head</b> injuries, so that their presence can usually be revealed by the appropriate clinical and radio-logical examinations. More often, however, the neurological examination is negative (apart from electroencephalography) and cerebral arteriography and encephalography do not disclose any such tangible abnormality. The underlying pathological basis then is a matter for speculation and conjecture. For more than a century it has been known tha...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Scars</b> <b>of</b> Mirrodin is a Magic: The Gathering block, {{consisting}} of the expansion sets <b>Scars</b> <b>of</b> Mirrodin (October 1, 2010), Mirrodin Besieged (February 4, 2011) and New Phyrexia. This block marked the return to the plane of Mirrodin. This plane was last visited in the Mirrodin block that concluded in 2004. The interim tagline for the set was [...] "The Corrosion Begins October 1, 2010." [...] The plans for this set were first made public by mananation.com when {{it was discovered that}} [...] "Scars of Mirrodin", as well as [...] "Mirrodin Pure" [...] and [...] "New Phyrexia" [...] had been registered as trademarks with the US Patent and Trademark Office by Wizards of the Coast. [...] As with the original Mirrodin block, artifacts make up the overarching theme <b>of</b> <b>Scars</b> <b>of</b> Mirrodin; Nearly half of all cards in the set are artifacts. In his May 24 column, Mark Rosewater confirmed that the [...] "Infect" [...] game mechanic in <b>Scars</b> <b>of</b> Mirrodin would bring poison counters back to Magic. All cards (other than basic lands) in the <b>Scars</b> <b>of</b> Mirrodin block carried a watermark, either Mirran or Phyrexian.|$|R
