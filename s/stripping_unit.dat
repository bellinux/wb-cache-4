40|$|An upflow {{anaerobic}} sluge blanket (UASB) reactor showed {{fairly good}} COD removal efficiency for the wastewater from a liner paper factory. Over 70 % of COD removal efficiency were obtained even at 18 g CODA day loading. A {{considerable amount of}} alkalinity was produced in the reactor when sulphate was reduced to hydrogen sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). Calcium was efficiently removed in CO 2 <b>stripping</b> <b>unit</b> where excess alkalinity was consumed to form calcium carbonate. No additional chemical such as caustic soda was necessary to facilitate the formation of calcium carbonate since the degassing of CO 2 increased the pH level in the CO 2 <b>stripping</b> <b>unit.</b> Calcium removal efficiency approached about 80 % {{and the level of}} effluent calcium ranged from 80 to 150 mg/l. Since this system (UASB + CO 2 <b>stripping</b> <b>unit)</b> used biologically produced alkalinity for the formation of calcium carbonate, it can be called a biosoftening process.

Higher temperatures and lower operating pressures increase the stripping factor by increasing both Henry's constant and the mass transfer coefficient.

Experiments, with ammonia bicarbonate model solution and digestate, were conducted.

Complementary to carbon capture activities, significant effort {{is devoted to the}} development of technologies for methanol synthesis by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide.

An additional source of hydrogen at industrial scale is the wet hydrogen by-product of chlorine production.

The predicted results from the rate-based model also agree reasonably well with pilot plant results including CO 2 absorption rate and NH 3 loss rate. The rate- based model is then utilized for the extended study of the effect of operation pressure, aqueous NH 3 concentration and liquid inlet temperature on the CO 2 absorption and NH 3 loss.

A synthetic influent containing NH 4 -N (2, 000 mg/L) was initially fed to promote biomass acclimation, then real sour water containing also organic substrate, cyanides, sulphides and phenols was supplied. With both synthetic and real wastewater, the applied Ci/N molar ratio was progressively increased from 1 to 2 and the SHARON reactor produced an effluent suitable for further treatment by autotrophic ANAMMOX or heterotrophic denitritation, respectively. Acute toxicity assessments based on the specific measurement of nitritation activity confirmed that biomass acclimation to the toxic substances contained in the real wastewater occurred successfully. Moreover, high removal of organic matter (73 %) suggested {{the absence of any}} competition between heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{short-lived}} intermediate in several {{processes of the}} oceanic nitrogen cycle, whereby denitrification {{is assumed to be}} the major pathway for NO in the ocean. Therefore, measurements of dissolved nitric oxide could be used to identify hot-spots of ongoing denitrification. Despite the fact that until today many laboratory studies about the role of nitric oxide in the nitrogen cycle have been performed, only a few depth profiles of dissolved nitric oxide from oceanic regions such as the eastern tropical North Pacific are available. One reason for this is the demanding analytical instrumentation necessary to detect the reactive and thus short-lived NO in seawater samples.

The first field test of this set up took place during a cruise near the coast of Peru in February 2013 (SFB 754 cruise M 93).

40|$|Enhanced {{separation}} of sodium and aluminum in Bayer spent liquor {{has been a}} challenge of the alumina industry for decades {{in its effort to}} obtain a stream of caustic solutions with high MR (molar ratio of Na 2 O to Al 2 O 3) to treat red mud. The existing methods are too energy-intensive to use in practice. Solvent extraction technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its high selectivity and efficiency. However, the extraction capacities of extractants as reported in the literature are insufficiently high, requiring multiple-stage extraction and high organic-to-aqueous phase ratio. In this paper, the mechanisms for the extraction of sodium from Bayer liquor using alkyl phenol weak organic acids are investigated in terms of their structures and acidities, and an optimized extractant consisting of 2 -tert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol dissolved in 1 -octonal was selected due to its high sodium extraction capacities. The equilibrium relations between equilibrated organic sodium concentration and aqueous alkaline concentration for sodium extraction from sodium aluminate solutions under different concentrations of organic acid at various temperatures were systematically investigated. The equilibrium data obtained using 1 mol/L 2 -tert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol diluted by 1 -octonal at 40 degrees C for extraction and stripping were used to design the extraction parameters to achieve a sodium extraction efficiency of 50 %. The results of the extraction of a two-stage countercurrent experiment in laboratory scale verified the design parameters. Sodium extraction efficiency of 40. 4 % was achieved.

Ground water at the site is encountered in the Triassic age Stockton Formation, which consists of gently dipping, alternating sandstone and mudstone units. Ground-water flow is primarily through fractures in the coarser grained units, while the finer grained mudstones generally act as semi-confining units. An aggressive pump-and-treat remedy was selected for the site, {{with the goal of}} source area containment and mass removal. A municipal water supply well in operation approximately 2, 000 feet downgradient from the site has been impacted by site-related and non site-related contamination. An air <b>stripping</b> <b>unit</b> on the municipal well is used to treat the water prior to public consumption. The remedial approach included the installation of extraction wells in the DNAPL zone. Extensive real-time hydraulic and water-quality testing and analysis and DNAPL screening procedures were employed through an iterative process during the installation of extraction wells to address the inherent uncertainties of fracture flow and minimize the potential for DNAPL migration. Measures were also taken to safeguard the municipal well against the possibility of contamination being released during the remedy implementation. A Technical Impracticability (TI) evaluation was also performed, and a TI Waiver subsequently was granted by EPA for the site to waive applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) in the DNAPL zone.
