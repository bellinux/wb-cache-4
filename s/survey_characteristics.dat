40|$|Abstract Fifty-nine methodological {{studies were}} {{designed}} to esti-mate the magnitude of nonresponse bias in statistics of interest. These studies {{use a variety of}} designs: sampling frames with rich variables, data from administrative records matched to sample case, use of screening-interview data to describe nonrespondents to main interviews, followup of nonrespondents to initial phases of field effort, and measures of be-havior intentions to respond to a survey. This permits exploration of which circumstances produce a relationship between nonresponse rates and nonresponse bias and which, do not.

40|$|Response rates can be {{calculated}} by various means, allowing the researchers the usage of different disposition codes, which in turn can result in vastly different response rates for the same survey. One of the most comprehensive reporting conventions is the ‘Standard Definitions’ by the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), which describes specific definitions of disposition codes and various outcome rates in great detail, allowing for only a marginal variance of results. In this inquiry, {{we aim to document}} the reporting of response rates and other <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> in recent publications of scientific journals. Our analyses are based on two sample of articles, which allow a comparison with earlier reviews as well as between different scientific disciplines. Our findings show, that while there is an overall increase in the reporting of response rates and other defining <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics,</b> these improvements are from universal. While the AAPOR standard might be considered an established convention within the survey research community, other disciplines of the social sciences can be considered far more heterogeneous in their reporting styles. A comparison between social sciences and public health journals reveals further a mostly similar reporting pattern, with only specific details underreported in the latter...|$|E

40|$|Web {{surveys are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular in survey research. Compared with face-to-face, telephone and mail surveys, web surveys may contain a different and new source of measurement error and bias: the type of device that respondents use to answer the survey questions. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first study that tests whether the use of mobile devices affects <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> and stated preferences in a web-based choice experiment. The web survey was carried out in Germany with 3, 400 respondents, of which 12 per cent used a mobile device (i. e. tablet or smartphone), and comprised a stated choice experiment on externalities of renewable energy production using wind, solar and biomass. Our main finding is that <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as interview length and acquiescence tendency are affected by the device used. In contrast to what might be expected, we find that, compared with respondents using desktop computers and laptops, mobile device users spent more time to answer the survey and {{are less likely to be}} prone to acquiescence bias. In the choice experiment, mobile device users tended to be more consistent in their stated choices, and there are differences in willingness to pay between both subsamples...|$|E

40|$|The study {{addresses}} the comparability of child labour estimates produced by different common household survey instruments. This question {{has important implications}} for credibility of published estimates of child labour, and for the reliability of current survey instruments as tools for monitoring and guiding efforts towards the progressive elimination of child labour. The study, covering some 87 datasets for 35 countries, first confirms that estimates of child labour vary significantly across different kinds of surveys. The variation, moreover, appears to be substantially larger than that relative to other children’s activities like schooling. The study then addresses whether the observed significant differences in estimates are due to difference in population characteristics or to other features of the surveys. In other words, whether different populations are targeted by the various surveys, or whether they address the same (or very similar) population with different instruments. The empirical results indicate that it is the latter explanation, i. e., differences in survey features are most relevant. Differences in observable <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as questionnaire type and fieldwork season explain some of the variation in child labour estimates across survey instruments, but a larger part of the variation stems from unobservable <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Elements of the survey process not spelled out in the survey documentation, such as interview methods, the familiarity of interviewers with child labour concepts, the accuracy of data coding and processing, are all likely to be important in this context. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we intend to}} {{identify}} the research trends manifested {{in the literature on}} the <b>survey</b> interviewer <b>characteristic’s.</b> A first objective pursued was to identify the distribution of research topics, their territorial distribution and their dynamics expressed in the study of <b>survey</b> interviewer <b>characteristics.</b> A second objective was to verify if the publication of articles in a journal depends on the theme, on the geographical area from which the author came or on the period of the research. In order to achieve these objectives we used descriptive statistics, multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression. Using the statistical software R statistical data were processed. For the analyzed sample, the results of statistical analysis showed that a signifi cant number of articles have been published by American and European researchers. Most these articles were published after 2000, and the main research theme is the analysis of the <b>survey</b> interviewer <b>characteristics.</b> The data analysis shows that the moment of publication of the research results in a prestigious journal depends on economic, political, social and cultural context characteristic of geographical area from which the author comes.

40|$|Accurate {{statistical}} measurement {{with large}} imaging surveys has traditionally required throwing away a sizable {{fraction of the}} data. This is because most measurements have have relied on selecting nearly complete samples, where variations {{in the composition of}} the galaxy population with seeing, depth, or other <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> are small. We introduce a new measurement method that aims to minimize this wastage, allowing precision measurement for any class of stars or galaxies detectable in an imaging survey. We have implemented our proposal in Balrog, a software package which embeds fake objects in real imaging in order to accurately characterize measurement biases. We demonstrate this technique with an angular clustering measurement using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We first show that recovery of our injected galaxies depends {{on a wide variety of}} <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> in the same way as the real data. We then construct a flux-limited sample of the faintest galaxies in DES, chosen specifically for their sensitivity to depth and seeing variations. Using the synthetic galaxies as randoms in the standard Landy-Szalay correlation function estimator suppresses the effects of variable survey selection by at least two orders of magnitude. With this correction, our measured angular clustering is found to be in excellent agreement with that of a matched sample drawn from much deeper, higher-resolution space-based Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) imaging; over angular scales of 0. 004 ^∘ < θ < 0. 2 ^∘, we find a best-fit scaling amplitude between the DES and COSMOS measurements of 1. 00 ± 0. 09. We expect this methodology to be broadly useful for extending the statistical reach of measurements in a wide variety of coming imaging surveys. Comment: 24 pages, 17 figures. This is the version accepted by MNRAS. Changes compared to the original version are very minimal; the biggest update is including a curve for a theoretical model in the clustering result...|$|E
40|$|Can {{existing}} longitudinal surveys {{profit from}} the (financial) advantages of web surveying by switching survey mode from face-to-face interviews to web surveys? Before such a radical change in data collection procedure can be undertaken, {{it needs to be}} established that mode effects cannot confound the responses to the survey items. To this end, the responses of the Dutch European Values Study of 2008 were compared to the responses of a time parallel web survey. The responses on 163 of the 256 items differed significantly across modes. To explain these response differences between modes, an exploratory crisp set qualitative comparative analysis approach was used. Five sufficient conditions—combinations of survey mode characteristics—but no necessary conditions for response differences between survey modes were found. Two <b>survey</b> <b>characteristics</b> were neither necessary nor sufficient to produce the outcome. Results suggest that switching modes may affect comparability between waves in a longitudinal survey.

To maintain uninterrupted time series, surveys conducted by national statistical institutes are often kept unchanged {{as long as}} possible. To improve the quality or efficiency of a survey process, however, it remains inevitable to adjust methods or redesign this process from time to time.
