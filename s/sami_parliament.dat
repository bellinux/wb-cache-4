The period also saw an increased immigration of unskilled labor from developing countries, especially Pakistan, although regulations from 1975 slowed this significantly. Oslo became the center-point of immigration. The Alta controversy started in the 1970s when Statkraft planned to dam the Alta River. The case united the environmental and Sami interest groups; although Alta Power Station was built, the issue shifted the political climate and made large-scale hydroelectricity project difficult to built.

25|$|The Sami {{languages}} are indigenous minority languages in Scandinavia. They belong {{to their own}} branch of the Uralic language family and are unrelated to the North Germanic languages other than by limited grammatical (particularly lexical) characteristics resulting from prolonged contact. Sami is divided into several languages or dialects.

According to the Sami Information Centre of the <b>Sami</b> <b>Parliament</b> in Sweden, southern Sami may have originated in an earlier migration from the south into the Scandinavian peninsula.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} before the 2009 {{parliamentary}} elections, the party had, as in the 2001 election, rated very highly in opinion poll results which however declined towards the actual election. Earlier in the year, the Progress Party had achieved above 30% in some polls which made it the largest party by several percentage points. With such high gains, the election result was in this case relatively disappointing. Before the election the gains continued to decrease, with most of these losses going to the Conservative Party which had a surprisingly successful campaign. The decline in support {{over a longer period}} of time can also be seen as the Labour Party was since 2008 accused of [...] "stealing" [...] policies from the Progress Party. The Progress Party did, regardless, achieve a slight gain from the 2005 election with 22.9%, the best election result in the party's history. It also for the first time got represented in the <b>Sami</b> <b>Parliament</b> of Norway in 2009, with three representatives. This made it the fourth largest party in the <b>Sami</b> <b>parliament,</b> and second largest of the nationwide parties. In the 2009 informal school elections, it became the largest party in Norway with 24% of the votes.|$|E
50|$|On 16 November 2005 in Helsinki, a {{group of}} experts, led by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway Professor Carsten Smith, {{submitted}} {{a proposal for a}} Nordic Sami Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for Sami affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three <b>Sami</b> <b>Parliaments</b> from the respective countries. This convention recognizes the Sami as one indigenous people residing across national borders in all three countries. A set of minimum standards is proposed for the rights of developing the Sami language and culture and rights to land and water, livelihoods and society. The convention has not yet been ratified in the Nordic countries.|$|R
40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} of Finland, Sweden and Norway {{is home to}} the Sámi people, an indigenous group that has in recent decades gone from political marginalization to empowerment. The strongest symbols of this political movement are the <b>Sámi</b> <b>parliaments,</b> political institutions that have been delegated power over Sámi cultural affairs. These parliaments are the main vehicle for maintaining and re-vitalizing the Sámi culture and language, both which have suffered greatly from assimilation policies of the Nordic states. However, the Sámi political sphere is currently marked by disunity among the three parliaments. As each has its own electorate, they all have their own electoral criteria as well, meaning there are three different interpretations on who is Sámi. How can this be? This thesis is a qualitative study on the three Sámi electoral criteria, with the research question why is there a difference in criteria among Sámi electorates in Norway, Sweden and Finland?" Through the method of process-tracing, the sequence of events that lead to the status quo is analyzed by looking at key events, documents, history and interviews. Debates are taking place within the Sámi political sphere between those who are excluded from enrolling in Sámi electorates, and those of the Sámi political establishment not recognizing them as Sámi. This debate is fueled by a perspective on identity held by some Sámi politicians known as essentialism, a belief that view re-vitalization of a culture impossible. Once a person has lost their Sámi- ness, it can never be regained. The findings and conclusion point towards an equifinal answer. The historical and external factors influencing the Sámi world has divided it, which means the <b>Sámi</b> <b>parliaments</b> each face different conditions and have acted in the interest of its own Sámi population...|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} many efforts {{over the years by}} Finnish {{authorities}} to safeguard the Sami' culture and way of life and to ease their entry into modern society. Officials created bodies that dealt with the Sami minority, or formed committees that studied their situation. An early body was the Society for the Promotion of Lapp Culture, formed in 1932. In 1960 the government created the Advisory Commission on Lapp Affairs. The Sami themselves formed the Saami-liitto in 1945 and the Johti Sabmelazzat, a more aggressive organization, in 1968. In 1973 the government arranged for elections every four years to a twenty-member <b>Sami</b> <b>Parliaments</b> that was to advise authorities. On the international level, there was the Nordic Sami Council of 1956, {{and there has been a}} regularly occurring regional conference since then that represented—in addition to Finland's Sami—Norway's 20,000 Sami, Sweden's 10,000 Sami, and the 1,000 to 2,000 Sami who remained in the Kola Peninsula in Russia.|$|R

40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is the {{identity}} politics of the Sami movement in Finland between 1945 - 1990. The focus is on developments in the representational strategies of the Sami elite, which evolved from threatened Sami culture via modernising Sami to the most obvious loan from the Indigenous Peoples’ Movement, the “natural people” imagery. The political space underwent profound changes in the 1970 s. The Sami elite found themselves in the institutionalised political space after {{the establishment of the}} Sami Delegation, the first of the <b>Sami</b> <b>Parliaments</b> in Nordic countries in 1973. A longer process of internationalisation, participation in the global Indigenous Peoples’ movement, resulted, among other things, to an internal division within the Sami identity politics, as the institutionalised Sami movement chose to concentrate on judicial reasoning, while the ”Independents” could use more radical ”ecologized” representational strategies. Neither of these strategies was legitimised in the minority politics of Finland. The land rights claims were sometimes ignored as encroachments to the formal equality provided by the Finnish society and the ecological reputation of the Sami under new hegemonic alternative discourse of environmentalism deteriorated fast. The use of the global rights discourse proved to be problematic in the Finnish political context. The possibility to ”guilt-trip” the national bodies was stunted by the institutionalisation, which enclosed the Sami activity to the national political frame, in its required political culture and rendered parts of the global indigenous imagery useless. The Sami in Finland can only point out to restricted successes in ”soft” issues, not in those of their interests, i. e. the land rights...|$|R
5000|$|Sámi {{refer to}} {{themselves}} as Sámit (the Sámis) or Sápmelaš (of Sámi kin), the word Sámi being inflected into various grammatical forms. It has been proposed that Sámi (presumably borrowed from the Proto-Finnic word), Häme (Finnish for Tavastia) ( [...] ← Proto-Finnic *šämä, the second ä still being found in the archaic derivation Hämäläinen), and perhaps Suomi (Finnish for Finland) (← *sōme-/sōma-, compare suomalainen, supposedly borrowed from a Proto-Germanic source *sōma- from Proto-Baltic *sāma-, in turn borrowed from Proto-Finnic *šämä) are of the same origin and ultimately borrowed from the Baltic word *žēmē, meaning [...] "land". The Baltic word is cognate with Slavic земля (zemlja), which also means [...] "land".The <b>Sámi</b> institutions—notably the <b>parliaments,</b> radio and TV stations, theatres, etc.—all use the term Sámi, including when addressing outsiders in Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or English.

2500|$|In 2011, {{however, the}} role of Sámi culture in Tromsø became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Tromsø to join the Sámi Language Administrative Area.
