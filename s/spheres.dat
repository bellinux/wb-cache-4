5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of <b>spheres</b> describe how <b>spheres</b> of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of <b>spheres</b> viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|Special Stages are {{entered by}} finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player {{is placed in}} a 3D {{environment}} and must turn all {{of a number of}} blue <b>spheres</b> red by running through them, but must avoid all red <b>spheres,</b> including formerly blue ones. Yellow <b>spheres</b> bounce the player long distances, and white <b>spheres</b> with red stars on them make the player walk backwards in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into Super Sonic or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.|$|E
5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial <b>spheres</b> to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the celestial <b>spheres</b> were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternative}} to inner <b>sphere</b> electron transfer is outer <b>sphere</b> electron transfer. In any transition metal redox process, the mechanism {{can be assumed}} to be outer <b>sphere</b> unless {{the conditions of the}} inner <b>sphere</b> are met. Inner <b>sphere</b> electron transfer is generally enthalpically more favorable than outer <b>sphere</b> electron transfer due to a larger degree of interaction between the metal centers involved, however, inner <b>sphere</b> electron transfer is usually entropically less favorable since the two sites involved must become more ordered (come together via a bridge) than in outer <b>sphere</b> electron transfer.|$|R

5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given <b>spheres,</b> can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution <b>spheres</b> can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given <b>spheres.</b> There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

50|$|Inversion is self-inverse, and fixes {{the points}} {{lying on the}} <b>sphere.</b> The inverse of a line is a circle through {{the centre of the}} {{reference}} <b>sphere,</b> and vice versa.

50|$|Intuitively, the conformally flat {{geometry}} of a <b>sphere</b> is less rigid than the Riemannian {{geometry of}} a <b>sphere.</b> Conformal symmetries of a <b>sphere</b> are {{generated by the}} inversion {{in all of its}} hyperspheres. On the other hand, Riemannian isometries of a <b>sphere</b> are generated by inversions in geodesic hyperspheres (see the Cartan-Dieudonné theorem.) The Euclidean <b>sphere</b> can be mapped to the conformal <b>sphere</b> in a canonical manner, but not vice versa.|$|R
5|$|The main {{residual}} {{uncertainty in the}} early measurements was in the measurement of the isotopic composition of the silicon to calculate the atomic weight, so in 2007 a 4.8kg single crystal of isotopically-enriched silicon (99.94% 28Si) was grown, and two one-kilogram <b>spheres</b> cut from it. Diameter measurements on the <b>spheres</b> are repeatable to within 0.3nm, and the uncertainty in the mass is 3µg. Full results from these determinations were expected in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished <b>spheres</b> {{of silicon}} {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. <b>Spheres</b> are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating that inevitably forms on the surface. The first measurements used <b>spheres</b> of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a relative uncertainty of 3.1. These first results were also inconsistent with values of the Planck constant derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of the discrepancy is now believed to be known.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They are {{thrown out of the}} base and start to fall to their deaths, but a beam of light from the base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating <b>spheres</b> {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the <b>spheres.</b> The party refuses, and instead hold onto the <b>spheres</b> for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the <b>spheres.</b> As they consume the <b>spheres,</b> a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E
5000|$|In geometry, {{inversion}} in a <b>sphere</b> is {{a transformation}} of Euclidean space that fixes the points of a <b>sphere</b> while sending the points inside of the <b>sphere</b> {{to the outside of}} the <b>sphere,</b> and vice versa. Intuitively, it [...] "swaps the inside and outside" [...] of the <b>sphere</b> while leaving the points on the <b>sphere</b> unchanged. Inversion is a conformal transformation, and is the basic operation of inversive geometry.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes one defines an {{incompressible}} <b>sphere</b> to be a 2-sphere in a 3-manifold {{that does}} not bound a 3-ball. Thus, such a <b>sphere</b> either does not separate the 3-manifold or gives a nontrivial connected sum decomposition. Since this notion of incompressibility for a <b>sphere</b> {{is quite different from}} the above definition for surfaces, often an incompressible <b>sphere</b> is instead referred to as an essential <b>sphere</b> or reducing <b>sphere.</b>|$|R

5|$|The second type, {{triggered}} by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a 3D map and passing {{through all of}} a number of blue <b>spheres</b> arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue <b>spheres,</b> in which case all of these <b>spheres</b> turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue <b>spheres</b> gives the player a Chaos Emerald; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become Super Sonic at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles. Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a post-credits scene in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.|$|E
5|$|Using an even simpler {{approximation}} of the ions as impenetrable hard <b>spheres,</b> {{the arrangement of}} anions in these systems are often related to close-packed arrangements of <b>spheres,</b> with the cations occupying tetrahedral or octahedral interstices. Depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound, and the coordination (principally determined by the radius ratio) of cations and anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed, and theoretically rationalized by Pauling's rules.|$|E
