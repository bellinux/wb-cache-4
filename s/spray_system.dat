25|$|After {{the loss}} of site power and reactor shutdown, Unit 1 was {{initially}} cooled using the isolation condenser system. About 10minutes after the earthquake, TEPCO operators removed both of Unit 1's isolation condensers from service, and instead chose to activate the HPCI (High Pressure Coolant Injection) systems to cool the reactor and the core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> was activated at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool. The core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> was disabled with AC power loss at 15:37 (The tsunami) and the HPCI system failed following DC (i.e., battery back up) power loss.|$|E
25|$|In August, TEPCO began {{considering}} {{changing the}} core injection method for the no. 3 reactor {{as it was}} requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized {{that this may be}} because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen {{to the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|E
25|$|After some {{positive}} effect was noticed using both the core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> and feed water piping, TEPCO decided on 16 September {{to increase the}} amount of water pumped into the No. 2 reactor by one ton, in an attempt to further lower the temperature in the core, to a total of 7 tons per hour. The same was done for reactor No. 3, where 5 tons were added, bring the total to 12 tons per hour. TEPCO also added that the volume of cooling water into the No. 1 reactor would be increased as necessary.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} air-and-water <b>spraying</b> <b>systems,</b> designed at the KOMAG Institute of Mining Technology, used in longwall shearers, in roadheaders, at transfer points of conveyors and in roadways. The simple and lightweight design of roadway <b>spraying</b> <b>systems</b> {{ensures that the}} solutions can be used anywhere that dust occurs in the air. The <b>spraying</b> <b>systems</b> form {{an integral part of}} longwall shearers, and their function is to reduce airborne dust levels and to prevent methane explosion. The use of air-and-water <b>spraying</b> <b>systems</b> can reduce dust concentration by up to 80 % and they contribute to a significant reduction of dust concentration in the air. Some results of tests concerning the effectiveness of air-and-water spraying devices are presented, verification tests of the author’s solutions for spraying nozzles are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|An energy tower (also {{known as}} a {{downdraft}} energy tower, because the air flows down the tower) is a tall (1,000 meters) and wide (400 meters) hollow cylinder with a water <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> at the top. Pumps lift the water {{to the top of}} the tower and then spray the water inside the tower. Evaporation of water cools the hot, dry air hovering at the top. The cooled air, now denser than the outside warmer air, falls through the cylinder, spinning a turbine at the bottom. The turbine drives a generator which produces the electricity.|$|E
25|$|According to the Jerusalem Talmud's definition, {{the use of}} the Venturi tube <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> {{and spray}} {{painting}} would come under this prohibition, while butane or propane propelled sprays, which are common in deodorants and air fresheners, etc. are permissible to operate as the dispersal force generated isn't from air, rather from the propellent within the can. According to the Babylonian Talmud's definition, neither of the above spraying methods is involved in sorting undesirable from desirable and therefore not part of this heading. However, as mentioned, the Rema rules that, unusually, the Jerusalem Talmud's definition is the applicable one.|$|E

Further protection against fire was supplied by a foam <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> fed by two rows of pipes and nozzles running along the walls and ends of the hangars. The lower hangar could also be flooded with carbon dioxide where the likelihood of fuel vapor build-up was greatest.|$|E

25|$|On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting {{water into}} the No. 2 reactor using the core <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> piping in {{addition}} to the feed water piping already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing the temperature in the No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature {{at the bottom of the}} No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92°F), compared to the 84.9°C degrees(184.82°F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3°C (214.34°F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.|$|E
