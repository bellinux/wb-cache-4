25|$|The Royal Navy {{took her}} into service as HMS Arrogante. She arrived at Plymouth in April 1798 and she <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> In August, the Navy renamed her HMS Insolent, {{but did not}} refit her until February to April 1801. On 24 April Lieutenant Burians, a veteran officer, {{commissioned}} her.|$|E
25|$|Renard {{arrived in}} Plymouth on 12 January 1799. She <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for six months, finally {{undergoing}} fitting between July 1799 and January 1800. While undergoing fitting {{she may have}} received additional cannons and extensive upperworks to hold them. There is some question though whether she in fact received the additional armament and upperworks (see below). Commander Peter Spicer commissioned Renard in August 1799 for the Channel.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1785 the Congress met in New York City {{under the}} Articles of Confederation. In 1789, New York City {{became the first}} {{national}} capital of the United States under the new United States Constitution. The Constitution also created the current Congress of the United States, and its first sitting was at Federal Hall on Wall Street. The first United States Supreme Court <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> The United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified there. George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall. New York City remained {{the capital of the}} U.S. until 1790, when the role was transferred to Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|The N-1M {{proved to}} be {{basically}} sound, {{paving the way for}} Northrop's later and much larger Northrop YB-35 and YB-49 aircraft. The pioneering aircraft was then donated to the United States Army Air Forces in 1945 and was placed in the storage collection of the National Air Museum the following year. It <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for nearly three decades, but was finally brought back to static, non-flying status, in its final flight configuration, after several years of painstaking restoration during the 1980s. The N-1M is now on public display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} that when mental {{rotation}} {{is used as a}} predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on <b>SAT,</b> <b>there</b> was a significant difference in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E

25|$|The 33rd-floor {{boardroom}} {{contained a}} massive oval {{table with a}} Macassar ebony veneer. The hallway leading to the boardroom and solarium contained coat hooks {{for each of the}} board members and senior officers. The foyer had a chart listing the presidents and board members of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society through the years and where they sat at the boardroom table. The foyer also featured a sketch of the old Walnut Street Headquarters and a list of bank offices and the dates they opened. The board room was decorated with portraits of the bank's founders and its presidents. The chairs around the board table each have a plaque on the back that showed the number of the chair and the names of the current and previous board members who <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1885 Hobhouse {{accepted}} a peerage as Baron Hobhouse, of Hadspen in the County of Somerset, {{with a view}} to assisting in the judicial work of the House of Lords, but a statutory qualification by which only judges of the high courts of the United Kingdom could sit to hear appeals had been overlooked. In 1887 the disqualification was removed by Act of Parliament in regard to members of the Judicial Committee; but Hobhouse did not take up the work of a judge in the House of Lords. He only <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> to try three cases, in two of which, Russell v. Countess of Russell (1897 Appeal Cases 395) and the Kempton Park case (1899 Appeal Cases 143), he was in a dissenting minority. As a judge Hobhouse, who was always careful and painstaking, invariably stated the various arguments fully and fairly, but he was tenacious of his deliberately formed opinion.|$|E
25|$|When {{a new set}} {{of county}} commissioners decided to remove the display cases, the local American Legion post then {{displayed}} Brostrom's Medal of Honor. In time, local veterans dwindled and the Legion Hall was taken over by the County. The last commander of the Preston American Legion Chapter in Preston then took Brostrom's display home for safe keeping. By this time, all of Brostrom's family had died except for a niece, who did not want the Medal of Honor display, citing that she {{would not be able to}} preserve it properly. A local lawyer, Jay MacKenzie, was asked to keep the display safe in his office. The medal <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> until a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Sherman L. Fleek, who was then the command historian for the United States Military Academy at West Point and doing research on Pfc. Brostrom's life, called MacKenzie. This eventually led to a discussion of how to properly honor Brostrom and display his Medal of Honor. Since Brostrom had been a lifetime member of the LDS Church, the Church History Library was contacted and agreed to preserve and display the medal there.|$|E

And yet had we two <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> by the wayside, or on that English stile, which {{attracted}} {{your attention}} so much; had we <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> and thrown forth each his own dream, each his own knowledge, {{it would have}} saved much that we must now forever regret.

500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E

I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|... "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} episode and was particularly {{excited by the}} guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was [...] "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have [...] "run their course". Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, {{and that it was}} touching to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, [...] "The rest of the story lines from last night just kind of <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> rather limply," [...] and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, [...] "just seemed so dumpy for this once-sexy show".|$|E

500|$|Germain {{left the}} series in 1993, and several new writers {{replaced}} him. At that time, Nickelodeon permitted {{the writers and}} animators to include a storyline {{about the death of}} Chuckie's mother. The development of the Rugrats Mother's Day television special was announced on December 7, 1996. Kim Cattrall provided the voice for Chuckie's mother, Melinda Finster. Germain described the episode as [...] "this whole very maudlin thing," [...] and said that he was disappointed over his inability to cover the topic. He explained: [...] "I just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> thinking, 'We weren't allowed to do this, and now you guys are doing it.' That's something I regret." [...] Mary Harrington, a supervising producer of animation for Nickelodeon, described it as one of her favorite episodes of Rugrats, and commended the writers and producers for their handling of the subject matter.|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage â€“ it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E

Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, I found that I can't really allow myself to think about those things.
