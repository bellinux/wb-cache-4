25|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>ion</b> mass {{spectrometry}} (SIMS) {{is a method}} very similar to FAB in that a beam of particles is fired against {{the surface of a}} sample in order to cause sputtering, in which the molecules of the sample ionize and leave the surface, thus allowing for the ions or the sample to be analyzed. The primary difference is that in SIMS, an ion beam is fired against the surface, but in FAB, an atom beam is fired against the surface. The other primary difference, of more interest to this page, is that, unlike FAB, SIMS is typically performed on a solid sample with little sample preparation required.|$|E

An electrostatic field captures the <b>secondary</b> <b>ions</b> that leave the sample surface; these extracted ions are then transferred to a mass spectrometer. In order to achieve precise isotope measurements, {{there is a need for}} high transmission and high mass resolution. High transmission refers to the low loss of <b>secondary</b> <b>ions</b> between the sample surface and the detector, and high mass resolution refers to the ability to efficiently separate the <b>secondary</b> <b>ions</b> (or molecules of interest) from other ions and/or ions of similar mass. Primary ions will collide with the surface at a specific frequency per unit of surface area. The collision that occurs causes atoms to sputter from the sample surface, and of these atoms only a small amount will undergo ionization.

2500|$|Presolar grains are {{investigated}} using scanning or {{transmission electron microscopes}} (SEM/TEM), {{and mass}} spectrometric methods (noble gas mass spectrometry, resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS), <b>secondary</b> <b>ion</b> mass spectrometry (SIMS, NanoSIMS)). [...] Presolar grains that consist of diamonds {{are only a few}} nanometers in size and are, therefore, called nanodiamonds. Because of their small size, nanodiamonds are hard to investigate and, although they are among the first presolar grains discovered, relatively little is known about them. [...] The typical sizes of other presolar grains are in the range of micrometers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 diamond {{grains and}} silicon carbide grains [...] {{were found to}} exist abundantly in those same acid-insoluble {{residues}} and also to contain large concentrations of noble gases. Significant isotopic anomalies were in turn measured by improvements in <b>secondary</b> <b>ion</b> mass spectrometry within the structural chemical elements of these grains. Improved SIMS experiments showed that the silicon isotopes within each SiC grain did not have solar isotopic ratios but rather those expected in certain red-giant stars. The finding of stardust is therefore dated 1987. To measure the isotopic abundance ratios of the structural elements (e.g. silicon in an SiC grain) in microscopic stardust grains had required two difficult technological and scientific steps: 1) locating micron-sized stardust grains within the meteorite's overwhelming mass; 2) development of SIMS technology to a sufficiently high level to measure isotopic abundance ratios within micron-sized grains. Ernst Zinner became the undisputed leader of SIMS applications to microscopic grains, earning him historic acclaim.|$|E
2500|$|The most studied trace and isotopic {{signatures}} are strontium due to {{the same}} charge and similar ionic radius to calcium; however, scientists can study multiple trace elements within an otolith to discriminate more specific signatures. [...] A common tool used to measure trace elements in an otolith is a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. [...] This tool can measure a variety of trace elements simultaneously. [...] A <b>secondary</b> <b>ion</b> mass spectrometer can also be used. [...] This instrument can allow for greater chemical resolution but can only measure one trace element at a time. The hope {{of this research is}} to provide scientists with valuable information on where fish have traveled. [...] Combined with otolith annuli, scientists can add how old fish were when they traveled through different water bodies. [...] All this information can be used to determine fish life cycles so that fisheries scientists can make better informed decisions about fish stocks.|$|E

2500|$|In DESI, {{there is}} a {{high-velocity}} pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample {{where it can be}} desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing <b>secondary</b> <b>ion</b> droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which the sprayer can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300°C with newer stages having built in CCD’s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI [...] is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.|$|E

Therefore, within the SIMS spectra collected from the CytoC-COOH-SAM samples, we should observe an enrichment of <b>secondary</b> <b>ions</b> from the leucine and glutamic acid residues. We hypothesize that on the NH 2 -SAMs, the heme group is pointed towards the vacuum interface.
