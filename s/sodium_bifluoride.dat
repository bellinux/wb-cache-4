40|$|Data are {{presented}} on {{the properties of}} alkali metal and alkaline earth hydrofiuor-ides. Melting, thermal decomposition and interaction of hydrofluorides with various classes of inorganic substances are discussed. Some regularities of changes in thermal properties within the sequences of the above hydrofluorides are established. Future directions of {{research in this field}} are outlined. In view of the increasing interest in the thermal properties of hydrofluorides [1], it appears timely to summarize some results and outline the future prospects in this field. In the present paper, we attempt to survey the data available, aiming at critical analysis, systematization a d generalization. When hydrofluorides are heated, different ypes of behaviour are observed: some hydrofluorides melt congruously, others melt incongruently, while a num-ber of hydrofluorides, including e. g. lithium and <b>sodium</b> <b>bifluorides</b> and alkaline earth hydrofluorides, decompose before melting.

Because the fluoride anion is highly basic, many alkali metal fluorides form bifluorides with the formula MHF2. <b>Sodium</b> and potassium <b>bifluorides</b> are significant to the chemical industry. Among other monofluorides, only silver(I) and thallium(I) fluorides are well-characterized. Both are very soluble, unlike the other halides of those metals.|$|R

The {{general theory of}} line shapes in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments is first outlined in some detail, and results important to the ensuing discussion are derived. A radiofrequency spectrometer has been assembled, and its design, construction, and operation are described. The fine structure problem for collinear systems of three interacting spins is solved by application of perturbation theory. Application is then made to the special case represented by the bifluoride ion. Experimental determinations of the line shapes and mean square line widths are made for the proton and fluorine resonances in potassium bifluoride, and interpreted {{in terms of the}} configuration of the ion. The equilibrium position for the proton is found to be within ? 0. 05 A. U. of the center of the ion axis. Similar experiments performed on <b>sodium</b> <b>bifluoride</b> are less conclusive, but limits are set on the possible configurations of the [ [...] . ] ion in this salt. Line width studies have been made on a number of crystalline coordination complexes. It is found that the cobalt (III) hexammine ion possesses freedom of reorientation in the lattice, but that no such freedom exists in other related compounds which were studied.
