25|$|His point {{effectively}} made, Akaitcho {{discussed his}} terms with Franklin. In {{return for the}} cancellation of his tribe's debts to the North West Company, and a supply of weapons, ammunition and tobacco, his men would hunt and guide for Franklin on the northward journey down the Coppermine River, and leave depots of food for their return. However, they would not enter the Inuit lands at the far north of the river (they and the Inuit viewed each other with mutual hostility and suspicion), and Akaitcho warned Franklin that in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> year, he could not guarantee that food would always be available.|$|E
25|$|R. romandi nests {{are often}} built under the eaves of buildings. When built on <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> surface, the nest, entirely covered by an envelope, forms a {{compressed}} hemisphere with multiple horizontal, flat combs, the largest comb being near the bottom. These combs {{are connected to}} each other within the envelope by ribbon-like pedicles. Cells are hexagonal and regularly arranged. The envelope is mostly single layered, however it can be double layered in parts. It is made of plant fibers and fragments and is a uniform light gray color. It is possible for the envelope to be heavily coated in saliva {{to the extent that}} the fibrous material of the envelope itself is completely hidden. A round entrance hole is at the bottom of the hemispherical nest.|$|E
25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E

Stephen Hybicki recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Ryan Kaul. Cyrus commented that the song was written on Valentine's Day in 2013, which was [...] "emotionally [...] <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time"; she elaborated that the track was [...] "about needing to leave someone but not really wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship.

[...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby.

500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Scott Mendelson, {{writing in}} The Huffington Post, cited Scully {{as an example}} of strong female {{characters}} on television, calling her [...] "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre". Radio Times Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, [...] "The very fact that her character was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change". She praised her for being more [...] "rational, resilient, [...] mature" [...] than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of [...] "Irresistible", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that it was a cliché to put Scully in danger, as [...] "Scully is [...] heart, and any time she's in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart".|$|E

2500|$|In May 1986, during Piper's five-month hiatus {{from the}} WWF, Adonis (with Hart) debuted his own talk segment, The Flower Shop. These {{segments}} {{were the primary}} backdrop for Paul Orndorff's slow-building heel turn against his friend Hulk Hogan, with Adonis relentlessly needling Orndorff about living in Hogan's shadow. In August, shortly before Piper's return, Adonis obtained the services of Piper's bodyguard, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton, who took to wearing a pink cowboy hat. A feud with Piper heated up when Adonis, Orton, and Don Muraco attacked him during a [...] "duel" [...] between the two talk segments, injuring his leg, covering him in lipstick and damaging the Pit set. A week later, Piper destroyed the set of The Flower Shop with a baseball bat. It was never rebuilt. On the October 4 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Piper struck Adonis with a crutch, resulting in a two-month absence from TV with an alleged separated shoulder. After Adonis returned in November to attack Piper on the Pit, the two agreed to a hair vs. hair match at WrestleMania III. Piper won the bout with help from Brutus Beefcake, who cut off the majority of Adonis' hair afterward. Piper was initially supposed {{to cut off the}} hair himself, but had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time because the hair was too wet, and when he got Beefcake to help out, that was the start of Beefcake's gimmick as [...] "The Barber". Adonis then began a feud with Beefcake but was fired in May 1987 for what the WWF claimed were [...] "dress code violations".|$|E

She also received a two-page article in Life Magazine, explaining about the wonderful performance and critics said she was up and coming and people should look out for the next pieces she performs in. She performed many other plays in New York and on Broadway and the public started to notice her, as she became a bigger star. [...] Not only did the public start to notice her, but also critics began analyzing her performances. [...] They wrote that she performed her roles as a, [...] "majestic, full-voiced, statuesque and stunning actress". [...] The passion she had for acting was reflected in her performances and an unusual thing happened for her, [...] "an African-American actress around whom producers and directors built production". [...] Instead of Gloria Foster having to audition for roles, people started to make parts for her to be in. [...] It was her spirit, excitement, and stamina for acting that gave her success in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> business.
