5|$|During the mid-1970s, highly <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> {{commercial}} bands such as Philly soul group The O'Jays and blue-eyed soul group Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success. By {{the end of}} the 1970s, most music genres, including soul, {{had been}} disco-influenced. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was once again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} recent {{advances}} in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetry to observe sea oil <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> man-made metallic targets are reviewed {{in the frame of}} the ESA funded PolSAR-Ap project. The most up-to-dated quad-pol approaches to observe sea oil <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> metallic targets are reviewed and their performance is discussed against conventional single- and dual-pol approaches using actual L- and C-band Single Look Complex (SLC) SAR data. The unique benefits of quad-pol SAR data to observe both oil <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> metallic targets are clearly shown...|$|R

5|$|The Matty Johns Show was pitched as a family-friendly {{variety show}} {{based on the}} National Rugby League (NRL) competition. It is {{primarily}} aimed at New South Wales and Queensland audiences (in which NRL is the dominant football code). The show features many comedy sketches, recurring characters and celebrity interviews in a variety format. This mixture has resulted in criticism from some media observers for a perceived lack of serious football analysis. Sports website The Roar notes that the show appears {{to be made to}} <b>slick</b> (<b>and</b> expensive) production values.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular kind of country music was the Nashville Sound, which was a <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> pop-oriented style. Many musicians {{preferred}} a rougher sound, leading {{to the development of}} the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in the mid to late 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed by a wave of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E
5|$|Wainwright {{charged to}} the attack, but the {{submarine}} submerged almost immediately. Upon reaching {{the spot where}} the submarine had been, the warship located an oil <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> began dropping depth charges which failed to achieve positive results. Approaching darkness and the necessity of escorting an Admiralty oiler forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} fully polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) measurements are employed for sea oil slick observation. The co-polarised signature is read in terms of sea surface scattering mechanism with <b>and</b> without surface <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> it is shown {{to be sensitive to}} the presence of sea oil slicks. A model, which relates the pedestal of the polarisation signature to the presence of surface <b>slicks,</b> is developed <b>and</b> successfully tested on L-band ALOS-PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT- 2 and C-band SIR-C/X- SAR full-polarimetric SAR data. Experiment results show that polarisation signature, and its pedestal height, can be successfully exploited for both observing sea oil <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> distinguishing them from weak-damping properties look-alikes...|$|R

5|$|In November 1945, with league {{competition}} still suspended, Arsenal {{were one}} of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and the <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> technically proficient Dynamo won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk. Funk was typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, The Meters, and James Brown himself, while more versatile groups like War, The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire also became popular. During the 1970s, some highly <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success, {{as well as a}} new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul groups like The Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics.|$|E
25|$|On a wet, <b>slick,</b> <b>and</b> {{slippery}} field, the Steelers {{dominated the}} Oilers by forcing 9 turnovers and only allowing 5 points. Pittsburgh took the early lead by driving 57 yards to score on running back Franco Harris' 7-yard touchdown run. Then, linebacker Jack Ham recovered a fumble at the Houston 17-yard line, {{which led to}} running back Rocky Bleier's 15-yard rushing touchdown.|$|E

25|$|An asphalt {{concrete}} surface will generally be constructed for high-volume primary highways having {{an average annual}} daily traffic load greater than 1200 vehicles per day. Advantages of asphalt roadways include relatively low noise, relatively low cost compared with other paving methods, and perceived ease of repair. Disadvantages include less durability than other paving methods, less tensile strength than concrete, the tendency to become <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> soft in hot weather and {{a certain amount of}} hydrocarbon pollution to soil and groundwater or waterways.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{potential}} of using log-cumulants for discrimina-tion between mineral oil spills and other low backscatter ocean features in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is investigated here. Radarsat- 2 fine quad-polarization data containing experi-mental oil spills {{as well as}} simulated biogenic <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> a natural phenomenon are analyzed. For this data set, the combined information of matrix log-cumulants of first and second order is found to clearly discriminate {{the majority of the}} mineral oil spills from the simulated biogenic <b>slicks</b> <b>and</b> the natural phenomenon. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed method has a potential application in classification of low backscatter ocean features of unknown origin.

25|$|Bowie was {{diagnosed}} with liver cancer in mid-2014. Bowie told only his family and people {{he was working with}} about his condition; Ivo van Hove, with whom Bowie was collaborating on the off-Broadway musical Lazarus, was told shortly after Bowie himself found out about his diagnosis. Tony Visconti, Bowie's friend and producer of many Bowie albums including Blackstar, was told in January 2015. Visconti recalled that Bowie was completely bald from his chemotherapy when they spoke. However, many musicians who had worked with Bowie over the years, such as Mike Garson, Gerry Leonard, Brian Eno, Nile Rodgers, Reeves Gabrels, Tina Turner, Sterling Campbell, Earl <b>Slick</b> <b>and</b> Gail Ann Dorsey, were not told about the illness and were surprised when Bowie died.|$|E
25|$|Trout {{stood out}} of Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1942, as a unit of Task Group 7.1, the Midway Island Patrol Group {{consisting}} of 12 submarines. Her station was south of the island as nine of the submarines were positioned fan-like {{to the west of}} Midway in preparation for the Japanese attack. At 08:12 on 4 June, Trout sighted a Japanese fighter plane preparing to attack from astern. She went deep and heard a series of light explosions. On 9 June, Trout passed through a large oil <b>slick</b> <b>and</b> some debris before rescuing two Japanese from a large wooden hatch cover. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June without firing a torpedo and began a major refit that included installation of search radars and JP sonar in preparation for deployment to Australia. The Trout also carried two POWs from the sunken Japanese cruiser Mikuma.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth {{became the}} {{catalyst}} in the uneasy – and ultimate breakup of – the Savage–Hogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan's overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth. At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches {{during the fall}} of 1988, including matches against King Haku, Akeem, and Bad News Brown that aired on Saturday Night's Main Event. In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth's safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, <b>Slick</b> <b>and</b> Akeem's tag-team partner, The Big Boss Man (who wrestled together as The Twin Towers) when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climatic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth's well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan. At the 1988 Survivor Series, Hogan's obviously friendly behavior toward Elizabeth angered Savage, something pro-heel commentator Jesse Ventura played up during a post-match interview with Savage. Savage emphatically denied any animosity between himself and Hogan, but Savage would become increasingly jealous and wary of Hogan as the weeks went by.|$|E
