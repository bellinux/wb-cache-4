5|$|In 1903, the GNP sought {{permission}} for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to run under Leicester Square, <b>Strand,</b> and Fleet Street {{and into the}} City of London. The branch would have passed and interchanged with the already approved <b>Strand</b> station, allowing travel on the GNP from <b>Strand</b> in three directions. The deliberations of a Royal Commission on traffic in London prevented parliamentary consideration of the proposal, which was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} Royal Commission's report {{about to be}} published, the GNP {{returned}} to Parliament with two bills for consideration. The first bill revived the 1903 proposal for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to the City of London, passing and interchanging with <b>Strand</b> station. The second proposed an extension and relocation of <b>Strand</b> station to the junction of <b>Strand</b> and Surrey Street. From there the line was to continue as a single tunnel under the River Thames to Waterloo. The first bill was again delayed and withdrawn. Of the second, only the relocation of <b>Strand</b> station was permitted.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one <b>strand</b> of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken <b>strand</b> then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover <b>strand</b> reanneals to its original partner <b>strand,</b> it displaces {{the original}} complementary <b>strand</b> ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which <b>strand</b> was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
40|$|In tight {{junctions}} (TJs), TJ <b>strands</b> are associated laterally {{with those of}} adjacent cells to form paired <b>strands</b> to eliminate the extracellular space. Claudin- 1 and - 2, integral membrane proteins of TJs, reconstitute paired TJ <b>strands</b> when transfected into L fibroblasts. Claudins comprise a multigene family and more than two distinct claudins are coexpressed in single cells, raising the questions of whether heterogeneous claudins form heteromeric TJ <b>strands</b> and whether claudins interact between each of the paired <b>strands</b> in a heterophilic manner. To answer these questions, we cotransfected two of claudin- 1, - 2, and - 3 into L cells, and detected their coconcentration at cell–cell borders as elaborate networks. Immunoreplica EM confirmed that distinct claudins were coincorporated into individual TJ <b>strands.</b> Next, two L transfectants singly expressing claudin- 1, - 2, or - 3 were cocultured {{and we found that}} claudin- 3 <b>strands</b> laterally associated with claudin- 1 and - 2 <b>strands</b> to form paired <b>strands,</b> whereas claudin- 1 <b>strands</b> did not interact with claudin- 2 <b>strands.</b> We concluded that distinct species of claudins can interact within and between TJ <b>strands,</b> except in some combinations. This mode of assembly of claudins could increase the diversity of the structure and functions of TJ <b>strands...</b>|$|R

5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger <b>strand</b> and the guide <b>strand.</b> The passenger <b>strand</b> is degraded and the guide <b>strand</b> is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide <b>strand</b> pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E

5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA <b>strand</b> complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide <b>strand,</b> binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide <b>strand</b> or passenger <b>strand</b> is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA <b>strand</b> from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide <b>strand</b> tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but <b>strand</b> selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger <b>strand.</b>|$|E
5|$|The west {{part of the}} <b>Strand</b> was in {{the parish}} of St Martin in the Fields and in the east it {{extended}} into the parishes of St Clement Danes and St Mary le <b>Strand.</b> Most of its length was in the Liberty of Westminster, although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. The <b>Strand</b> was the northern boundary of the precinct of the Savoy, which was approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now. All of these parishes and places {{became part of the}} <b>Strand</b> District in 1855, except St Martin in the Fields which was governed separately.

5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other <b>strand</b> {{can be used as a}} {{template}} to guide the correction of the damaged <b>strand.</b> In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA <b>strand.</b>|$|E
50|$|This method generates single <b>stranded</b> DNA <b>strands,</b> which {{encompass}} {{a single}} block sequence {{either at the}} 5' or 3' end, complementary sequences in a stem loop region, and a D branch region serving as a primer binding site for PCR.

5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single <b>strand</b> DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate <b>strand</b> invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote <b>strand</b> invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double <b>strand</b> breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary <b>strand</b> by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original <b>strand.</b> As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA <b>strand</b> in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old <b>strand</b> dictates which base appears on the new <b>strand,</b> and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
