40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the most important <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> {{in the context of the}} development of the financial turmoil that started in the third quarter of 2007 and continued into 2008. These financial market tensions were triggered by concerns about exposures of financial institutions to the most risky segment of the US mortgage markets -the so-called subprime mortgage market- and related financial instruments, which predominantly were related to <b>structured</b> <b>finance.</b> As <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> has developed very fast in recent years and often involves highly complex financial instruments and techniques, which may not be understood completely beyond a small circle of financial market experts, the aim of this paper is to provide an introduction to these instruments that may serve to better understand the specific characteristics of the financial turmoil. In this context, the paper proposes a specific classification of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> and discusses both securitizations and credit derivatives with the aim of explaining their specific contributions to the development of the financial turmoil. To this extent, the paper differentiates between two main categories of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments.</b> The first one played an important role in the initiation and propagation of the turmoil and includes mortgage-backed securities (MBS), asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), both cash flow and synthetic. The second category of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> involves those that have been more instrumental in monitoring the crisis, both for market participants and policymakers. The main instruments here are credit default swaps (CDS), of which examples are presented for both single name and index contracts. Finally, the paper {{provides an}} overview of the specific contagion channels involving various <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments.</b> This will be conducted on the basis of examples for hypothetical financial institutions that are nevertheless representative for real world developments such as they occurred in the course of 2007 and 2008. financial turmoil, financial markets, financial institutions, <b>structured</b> <b>finance,</b> securitization, credit derivatives...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In May 2003, the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) {{decided to}} {{establish}} a Working Group on Ratings in <b>Structured</b> <b>Finance</b> to explore the role of rating agencies in the rapidly evolving markets for <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments.</b> To facilitate {{a better understanding of}} this role and of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> markets more broadly, the Working Group was mandated to identify and explain methodological differences that exist between the rating of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> and more traditional credit products, and to explore the various methodological and organisational challenges involved in rating <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> products. This report documents the Working Group's findings, complementing earlier work by the CGFS and other official forums, such as CGFS (2003) and Joint Forum (2004 b). It highlights several of the characteristics of structured products, challenges arising for the rating agencies and other market participants, and implications for central banks and investors. The report is based on the Group's discussions, written contributions by Group members on a number of technical topics, and series of interviews with rating agency officials and other participants in the <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> markets. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> {{represent}} {{a form of}} securitization technology which can be defined by the characteristics of pooling of financial assets, delinking of the credit risk of the asset pool from the credit risk of the originating intermediary, and issuance of tranched liabilities backed by the asset pool. Tranching effectively accomplishes a "slicing" of the loss distribution of the underlying asset pool. This paper reviews the finance literature relating to security design and securitization, {{in order to identify}} the economic forces underlying the creation of SF instruments. A question addressed is under what circumstances one would expect to observe pooling alone (as with traditional securitization) versus pooling and tranching combined (as with <b>structured</b> <b>finance).</b> It is argued that asymmetric information problems between an originator and investors can lead to pooling of assets and tranching of associated liabilities, as opposed to pooling alone. The more acute the problem of adverse selection, the more likely is value to be created through issuance of tranched assetbacked securities. <b>Structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> also help to complete incomplete financial markets, and they may also appear in response to market segmentation. <b>Structured</b> <b>finance,</b> securitization...|$|R
25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} assess the relative credit risk of specific debt securities or <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> and borrowing entities (issuers of debt), {{and in some}} cases the creditworthiness of governments and their securities. By serving as information intermediaries, CRAs theoretically reduce information costs, increase the pool of potential borrowers, and promote liquid markets.

40|$|The central insight of asset pricing {{is that a}} security's value depends both on its {{distribution}} of payoffs across economic states and on state prices. In fixed income markets, many investors focus exclusively on estimates of expected payoffs, such as credit ratings, without considering {{the state of the}} economy in which default occurs. Such investors are likely to be attracted to securities whose payoffs resemble economic catastrophe bonds—bonds that default only under severe economic conditions. We show that many <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> can be characterized as economic catastrophe bonds, but offer far less compensation than alternatives with comparable payoff profiles.

We investigate balance sheet figures for the 250 largest banks in each Europe, Germany and USA between 1994 - 2009. We identified different main reasons for the banks in each region to securitize that {{are in line with}} observable behavior of market participants. US banks use securitization mainly as credit risk transfer instrument and to increase performance, while European originators focus on regulatory capital arbitrage and performance improvement. For German banks securitization seems to be an appropriate funding tool.

The method has applications to any situation where marginals are provided, and bounds need to be determined on total portfolio risk. This arises in many financial contexts, including pricing and risk management of exotic options, analysis of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments,</b> and aggregation of portfolio risk across risk types. Applications to counterparty credit risk are emphasized, and they include assessing wrong-way risk in the credit valuation adjustment, and counterparty credit risk measurement.

40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) play {{an integral part}} in today's financial markets. Through ratings they express considered opinion about future creditworthiness of an obligor and thus lower information asymmetry in the capital markets. Recently, CRAs have been brought in the spotlight as they are often blamed for being the triggers of the recent market turmoil. Critics often argue that ratings of tranches of <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments,</b> backed by subprime mortgages, were unjustifiably high, downgrades were too late and the overall integrity of the rating process was compromised through numerous conflicts of interests CRAs face. However, in this thesis I argue that CRAs were put in this position rather through external factors than their own actions. Massive regulation usage of ratings, rapid growth of structured securities market, overdependence on the rating and the overall ignorance {{of the meaning of}} rating itself are the actual causes to blame...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the risk properties of typical asset-backed securities (ABS), like CDOs or MBS, {{relying on a}} model with both macroeconomic and idiosyncratic components. The examined properties include expected loss, loss given default, and macro factor dependencies. Using a two-dimensional loss decomposition as a new metric, the risk properties of individual ABS tranches can directly be compared to those of corporate bonds, within and across rating classes. By applying Monte Carlo Simulation, {{we find that the}} risk properties of ABS differ significantly and systematically from those of straight bonds with the same rating. In particular, loss given default, the sensitivities to macroeconomic risk, and model risk differ greatly between instruments. Our findings have implications for understanding the credit crisis and for policy making. On an economic level, our analysis suggests a new explanation for the observed rating inflation in <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> markets during the pre-crisis period 2004 - 2007. On a policy level, our findings call for a termination of the 'one-size-fits-all' approach to the rating methodology for fixed income instruments, requiring an own rating methodology for <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments.</b> Credit Risk, Risk Transfer, Systematic Risk...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simple short-run post-Keynesian {{model in which}} the key aspects of shadow banking, namely {{securitization}} {{and the production of}} <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments,</b> are explicitly formalized. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to broaden purely real-side post-Keynesian models and their traditional focus on shareholder-value orientation, the financialization of non-financial firms, and the profit-led vs wage-led dichotomy. We rather put emphasis on the role of financial institutions and rentier-friendly environment in determining the predominance of specific growth and distribution regimes. First, we illustrate the macroeconomic rationale of shadow banking practices. We show how, before the 2007 - 8 crisis, securitization and shadow banking allowed for an increase in profitability for the whole financial sector, while apparently keeping leverage under control. Second, we define a variety of shadow-banking-led regimes in terms of economic activity, productive capital accumulation, and income distribution. We show that both an ‘exhilarationist’ and a ‘stagnationist’ regime may prevail, nevertheless characterized by a probable increase in income inequality between rentiers and wage earners...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{volatility}} of defined benefit of pension plans over the period 1999 - 2006. We document economically significant relationships between the asset-liability structure and the risk-taking of pension plans. We find that increasing the underfunding of a bottom size-decile plan by one-standard deviation on average implies a 34 % increase in {{the volatility of}} the plan. In contrast, the relationship between funding status and risk is reversed for top size-decile plans. The higher risk-taking of underfunded plans is confined to higher upside-risk exposure, consistent with plans hedging pension liabilities via <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> with non-linear payoffs. Defined benefit (DB) 1 pension plans today seem less secure than a decade ago. The total amount of US retirement assets in private DB plans was $ 2. 328 trillion as of March 2007 (According to the Investment Company Institute). There {{is a growing concern}} about the funding status of DB pension plans as many of them are experiencing declining solvency. While regulators and policy makers are calling for reform of the institutional framework of DB pension plans, understanding the determinants of DB risk-taking is of critical importance. This paper investigates the relationship between the risk-taking of US DB pension plans and their asset-liability structure and characteristics. We report evidence that the total risk exposure of privately-held pension plans is explained by the interaction of the funding status of the pension plan and the plan size, while the risk-taking of publicly-held corporate plans is driven by their commitment to accrue future obligations. Moreover, we find evidence of asymmetric risk exposure of the average pension plan that is consistent with hedging of pension liabilities. These relationships between funding and risk can be interpreted as evidence of different managerial incentive structures across different plans. Theoretical arguments for optimal pension-plan risk-taking have produced conflicting predictions about both high and low risk (for example, Sharpe (1976), Treynor (1977), Blac...|$|R
40|$|Islamic law or Shari’a {{purports to}} govern {{all aspects of}} the private and public life of the believers. Its all-embracing {{character}} is the constant narrative of Islam as a religion and a civilization. While Shari’a does not address finance in its modern meaning, it does incorporate general principles governing the economic behaviour of the Islamic society and specific instruments regulating classic commercial transactions. Thus, Islamic banks are unable to use conventional methods of financing and seek to provide Shari’a compliant alternatives to the services rendered by western banks.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show a {{creative}} way to fulfill financing needs of entities involved in pre- and post-harvest production activities in extreme cases while mitigating inherent risks by Islamic <b>structured</b> trade <b>finance</b> from the real-life case of cotton production in Burkina Faso. Design/methodology/approach – The existing Islamic <b>structured</b> <b>finance</b> design for SOFITEX was analyzed in details so as to provide clear understanding of the subject matter. This structure was evaluated and a new design is proposed to better accommodate the financing need of SOFITEX. Findings – There are some inherent drawbacks, explained in details, of the existing Islamic <b>finance</b> <b>structure.</b> Salam contract for pre-harvest input financing in favor of farmers can, unlike existing structure, accommodate the complete supply chain financing solution, hence, support the whole production cycle from input procurement to the exports of cotton fiber. That is, it fits better for financing the agricultural sector. Research limitations/implications – The case and the structure studied in depth are limited to the cotton sector. This could be widened in subsequent researches. Practical implications – Islamic <b>finance</b> <b>instruments</b> provide us enough room to fulfill financing needs in extreme cases as a better alternative to conventional financing tools. A method of mark-up calculation for <b>structured</b> cotton trade <b>finance</b> is developed for Murabaha and Salam contracts. Originality/value – The paper sheds new light on how to finance the agricultural sector starting from input procurement to the sale/export by Islamic <b>finance</b> <b>instruments.</b> It also shows how to get guarantees in the form of commodities in warehouse rather than bank guarantees, mortgage, sovereign guarantees, etc. Cotton, Finance, Islam, Saudi Arabia, Supply chain management, Trade...|$|R

40|$|Objective - Islamic {{banks are}} banks which its activities, both fund raising and funds {{distribution}} {{are on the}} basis of Islamic principles, namely buying and selling and profit sharing. Islamic banking is aimed at supporting the implementation of national development in order to improve justice, togetherness, and equitable distribution of welfare. In pursuit of supporting the implementation of national development, Islamic banking often faced stability problems of <b>financing</b> <b>instruments</b> being operated. In this case, it is measured by the gap between the actual rate of return and the expected rate of return. The individual actual RoR of this instrument will generate an expected rate of return. This raises the gap or difference between the actual rate of return and the expected rate of return of individual instruments, which in this case is called the abnormal rate of return. The stability of abnormal rate of return of individual instruments is certainly influenced by the stability of the expected rate of return. Expected rate of return has a volatility or fluctuation levels for each <b>financing</b> <b>instrument.</b> It is also a key element or material basis {{for the establishment of a}} variance of individual instruments. Variance in this case indicates the level of uncertainty of the rate of return. Individual variance is the origin of the instrument base for variance in the portfolio finance that further a portfolio analysis. So, this paper is going to analyze the level of expected RoR volatility as an initial step to see and predict the stability of the fluctuations in the rate of return of Indonesian Islamic <b>financing</b> <b>instruments.</b> Methods – Probability of Occurence, Expected Rate of Return (RoR) and GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity).
