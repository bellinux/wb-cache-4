25|$|The outer border fences {{were lined}} with anti-personnel mines {{designed}} to kill or injure would-be escapees. The mining of the border began in 1966; by the 1980s, some 1.3million mines of various Soviet-made types had been laid. The mines were usually laid in a standardised pattern of a rectangular box, , containing three rows of mines. The most common type was the Soviet-made PMD-6M mine. However, its wooden construction made it unreliable and prone to decay. The PMD-6Ms were later replaced by more durable plastic mines of the PMN-2, PMP-71 and PPM-2 types. Most of the mines were pressure-activated, requiring someone to step on one to detonate it, {{with the exception of}} the tripwire-activated POMZ-2 <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> The minefields were not marked on the East German side, though Achtung! Minen! signs were often posted by the West Germans on their side. The mines were a hazard to civilians on both sides of the border; they were frequently set off by animals such as deer and could be washed out of position by rain or floods. It was not unknown for mines to travel hundreds of metres into fields and streams on either side of the border.|$|E

5000|$|In 1876, {{a soldier}} and an army scout <b>staked</b> <b>mining</b> claims over silver {{mineralization}} at Bisbee. Bisbee later produced more silver {{than any other}} district in Arizona, 102 million troy ounces, but mostly as a byproduct to copper mining. [...] Bisbee is historically the 10th-largest silver producing district in the US.|$|R
50|$|Prospectors in the 1870s and 1880s <b>staked</b> <b>mining</b> {{claims in}} the canyon. They hoped that {{previously}} discovered deposits of asbestos, copper, lead, and zinc would be profitable to mine. Access to and from this remote region and problems getting ore out of the canyon and its rock made the whole exercise not worth the effort. Most moved on, but some stayed to seek profit in the tourist trade. Their activities did improve pre-existing Indian trails, such as Bright Angel Trail.|$|R
50|$|When {{the area}} was part of Indian {{reservations}} and therefore off-limits to non-Native Americans, the Wichita Mountains were rumored to contain rich gold deposits. When {{the area was}} first opened up for settlement, many prospectors <b>staked</b> <b>mining</b> claims, and towns were laid out to serve the presumed bonanzas, but no economic deposits were found. The gold boom was prolonged by some unscrupulous assayers who found gold in every sample, but the miners eventually gave up, leaving behind ghost towns such as Wildman, Oklahoma.|$|R

50|$|The {{mountain}} {{is named after}} Peter A. Ferguson, a gold prospector {{from the town of}} Mattawa who <b>staked</b> <b>mining</b> claims on Mount Ferguson in the 1880s. He is also the namesake for Ferguson Bay, Ferguson Island and Ferguson Point. A fire lookout tower set up by the Department of Lands and Forests (now the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry) had formerly occupied the summit of Mount Ferguson. In 1966, the tower was no longer used which led to its eventual demolition around 1975.|$|R
50|$|The P-40 mine is a Vietnamese anti-personnel {{fragmentation}} <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> The mines {{were produced}} using the spherical steel cases of U.S. BLU-24/B and BLU-66 submunitions {{on top of}} which is a plastic adaptor to accept an MUV style tripwire fuze.|$|E
50|$|The Model 49 {{is a large}} {{cylindrical}} Swiss anti-personnel <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine is {{no longer}} in service with Swiss forces and all operational stocks of the mine have been destroyed. The mine is normally stake mounted, and uses the ZDZ-39 fuze, which can be operated by either pull or tension release. The mine has a concrete fragmentation jacket with embedded steel fragments.|$|E
50|$|When {{used as a}} <b>stake</b> <b>mine</b> {{the mine}} is {{inverted}} and an MUV type pull fuse is inserted into {{the base of the}} mine, and the normal pressure fuse hole is used to attach the mine to the stake. When used with the fragmentation jacket the mine has a lethal radius of 15 metres, although the fragments may be lethal at greater range.|$|E
50|$|The M61 or Model 61 and M63 or Model 63 are French anti-personnel <b>stake</b> {{fragmentation}} <b>stake</b> <b>mines</b> {{the mines}} are sometimes called piquet (picket). The M61 is {{slightly larger than}} the M63, but otherwise the mines are similar in appearance and operation. The mines have plastic cases, and use the ALPR ID 59 fuze, which is also used in the MI AP DV 59 mine, {{it can also be}} fitted with a tripwire fuze. The mines can be fitted with a plastic detonator making the mine very difficult to detect.|$|R

50|$|The PMR-3 is a Yugoslavian anti-personnel <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine is a {{development}} of the PMR-1 and PMR-2 stake mines, having a larger main charge and a greater effective radius. Two versions of the mine were built, an 'old' version and a 'new' version. The principal difference being that the 'old' model could be pressure and pull operated, while the 'new' model can only be pull operated.|$|E
5000|$|The AUPS is a {{circular}} Italian bakelite cased minimum metal anti-personnel blast mine. The mine {{can be adapted}} with a steel fragmentation jacket and stake into a fragmentation <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine is constructed in two halves, with the upper half containing the pressure fuse mechanism, the lower half contains the main charge and the detonator. The mine case is normally unpainted bakelite brown.|$|E
50|$|The MBV-78-A2 {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} Vietnamese anti-personnel fragmentation <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> It is {{unrelated to}} the MBV-78-A1. The mine has a large plastic head which contains the main charge wrapped around the detonator. A fragmentation layer of steel pieces set into wax surrounds the main charge. The plastic head has two mounting lugs for stake mounting the mine. A Vietnamese copy of the Russian MUV fuze is typically used with the mine, although other fuzes could be used.|$|E

50|$|The P-25 is {{a plastic}} cased Italian anti-personnel <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> It was {{developed}} {{along with the}} larger P-40 mine in the late 1970s by Misar SpA and entered production in 1978. The mine consists of a plastic cylinder with a fuse protruding from the top. The mine can either be stake mounted or buried, although {{it was designed to}} be stake mounted. Pull pressure on the tripwire results in the fuse head tilting sideways, releasing a striker into the detonator assembly.|$|E
50|$|The stock {{mine was}} a German anti-personnel <b>stake</b> <b>mine</b> {{used during the}} Second World War. It {{consisted}} of a cylindrical concrete main body {{on top of a}} short wooden stake. The concrete head contained a small TNT bursting charge, and was embedded with a number of metal fragments. A fuze is fitted to a central fuze well {{on the top of the}} mine. It could be used with a range of fuzes including the ZZ 35, ZZ 42 and ZU ZZ 35 that would trigger on either a tripwire pull or release.|$|E
50|$|The NR-413 is a Belgian {{trip wire}} {{activated}} anti-personnel <b>stake</b> <b>mine.</b> The {{main body of}} the mine is wine bottle shaped, with an NR 410 tripwire fuse screwed into a fuse well {{on the top of the}} mine. Under the fuse well is a detonator and a row of booster pellets. Wrapped around the detonator and booster pellets is the main charge. An internally square cross-sectioned steel wire is coiled around the outside of the mine, which give a fragmentation effect. The mine produces 600 fragments with a velocity of approximately 1,660 metres per second. It has an effective range of around 15 metres. A variant is produced with a cast steel fragmentation jacket.|$|E

Tex Rickard was also already there and had opened a second Northern Saloon. He hired Wyatt as a pit boss. Wyatt also <b>staked</b> <b>mining</b> claims just outside Death Valley and {{elsewhere}} in the Mojave Desert. In 1906, he discovered several deposits of gold and copper near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. While in Los Angeles, they lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer.|$|R
