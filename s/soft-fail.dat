50|$|If {{the client}} only trusts {{certificates}} when CRLs are available, then they lose the offline capability that makes PKI attractive. So most clients do trust certificates when CRLs are not available, {{but in that}} case an attacker that controls the communication channel can disable the CRLs. Adam Langley of Google has said <b>soft-fail</b> CRL checks are like a safety belt that works except when you are having an accident.|$|E
40|$|An {{architecture}} for {{a mobile}} satellite system proposed for integration with the pan-European GSM terrestrial cellular system is described. A cellular satellite system concept is outlined {{with emphasis on}} multispot coverage of the cell, and a carrier-to-interference analysis is performed. It is noted that a suitable payload structure is needed to allow the flexible management of the channels assigned to a certain cell, and a multiport transponder (MPT) payload architecture is introduced, where an MPT is a wideband transparent multibeam cell-transponder provided with an intrinsic <b>soft-fail</b> capability. A proposal for a comprehensive program encompassing an experiment including a propagation mission and a communication mission is discussed, and {{attention is focused on}} experiments with highly inclined orbit mobile-radio channels, statistical channel models, and mobile-terminal terrain antenna...|$|E
