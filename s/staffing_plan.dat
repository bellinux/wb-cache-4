2500|$|A major {{controversy}} over scheduling erupted in November 2011 when Ellerbe proposed that firefighters work a [...] "3-3-3 shift"—three 12-hour days (with nights off), three 12-hour nights (with days off), {{and three days}} off. It was a staffing model used by the D.C. fire department in the 1960s and 1970s, and marked a change from the then-current practice of a single 24-hour shift followed by three days off (known as 24/72). Ellerbe claimed it would reduce staffing costs by $36 million a year after four years, and increase days worked per month to 22 from eight. Because about 40 percent of the city's firefighters lived 30 to 100 miles away, the plan also encouraged firefighters to move closer to Washington, D.C. This would enable the city to recall off-duty firefighters more quickly in an emergency, he said. The union, Local 36, IAFF, strongly opposed the plan. It said firefighters' salaries ($44,300 for a new hire, and $65,500 for a 20-year veteran) were too low to allow firefighters to live {{in or near the}} District of Columbia. The <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> would force them to lower their standard of living by moving nearer or into D.C., and deny them the opportunity to work second jobs. The union also said the long lead-time to recall off-duty staff was actually beneficial (since it took the city several hours to get ready during an emergency). It denied the plan would save money, and offered an analysis that showed the change would cost the city $16 million a year.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we examine the}} {{creation}} of staffing plans at ESOS (ATCC Stockholm). The <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> is the cornerstone in making the working schedule for the employees and is created {{with regard to the}} traffic flow in the Swedish airspace. In the thesis we {{have come up with a}} model in order to create and examine staffing plans at ESOS where ATCOs (Air Traffic Controllers) will handle air traffic 55 per cent of their scheduled working hours. This would be an increase from the current <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> where they handle traffic approximately 50 per cent of their time at work. In order to create a <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> with the model, data on sector opening hours was received from ESOS. This data showed how many ATCOs that were handling traffic at any point in time during September 2013. By analysing the data, we obtained information about the number of hours that needed to be scheduled and also when it was appropriate to place the hours. The result is one <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> which was created manually with a heuristic approach for competence group X. The <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> is created so that the ATCOs handle traffic 55 per cent of their working hours in a month with the traffic pattern as the one from the data. It is important to properly investigate the effects that might occur if a <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> with 55 per cent time in position would be implemented. The created <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> is good to use as evaluation when deciding if 55 per cent time in position is something to use or not...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) {{is a small}} group of naval officers totaling approximately 1250 officers. Being a small community, the CEC attempts to capture the location and other relevant information of every CEC Officer at a given time and publis h that information in the Chief of Civil Engineers Directory (P- 1). The CEC detailers also produce and work off a <b>Staffing</b> <b>Plan</b> to help them manage the movement of officers. The current process of developing the <b>Staffing</b> <b>Plan</b> and P- 1 is complex and arduous. This thesis examines existing systems at the CEC detail shop and explores the possibilities of developing a Detailing Management System. The intent is to develop a prototype application that links with existing systems to assist the detailers in the execution of their tasks including the streamlined production of the P- 1 and <b>Staffing</b> <b>Plan.</b> A prototyping methodology is used to accomplish these goals. The methodology includes the following phases: Problem Definition, Requirements Analysis, Design, Build/Revise prototype, and Finalize application. The build phase is iterated through several end-user reviews to obtain the best possible product to support their needs. The application supports the immediate requirements of streamlining the development of the <b>Staffing</b> <b>Plan</b> and P- 1 while providing additional detailing management capabilities.

The new scheduling approach not only out-performs the traditional staffing approach in all scenarios examined, it reduces total weekly costs of the call center’s existing agent schedule by 8 - 25 %, depending on the scenario. 1...|$|E

40|$|In the {{integrated}} project scheduling and personnel staffing problem the project activities are scheduled and simultaneously a <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> is composed {{to carry out}} a single project. In this way, the project schedule that leads to the <b>staffing</b> <b>plan</b> with minimum cost is determined. In this paper, we evaluate different scheduling policies and practices for different personnel resource types. We examine the impact on the staffing cost when the personnel resources are scheduled in a cyclic versus a non-cyclic manner for different (days on, days off) -patterns. Furthermore, the impact of introducing more flexible resource types, such as overtime and temporary help, is explored in relationship with the activity resource demand variability. Computational results show that non-cyclic scheduling leads to a considerable lower staffing cost under all circumstances compared to cyclic scheduling. However, despite the tractability of the resource requirements, flexible temporary resources are essential on top of the regular personnel resources to respond to the variability in demand. The addition of overtime on a strategic staffing level only marginally decreases the personnel cost...|$|E
