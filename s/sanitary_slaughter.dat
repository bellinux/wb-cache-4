40|$|Within the Swedish {{salmonella}} {{control program}} any findings of salmonella is compulsory notifiable. In all Salmonella infected herds an official veterinary officer will perform an investigation and supervise the clearance of Salmonella infection/contamination {{from the farm}} (Wierup, M. 1991).

40|$|In Denmark, it {{was agreed}} to lower the Salmonella {{prevalence}} in pork to 1. 2 % {{before the end of}} 2006. The current control {{did not seem to be}} sufficient to attain this goal. Therefore, four alternatives to the existing Danish control strategy for Salmonella in pork were compared in a cost–benefit analysis: (1) hot-water decontamination of all pigs at slaughter, (2) <b>sanitary</b> <b>slaughter</b> of pigs from herds with high levels of Salmonella, (3) use of home-mixed feed in herds with slaughter pigs and (4) use of acidified feed for slaughter pigs. The data originated from official statistics, published papers as well as expert opinion. The partial cost–benefit analysis was restricted to slaughterhouses affiliated with the Danish Meat Association and Danish human cases ascribable to pork from these slaughterhouses. Only hot-water decontamination was socio-economically profitable. Hot-water decontamination had a net present value over 15 years ofs 3. 5 million. For <b>sanitary</b> <b>slaughter</b> the net present value was s 43. 6 million, for home-mixed feed it was s 262. 3 million and for acidified feed it wass 79. 9 million. For all alternatives the costs were born solely by the pig sector, whereas primarily the consumers and public authorities received the benefits. The conclusions were robust in sensitivity analyses...|$|E
40|$|In Denmark, pigs from herds with {{unacceptable}} {{high levels}} of Salmonella spp. (level- 3 herds) or herds with multi-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DTI 04 are obliged to undergo <b>sanitary</b> <b>slaughter</b> to secure food safety. Since 2001, carcasses from such herds undergo hot-water decontamination (HWD) in one plant belonging to the largest slaughterhouse company in Demnark. On each day of HWD, swab samples are taken {{from the surface of}} five heat-treated carcasses. These samples are analysed qualitatively as a pooled sample for Salmonella. Further I 0 swab samples are collected and analysed individually for E. coli (quantitatively). We present surveillance data from mid-February 2004 to December 2008. Moreover, we identifY risk factors for Salmonella after HWD. Salmonella was found in 2. 6...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Tuberculosis is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} disease affecting humans and animals. It {{is caused by the}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) – Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae, which are aetiological factors of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). In Poland, the bTB eradication programme exists. Animals diagnosed with tuberculosis are in the majority of cases not treated, but removed from their herd and then <b>sanitary</b> <b>slaughtered...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} the {{relationship}} between lung lesions of pigs with Enzootic Pneumonia and kidney lesions during <b>sanitary</b> inspection at <b>slaughter</b> was investigated. For this purpose sixty-nine Enzootic Pneumonia positive lung samples and sixty-nine negative ones as well as kidneys from the same pigs were post mortem examined. Microscopic examination revealed that 54. 28 % of the pigs (58 / 138) had both lesions, an association significant by Chi-square (P< 0. 05). The intensity of this association, by “Odds ratio ” value of 0. 2267 was also significant (0. 09045 - 0. 5683). Such result indicates that Porcine Enzootic Pneumonia positive pigs {{are more likely to}} develop nephritis. Although {{the relationship between}} lesions is uncertain, immunodepression caused by Porcine Enzootic Pneumonia is a probable cause of the concomitant renal disease...|$|R
40|$|Bovine cysticercosis, a {{cosmopolitan}} disease caused by Taenia saginata, leads to economic losses due to carcass devaluation at <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Sanitary</b> inspection at slaughterhouses, the routine diagnostic method in Brazil, lacks the necessary sensitivity {{to detect the}} mildly infected cattle that are typically encoutered in Brazil. In this study we have tested cattle sera from animals diagnosed as positive and negative by veterianry inspection for (1) anti-parasite antibodies using metacestodes antigens (T. solium vesicular fluid and T. saginata secretions) and (2) the HP 10 secreted antigen of viable metacestodes. The cut-off values were calculated by ROC curve for intense and mild infections conditions, and by the classical method (for negative samples). The sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic tests were different depending on the assumed cut-off value and, importantly, whether the infection was mild or intense. In spite of these observations, however, such ELISA assays for serum antibodies and parasite antigens constitute an important tool for epidemiological porposes, and in establishing priorities for the control of bovine cysticercosis...|$|R
40|$|The low {{productivity}} of buffalo herds and condemnation of carcasses in slaughterhouses due to tuberculosis lesions {{have resulted in}} increasing economic losses because these animals cannot be treated and must be destroyed by <b>sanitary</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Tuberculosis is a widely distributed zoonosis that affects the beef supply chain of the Brazilian agribusiness economically and socially. Like cattle, buffaloes are sensitive to Mycobacterium bovis, which is the main causative agent of zoonotic tuberculosis. Tuberculosis in buffaloes {{has been reported in}} several countries, including Brazil. In order to control and eradicate this disease among cattle and buffaloes in Brazil, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply created the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis with the main objective of finding a significant number of disease-free herds throughout the national territory using reliable methods. This review summarizes the main data on the history of occurrence of M. bovis in Brazilian herds and the diagnostic methods for the disease in buffaloes. Little information is available on buffalo tuberculosis. Due to the increasing population of buffaloes and their economic importance, more studies investigating the occurrence and identification of tuberculosis in this species are clearly needed. ...|$|E
