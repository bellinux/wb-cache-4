500|$|Literary critic John Kenneth Muir {{felt the}} script had many plot-holes left many {{unanswered}} questions, {{and that there}} was [...] "little effort to forge a coherent story out of the mix". New York Daily News writer David Bianculli described Laserblast as [...] "numbingly bad". In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies, Phil Hardy describes it as [...] "a wholly unimaginative film", adding, [...] "Even the non-stop series of exploding cars becomes monotonous in the hands of director Rae." [...] The Time Out Film Guide described Laserblast as a rip-off of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and said Billy's reign of destruction seemed random and senseless rather than driven by plot or characterization. The review called the film [...] "the epitome of what Frank Zappa once hymned as 'cheapness. The Globe and Mail writer Robert Martin called the script inept, <b>said</b> <b>Steve</b> Neill's make-up effects were [...] "frightful rather than frightening", and said Cheryl Smith could [...] "barely talk, let alone act". [...] Martin also stated the film was pulled from a Toronto theater after showing for one week.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Matt Roush from USA Today <b>said</b> <b>Steve</b> Railsback's performance as Duane Barry rivaled {{that of his}} portrayal of Charles Manson in the 1976 television miniseries Helter Skelter. An unnamed reviewer from the Contra Costa Times called the episode [...] "seminal". San Jose Mercury News said Railsback gave {{what was to be}} the [...] "ultimate X-Files performance" [...] in 2002 after the show had been cancelled. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called it [...] "a career best for Chris Carter" [...] and praised his writing and directing, noting that both were [...] "powerfully" [...] and [...] "passionately" [...] done. Shearman and Pearson also applauded the episode's simplicity, citing it as the factor that made the entry stand out from others. [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club named it an [...] "essential" [...] episode of The X-Files. Furthermore, he praised Railsback's performance, writing that [...] "there's a sweaty intensity to his best performances that makes him impossible to look away from; but you still can't accept anything he says at face value." ...|$|E

The episode received generally positive reviews. Marc Hirsh of National Public Radio said {{the addition of the}} no-nonsense Charles Miner character infused a sense of reality into The Office, which he said was growing increasingly wacky and out of control: [...] " [...] may, in fact, {{have been one of the}} most important episodes of the entire series, acting as a corrective to the show's increasing flirtations with ridiculousness. The characters of The Office have lived in a bubble for long enough." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "New Boss" [...] brought a badly needed change to the series, which he said had been in a [...] "stagnant state" [...] over the last several episodes. Fickett <b>said</b> <b>Steve</b> Carell gave [...] "a tour de force" [...] as Michael saw his power slip away, and he called the final scene when Michael quit as one of the show's biggest moments. He said, [...] "Watching Miner work like a monkey wrench thrown into the works is the most fun I've had watching this show in a long time." [...] Shahzad Abbas of TV Guide said, [...] "Overall, this was a terrific episode, tightly structured, some nice laugh-out loud moments, and a genuine shocker at the end that was completely consistent with Michael's personality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Caesar was {{considered}} a [...] "sketch comic" [...] and actor, {{as opposed to a}} stand-up comedian. He also relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV, his style {{was considered}} [...] "avant garde" [...] in the 1950s. He conjured up ideas and scene and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue. Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers were Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin, and Woody Allen. [...] "Sid's was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Steve</b> Allen.|$|E

2500|$|The F-15 is {{featured}} in the 1996 film Air Force One. The Eagle was also shown in advertisements for the 2000 film Thirteen Days. The ads were withdrawn {{when it came to}} the attention of New Line Cinema that the F-15, which first flew in 1972, was out of place for a film set in 1962. This was problematic for New Line, who had termed the film a [...] "by-the-numbers recreation" [...] and [...] "close to perfect." [...] "Every ship, plane, truck and craft that moves in the film is absolutely authentic to the time period", <b>said</b> <b>Steve</b> Elzer, a spokesman for New Line.

2500|$|When {{nominations}} were completed, {{opposition parties}} had successfully contested {{more than half}} the seats, thus denying PAP a walkover majority to form a government on nomination day, the first time since 1988. Lee Hsien Loong's response stated that he was happy that there were many opposition candidates contesting in the election, and said it is good for the maturation of Singapore's political system. He accepted the challenge from the opposition saying that [...] "we [...] don't have a majority, so we will fight this election." [...] Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim said that her party would fight for more seats in parliament but did not expect to topple the PAP government. [...] "There is no way the opposition will win every seat they contest," [...] she <b>said.</b> <b>Steve</b> Chia (NSP) had said earlier that the SDA's aim was to win 15 seats and form a shadow cabinet, to provide effective scrutiny for the government.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Said</b> <b>Steve</b> Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally ended last Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this can be tough to distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E
