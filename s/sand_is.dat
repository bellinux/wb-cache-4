5|$|Boys in the <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of three segments set on Fire Island.|$|E
5|$|Collected from coastal waters, zircon-bearing <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> {{purified}} by spiral concentrators {{to remove}} lighter materials, {{which are then}} returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> a non-fiction {{book about}} climate change denial, coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook, with a {{foreword}} by Naomi Oreskes. Washington had a background in environmental science prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in physics and founded the website Skeptical Science which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of global warming. The book {{was first published in}} hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by Earthscan, a division of Routledge.|$|E

50|$|On May 26, 2016, <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned}} to the Los Angeles KISS. On June 14, 2016, <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> placed on reassignment.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 and 2010, <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> {{honored as}} a fellow of both the Materials Research Society (MRS) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), respectively. In 2013, <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> honored as a charter fellow in the 101-member inaugural class of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI). <b>Sands</b> <b>is</b> {{also a member of}} the Phi Beta Kappa Society and Tau Beta Pi.|$|R
5|$|In both localities, B.epica occurs among heath on cliff-top dunes of deep, white {{siliceous}} sand over limestone. It co-occurs with B.media in both localities, and B.praemorsa is {{also present}} at Point Culver. Toolinna Cove <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> somewhat alkaline, making B.epica and B.media the only Banksia species that grow in alkaline soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Various customs arose {{around the}} writing of a kvitel. It is {{considered}} a bad omen if a kvitel falls on the ground, or if <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> placed on it. (Sand was commonly used as a drying agent for ink on paper.) Care is taken to write the kvitel without any mistakes, as Hasidic Jews believe that kvitelach contain deep secrets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>was</b> {{involved}} as a shortstop in three triple plays in his career. In July 1924, <b>Sand</b> <b>was</b> {{involved in a}} triple play on a ball hit by Heinie Groh.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sands</b> <b>is</b> {{the cousin}} of hurdler Shamar <b>Sands</b> who <b>is</b> also the Bahamian record holder in his event.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> {{cast in the}} NBC pilot Salvation. This was not {{picked up}} to series. <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> cast in FOX's pilot, Minority Report, as Dash, a precog. The series premiered on September 21, 2015.|$|R
5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|Boys in the <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released {{at the very}} beginnings of the Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. Boys in the Sand was the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest porn films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream credibility, preceding 1972's Deep Throat by nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
50|$|Rock <b>Sand</b> <b>was</b> a {{small brown}} horse bred by his owner Sir James Miller at his Hamilton Stud in Newmarket. Rock <b>Sand</b> <b>was</b> sired by Sainfoin, {{the winner of}} the 1890 Derby, who was bred by Queen Victoria. He was the first foal of Roquebrune by St. Simon who won two races and was a {{half-sister}} to Epsom Oaks winner Seabreeze. Rock <b>Sand</b> <b>was</b> trained throughout his career by George Blackwell at Newmarket, Suffolk.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> {{called to}} the Bar of England and Wales in 1985. In 2000 he was a {{founding}} member of Matrix Chambers and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 2003. <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> elected a Bencher of Middle Temple in 2009.|$|R

5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players can hide behind cover, vault over obstacles, and shoot enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> a key gameplay mechanic that can be manipulated to defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

50|$|Scroby <b>Sands</b> <b>is</b> 4 mi {{from the}} coast and {{separated}} by channels from the adjacent Caister shoals, Cockle Shoals, Cross Sands, Corton and Holm <b>Sands.</b> Scroby <b>sands</b> <b>is</b> frequently shown on charts as having three components, named North Scroby, Middle Scroby and South Scroby.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, Miho no Matsubara {{no longer}} has white <b>sands.</b> The <b>sands</b> <b>are</b> now uniformly black, perhaps from the {{volcanic}} rock that first formed the peninsula. One local resident's story is that the Abe River provided the white sand that made Miho such a scenic spot. During construction of the nearby shinkansen line, {{too much of the}} Abe River's white <b>sand</b> <b>was</b> used. Over time, the sea swept away the layers of white sand and no new <b>sand</b> <b>was</b> available to replenish the sand carried out to sea.|$|R
5|$|Lakes may form in basins {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> known as a playa. The deserts of North America {{have more than one}} hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter. These include the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake and many dry lake beds. The smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at Black Rock Desert and Bonneville Speedway and the United States Air Force uses Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert as runways for aircraft and the space shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E

5|$|Like {{almost all}} Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or <b>sand</b> <b>is</b> loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E

25|$|The {{base of the}} Tunbridge Wells <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> {{marked by}} a {{distinct}} change from the predominantly argillaceous sediments of the Wadhurst Clay to siltstones and silty sands. This boundary is often indicated on maps by spring lines and seepages, where groundwater percolating through the permeable Tunbridge Wells <b>Sand</b> <b>is</b> forced to surface at the junction with the Wadhurst Clay.|$|E
50|$|Jean <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> {{built at}} Brooklyn, New York, in 1863 and was {{purchased}} by the Navy at New York City from T. F. Rowland 18 October 1864. She was stationed at the Norfolk Navy Yard where she served as a tug and salvage vessel. Jean <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> sold 16 May 1892.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> {{a devout}} Roman Catholic and his {{influence}} {{was effective in}} creating a tolerance for Catholics and others of various faiths at the Naval Academy and within the military services. <b>Sands</b> <b>was</b> married to Mary Elizabeth Meade, who came from a famous Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, family. She also converted to Catholicism.|$|R
