5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the shaking. Their hit times proved to mimic the <b>seismic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation generated by the earthquake. On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start shaking. The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. <b>Seismic</b> <b>wave</b> amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of a dynamic simple shear strain test system which is the latest generation of GCTS made in USA {{as well as its}} features is presented. The input method for primarily real seismic loading is analyzed. And the validity of the method is verified. Based on the US Filter clean sand, the preparation process of the sand samples is explained. Two shock types of <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> and two vibration types of <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> are selected for input loading in tests. Considering the relative density and overlying loading, the test conditions are planned, and 202 dynamic simple shear tests controlled by strain are carried out. The test results show that the seismic compression in sands due to the vibration-type <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> is larger than that induced by the shock-type <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> under the same relative density of sands and the same overlying loading. The seismic compression is mainly caused by several <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> with relatively high peak prior to the maximum peak. And the maximum vertical shear strains in sands are corresponding to the maximum peak <b>seismic</b> <b>waves.</b> For the <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> after the maximum peak, the waves whose peak reaches 80 % of the maximum peak approximately in the <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> have more significant effectiveness on deformations of sands. For the shock-type <b>seismic</b> <b>waves,</b> various waves after the maximum peak have no obvious effect on deformations of sands. However, for the vibration-type <b>seismic</b> <b>waves,</b> the <b>seismic</b> compressions in sands are determined by the waves both prior to the maximum peak and that in a certain range after the maximum peak together...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} 10 {{stations of}} co-located seismometer, QuakeFinder/infrasound to observe co-seismic signatures {{triggered by the}} 6 February 2016 M 6. 6 Meinong Earthquake. Each QuakeFinder system consists of a 3 -axes induction magnetometer, an air conductivity sensor, a geophone, and temperature/relative humidity sensors. There are no obvious charges in the positive/negative ions, the temperature, and the humidity, while the magnetometer, the geophone, and infrasound data detect clear co-seismic signatures, similar to <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> recorded by seismometers. The magnetometers register high-frequency pulsations, like <b>seismic</b> <b>waves,</b> and superimpose with low-frequency variations, which could be caused by the magnetometer shaking/tilting and/or the underground water level change, respectively, upon the arrival of <b>seismic</b> <b>waves.</b> The spectrum centering around 2. 0 Hz of the co-seismic geophone fluctuations {{is similar to that}} of the <b>seismic</b> <b>waves.</b> However, the energy of co-seismic geophone fluctuations (also magnetometer pulsations) yields an exponential decay to the distance of a station to the epicenter, while the energy of the <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This suggests that the mechanisms for detecting <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> of the QuakeFinder system and seismometers are different. In general, the geophone and magnetometer/infrasound system are useful to record high- and low-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves,</b> respectively...|$|R
25|$|In seismology, {{several types}} of surface waves are encountered. Surface waves, in this {{mechanical}} sense, {{are commonly known as}} either Love waves (L waves) or Rayleigh waves. A <b>seismic</b> <b>wave</b> is a wave that travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion. Love waves have transverse motion (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light waves), whereas Rayleigh waves have both longitudinal (movement parallel to the direction of travel, like sound waves) and transverse motion. Seismic waves are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. Surface waves span a wide frequency range, and the period of waves that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. Surface waves can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. Surface waves are caused when P waves and S waves come to the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy of}} the nuclear {{explosion}} is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable {{with the weight of}} the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The cracked zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a <b>seismic</b> <b>wave.</b> A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting {{on the bottom of the}} cavity and the cavity content begins cooling. The rebound after the shock wave causes compressive forces to build up around the cavity, called a stress containment cage, sealing the cracks.|$|E

30|$|It is undisputed that {{a shallow}} region with large slip radiates very low-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> (Ide et al. 2011; Suzuki et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2011). However, the {{location}} in which high-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> are radiated is debatable. The {{vicinity of the}} edges of coseismic slip in which the rupture velocity changes abruptly emits high-frequency radiation (Madariaga 1977). Ide et al. (2011) considered that the shallow depths have a quiet rupture and that high-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> are radiated from deep depths. Simons et al. (2011) suggested that relatively high-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> are generated {{from the edge of}} coseismic slip at the deepest depths. The results of back-projection imaging show that the short-period energy is radiated down-dip from the hypocenter as well (Koper et al. 2011; Wang and Mori 2011). Dynamic source simulation suggests that the shallowest and deepest edges of coseismic slip all radiate high-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> (Duan 2012). By using kinematic inversion, Lee et al. (2011) demonstrated that deep depths as well as the shallow parts of a fault radiate high-frequency <b>seismic</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R
50|$|A seismic {{shadow zone}} {{is an area}} of the Earth's surface where seismographs can only barely detect an {{earthquake}} after its <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> have passed through the Earth. When an earthquake occurs, <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> radiate out spherically from the earthquake's focus. The primary <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> are refracted by the liquid outer core of the Earth and are not detected between 104° and 140° (between approximately 11570 and 15570 km) from the epicenter. The secondary <b>seismic</b> <b>waves</b> cannot pass through the liquid outer core and are not detected more than 104° (approximately 11570 km) from the epicenter. P waves that have been converted to s-waves on leaving the outer core may be detected beyond 140 degrees.|$|R

2500|$|It {{have been}} found that, the {{initially}} predicted tsunami height by the tsunami warning system was lower than the actual tsunami height {{and it could be}} connected to the delayed escape of some residents. For the purpose of quick calculation and timely warning, initial earthquake and tsunami warning being issued for the event was base on , which only take about 3 minutes to calculate but is based on the maximum amplitude of <b>seismic</b> <b>wave,</b> similar to Richter magnitude scale, and is thus suffer from the same problem of saturation above the certain earthquake magnitude (Magnitude 8 for JMA magnitude), which resulted in underestimation on tsunami height in initial reports. Also, the warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after earthquake occur when calculation for moment magnitude scale completed, however thee strong quake have exceeded the measure limit of all the teleseismometer within Japan and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those meters. The second update on the tsunami warning was released 28 minutes after the earthquake based on observation, which was reportedly unable to reach some residents due to circumstances like power cut, and observed data from off coast tidal meter were also not fully reflected in the second warning. Also, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters have reported a fluctuation of [...] "20 centimeter" [...] and the value was broadcast across mass media and warning system, which caused some resident to underestimate the situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation.|$|E

50|$|In {{reflection}} seismology, the anelastic attenuation factor, often {{expressed as}} seismic quality factor or Q (which is {{inversely proportional to}} attenuation factor), quantifies the effects of anelastic attenuation on the seismic wavelet caused by fluid movement and grain boundary friction.
