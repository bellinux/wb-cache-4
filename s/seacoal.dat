5|$|<b>Seacoal</b> – a film made by Amber Films in 1985. The {{station is}} {{features}} heavily {{as a backdrop}} in the beach scenes, where the characters are working, collecting <b>seacoal.</b> Photographer Mik Critchlow (who would later become involved with Amber Films' sister company Side Gallery) also documented the seacoalers at Lynemouth, between 1981 and 1983. He also used the power station as an industrial backdrop {{to some of his}} images.|$|E
5|$|When {{still in}} operation, the power {{stations}} appeared in films and television programs {{shot in the}} Newcastle area. They appeared in Payroll, a movie made in 1961, starring Michael Craig. One of two security van operators lives in Stella park, a housing estate above the power station. It is prominently in the background whenever the van operator's home is shown. In 1985, the Stella power stations are seen briefly in a shot in <b>Seacoal,</b> a movie made by Amber Films. They appear during a scene where the two protagonists, Ray and Betty, are travelling from Sunderland to Newcastle. (Lynemouth power station, a North East power station still in operation, is more prominent in the film.) In Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, a British sitcom broadcast between 1973 and 1974, the stations themselves did {{not appear in the}} series, but in the end credits their ash boat, Bessie Surtees, could be seen passing Spiller's Wharf near Byker. In 1981, it was featured in Swing Bridge Videos' Check it Out, a short film about youth unemployment in the west end of Newcastle. In the mid-1990s, the decommissioned stations were photographed by north eastern artist John Kippin as part of his work The Secret Intelligence of the Silent. This piece was exhibited at the Laing Art Gallery in 2012 as part of the exhibition Futureland Now.|$|E
2500|$|No {{evidence}} exists {{of the product}} being of great importance in Britain before the High Middle Ages, after about AD 1000. Mineral coal came {{to be referred to}} as [...] "seacoal" [...] in the 13th century; the wharf where the material arrived in London was known as <b>Seacoal</b> Lane, so identified in a charter of King Henry III granted in 1253. Initially, the name was given because much coal was found on the shore, having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops, but by the time of Henry VIII, it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to London by sea. In 1257–1259, coal from Newcastle upon Tyne was shipped to London for the smiths and lime-burners building Westminster Abbey. <b>Seacoal</b> Lane and Newcastle Lane, where coal was unloaded at wharves along the River Fleet, are still in existence.

5000|$|Channel 4 {{helped to}} finance and produce their first feature-length film, <b>Seacoal,</b> a semi-fictional {{narrative}} set among the coal-collectors on Lynemouth beach, {{close to the}} coal-mining towns of Ellington and Ashington. The BFI's Martin Hunt comments that <b>Seacoal</b> [...] "built upon earlier techniques and experiments to interweave a fictional narrative with documentary footage, and improvised and reconstructed dramatic scenes. The final film {{was the product of}} two years' working and living alongside the seacoalers." [...] The film won the European Film Award.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Great Fire of London in 1666, Christopher Wren's {{proposal}} for widening {{the river was}} rejected. Rather, the Fleet was converted into the New Canal, completed in 1680 {{under the supervision of}} Robert Hooke. Newcastle Close and Old <b>Seacoal</b> Lane (now just short alleyways off Farringdon Street) recall the wharves that used to line this canal, especially used by the coastal coal trade from the North East of England. (An adjacent narrow road, <b>Seacoal</b> Lane, also existed until the late 20th century when the present building fronting onto Farringdon Street was built, perhaps suggesting that a new wharf had been built near the old one.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} the film lie {{in the making of}} <b>Seacoal,</b> which was {{released}} in 1985. This film depicted the lives of seacoalers on the Northumberland coast, and introduced members of Amber to a passion for horses, and the addictive pursuit of harness racing. The Laidler family, who were featured in <b>Seacoal,</b> proved to have a profound impact. It was they who talked some members of the Amber Production Team into buying their first horse, taught them the rudiments of training and driving, and encouraged their bartering and re-cycling skills. The Laidlers wove the web that pulled Amber into the activity, and secured entry into their environment and the world of harness racing.|$|E

50|$|Amber Films is a {{film and}} {{photography}} collective based in Newcastle upon Tyne with an aim to capture working-class life in North East England. Often combining professional and non-professional actors, Amber has produced several documentary and feature films of varying lengths, sometimes blending documentary with fiction. Their productions have included <b>Seacoal</b> and Eden Valley, along with a drama-documentary about 1960s Newcastle City Council leader, T. Dan Smith.|$|E
50|$|In 1603 Plat gave {{an account}} of an {{invention}} of cheap fuel—i.e. coal mixed with clay and other substances, and kneaded into balls—in a tract called 'Of Coal-Balls for Fewell wherein <b>Seacoal</b> is, by the mixture of other combustible Bodies, both sweetened and multiplied,' London, 1603. Richard Gosling reissued in 1628 {{an account of}} Plat's device, and developed it further in his 'Artificial Fire,' 1644.|$|E
5000|$|Amber Films {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} collective crediting of its films {{with the release of}} <b>Seacoal</b> in 1985. Amber argues that [...] "all Amber members are involved in all the different areas of operation". Whilst individual members eventually take on specific roles - director, sound recordist, cinematographer - during specific productions, the project's ongoing development is collectively owned by all those involved. Amber therefore credit their films collectively, rather than singling out individuals for roles in the production that are deemed socially superior by conventional society.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the bottom}} of Ludgate Hill, on the north side, is Limeburner Lane. This {{may sound like a}} quaint {{survival}} from medieval times, but it was actually constructed in the 1990s, where <b>Seacoal</b> Lane used to be. This was the location of the Bell Savage Inn, first mentioned in 1452 where plays were performed. According to surveyor John Stow the name was derived from Isabella Savage, but Addison claimed it was [...] "La belle Sauvage", a woman in the wilderness. The clown Richard Tarlton used to perform here. It is mentioned in Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's Schooldays and Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers. In October 1684, a [...] "Rynoceros lately brought from the East Indies" [...] was put on show there. The inn was demolished in 1873. In 1851, part of it was rented out to John Cassell (1817-1865), a notable publisher. At this time it was still called La Belle Sauvage Yard and the firm of Cassell used [...] "la Belle Sauvage" [...] in some of their imprints.|$|E
50|$|Wood {{craftsmen}} {{begin by}} making {{a model of the}} desired metal object from hardwood, using lathes, saws, and planes, which were all powered by the Knight Wheels. The model, called a pattern, is then placed in a casting flask, in its simplest form a topless and bottomless box split in half around its perimeter. The flask is placed on a board and a sand mixture (containing <b>seacoal,</b> bentonite clay, and pitch) poured and rammed around the pattern. The additives harden and stabilize the sand so that the flask can be split apart and the pattern removed leaving an exact impression or mold in the sand. The pattern can be reused almost indefinitely to create more molds in additional casting flasks. A channel or gate is left in the sand so that when the flask is rejoined, the ironworkers can pour the molten iron into it through the opening. When the iron has solidified the flask is broken apart, destroying the sand mold in the process, to reveal the rough casting.|$|E

40|$|In sand moulds, at a {{distance}} of 3 mm from the metal- mould interface, the sensors of temperature, and of oxygen and hydrogen content were installed. Temperature and the evolution of partial gas pressure have been analysed in moulds bonded with bentonite with or without the addition of <b>seacoal,</b> water glass or furan resin. Moulds were poured with ductile iron. For comparison, also tests with the grey iron have been executed. It was found that the gas atmosphere near the interface depends mainly on the content of a carbonaceous substance in the mould. In the green sand moulds with 5 % of <b>seacoal</b> or bonded with furan resin, after the mould filling, a sudden increase in the hydrogen content and the drop of oxygen is observed. This gas evolution results from the oxidation of carbon and reduction of water vapour in the mould material, and also from the reduction of water vapour and alloy reoxidation. In carbon-free sand, the evolution in the gas composition is slower because water vapour is reduced only at the interface. Changes of oxygen and hydrogen content in the controlled zone are determined by the transport phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Drops {{of molten}} cast iron {{were placed on}} {{moulding}} sand substrates. The composition of the forming gaseous atmosphere was examined. It was found {{that as a result}} of the cast iron contact with water vapour released from the sand, a significant amount of hydrogen was evolved. In all the examined moulding sands, including sands without carbon, a large amount of CO was formed. The source of carbon monoxide was carbon present in cast iron. In the case of bentonite moulding sand with <b>seacoal</b> and sand bonded with furan resin, in the composition of the gases, the trace amounts of hydrocarbons, i. e. benzene, toluene, styrene and naphthalene (BTX), appeared. As the formed studies indicate much higher content of BTX at lower temperature it was concluded that the hydrocarbons are unstable in contact with molten iron...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} program {{was successful in}} identifying the major factoirs that influence penetration. This was done first through {{a case study of}} penetration samples. The study revealed that both chemical and mechanical penetration were present in carbon and high manganese steels. It also found that only mechanical penetration is found in stainless steel samples. It should be noted that when mechanical penetration does occur, there is a greater risk of chemical reactions with the mold. Therefore, it is common to confuse mechanical penetration with chemical. Sessile drop experiments were run to discover the effect of steel chemistry on the contact angle for different substrates. These experiments revealed the best substrates for each type of metal. Bauxite, magnesite, and mullite were discovered to be the best materials for resisting mechanical penetration. It was also shown that high manganese steels cannot be poured into silica molds and that stainless steel should not be poured in chromite molds. The sessile drop data was used to develop a mechanical penetration model which correctly predicted penetration in sixteen of twenty castings poured at the University of Alabama. Mold/metal atmosphere tests were run to understand the effects of the atmosphere on chemical penetration. It was found that the chemistry affecting penetration has its greatest effect as the casting is just poured. Chemical penetration for low carbon steels cannot be completely eliminated by adding carbon (<b>seacoal)</b> to green sand molds although a marked decrease is obtained in its severity. Extremely high carbon concentrations might be able to totally eliminate the penetration but are not used because of their possible diffusion into the steel causing carburization. A chemical penetration model was produced and its results agree well with the experimental results...|$|E
