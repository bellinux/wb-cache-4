5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 19th century, Americans {{increasingly}} {{settled in}} the Arizona Territory, following the Mexican-American War and the subsequent Gadsden Purchase including Southern Arizona. George Pusch, a German immigrant, {{settled in the}} area of Oro Valley in 1874, establishing a cattle ranch. This ranch was unique because it utilized a <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> to provide water, eventually popularizing Pusch's property as the <b>Steam</b> <b>Pump</b> Ranch on the Cañada del Oro. The <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was one of only two in the Arizona Territory.|$|E
25|$|Seven guard locks, {{often called}} inlet locks (numbered 1 through 8) were built to allow water and {{sometimes}} boats (particularly at Big Slackwater and Little Slackwater) to enter. Dam #7 and Guard Lock #7 were proposed (near mile 164 at the South Branch of the Potomac) but never built. In 1856, {{there was a}} <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> put at that site. Later, in 1872, a new <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was put near mile 174.|$|E

25|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>Pump</b> Ranch: Located in {{the heart}} of Oro Valley, the <b>Steam</b> <b>Pump</b> Ranch dates back to the mid-1870s when George Pusch settled in the area. Pusch was an Arizona state {{legislator}} and delegate to the original Arizona Constitutional Convention in 1910. The ranch {{is in the process of}} being preserved by the town and includes several original buildings from the ranch itself. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 2009.|$|E
25|$|Since {{these were}} locks to {{regulate}} water {{coming into the}} canal, they are frequently called inlet locks. At the slackwaters (particularly at Big Slackwater and Little Slackwater) they allowed boats to reenter the canal from the slackwater. There is no guard lock #7, since Dam #7 was proposed to be around mile 164 {{near the mouth of}} South Branch, but it was never built. A <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was later put where this dam would have been in 1856. In 1872, a new <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was put 10 miles upstream at mile 174.2, and gave about 24 cubic feet per second of water.|$|E

50|$|The {{invention}} of <b>steam</b> <b>pumps</b> meant that water could be supplied directly to homes, and pumped upward from fountains. The new fountains in Trafalgar Square (1845) used <b>steam</b> <b>pumps</b> from an artesian well.

25|$|Grampus {{needed a}} {{windlass}} {{in order to}} work her gear, and the Fish Commission opted for a steam windlass. United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Zera Luther Tanner, an influential inventor and oceanographer of the era, commanding officer of the Fish Commissions fisheries research ship USFC Albatross, and previously the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, received the task of determining what type of steam apparatus Grampus should carry. He chose a steam windlass with engines of 35-horsepower (26.1-kW). Operating the windlass required the installation of a boiler, <b>steam</b> <b>pump,</b> iron water tanks, and associated piping.|$|E
25|$|The line {{built by}} Isambard Kingdom Brunel {{runs along the}} South Devon Railway sea wall which is a stone {{embankment}} between the sea and cliffs that runs for several miles between Teignmouth and Dawlish Warren. This line was originally both broad gauge and worked by the atmospheric system, with <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> houses at regular intervals to create the vacuum. It was not successful {{for a host of}} reasons and was converted to normal steam locomotive working. Redundant sections of the atmospheric railway pipes were used as drains all over Teignmouth. One was set in the roadside in Woodway Lane, near Woodway House.|$|E
25|$|The {{water supply}} was {{supplemented}} by mill streams, which were diverted into the canal {{after the company}} bought out mills at Wendover, Halton and Weston Turville. They also built Weston Turville reservoir in 1798, which was used to supply the mills in Aylesbury, whose water supply had been diverted into the canal. The reservoir was also used to replenish the canal and, as milling technology developed, this became its primary purpose. A <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was installed in 1814 which fed water to the canal through underground pipes. Although only installed as a temporary solution, it continued to operate until 1839.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1820s Ericsson and Braithwaite were working {{together}} building horse drawn fire engines with <b>steam</b> <b>pumps.</b> These used a boiler designed by Ericsson and {{were built in}} the London works of John Braithwaite.|$|R
25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the exhaust steam feedwater heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary <b>steam</b> <b>pump.</b> The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E
25|$|Further {{development}} work {{was required to}} enable the mine to be worked systematically and the Rogers' Golden Gate produced 3,295 tons of quartz yielding 3,947 ounces of gold in 1900. The mine was worked with two stem engines of eight and ten horsepower, two sets of double winding gear, one <b>steam</b> <b>pump,</b> and one whip, valued at £850. In 1902 additional plant was erected including three steam engines {{with a total of}} 51 horsepower, one single and two sets of double winding gear. The straight shaft was done to 510 feet and the underlie of the extended shaft down to 531 feet. The mine kept 15 head of stamps at the Golden Gate mill constantly employed. The mine was partly tributed in 1904 with the tributers doing well. In 1906 Rogers' Golden Gate was the Golden Gate line's largest producer - 2,000 tons for 10,527 ounces by the tributers.|$|E
500|$|Increasing demand {{led to the}} {{construction}} of a reservoir in 1876, from which water was drawn, still pumped by prisoners. From 1888 to 1894, additional wells were built, connected by a series of tunnels or horizontal drives [...] under the north-east of the prison. A <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was implemented, which drew [...] per hour of water into the new East Reservoir. In 1896, a town reservoir was constructed on Swanbourne Street, fed from the prison by a triple expansion steam-driven pump which could take more than [...] per day from the prison tunnels. Prisoners, relieved of manual pumping, were employed to supply wood and stoke boilers.|$|E
50|$|The Potteries Waterworks Company, {{formed in}} 1847, {{supplied}} water to Goldenhill and Kidsgrove by pumping {{water from a}} <b>steam</b> <b>pumping</b> plant in Tunstall, built in 1854, to a new reservoir on the higher ground at Goldenhill.|$|R

25|$|Water was a {{precious}} resource, spent {{each time a}} lock was emptied as a boat changed level. <b>Steam</b> <b>pumps</b> were employed at many flights of locks to pump water back to a higher level, for example, the Smethwick Engine.|$|R
500|$|The first {{mechanical}} {{pumping station}} on the Somerset Levels was built in 1830 to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery. The success of the drainage system {{led to the formation}} of other drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations. The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and scoop wheel (like a water wheel running backwards) but, after 25 years, there were problems pumping the water away because the land had dropped as it dried out despite the wheel being raised [...] in 1843. A better method was sought, and in 1861 the present Easton and Amos pump was installed. The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne (pronounced 'reen') into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, by which time the local drainage system had been linked into King's Sedgemoor Drain, which discharged further down the River Parrett; the water levels dropped and the pump was unable to draw the water from the rhyne. Additionally, the Parrett riverbank has now been raised by some [...] in the vicinity of the pumping station and the opening to the river, from the base of the pump-well, is now bricked up. In 1951 a diesel pump, with a capacity of 50tons per minute, was installed by the Environment Agency in an adjacent building meaning that the <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> was no longer needed.|$|E
500|$|By about 08:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade {{had entered}} Bureir and around {{an hour later}} the 2nd Light Horse [...] Brigade was {{approaching}} Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein's Eighth Army headquarters at Hulayqat. Here Ottoman soldiers were discovered to be occupying a strong position on high ground north-west of the village; the brigade made a dismounted attack capturing 600 prisoners along with large amounts of supplies, materiel and an abandoned German field hospital. At midday El Mejdel, [...] north-east of Gaza, was occupied with little difficulty by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, who captured 170 prisoners and found a good well with a <b>steam</b> <b>pump</b> enabling the brigade to water all horses expeditiously. After passing the ancient town of Ashkelon a message was received from the Desert Mounted Corps notifying the Anzac Mounted Division that the British XXI Corps were marching towards El Mejdel and Julis. The main Ottoman road and railway leading north from Gaza were both cut and as a consequence, Chauvel ordered the division to advance towards Bayt Daras. The division duly turned north-east with the 1st Light Horse Brigade entering Isdud close to the Mediterranean Sea. On the right, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured the villages of Suafir el Sharkiye and Arak Suweidan, a convoy and its escort (some 350 prisoners). While the brigade was reorganising, Ottoman guns further north opened fire, shelling both captors and captives alike. Just before dark the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured a further 200 prisoners. The Anzac Mounted Division took up a night battle outpost line along high ground south of the Wadi Mejma, from near Isdud to Arak Suweidan.|$|E
