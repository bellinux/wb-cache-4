5|$|The Dirty Picture is a 2011 Indian biographical musical drama film {{inspired}} by the life of Silk Smitha, a South Indian actress noted for her erotic roles. The filmmakers have clarified that the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> officially or literally based on Smitha alone, but on many of her southern contemporaries such as Disco Shanti. It also resembles the personal lives of other women in popular culture, including Hollywood actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. The film was directed by Milan Luthria and co-produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, after Ekta {{came up with the}} idea and asked screenwriter Rajat Aroraa to pen a story based on it.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Fragments of Him {{is based}} on {{the life and death of}} Will, a man who dies early in the game. The player controls four characters throughout the game; Will, his ex-girlfriend, his boyfriend at the time when he died, and his grandmother. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only based on Will's life, but also on those of the other characters, and how they cope with his death. The game relies heavily on its narrative which, although the player controls the game in the first-person, is described by the developer as being viewed in a second-person perspective, i.e. where the player is not directly controlling a character but instead indicates what the characters should interact with next.|$|E
5|$|Various regiments were {{stationed}} at Craigiehall Camp during the Second World War, including Royal Artillery, Royal Signals, and anti-aircraft units. On 12 May 1945, {{the surrender of}} German forces in Norway was negotiated and signed at Craigiehall. A rumour, related in Major Innes' book, states that Rudolf Hess was brought to Craigiehall after he flew to Scotland in 1941 to contact the Duke of Hamilton. This rumour {{is based on a}} photograph of Hess supposedly once on display at Craigiehall, although the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> corroborated.|$|E

5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, Elisa (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of an elderly man named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which Elisa gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton along on their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and Elisa are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though Elisa tells the son that his <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> true. As Elisa distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with Elisa to Mr. Templeton, which he understands, and promises Jack he will not tell his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E

According to the text, Huineng won this contest, but had to flee the monastery to avoid the rage of the supporters of Henxui.

25|$|Although Mutendi's {{biography}} is well known, it {{has recently}} been questioned as new documentation has come to light.

25|$|Geochemical {{evidence}} supports {{the hypothesis that}} some intrusions result from plume magmatism.

However, the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so simple, because most ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions also correlate with craton margins, perhaps because they are exhumed more efficiently in cratonic margins because of faulting and subsequent orogeny.|$|E

Since Jordanes served as the notary of Andag's son Gunthigis, even if this latter <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> true, this version was certainly a proud family tradition.|$|E
25|$|Story Telling-The protagonist, Anna Andrianovna, takes {{great pride}} in {{identifying}} herself as a storyteller and poet.

Though she presents her tale as the story of her children's lives, as the novel progresses, it becomes apparent that the <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> about Anna's children, but about Anna herself and the way she relates them.|$|E
