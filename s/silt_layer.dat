40|$|Groundwater {{dynamics}} {{may play}} a significant role in landslides. A detailed model is developed of the groundwater dynamics in landslides in varved clays in the Trièves area in the French Alps. The varved clays consist of a sequence of alternating <b>silt</b> and clay <b>layers,</b> covered by a colluvium layer and cut through by fissures. The hydraulic conductivity of the clay layers is negligible compared to the <b>silt</b> <b>layers.</b> It is conceptualized that fissures form a hydraulic connection between the colluvium and the varved clays. Groundwater recharge flows through the colluvium into the fissures where water is exchanged horizontally between the fissure and the <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> of the varved clays. Groundwater flow in the colluvium is simulated with the Boussinesq equation while flow in the <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> of the varved clays is simulated with the Richards' equation. Longitudinal outflow from the fissure is simulated with a linear-reservoir model. Scattered data of relatively short monitoring periods is available for several landslides in the region. A good similarity between observed and simulated heads is obtained, especially when considering the lack of important physical parameters such as the fissure width and the distance between the monitoring point and the fissure. A simulation for the period 1959 – 2004 showed some correlation between peaks in the simulated heads and the recorded occurrence of landslides while the bottom of the varved clays remained saturated during the entire simulation period.

40|$|The sediments in gravity core DH- 1, {{collected}} from Shenhu {{area on the}} northern slope of the South China Sea, are composed of two dark grey clay <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> (A(1) and A(3)) and two foraminifera-rich layers (A(2) and A(4)) (A(1) is the top layer and A(4) is the bottom layer). Major and trace metal contents, along with grain size and mineralogic data suggest that these <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> represent background hemipelagic sedimentation. Unlike <b>silt</b> <b>layers,</b> the intervening foraminifera-rich layerA(4) exhibits a fining-upward trend, is distal turbidite. Grain size CM diagram and the sharp contacts between the foraminifera-rich layer A(2) and {{the upper and lower}} layers suggest layer A(2) is the result of depositional interaction between turbidite and bottom currents. AMS 14 C dating of planktonic foraminifera indicate the age of the turbidite in A(2) is between 15. 3 ka and 22. 6 ka. We hypothesize that turbidite formation in this period was related to the increase supply of terrigenous matter since the Last Glacial Maximum. The rapid deposition of each turbidite led to reduced rates of oxygen diffusion into the sediment, allowing anoxic conditions develop in sediments and fostering U enrichment (> 3. 1 mu g/g) in foraminifera-rich layer A(4 b). In contrast, decrease concentration of U and U/Mo ratios in foraminifera-rich layerA(2), which is possibly due to U remobilization as a consequence of downward penetration of the oxidation front from the oxygen rich bottom currents. These new data suggest that authigenic U was quite sensitive to the inflow of bottom currents, and U/Mo ratios may indicate the depositional environmental change in relation to the bottom current action on the turbidite.

50|$|Sediments {{that are}} {{carried in the}} {{suspended}} load of a stream, commonly silts and clays, are transported into the lake in suspension or by currents along the lake floor. These are the principal deposits during the winter {{because of lack of}} melting of the glacier so the stream has a reduced discharge therefore carrying less coarse material. These sediments normally consist of fine-grained rhythmites that are laid down in layers known as varves or varvites. A varve represent an annual deposit of silt and clay. Sedimentation in deltas also occurs in rhythmic patterns as in the lake deposits, but they are thicker and contain coarse-grained materials instead of just silt and clay. As the varves get closer to the shoreline the clay layer will stay relatively the same thickness, but there will be an increase in thickness of the <b>silt</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of {{freshwater}} wetlands in the global carbon cycle has become more important as evidence of climate change grows. In this paper, we examine the burial and decomposition of particulate organic matter (POM) in a temperate, siliciclastic, seasonal wetland. High POM abundances are found in <b>silt</b> <b>layers,</b> while sand units preserve very little POM. The POM distribution with depth is compared to the biogeochemistry of sediment porewater with depth. POM acts as a driver for reduction reactions within the wetland soil. Porewater biogeochemistry and POM decomposition are controlled by seasonal changes {{in the level of}} the water table which cause seasonal shifts in the oxic/anoxic boundary. At the oxic/anoxic boundary, reoxidation of FeS minerals in the soil cause rapid POM decomposition at the average minimum water table level in the late summer and early fall. Variation in the minimum depth of the water table from year to year may account for fluctuating POM numbers in the upper <b>silt</b> <b>layers.</b> The results from this study can be used to predict seasonal water level fluctuations in ancient wetland and to explain recurrence horizons in peat...|$|R

40|$|Earthquake induced {{cyclic loading}} has the {{potential}} to destabilize submarine slopes either by liquefaction in coarse-grained deposits or by cyclic softening in cohesive sediments. Vibratory cone penetration tests (VCPTU) represent a new approach for the evaluation of cyclic softening in fine grained sediments. In the past, VPCTU were utilized to evaluate liquefaction potential of sands, but cyclic softening of fine-grained marine sediments has not yet been tested with VCPTU in situ. At the study site in Orkdalsfjord, mid Norway marine clayey silt deposits are interbedded with coarse <b>silt</b> and clay <b>layers.</b> Static and vibratory CPTU were performed down to 19 m penetration depth using the Geotechnical Offshore Seabed Tool (GOST) and in addition, two gravity cores were taken for cyclic triaxial testing and geotechnical index tests. From static and vibratory CPTU a number of coarse <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> with a distinct drop in cyclic cone resistance were identified. Compared to surrounding finer sediments the coarse <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> exhibited a higher potential for cyclic softening. This assumption is supported by cyclic triaxial tests on very coarse and surrounding medium-coarse silts, respectively, revealing a strong loss of cyclic shear strength in a controlled and documented stress-strain regime. This study highlights the potential for VCPTU as a promising tool to qualitatively evaluate the vulnerability of marine silts to cyclic softening. In combination with advanced laboratory tests these results are envisioned to help better identifying submarine slopes subjected to failure during earthquakes...|$|R

Records from the 20 th century showed that this species had disappeared from the Common Meuse in the Netherlands, probably due to river regulation or changes in water quality. A field survey in 2003 showed that H. sulphurea was present in the Geul tributary, approximately 300 m upstream of its confluence with the Common Meuse. H. sulphurea has not recolonized the Common Meuse despite improvements in water quality over the last decades.

40|$|A shallow {{unconfined}} glaciofluvial aquifer in North Dakota (USA) has largest groundwater sulfate concentrations {{near the}} bottom boundary. A deltaic <b>silt</b> <b>layer</b> underlying the aquifer, at > 16 m, is the modern proximate sulfate source for the aquifer. The original sulfate source was pyrite in the organic-rich shale component of the aquifer and silt grain matrix.

A method was developed for estimating the approximate initial sulfate concentration in the source layer and the redistribution time since the oxidizing event, using a semi-generic convection-dispersion model. The convection-dispersion model and a model for the evolution of modern sulfate δ 34 S in silt-layer pore water from the initial grain-matrix pyrite δ 34 S, both estimated that the oxidizing event occurred several thousand years ago, and was likely related to the dry conditions of the Hypsithermal Interval.

The ratio of motile to attached benthic diatoms from five different stream sites in Hong Kong was correlated with the level of suspended solids for each of these sites. Sites with high concentrations of suspended solids had a high percentage of motile diatoms on their rocks while sites with low concentrations of suspended solids had a high percentage of attached (non-motile) diatoms on their rocks. When water carried by a stream has a high concentration of suspended solids, benthic diatoms in the stream are often covered in a layer of silt.

Although there have been more than 500 suction caissons installed in various locations around the world,understanding of this concept is still limited. This thesis investigates the installation aspect of suction caissons, focusing on the installation in dense sand and layered soils, where sand is inter-bedded by silt and weakly cemented layers. The research was mainly experimental, at both normal gravity and elevated acceleration levels in a geotechnical centrifuge, with some numerical simulations to complement the experimental observations. This study firstly explored the suction caisson installation response in the laboratory at 1 g. The influence and effect of different design parameters, which include caisson size and wall thickness, and operational parameters including pumping rate and the use of surcharge were investigated in dense silica sand. The sand heave inside the caisson formed during these installations was also recorded and compared between tests. The 1 g study also investigated the possibility of installing suction caissons in layered sand-silt soil, where caissons were installed by both slow and rapid pumping. The heave formation in this case is also discussed. The mechanism of heave formation in dense sand and deformation of the <b>silt</b> <b>layer</b> was further investigated using a half-caisson model and the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The installation response at prototype soil stress conditions was then investigated in a geotechnical centrifuge. The effects of caisson size, wall thickness, as well as surcharge were investigated in various types of sand, including silica sand, calcareous sand dredged from the North Rankin site in the North West Shelf (Australia), and mixed soil where silica sand was mixed with different contents of silica flour. Comparison with the 1 g results was also made. The general trend for the suction pressure during installation in homogenous sand was identified. The installation in layered soil was also investigated in the centrifuge. The installation tests were performed in various sand-silt profiles, where the silt layers were on the surface and embedded within the sand. Comparison with the results in homogenous sand was made to explore the influence of the <b>silt</b> <b>layer.</b> Installations in calcareous sand with cemented layers were also conducted. The penetration mechanism through the cemented layer is discussed, and also compared with the penetration mechanism through the <b>silt</b> <b>layer.</b> Finite element modelling was performed to simulate key installation behaviour. In particular, it was applied to simulate the sand deformation observed in the PIV tests. The likely loosening range of the internal sand plug during suction installation in silica sand was estimated. By investigating the development of hydraulic gradient along the inner wall, the principle underlying the suction response for different combinations of selfweight and wall thickness was identified. FE modelling was also performed to explore the influence of the hydraulic blockage by the <b>silt</b> <b>layer.</b> This study found that the caissons could penetrate into all soils by suction installation. Among the key findings are the observations that the suction pressure increases with depth following a distinct pressure slope, corresponding to a critical hydraulic condition along the inner wall; and the installation was possible in both layered sand-silt and uncemented-cemented soils if sufficient pumping was available. While the caisson could penetrate the weakly cemented layers well with no notable adverse effects, problems were observed in the installation in layered sand-silt soil. These include piping failure in slow pumping rate installation at 1 g, and the formation of extremely unstable soil heave during installation...|$|E

Radiocarbon ages of the two <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> at Lynch Cove are 1690 – 1830 A. D. (120 – 260 cal yr BP, layer A), and 1170 – 1230 A. D. (720 – 780 cal yr BP, layer B). These ages more closely align with the ages of two Cascadia earthquakes than with any other known earthquake in the Puget Sound region within the last 1, 000 years. These the <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> may have been deposited by tsunamis generated by Cascadia subduction thrust earthquakes, as were likely correlative deposits at another tidal marsh at Discovery Bay, along the tsunami path between the Pacific Ocean and Hood Canal. This study improves the age ranges of the youngest six tsunami deposits at Discovery Bay, and compares them to layers A and B at Lynch Cove, and to the ages of known earthquakes and their secondary effects, including tsunamis and slope failures, of the last 1, 200 years in the Pacific Northwest. Beds 1 and 3 at Discovery Bay are attributed to Cascadia subduction thrust tsunamis, and have radiocarbon ages that overlap with the ages of layers A and B at Lynch Cove. Discovery Bay Bed 2 has now been dated to 560 - 630 cal yr BP (1320 - 1390 A. D.). It is unclear why no corresponding deposit is present between layers A and B at Lynch Cove, and why no known 14 th-century coseismic subsidence or tsunami is preserved at any of the Pacific coast estuaries of southern Washington. The source of the tsunami that deposited Discovery Bay Bed 2 remains to be determined. If the source was a rupture along the Cascadia subduction thrust, it may have been limited to an area offshore southern British Columbia and northern Washington, on the northern end of the subduction zone. To test whether Cascadia tsunamis could have deposited the <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> at Lynch Cove and Discovery Bay, numerical tsunami simulations were run for three different rupture styles of great Cascadia earthquakes, a local Seattle fault tsunami, and a transoceanic tsunami from Alaska. The Cascadia earthquake tsunami simulations produced flow depths and current speeds sufficient to deposit the <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> at both Lynch Cove and Discovery Bay, while the Seattle fault simulation did not. The Alaska tsunami simulation also produced flooding at Lynch Cove and Discovery Bay, in agreement with historical observations from 1964. Using the inferred tsunami deposits at Lynch Cove as time markers for great Cascadia earthquakes, the paleoecology of the last ~ 1, 000 years is reconstructed using fossil diatoms to test whether Lynch Cove, 240 km inland of the deformation front, records any Cascadia earthquake cycle deformation. A diatom transfer function was developed by statistically comparing the fossil diatoms at Lynch Cove to a training set of modern intertidal diatoms from Puget Sound. Using this method, 31 paleomarsh surface elevations were reconstructed, and with radiocarbon ages, a relative sea level curve was constructed. An overall rise in relative sea level of about 2. 5 m is estimated at Lynch Cove over the last 1, 000 years, a rate that is faster than rates estimated by other Puget Sound studies. Superimposed on this overall relative sea level rise, paleomarsh surface elevations are observed to rise by about 25 cm prior to the deposition of both layers A and B. While these may record Cascadia preseismic deformation, these rises are within the error range of adjacent data points, so are inconclusive. Because of this, Lynch Cove marsh is interpreted as a location that probably does not record Cascadia earthquake cycle vertical deformation. Lynch Cove is the only forearc data point of vertical interseismic deformation for the Cascadia subduction zone, and these negative results provide an inland limit of earthquake cycle deformation. The findings of this research help to better understand hazards from Cascadia earthquakes and tsunamis in the Puget Sound region. The identification of paleotsunami {{deposits in}} Hood Canal identifies a tsunami hazard that was previously unknown. The tsunami simulations corroborate the geological evidence, and identify some areas in Puget Sound with greater tsunami hazard. This study also places constraints on the inland limit of Cascadia earthquake deformation. This is important for accurate estimates of areas of strong shaking, which influence earthquake hazard maps, and for geophysical models. This research also influences estimates of earthquake recurrence. If Bed 2 at Discovery Bay is from a northern Cascadia earthquake, recurrence rates at the northern end of the subduction zone may be shorter than current estimates...|$|R

40|$|As part of English Nature's Lakes Flagship Project {{to address}} adverse {{environmental}} impacts on selected, important lakes, a proposal {{has been made}} to dredge Aqualate Mere. The site has experienced rapid, 'recent' sedimentation thought to be derived from a nearby canal. The aim of this study has been to determine the recent sedimentation history of the site in order to assess the possibility of the disposal to land of its sediments and the efficacy of this form of lake restoration. A predominantly clayey <b>silt</b> <b>layer</b> was found across the lake beneath which darker, organic-rich sediments were noted. This transition may represent the input of canal-derived sediments, although it may reflect other environmental changes at this time. The radiometric dating technique employed was unable to date this sediment boundary. A further change in the characteristics of {{the upper part of the}} clayey <b>silt</b> <b>layer</b> may represent an additional influence of the canal. Heavy metal levels were modest, whereas nutrient levels were relatively high and some pesticides were detected. Topsoil erosion supplying nutrients and other compounds associated with agriculture have been an important source of the lower layers of the clayey silt sediments in particular. The highest levels of most pollutants were found in the finer sediments in the uppermost (post- 1950 s) part of the sediment profile. These sediments appear to reflect a change in the characteristics of the sediments of the canal, which was associated with a change in the nature of its water supply. The key geochemical properties of the sediments should not preclude the land-based disposal of dredged materials under current UK regulations for waste management. Accurate estimation of sediment quantities was limited, as the interface between the 'recent' and underlying sediments was not positively identified at all sample points...|$|E
40|$|The Site is {{a former}} dry {{cleaning}} operation where a release of perchloroethylene (PCE) to soil and groundwater had occurred. Hydrogen Release Compound® (HRC) is being used for source control to mitigate vapor intrusion to the existing building. The Site {{is located in the}} Connecticut River basin with PCE up to 250 mg/L in perched groundwater above a silt-layer aquitard. Site risk is driven by the soil vapor intrusion pathway into the commercial building. Soil vapor extraction was implemented to mitigate vapor intrusion, with no appreciable change in the perched groundwater conditions and rapid rebound of PCE in soil gas to pre-treatment levels in four months. Our evaluation of soil data following multiple HRC applications over an 8 -year period into the perched groundwater on top of a Connecticut River basin silt deposit finds that treatment in the sandy unit above the aquitard achieved significant reduction of PCE in the <b>silt</b> <b>layer</b> below. This discovery changed the project Conceptual Site Model and led to further evaluation of the source of PCE feeding into soil gas. With decreased groundwater concentrations of PCE but persistent soil gas concentrations, Membrane Interface Probe (MIP) work was done to further assess the extent of additional area within the perched groundwater that required treatment. The results indicated that the extent of significant concentrations of PCE was in a peripheral area around the initial treatment zones. Following the MIP results, additional in-situ HRC treatment in the perched aquifer over a broader area than previous injections was implemented with the intent of removing a significant mass of PCE. As we expected, there was a PCE source in the <b>silt</b> <b>layer</b> below the treatment area. Subsequent data show further decreases in PCE concentrations measured in perched groundwater and soil gas...|$|E
30|$|The {{fluidized}} {{coarse silt}} with sheared sand and <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> {{may have been}} responsible for minor sliding of the SSDs horizons, which introduced shear stress within the liquefied layer below the surface. In particular, the interval E obviously shows sliding of the beds. The Locs. 9 and 9 - 1 are close to the buried flexure (Fig.  3), which was active during the Pleistocene (Sakai and Gajurel, 2012) and its activity could be the trigger of slidings. Tilting of the surface was the only possible trigger for sliding, because the environment of sedimentation was almost flat. This result suggests that sliding of the plain area could happen in conjunction with future large earthquakes centered around the Kathmandu Valley. As the future studies, the distribution of seismites hosting evidence of sliding within the valley should be specified for creation of the hazard map indicating the possibility of sliding {{as well as for the}} risk management of the plain area.|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{describe}} the main hidrogeologic aspects of La Brianza area, making {{a contribution to the}} knowledge of the natural resources in this agricultural region from the central argentine plain. Two aquifer systems are found in this territory. The phreatic aquifer comprises mainly fine eolic quaternary sediments, it presents relatively low yields (flows) and highly variable ionic contents. The presence of Fluorine and Arsenic is common. The different confined deep aquifers identified, with higher yields, include coarser clasts, mainly coarse sand and gravel, limited by thick <b>silts</b> <b>layers.</b> The total dissolved solids are low, always under 1000 mg per litre. An analysis of the aptitude of use of these waters indicates important restrictions due to their chemical characteristics.

40|$|Nano-scale {{zero valent}} iron (nZVI) has shown {{promising}} mobility and in-situ reactivity with chlorinated {{volatile organic compounds}} when injected into saturated porous media. The current study evaluated nZVI mobility and subsequent reactivity with in-situ contaminants in a variably saturated porous media. The nZVI particles, synthesized onsite at subzero temperatures, demonstrated complete trichloroethene (TCE) degradation within the target area. Furthermore, a three dimensional finite difference model (CompSim) was utilized to investigate nZVI mobility in variably saturated zones. Model predicted well head data were in very good agreement with field observations. Simulation {{results showed that the}} injected slurry migrated radially outward from the injection well and that nZVI travel distance increases were not proportional to the increase in injected nZVI volume. This study suggested that the numerical simulator can be a practical tool for optimal design of nZVI field applications. The second study aimed at alleviating back diffusion from low permeability porous media observed at numerous field studies. Experiments were conducted in a two-dimensional sandbox with alternate vertical layers of coarse sand and silt flooded with TCE at aqueous solubility. Electrokinetics (EK) was used to enhance permanganate delivery through the <b>silt</b> <b>layers.</b> The suite of experiments demonstrated that EK was able to drive more permanganate at a faster rate throughout the <b>silt</b> <b>layers</b> in comparison to no-EK experiments. The combined EK and permanganate application resulted in 4. 4 orders of magnitude reduction in TCE concentrations compared to a 3. 5 orders of magnitude reduction without EK application. This experiment demonstrated that EK coupled with permanganate application can be used to remediate low permeability strata. The third study investigated a novel approach of EK assisted persulfate delivery followed by electrical resistance heating (ERH) for persulfate activation for low permeability soil remediation. The study showed that EK delivered persulfate throughout the silt. The application of ERH was successfully able to activate the persulfate within the porous matrix leading to complete in-situ tetrachlorothene (PCE) degradation. To the authors’ knowledge, this study was the first to combine EK and ERH for persulfate delivery and activation for low permeability soil remediation...|$|R
