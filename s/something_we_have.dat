To help recall <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E

2500|$|... (b) In {{rejecting the}} idea that laws merely {{describe}} or independently ground phenomena, Hegel revives the Aristotlean position that law or principle is something implicit in a thing, a potentiality which is not actual but {{which is in the}} process of becoming actual. This means that if we want to know the principle governing <b>something,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to observe its typical life-process and figure out its characteristic behavior.

2500|$|Following the budget, and in {{the period}} until the {{spending}} review, Alexander found himself {{at the heart of}} controversial spending decisions made by the government. A series of leaked letters from cabinet ministers showed that the spending review was causing strain within government departments including within the Department of Work and Pensions when a memo from Osborne to Iain Duncan Smith suggested that deep cuts to the welfare budget had already been agreed, prompting accusations by Labour that the cuts were [...] "vicious" [...] and an attack on the poorest in society. In response Alexander said [...] "I am not going to comment on a leaked letter but what I will say is that with welfare spending making up nearly £200 billion, of course it is <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to look at {{in the context of the}} spending review." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} art has been {{described}} by philosopher Richard Wollheim as [...] "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle. Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. Benedetto Croce and R.G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists {{in the mind of the}} creator. The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and was developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. [...] More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as [...] "the art world" [...] has conferred [...] "the status of candidate for appreciation". Larry Shiner has described fine art as [...] "not an essence or a fate but <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other notable {{groups of}} people have been {{labelled}} as some variation of a play-on-words on the Spice Girls' name as an allusion to the band.

The label has stuck with these footballers ever since, with John Scales, one of the so-called Spice Boys, admitting in 2015 that, [...] "We’re the Spice Boys and it’s <b>something</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to accept because it will never change." [...] In the Philippines, the “Spice Boys” tag was given to a group of young Congressmen of the House of Representatives who initiated the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. The Australian/British string quartet Bond were dubbed by the international press as the [...] "Spice Girls of classical music" [...] during their launch in 2000 due to their “sexy” image and classical crossover music that incorporated elements of pop and dance music. A spokeswoman for the quartet said in response to the comparisons, “In fact, they are much better looking than the Spice Girls. But we don't welcome comparisons. The Bond girls are proper musicians; they have paid their dues.” The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) doubles team of Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, two-time Grand Slam and two-time WTA Finals Doubles champions, dubbed themselves the [...] "Spice Girls of tennis" [...] in 1999. Hingis and Kournikova, along with fellow WTA players Venus and Serena Williams, were also labelled the [...] "Spice Girls of tennis", then later the “Spite Girls”, by the media in the late 1990s due to their youthfulness, popularity and brashness.|$|E
