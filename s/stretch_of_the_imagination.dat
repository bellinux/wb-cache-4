30|$|The erect penis is {{likened to}} a weapon: weapon, sword, (vagina is Latin for “sheath, scabbard”), pistol, gun, rod, lance, bill, pike, dart, chopper, prick. 29 The very common prick {{in the sense}} “penis” is arguably a literal sense rather than a nonliteral one. The verb prick names <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> {{a certain kind of}} event in which a sharp object penetrates a membrane; with little <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> that {{describes}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> inserting <b>the</b> penis into the vagina: intromission is an act in which the penis is <b>the</b> instrument <b>of</b> pricking, i.e. a prick, which makes this noun deverbal. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the noun and verb have co-existed since the earliest records in English. In addition to its current meaning, the verb prick has meant “to spur or urge a horse on” (OED 9 – 12) which links up with the copulation-as-riding metaphor, with the man as rider; “to thrust a stick (or pointed object) into something” (OED 25) which links up with <b>the</b> metaphor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man as tailor stitching the woman—the man as tailor turns up in many bawdy folk songs, and in Grose et al. (1811); and prick up still means “to rise or stand erect with the point directed upward” (OED 28). It is hardly surprising, then, that the noun prick was used variously for (a) a thorn, a sting, and figuratively as a vexation or torment (OED 12); this could be partly responsible for some interpretations nonliteral prick; (b) a dagger or pointed sword (OED 15) links with the penis as weapon metaphor; (c) <b>the</b> upright pole <b>of</b> a tent (1497, OED 16); (d) it has long been a term for the penis. Although the earliest record for prick “penis” in the OED is 1592, there is <b>the</b> record <b>of</b> it being used as a term for a lover in 1540 (OED 17 b), which suggests at least a contemporary sense “penis”, too. In all probability, prick was used much earlier in this sense.|$|R

[...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect by any <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius".

40|$|<b>The</b> {{expanding}} scope <b>of</b> business {{corporations in}} <b>the</b> first decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twenty-first century is drawing much scholarly attention, and {{the trend has}} been described as a fact of life that defies <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> human <b>imagination.</b> <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> global economy has expanded consumer awareness, defined new standards and rules of operations, and increased the need for national and corporate interdependence. Multinational organizations are exploring opportunities around the world, demonstrating sensitivity towards cultural differences in order to gain from the proliferation and growth of international enterprise. Recent studies indicate that while some corporations compete successfully in the global marketplace, others have failed to sustain their competitive advantage because of cultural imperialism or inadequate acculturation of their managers on international assignment. Corporate analysts argued that the key to global business success depends on effective cross-cultural etiquette and global workforce diversity management. Other significant studies emphasized that global managers should be trained in interpersonal relationship and group communication competence, and should be equipped with cross-cultural negotiation skills that can maintain global competitiveness. Increasingly, corporations recognize <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> preparing global managers, because business objectives of are not been achieved primarily because of deficiencies in cross-cultural etiquette. Against this background, this study provides a constructive evaluation and analysis of global etiquette and cross-cultural communication for managers in international assignments. The study then proposes a strategic role for organizations to achieve adequate return on investments and to succeed in international competitiveness through cultural awareness, sensitivity, and reciprocity. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In a {{rebuttal}} of Massacre Myth, Neville Green {{describes the}} massacre as probable, but {{not able to}} be proven in court. He makes a number of criticisms of Moran's book. For example, Moran cites the evidence of [...] "anthropologist" [...] Hepburn Tindale who, at the time, {{claimed to be a}} Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, to have a master's degree and diploma in anthropology from Oxford University and to have written anthropological articles for English papers. None of these claims were true. Moran refers to anthropologist Phyllis Kaberry's descriptions of Forrest River cremation customs, suggesting that this would explain the cremated remains found at the sites. However, Kaberry also stated that cremation was peculiar to the small Numalo horde and was abandoned after the arrival of Europeans. In regards to Moran's claims that the burnt fragments were the result of bushfires, in 1926 Commissioner Wood stated that [...] "by no <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> could it [...] be associated with a bushfire". [...] Moran also referred to evidence given at the Royal Commission that the volume of wood required for the cremation of 11 bodies was 16.5 tons, Moran concluded that this was insufficient and suggested that 28.5 tons was required, a figure that historian Keith Windschuttle accepted and used in his own work. Green subsequently conducted a survey of government and municipal agencies and undertakers in regions where open air cremations are still conducted which found that one ton per body is recommended for health reasons although as little as 250kg per body, or 2.75 tons for all 11, would be more than sufficient.|$|E
