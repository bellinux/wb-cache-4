40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{field strength}} coverage predictions for high frequency indoor communications at 17 GHz using directional antennas at the basestation and 2 branch <b>spaced</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> at the terminal. Detailed propagation information is generated {{for a typical}} two-dimensional indoor environment using a ray-tracing propagation tool developed at the University of Bath. As a performance benchmark, initial field strength predictions are generated for omni-directional basestation and terminal antennas. Downlink performance is enhanced {{by the use of}} 2 branch <b>spaced</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> at the terminal. Factors such as antenna spacing and the choice of diversity combining algorithm are considered. At the basestation, a novel 3 branch phased array beam pattern diversity system is compared with an ideal six branch sectorised antenna. For each configuration, detailed propagation studies are performed to determine the relative (compared to omni-directional antennas) coverage improvement over the entire environment. Results indicate that the use of <b>spaced</b> <b>diversity</b> at the terminal can improve the expected coverage by as much as 10. 7 dB. Beam pattern and sector switching arrangements at the basestation result in a 7. 2 - 10. 4 dB improvement. The most impressive gains were observed using directional antennas at the basestation and <b>spaced</b> antenna <b>diversity</b> at the terminal. Gains of 17. 2 dB and 19. 4 dB were observed for 3 (beam pattern) and 6 (sectorised) branch systems respectively at the basestation...|$|R

50|$|The {{tropospheric scatter}} system {{operated}} around 900 MHz, and utilized both <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> and frequency diversity, multiplexing {{a maximum of}} 132 simultaneous voice channels. The tropospheric hops used pairs of 60 ft or 120 ft parabolic, billboard like reflectors pointed at a low angle into the horizon. The radio waves were scattered by the tropopause, returning to Earth beyond the horizon, allowing communication between stations hundreds of kilometers apart. Having two antennas allowed for <b>space</b> <b>diversity,</b> meaning that if tropospheric conditions degrade on one path the second path might still be clear and communications would not be disrupted. For frequency diversity, each antenna transmitted two separate frequencies. Using both frequency and <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> was called quad diversity.

Often, especially in urban and indoor environments, there is no clear line-of-sight (LOS) between transmitter and receiver. Instead the signal is reflected along multiple paths before finally being received.
