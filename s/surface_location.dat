5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the <b>surface</b> <b>location</b> of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free <b>surface</b> <b>location</b> is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E

500|$|Warm fronts {{mark the}} {{position}} on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air. The temperature increase {{is located on the}} equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts. Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface. This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. The warm air mass overrides the cold air mass and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface. [...] Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm front passage.

40|$|In 2004, data {{obtained}} from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) indicated a total of 891 underground (6. 2 %) and 13, 587 surface (93. 8 %) mining operations. A total of 46, 360 employees, or 48, 183 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, were reported to MSHA as working at underground mining locations in 2004. This corresponded to 249, 457 employees (or 222, 839 FTE employees) that were reported as working at <b>surface</b> <b>locations.</b> <b>Surface</b> work <b>location</b> employee hours accounted for 82. 2 % of all hours reported to MSHA, while 17. 8 % of employee hours were reported for underground work locations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{computational fluid dynamic}} {{studies of}} the inlet turbulence and wall curvature effects on the flow steadiness at near wall <b>surface</b> <b>locations</b> in boundary layer flows. The time-stepping RANS numerical solver of the NASA Glenn-HT RANS code and a one-equation turbulence model, with a uniform inlet turbulence modeling level {{of the order of}} 10 percent of molecular viscosity, were used to perform the numerical computations. The approach was first calibrated for its predictabilities of friction factor, velocity, and temperature at near <b>surface</b> <b>locations</b> within a transitional boundary layer over concave wall. The approach was then used to predict the velocity and friction factor variations in a boundary layer recovering from concave curvature. As time iteration proceeded in the computations, the computed friction factors converged to their values from existing experiments. The computed friction factors, velocity, and static temperatures at near wall <b>surface</b> <b>locations</b> oscillated periodically in terms of time iteration steps and physical locations along the span-wise direction. At the upstream stations, the relationship among the normal and tangential velocities showed vortices effects on the velocity variations. Coherent vortices effect on the velocity components broke down at downstream stations. The computations also predicted the vortices effects on the velocity variations within a boundary layer flow developed along a concave wall surface with a downstream recovery flat wall surface. It was concluded that the computational approach might have the potential to analyze the flow steadiness in a turbine blade flow...|$|R

50|$|Most {{drill holes}} deviate {{slightly}} from their planned trajectory. This {{is because of}} the torque of the turning bit working against the cutting face, because of the flexibility of the steel rods and especially the screw joints, because of reaction to foliation and structure within the rock, and because of refraction as the bit moves into different rock layers of varying resistance. Additionally, inclined holes will tend to deviate upwards because the drill rods will lie against the bottom of the bore, causing the drill bit to be slightly inclined from true. It is because of deviation that drill holes must be surveyed if deviation will impact the usefulness of the information returned. Sometimes the <b>surface</b> <b>location</b> can be offset laterally {{to take advantage of the}} expected deviation tendency, so the bottom of the hole will end up near the desired location.
