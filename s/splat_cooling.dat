Plasma spraying is part of thermal spraying which is a group of processes in which finely divided metallic and non metallic materials are deposited in a molten or semi-molten state on a prepared substrate to form a spray deposit [1, 2]. In this process the substrate can be kept at relatively low temperature by specific cooling devices. In fact thermal spray has been practiced since the early 1900 's [3]. Historically a surfacing technology, it has now moved from coating to materials processing technology with growing importance as stated by Smith [4]. DC plasma spraying, f i s t proposed by Reineke in 1939 [4], was advanced in the late 1950 s by several US companies. The high gas velocity DC arc torches were developed in the early 1970 's by Pratt and Whitney with the Gator Gard (licenced to Sermatech [5]) and in the late 1980 's by Browning with the high energy, high velocity Plazjet (licenced to a Japanese company [6]). The first spraying RF induction plasma torch, producing very low gas velocities, was reported in 1985 by Boulos and his co-workers [7] and then commercially developed by Tafa and Tekna in North America. Plasma spraying was pushed by the development of its applications (wear protection, thermal insulation or barriers, oxidation protection, corrosion resistance, abradable seals, abrasive surfaces or seals, electrically conductive or insulating materials, dimensional restoration o...|$|R
40|$|Using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) in {{differential}} mode (DiffXAS), the magnetostriction of a Fe 81 Ga 19 <b>splat</b> <b>cooled</b> ribbon has been measured and the strain coefficients quantified. Due {{to the local}} atomic nature of XAS, this represents the first microscopic analysis of such a system, and was made possible only by recent advances in synchrotron radiation based techniques, capable of detecting atomic strains {{on the scale of}} femtometres [1]. Previously, magnetostriction measurements have relied on macroscopic techniques, commonly via strain gauges. However, such measurements on thin films and ribbons, which tend to be of the greatest importance from a technical perspective, are notoriously difficult. This is in part due to the measured strains being extremely small over a sample thickness of a few tens of microns, but also due to the practicalities of coupling such a sample to a sensor. Consequently, published magnetostriction coefficients vary immensely. In some cases, giant magnetostrictions have been reported for Fe(1 -x) Gax ribbons [2][3] although doubt has recently been cast upon their validity [4]. This serves to assert a need for a more fundamental approach to measuring magnetostrictive strains. A need which is satisfied by DiffXAS. Being based upon XAS, DiffXAS probes changes in local atomic structures and is just dependent upon the short-range order of the first one or two atomic shells surrounding an absorbing atom. However, whilst even giant magnetostrictive strains exhibited by a number of rare-earth based Fe alloys are on the very limits of detection by conventional XAS techniques, DiffXAS offers an increase in sensitivity of two orders of magnitude and so makes such strains easily measurable. Direct detection of strains on the scale of tens or hundreds of ppm then becomes possible. Furthermore, in principle, this is true for any type of strain that is reproducible upon the modulation of some external sample property [5]. Additionally, since x-ray absorption is chemically selective, these structural changes may be viewed from different positions within the crystal lattice, and so the underlying significance of different atomic species in the overall process elucidated. Contributions from different types of bonds within the structure may then be decoupled and analysed. Such information has immense value when trying to obtain fundamental knowledge of atomic strains, and particularly when attempting to verify theoretical models. Concerning Fe(1 -x) Gax, a theory for the observed strain enhancement was first put forward by Wu [6] in 2002, which has more recently been developed by Cullen et al [7] after modelled the behaviour of the material’s magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Experimental verification of these proposals has yet to be presented, but is something that DiffXAS has the potential to provide. Using this technique, we have focused on the problem of enhanced magnetostriction observed in the Fe(1 -x) Gax system. Such systems have attracted significant interest from a technological and device applications perspective since, although they do not possess truly giant magnetostrictions, they are both absent of expensive rare-earth components and have desirable mechanical properties. They also show appreciable low-field magnetostriction, saturating at fields of only several hundred Oersteds. Working within these saturation conditions, DiffXAS detects the changes in photoelectron scattering path length induced by structural distortions that occur when the sample’s magnetisation vector is modulated between two states – parallel and perpendicular to the x-ray polarisation vector. Subsequent data analysis uses a framework of Cartesian tensors to model the structural properties of the sample, and ab initio XAS theory to model the observed perturbations. From this, the atomic strain tensor may be derived and related to the sample magnetisation vector in order to find the coefficients of the Joule magnetostriction tensor [8]. These coefficients may then be reduced to the more familiar macroscopic  100 and  111 coefficients by exploiting the crystal symmetry elements [8]. Working on a <b>splat</b> <b>cooled</b> foil of Fe 81 Ga 19, preliminary analyses performed with this technique have yielded a magnetostriction coefficient of (3 / 2)  100 = 250 ± 20 ppm ( 111 coefficient is approximately zero for this composition), based upon a disordered A 2 structure, determined from analysis of the sample’s conventional XAS signal. This analysis failed to detect the D 03 structure reported by some authors for this composition. Further experiments are planned to examine the full range of compositions over which magnetostriction enhancement is observed in this system. [1] R. F. Pettifer, O. Mathon, S. Pascarelli, M. D.

40|$|Accelerator Technology Corp. (ATC) has {{successfully}} completed its Phase 1 effort to devel-op rf plasma torch synthesis of MgB 2 superconducting powder. The overall {{objective is to}} de-velop a way to introduce homogeneous alloying of C and SiC impurities into phase-pure MgB 2. Several groups have attained remarkable benefits from such alloying in raising the upper critical field Hc 2 from ~ 14 T to ~ 30 T (bulk) and ~ 50 T (thin films). But no one has succeeded in pro-ducing that benefit homogeneously, so that current transport in a practical powder-in-tube (PIT) conductor is largely the same as without the alloying. ATC has conceived the possibility of attaining such homogeneity by passing aerosol suspen-sions of reactant powders through an rf plasma torch, with each reactant transported on a stream-line that heats it to an optimum temperature for the synthesis reaction. This procedure would uniquely access non-equilibrium kinetics for the synthesis reaction, and would provide the possi-bility to separately control the temperature and stoichiometry of each reactant as it enters the mixing region where synthesis occurs. It also facilitates the introduction of seed particles (e. g. nanoscale SiC) to dramatically enhance {{the rate of the}} synthesis reaction compared to gas-phase synthesis in rf plasma reported by Canfield and others. During the Phase 1 effort ATC commissioned its 60 kW 5 MHz rf source for a manufactur-ing-scale rf plasma torch. This effort required repair of numerous elements, integration of cooling and input circuits, and tuning of the load characteristics. The effort was successful, and the source has now been tested to ~full power. Also in the Phase 1 effort we encountered a subsidiary but very important problem: the world is running out of the only present supply of phase-pure amorphous boron. The starting boron powder must be in the amorphous phase in order for the synthesis reaction to produce phase-pure MgB 2. Even small contamination with crystalline boron results in the formation of parasitic phases such as MgB 4, MgB 7, etc. Such parasitic phases are a primary element of the connectivity problem, in which even though a sample powder may contain grains of high-quality MgB 2, adjacent grains are surrounded by intergrowths of parasitic phases so that current trans-port is badly degraded. The best results to date have been obtained using boron powder produced long ago for a rocket propellant development project. The synthesis process was complex and is now largely lost, and the manufacturing equipment has long since been scrapped. The last batch of the powder has been used during recent years to support MgB 2 R&D at several labs, but supplies are dwindling. ATC has identified a first application of its plasma torch to synthesize phase-pure amorphous boron flake using a rapid-quench splat technique. Inexpensive technical-grade boron would be purified of contaminants, then dispersed as an aerosol in inert gas and passed through the plasma torch to melt it into a spray. The spray would be splat-condensed on a rotating drum to form pure amorphous flake. The process would begin with technical-grade boron powder, having good stoichiometric purity, nanoscale particles, but significant contamination of MgO and crystalline boron. We used wet chemistry to remove B 2 O 3 completely and reduced the MgO impurity, and analyzed the particle size distribution using a Coulter counter and the phase composition using X-ray diffrac-tion (XRD). The next step will be to build an rf plasma torch with a recirculating single-component aerosol feed and the <b>cooled</b> <b>splat</b> drum and collector, and undertake process devel-opment for amorphous boron powder. This revised goal has two benefits. First, it is an easier technology than our ultimate goal of a multi-component laminar flow torch. We have been counseled by those experienced in plasma torch technology that our ultimate goal will require a torch that should be feasible but has never been attempted. It may require an extended period of R&D for both the torch itself and the gas dynamics in the reaction region. Second, this simpler single-component process will yield a product powder that is important today for the many groups undertaking powder-metallurgy routes to MgB 2. The above success and learning curve has brought us to a significant shift of strategy from what was originally set out in the Phase 1 plan. But this shift has brought us to within sight of a powder product that will itself be an enabling boost for the community of MgB 2 developers...|$|R

40|$|Rapidly {{solidified}} Mg based alloys are {{of interest}} for industrial applications as a structural material and for hydrogen storage. Mg-Cu-Rare Earth alloys have shown high glass forming ability; full amorphous structure with thickness of mm size can be obtained within these systems. However, their brittle behavior limits their industrial applications. In the present work, the Al effect in substitution of Cu in the Mg 65 Cu 25 MM 10 (at%, MM: mischmetal) was studied. Samples up to 15 at% Al were prepared by <b>splat</b> <b>cooling</b> and their microstructure, stability and mechanical properties were characterised. The crystallization temperature increases with the Al addition; the amorphous phase with different Al content has a Young’s modulus of ~ 55 GPa; the microhardness increases with the Al content in the amorphous and crystallized samples and the fracture of the alloy containing 10 at% Al showed ductile vein patterns characteristics of ductile metallic glasses. The partial Cu substitution by Al can improve the stability and mechanical properties of the amorphous Mg 65 Cu 25 MM 10 alloy. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{have studied}} a ternary {{phase of the}} CePt 3 +/- xGe composition, with the maximum values of x = 0. 2. A series of samples was {{prepared}} by arc melting, Czochralski method and <b>splat</b> <b>cooling,</b> and characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The arc-melted samples are well-crystalline and single-phase with slightly varying stoichiometry close to the nominal CePt 3 Ge, while the splat-cooled samples form an amorphous or a nanocrystalline constitution of the similar to CePt 3 Ge composition. Detailed measurements of magnetization, specific heat and electrical resistivity were performed in the temperature range 0. 40 - 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. In addition, a delicate neutron diffraction experiment down to 70 mK was done, which excluded long-range magnetic order in the CePt 3 Ge compound. The specific heat data were tested to anisotropic Kondo model, and the resistivity behavior has been treated by means of electron localization effects. The experiments evidenced that the CePt 3 Ge compound {{can be considered as}} a Kondo lattice with low-temperature magnetic correlations, and the size effect seems to have minor role in control of the Kondo scattering phenomena in this compound...|$|E
40|$|Plasma-sprayed {{molybdenum}} and yttria-stabilized zirconia particles (382 ̆ 01363 5 m diameters) were sprayed onto {{glass and}} Inconel 625 held at either room temperature or 400 0 C. Samples of Inconel 625 were also preheated for 3 h, and then air-cooled {{to room temperature}} before spraying. Photographs of the splats were captured by using a fast charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A rapid two-color pyrometer was used to collect thermal radiation from the particles during flight and spreading to follow the evolution of their temperature. The temperature evolution was used to determine the cooling rate of spreading particles. An analytical heat conduction model was developed to calculate the thermal contact resistance at the interface of the plasma-sprayed particles and the surfaces from <b>splat</b> <b>cooling</b> rates. The analysis showed that thermal contact resistance between the heated or preheated surfaces and the splats was more than an order of magnitude smaller than that on non-heated surfaces held at room temperature. Particles impacting on the heated or preheated surfaces had cooling rates that were significantly larger than those on surfaces held at room temperature, which was attributed to smaller thermal contact resistance.

40|$|Plasma-sprayed, molten nickel {{particles}} (2 ̆ 23 c 60 3 ̆bcm diameter) were photographed during {{impact on}} oxidized 304 L stainless steel surfaces that were maintained at either room temperature or at 350 0 C. Steel coupons were oxidized by heating them at different temperatures. A fast chargecoupled device (CCD) camera captured time-integrated {{images of the}} spreading splat. A two-color pyrometer collected thermal radiation from particles and recorded the evolution of their temperature after impact. Molten nickel particles impacting on oxidized steel at room temperature fragmented significantly, while heating the surfaces produced splats with disk-like morphologies. Impact on steel that was highly oxidized induced the formation of finger-like splash projections at the splat periphery. Thermal contact resistance between splats and non-heated oxidized steel was calculated from <b>splat</b> <b>cooling</b> rates and found to decrease as the degree of oxidation increased. On heated, oxidized steel thermal contact resistance was much lower and did not change significantly with the degree of oxidation. It was concluded that thermal contact resistance was largely influenced by adsorbates on the steel surface that evaporated when the surface was heated or oxidized.

40|$|The {{ductility}} of the amorphous Mg-Cu-RE (RE: rare earths) alloys {{could be}} improved {{by means of the}} partial substitution of Cu atoms by Al ones, as can be interred from the heterogeneous amorphous concept [1, 2]. Instead of only one RE element, a solid solution of RE known as mischmetal (MM) was used. Rapidly quenched (RQ) samples (cooling rate > 10 (3) K s(- 1)) of Mg 65 AlxCu 25 -xMM 10 (0 {{less than or equal to}} x less than or equal to 25 at. %) alloys were obtained in a <b>splat</b> <b>cooling</b> device. The structure and the crystallisation process were observed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fractographic analysis was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the fracture surface of samples broken by hand bending. With increase of the Al concentration, we observed that both the glass forming ability (GFA) and the amorphous pre-peak (a-pre-peak) in the XRD pattern decreased; meanwhile the crystallisation temperature increased. On the other hand, the ductility of the 10 at. % Al alloy was improved and a vein pattern was observed in the fracture surfaces. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlasses {{with a high}} {{content of}} niobium oxide are of {{significant}} interest for electro-optics and nonlinear optics. In the present paper we report {{the results of the}} investigation of the submicroscopic structure and nonlinear optical properties of (1 - x) KNbO 3 - x SiO 2 (KNS) glasses (x =  0. 05 - 0. 30) by XRD, SANS, electron microscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Vitreous samples were fabricated by rapid melt cooling, via pressing the melt by steel plates, quenching between rotating metal rolls or <b>splat</b> <b>cooling</b> in air or nitrogen flow. Glasses with x   2. On the contrary, as-quenched glasses with x  >  0. 15 are found by SANS to be homogeneous, but form nanostructures enriched by SiO 2 after heat-treatment. At temperatures below ~(T g  +  50  °C), SiO 2 -enriched regions grow slightly, whereas their chemical composition shifts considerably closer to SiO 2. The data on the nano-inhomogeneous structure enables clarifying the complicated T g (x) dependence of KNS glasses. SHG-active KNbO 3 phase precipitates at later stages of crystallization when the glass starts to lose its transparency, and crystallization of perovskite-like KNbO 3 is accompanied by the enhancement of SHG efficiency by several orders of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|Microstructure and {{properties}} of plasma sprayed cast iron coatings are {{closely linked to}} the spray conditions such as substrate temperature, chamber pressure, particle size, and spray distance. Another factor is the chemical composition of sprayed particles, which affects the physical properties such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of droplets. In spraying cast iron on aluminum alloy substrate the purpose is to deposit a superior wear resistant coating as an approach to improve its wear resistance. Presence of graphite in cast iron increases the wear resistance of cast iron coating because of its self-lubricant property. Graphite grows during droplet solidification and <b>splat</b> <b>cooling</b> and thus its appearance is related to the solidification rate of the individual droplets. Alloying elements such as Al and Si in cast iron materials promote the graphite formation because they act as strong graphitizers probably by creation active nuclei for graphite growing. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the influence of powder chemical composition on the features and {{properties of}} sprayed cast iron splat and coating by spraying three cast iron powders of different chemical compositions on Al-Si-Cu alloy. The effect of powder chemical composition on graphite formation and microstructure was investigated. In addition, the mechanical properties such as friction, wear resistance, and microhardness of sprayed coatings with those powders were examined. The influence of chemical composition of sprayed powders on the microstructure of cast iron coatings was examined by X-ray and SEM...|$|E
