The first section {{begins with the}} second basses with the next highest part. The only departure from this formula is in Section 8 when Gorecki holds the expected first soprano entrance until Section 9. The first ten sections are <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> the <b>text</b> [...] "Domine Deus noster", with the last section <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> [...] "MISERERE NOBIS", bolded in Górecki's own hand.|$|R

The song's refrain of [...] "Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt" [...] {{addresses}} the gangsters from Graham Greene's 1938 novel Brighton Rock and so has a thematic link with Morrissey's 1989 song about the Kray twins [...] "The Last of the Famous International Playboys". In an interview published in Les Inrockuptibles in 1995, Morrissey stated [...] "This song was the definitive expression of my change to adulthood, of my maturity. And, to be honest, I was {{very happy to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> this <b>text,</b> <b>to</b> have reached this state. After this song I could perfectly retire: I've come full circle." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pehe are {{songs of}} Tokelau, while pehe anamua are ancient songs; hiva are dances. Together, they are popular forms {{of music in}} Tokelau. The best-known form of {{traditional}} music is fatele, a dance performed at many community gatherings and events. Each song begins with a stanza that is repeated up to a half-dozen times, followed by increased pitch and tempo {{near the end of}} the piece. This tradition is shared with the music of Tuvalu. Fetele is a song form which is an abridged and fascinating song rendering of compositions which are situation specific and <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> the <b>text</b> format. The community is usually aware of the singer's capability in composing and rendering such songs. The experienced composer and singer of these songs is known as [...] "pulotu". One such pulotu who is popular among the public is Ihaia, who is not only a singer but also carpenter and fisherman, with oratory skills blended with humour.|$|R
50|$|Ernest Walker's {{style as}} a {{composer}} is conventional and conservative, {{but with a}} fine feeling for the declamation of English poetry in his vocal works and a flair for chromatic harmony. After 1914 his chromatic harmony became much more pronounced. The majority of his music is written for voices - many choral pieces (partsongs, anthems and motets), songs, and vocal duets and quartets. Notable are his Stabat Mater (1898), I will lift up mine eyes, Op. 16, No. 1 (1899), Hymn to Dionysus, Op. 13 (1906), Ode to a Nightingale, Op. 14 (1908; words by John Keats), and One generation passeth away, Op. 56 (1934). There is also vocal incidental music to Rhesus (attrib. Euripides; 1922; <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> a Greek <b>text).</b>|$|R

The subject of fattijiet may be tragic or comic and may be based on actual events or the work of the imagination. This series discusses Maltese folk music and the various Maltese traditional instruments, based on the book penned by Ruben Zahra: A guide to Maltese Folk music. N/...|$|R
50|$|Anglican chant, {{also known}} as English chant, is a way <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> unmetrical <b>texts,</b> {{including}} psalms and canticles from the Bible, by matching the natural speech-rhythm of the words to the notes of a simple harmonized melody. Today, this type of chant is sung in Anglican churches, as well as Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Reformed churches. Within Anglican and Episcopal churches, Anglican chant was previously in more widespread use but today is sung primarily in Anglican cathedrals and also in parish churches that have retained a choral liturgical tradition.|$|R

40|$|Popular Music in the Eighteenth-Century Netherlands In {{this issue}} of TVNM we focuss on popular music in the {{eighteenth-century}} Netherlands. The repertoire was defined by Etienne Roger’s edition Oude en Nieuwe Hollantse Boerenlieties en Contradansen (Old and New Dutch Peasant Songs and Country Dances; Amsterdam 1701 - 1714), which contained nearly 1000 melodies and was followed by two similar series. In the twentieth century this repertoire was considered as ‘folk music’, but recently Jos Koning has demonstrated that Roger’s target group must have been reasonably well-to-do amateurs, citizens who liked to articulate their Dutchness by playing these so-called ‘peasant’ tunes. A large part of this repertoire of ‘Dutch peasant ditties’ has been made accessible in the Dutch Song Database of the Meertens Institute in Amsterdam, which unlocks 140, 000 songs from the Middle Ages until the twentieth century. The eighteenth-century content of the Database has been tested by three authors who write about different aspects of eighteenth-century popular music: Jos Koning about music manuscripts containing similar repertoire as Roger’s series, Marieke Lefeber about expensive bell clocks playing ‘peasant’ ditties, and Louis Peter Grijp about the ‘peasant opera’ De Bruiloft van Kloris en Roosje (The Wedding of Cloris and Rosie) in which similar tunes were <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> farcical <b>texts.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} early {{cases of}} aphasia that include {{observations of the}} capacity <b>to</b> <b>sing.</b> Although {{the majority of these}} cases were published in the late nineteenth century, earlier reports exist and provide insights into the early thinking about the capacity <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> in aphasia, a topic that continues to the present day. The observation that some patients with aphasia and limited speech output were able <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> the <b>texts</b> of songs inspired scholars {{to examine the relationship between}} music and language. Early ideas about the capacity <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> were provided by well-known neurologists, such as John Hughlings Jackson and Adolf Kussmaul. The work of Herbert Spencer about the origins and function of music heavily influenced Jackson and others in their thinking about aphasia. This work also led to an increased interest in understanding music abilities in persons with aphasia and, later, in the brain mechanisms of music. The chapter provides a background as to why there was an interest in the capacity <b>to</b> <b>sing</b> in persons with aphasia and what influenced early thinking on this topic...|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} the motet {{transformed}} from the isorhythmic {{model of the}} 14th century to the smoothly polyphonic, sectional composition seen {{in the work of}} the later Burgundians such as Busnois. In the motets, as well as the masses and other sacred music, a common musical technique employed was fauxbourdon, a harmonization of an existing chant in parallel 6-3 chords, occasionally ornamented to prevent monotony. Composition using fauxbourdon allowed <b>sung</b> <b>text</b> <b>to</b> be clearly understood, but yet avoided the plainness of simple chant. Burgundian motets tended to be in Latin, written for three voices with the top voice being the most important. An example of a Burgundian motet is Quam pulchra es, written by Dunstaple in the early 15th century.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the problem}} Shostakovich had in writing the symphony was that people {{expected}} a successor to his First Symphony, and he no longer believed in writing in the same compositional style. He also had other projects toward which he wanted to direct his attention as soon as possible, and the First Symphony had taken him nearly a year to write. As it turned out, the Commissariat for Enlightenment's propaganda department, Agitotdel, regularly commissioned single-movement works on topical subjects. These works often featured revolutionary tunes and invariably employed <b>sung</b> <b>texts</b> <b>to</b> make the required meaning clear. Furthermore, because of the non-musical orientation of potential audiences, these pieces were not expected to last more than 15 or 20 minutes at most.|$|R

[...] George Loomis, in the Financial Times, wrote that [...] "the expressive range of Hagen’s music broadens memorably to accommodate the cascade of divergent emotions {{en route to a}} grand, life-affirming unaccompanied ensemble for the nine principal singers." [...] Anthony Tommasini, in the New York Times, {{described the}} opera as [...] "earnest and original, if heavy-handed and melodramatic. ... a serious, heartfelt and unusual work." [...] Bernard Jacobsen, in the Seattle Times, wrote, [...] "Besides cleverly enabling the <b>sung</b> <b>text</b> <b>to</b> emerge with rare clarity, Hagen has fashioned a score of impassioned and compelling beauty. His melodic lines are eminently singable, and his sumptuous orchestral writing constantly enchants the ear. ...it stands as an achievement at once profound and hugely enjoyable." [...] Ivan Katz, in the Huffington Post, wrote [...] "Daron Aric Hagen's score is well-composed and, in many respects, a work of genius. He tends to write in a more facile manner for the women, but his writing for the men (especially tenor William Burden) is complex and highly effective." ...|$|R
