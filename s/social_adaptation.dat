Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E

25|$|Drugs, supplements, or diets {{are often}} used to alter {{physiology}} {{in an attempt to}} relieve common autistic symptoms such as seizures, sleep disturbances, irritability, and hyperactivity that can interfere with education or <b>social</b> <b>adaptation</b> or (more rarely) cause autistic individuals to harm themselves or others. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support medical treatment; many parents who try one or more therapies report some progress, and there are a few well-publicized reports of children who are able to return to mainstream education after treatment, with dramatic improvements in health and well-being. However, this evidence may be confounded by improvements seen in autistic children who grow up without treatment, by the difficulty of verifying reports of improvements, and by the lack of reporting of treatments' negative outcomes. Only a very few medical treatments are well supported by scientific evidence using controlled experiments.|$|E
500|$|There was {{systematic}} political {{abuse of}} psychiatry in the Soviet Union, Within {{the boundaries of}} the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor <b>social</b> <b>adaptation</b> and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of [...] "sluggish schizophrenia." ...|$|E
500|$|Snezhnevsky, {{the most}} {{prominent}} theorist of Soviet psychiatry {{and director of the}} Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria. A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of psychopathy, hypochondria, depersonalization or anxiety were central to it. Symptoms referred to as part of the [...] "negative axis" [...] included pessimism, poor <b>social</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of [...] "sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms." [...] According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye. Thereby patients with non-psychotic mental disorders, or even persons who were not mentally sick, could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia. Along with paranoia, sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters. As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since the illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards. As a consequence, schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries, as the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia reported in 1973. The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow. In particular, the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense. Their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character. The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society. Thereby, sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as [...] "reform delusions," [...] "perseverance," [...] and [...] "struggle for the truth." [...] As Viktor Styazhkin reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient [...] "develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an academy of human happiness, and many other projects for the benefit of mankind." ...|$|E

The islands used for this study are Anguilla, St. Martin-St. Maarten (hereafter to be referred to simply as St. Martin), Dog Island, St. Barthelemew (St. Baits) and their adjacent cays. It is suggested that the processes of divergent evolution and adaptive radiation increased the isolation of economic exploitation and <b>social</b> <b>adaptations,</b> thus allowing for the emergence of a cluster specific interaction sphere...|$|R

Before this time, individual colleges defined their own entrance requirements.

Their report largely defined the way history would be taught {{at the high school level}} as a preparation for college, and wrestled with issues about how the field should relate to the other social studies. The Committee recommended four blocks of Western history, to be taught in chronological order—ancient, medieval and modern European, English, and American history and civil government—and advised that teachers [...] "tell a story" [...] and [...] "bring out dramatic aspects" [...] to make history come alive.he student who is taught to consider political subjects in school, who is led to look at matters historically, has some mental equipment for a comprehension of the political and social problems that will confront him in everyday life, and has received practical preparation for <b>social</b> <b>adaptation</b> and for forceful participation in civic activities.... The pupil should see the growth of the institutions which surround him; he should see the work of men; he should study the living concrete facts of the past; he should know of nations that have risen and fallen; he should see tyranny, vulgarity, greed, benevolence, patriotism, self-sacrifice, brought out in the lives and works of men. So strongly has this very thought taken hold of writers of civil government, that they no longer content themselves with a description of the government as it is, but describe at considerable length the origin and development of the institutions of which they speak.|$|E

A stylized agent-based model is presented that captures small-group decision making on movements and resource use in ancient arid environments. The impact of various assumptions concerning storage, exchange, sharing, and migration on indicators of aggregation and sustainability are explored. Climate variability is found to increase the resilience of population levels at the system level. Variability reduces the time a population stays in one location and can degrade the soils. In addition to climate variability, the long-term population dynamics is mainly driven by the level of storage and the decision rules governing when to migrate and with whom to exchange...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ‘{{accommodation}} careers’ and <b>social</b> <b>adaptations</b> of Gypsies and Travellers living in ‘bricks and mortar’ accommodation {{and the implications}} of this trend for current concerns pertaining to social segregation and ‘parallel communities’. The paper discusses the ‘constrained choices’ regarding accommodation that Gypsies and Travellers face, before considering the structure of social relations in their respective localities. The strategies by which cultural identities are sustained in housing and how the presence of kin and other Gypsy/Travellers helps to mitigate some of the difficulties experienced are explored. However, the argument is made that while frequent social interaction and the maintenance of a distinct cultural identity provides a crucial source of support, there is also the danger that social relations become restricted to close ‘bonding’ networks, thus intensifying the social isolation of Gypsy/Traveller communities and further fragmenting neighbourhoods along ethnic lines...|$|R
40|$|Summary. This report {{presents}} {{a pilot study}} of an integration of particle swarm algorithm, <b>social</b> knowledge <b>adaptation</b> and multi-agent approaches for modeling the collective search behavior of self-organized groups in an adaptive environment. The objective {{of this research is}} to apply the particle swarm metaphor as a model of <b>social</b> group <b>adaptation</b> for the dynamic environment and to provide insight and understanding of social group knowledge discovering and strategic searching. A new adaptive environment model, which dynamically reacts to the group collective searching behaviors, is proposed in this research. The simulations in the research indicate that effective communication between groups is not the necessary requirement for whole self-organized groups to achieve the efficient collective searching behavior in the adaptive environment. One possible application of this research is building scientific understanding of the insurgency in the count-Insurgent warfare. ...|$|R
