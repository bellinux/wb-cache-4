50|$|It was {{postulated}} that <b>small</b> rafts of <b>ice</b> form around {{the rocks and}} the rocks are buoyantly floated off the soft bed, thus reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed. Since this effect depends on reducing friction, and not on increasing the wind drag, these <b>ice</b> <b>cakes</b> need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick, as the minimal friction allows the rocks to be moved by arbitrarily light winds.|$|R

50|$|The Thompson Ice House {{stands on}} the east side of SR 129, just south of its {{junction}} with McFarlands Cove Road. It is set between the road and Thompsons Pond, a 3 acre freshwater pond. The ice house is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled main section flanked on its long sides by shed-roof ells. Its exterior walls are unpainted horizontal pine boards, and its interior walls are separated from the outside by a nine inch gap filled with sawdust for insulation. Large doors on the east and west sides facilitate the movement of large <b>ice</b> <b>cakes</b> into and out of the building.

40|$|Despite much {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of cloud microphysics, the measurement and observation of <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> particles has proven difficult and the exact mechanisms behind ice nucleation remain a fundamental uncertainty. This is particularly true in maritime cumulus clouds where large ice concentrations have been observed at temperatures as warm as - 5 °C. The work presented here provides new insight into the early formation of ice in maritime cumulus clouds through the analysis of recent observations of <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> particles, with a particular focus on an instrument capable of detecting the habit of very <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> particles, and comparison with a high resolution 3 D numerical cloud model capable of representing 10 individual ice hydrometeor species, including a variety of <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> particle habits. The findings of this comparison suggest that a <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> population, formed though deposition and condensation-freezing nucleation, could be the first ice to form in maritime cumulus clouds. These <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> particles may also be responsible for nucleating the graupel and/or large frozen raindrops previously thought to be the first ice particles to form through immersion freezing. The model also suggests that contrary to the conclusions of some past observational studies, rime splintering may not be necessary to explain the early stages of ice formation at temperatures warmer than - 10 °C. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>ice</b> {{crystals}} (with {{maximum dimension}} P 11 and asymmetry parameter g) are computed by a ray-tracing code. Compared with previosly used models, 3 B scatters less {{light in the}} forward and more light in the lateral and backward directions. The Chebyshev particles and Gaussian random spheres show smooth and featureless P 11 , whereas droxtals and 3 Bs, which have a faceted structure, show several peaks in P 11 associated with angles of minimum deviation. Overall, {{the difference in the}} forward (lateral; backward) scattering between models are up to 22 % (994 %; 132 %), 20 % (510 %; 101 %), and 16 % (146 %; 156 %) for <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> crystals with repective area ratios of 0. 85, 0. 77, and 0. 69. The g for different models varies by up to 25 %, 23 %, and 19 % for particles with area ratios of 0. 85, 0. 77, and 0. 69, respectively. Becuase the single-scattering properties of <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> crystals depend both on the choice of the idealized model and the area ratios used to characterize the <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> crystals, higher resolution observations of <b>small</b> <b>ice</b> crystals or direct observations of their single-scattering properties are required...|$|R
