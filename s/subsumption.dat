25|$|Objects in object {{oriented}} languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) {{is equal to}} either the object's run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the Liskov substitution principle, which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept {{is also known as}} <b>subsumption.</b> In some languages subtypes may also possess covariant or contravariant return types and argument types respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{ontology}} classification task, consequence-based reasoners {{are typically}} significantly faster while tableau-based reasoners can process more expressive DL languages. However, {{both of them}} have difficulty to classify some available large and complex ALCHOI ontologies with complete results in acceptable time. We present a prototype hybrid reasoning system WSReasoner, which is built upon and takes advantages of both types of reasoners to provide efficient classification service. In our proposed approach, we approximate the target ontology O by a weakened version Owk and a strengthened version Ostr, both are in a less expressive DL ALCH and classified by a consequence-based main reasoner. Classification of Owk produces a subset of <b>subsumptions</b> of ontology O and {{the target of the}} classification of Ostr is to produce a superset of <b>subsumptions</b> of O. Additional <b>subsumptions</b> derived from Ostr may be unsound, so they are further verified by a tableau-based assistant reasoner. For the ALCHOI ontologies in our experiment, except for one for which WSReasoner has not obtained the result, (1) the number of <b>subsumptions</b> derived from WSReasoner is no fewer than from the reasoners that could finish the classification; (2) WSReasoner takes less time than tableau-based reasoners when the ALCHOI ontologies are large and complex. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{lightweight}} {{ontology language}} OWL RL {{is used for}} reasoning with large amounts of data. To this end, the W 3 C standard provides a simple system of deduction rules, which operate directly on the RDF syntax of OWL. Several similar systems have been studied. However, these approaches are usually complete for instance retrieval only. This paper asks if and how such methods {{could also be used}} for computing entailed subclass relationships. Checking entailment for arbitrary OWL RL class <b>subsumptions</b> is co-NP-hard, but tractable rule-based reasoning is possible when restricting to <b>subsumptions</b> between atomic classes. Surprisingly, however, this cannot be achieved in any RDF-based rule system, i. e., the W 3 C calculus cannot be extended to compute all atomic class <b>subsumptions.</b> We identify syntactic restrictions to mitigate this problem, and propose a rule system that is sound and complete for many OWL RL ontologies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{non-deterministic}} consequence-based procedure for the description logic ALCHI. Just like the similar style (deterministic) procedures for EL and Horn-SHIQ, our procedure explicitly derives <b>subsumptions</b> between concepts, {{but due to}} non-deterministic rules, {{not all of these}} <b>subsumptions</b> are consequences of the ontology. Instead, the consequences are only those subsump-tions that can be derived regardless of the choices made in the application of the rules. This is similar to tableau-based procedures, for which an ontology is incon-sistent if every expansion of the tableau eventually results in a clash. We report on a preliminary experimental evaluation of the procedure using a version of SNOMED CT with disjunctions, which demonstrates some promising potential. ...|$|R
25|$|Agent {{architectures}} {{and cognitive}} architectures: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system. A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system, {{and the study}} of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration. A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling. Rodney Brooks' <b>subsumption</b> architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.|$|E
25|$|Constraint {{modeling}} theories concern {{families of}} directed graphs related by a partial order. In these applications, graphs are ordered by specificity, meaning that more constrained graphs—which are more specific and thus contain a {{greater amount of}} information—are subsumed by those that are more general. Operations between graphs include evaluating {{the direction of a}} <b>subsumption</b> relationship between two graphs, if any, and computing graph unification. The unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph (or the computation thereof) that is consistent with (i.e. contains all of the information in) the inputs, if such a graph exists; efficient unification algorithms are known.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and reasoning {{are a key}} enabling technology for the Semantic web. Languages based on the Frame model with automatic classification provide a layer of semantics {{on top of the}} existing Internet. Rather than searching via text strings as is typical today {{it will be possible to}} define logical queries and find pages that map to those queries. The automated reasoning component in these systems is an engine known as the classifier. Classifiers focus on the <b>subsumption</b> relations in a knowledge base rather than rules. A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever changing and evolving information space of the Internet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We discuss two {{approaches}} for defeasible reasoning in Description Logics {{that allow for}} the statement of defeasible <b>subsumptions</b> of the form “α subsumed by β usually holds”. These approaches are known as prototypical rea-soning and presumptive reasoning and are both rooted {{in the notion of}} Rational Closure developed by Lehmann and Magidor for the propositional case. Here we recast their definitions in a defeasible DL context and define algorithms for prototypical and presumptive reasoning in defeasible DL knowledge bases. In particular, we present a plug-in for the Protége ́ ontology editor which imple-ments these algorithms for OWL ontologies. The plug-in is called RaMP and allows the modeller to indicate defeasible information in OWL ontologies and check entailment of defeasible <b>subsumptions</b> from defeasible knowledge bases. ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Subsumption</b> {{architecture}} is a methodology for developing artificial intelligence that is heavily associated with behavior based robotics. [...] This {{architecture is}} a way of decomposing complicated intelligent behavior into many [...] "simple" [...] behavior modules, which are in turn organized into layers. Each layer implements a particular goal of the software agent (i.e. system as a whole), and higher layers are increasingly more abstract. Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers, e.g. the decision to move forward by the eat-food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest obstacle-avoidance layer. Behavior need not be planned by a superior layer, rather behaviors may be triggered by sensory inputs and so are only active under circumstances where they might be appropriate.|$|E

6000|$|... § 5. Besides the {{two modes}} {{which have been}} treated of, {{there is a third}} mode in which laws are {{resolved}} into one another; and in this it is self-evident that they are resolved into laws more general than themselves. This third mode is the <b>subsumption</b> (as it has been called) of one law under another; or (what comes to the same thing) the gathering up of several laws into one more general law which includes them all. The most splendid example of this operation was when terrestrial gravity and the central force of the solar system were brought together under the general law of gravitation. It had been proved antecedently that the earth and the other planets tend to the sun; and it had been known from the earliest times that terrestrial bodies tend toward the earth. These were similar phenomena; and to enable them both to be subsumed under one law, it was only necessary to prove that, as the effects were similar in quality so also they, as to quantity, conform to the same rules. This was first shown to be true of the moon, which agreed with terrestrial objects not only in tending to a centre, but in the fact that this centre was the earth. The tendency of the moon toward the earth being ascertained to vary as the inverse square of the distance, it was deduced from this, by direct calculation, that if the moon were as near to the earth as terrestrial objects are, and the acquired force {{in the direction of the}} tangent were suspended, the moon would fall toward the earth through exactly as many feet in a second as those objects do by virtue of their weight. Hence the inference was irresistible, that the moon also tends to the earth by virtue of its weight: and that the two phenomena, the tendency of the moon to the earth and the tendency of terrestrial objects to the earth, being not only similar in quality, but, when in the same circumstances, identical in quantity, are cases of one and the same law of causation. But the tendency of the moon to the earth, and the tendency of the earth and planets to the sun, were already known to be cases of the same law of causation; and thus the law of all these tendencies, and the law of terrestrial gravity, were recognized as identical, and were subsumed under one general law, that of gravitation.|$|E

Of the three effects only the book value and (previously confirmed) small firm main effect, but not the P/E effect, is present for Australian stocks. This result suggests that the P/E effect reported in the U. S. literature may disappear in (very) small U. S. stocks.

Given that most continuous queries specify windowing constraints, we suggest a multi-level scheme for concurrent {{evaluation of}} time-based sliding windows seeking for potential <b>subsumptions</b> among them. As requests may be registered or suspended dynamically, we develop a technique for choosing the most suitable embedding of a given window into a group composed of multi-grained time frames already employed for other queries. Intuitively, the proposed methodology ""clusters"" windowed operators into common hierarchical constructs, thus drastically reducing the need for their separate evaluation. Our empirical study confirms that such a scheme achieves dramatic memory savings with almost negligible maintenance cost. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|International audience—Path-biased random {{testing is}} an {{interesting}} alternative to classical path-based approaches faced to {{the explosion of the}} number of paths, and to the weak structural coverage of random methods based on the input domain only. Given a graph representation of the system under test a probability distribution on paths of a certain length is computed and then used for drawing paths. A limitation of this approach, similarly to other methods based on symbolic execution and static analysis, is the existence of infeasible paths that often leads to a lot of unexploitable drawings. We present a prototype for pruning some infeasible paths, thus eliminating useless drawings. It is based on graph transformations that have been proved to preserve the actual behaviour of the program. It is driven by symbolic execution and heuristics that use detection of <b>subsumptions</b> and the abstract-check-refine paradigm. The approach is illustrated on some detailed examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ontology Matching {{is a task}} {{needed in}} various applications, for example for {{comparison}} or merging purposes. In literature, many algorithms solving the matching problem can be found, {{but most of them}} do not consider instances at all. Mappings are determined by calculating the string-similarity of labels, by recognizing linguistic word relations (synonyms, <b>subsumptions</b> etc.) or by analyzing the (graph) structure. Due to the facts that instances are often modeled within the ontology and that the set of instances describes the meaning of the concepts better than their meta information, instances should definitely be incorporated into the matching process. In this paper several novel instance-based matching algorithms are presented which enhance the quality of matching results obtained with common concept-based methods. Different kinds of formalisms are use to classify concepts on account of their instances and finally to compare the concepts directly. Keywords—Instances, Ontology Matching, Semantic Web I...|$|R
