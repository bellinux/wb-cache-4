500|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey {{is a member}} of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys containing {{squirrel monkey}}s, capuchin monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. Within the family Cebidae, it {{is a member of}} the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys. It is one of five recognized species of squirrel monkey, and the only species occurring outside South America. The Central American Squirrel Monkey is placed in genus Saimiri (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other squirrel monkey species. Among the squirrel monkeys, the Central American squirrel monkey is most closely related to the common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and these three species form the S. sciureus species group. [...] The binomial name <b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii</b> was given by Johannes Theodor Reinhardt in honor of his fellow Danish biologist Anders Sandøe Ørsted.|$|R
40|$|The black-crowned Central American {{squirrel}} monkey (<b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii</b> oerstedii) {{has never been}} abundant, having been geographically restricted by its preferred habitat of low altitude secondary forest in Costa Rica and Panama. But heavy deforestation in the 20 th century had a devastating effect on the population: the most recent survey, completed in 1996, estimated that fewer than 6000 individuals remained in the wild. Deforestation and subsequent habitat fragmentation remain the major threats to this {{squirrel monkey}}, while insecticide use in agribusiness and poorly insulated electrical wires also pose serious risks. Costa Rica, with its international reputation {{as a leader in}} conservation actions, {{is in a position to}} reverse S. o. oerstedii 2 ̆ 7 s downward population trend. Conservationists and policy makers are limited by the absence of current population data, making a new survey a top priority.

Abstract: Parasites {{have been}} {{investigated}} for some New World primates; however, very {{little is known about}} ectoparasites and specifically fur mites. In this study, Alouatta palliata, Cebus capucinus, <b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii,</b> and Ateles geoffroyi monkeys from different areas of Costa Rica were searched for fur mites. A total of 276 monkeys were evaluated, and 51 of them were positive for mites of the family Atopomelidae. Listrocarpus alouattae was identified on 22. 3 % of A. palliata; Listrocarpus capucinus on 12. 8 % of C. capucinus; and Listrocarpus costaricensis on 36. 8 % of S. oerstedii; No fur mites were found on A. geoffroyi. Sex was not considered a determinant of mite infestation, but prevalence was significantly higher in the Central Volcanic Mountain Range Conservation Area for L. alouattae (p= 0. 01) and in the Central Pacific Conservation Area for L. capucinus (p= 0. 002).

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the association between}} geographic distribution, ecological traits, life history, genetic diversity, and risk of extinction in nonhuman primate species from Costa Rica. All of the current nonhuman primate species from Costa Rica {{are included in the}} study; spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata), capuchins (Cebus capucinus), and squirrel monkeys (<b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii).</b> Geographic distribution was characterized accessing existing databases. Data on ecology and life history traits were obtained through a literature review. Genetic diversity was characterized using isozyme electrophoresis. Risk of extinction was assessed from the literature. We found that species differed in all these traits. Using these data, we conducted a Pearson correlation between risk of extinction and ecological and life history traits, and genetic variation, for widely distributed species. We found a negative association between risk of extinction and population birth and growth rates; indicating that slower reproducing species had a greater risk of extinction. We found a positive association between genetic variation and risk of extinction; i. e., species showing higher genetic variation had a greater risk of extinction. The relevance of these traits for conservation efforts is discussed...|$|R
40|$|You are a {{biologist}} working {{to protect a}} recently discovered population of Central American squirrel monkeys (<b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii)</b> on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. Just a few years ago, this small troop of approximately 30 individuals was found in an isolated patch of secondary forest close to Finca La Cusinga, {{on the border of}} Ballena Marine National Park. The attached map of southwest Costa Rica shows the locations of Ballena Marine National Park, Corcovado National Park, and Manuel Antonio National Park, as well as important potential geographic barriers such as mountains and rivers. Because almost none of the terrestrial ecosystems along this coast are protected, you have convinced a conservation foundation to purchase approximately 200 hectares (ha) of forested land in the area inhabited by the newly found squirrel monkeys. Your objectives are to manage this reserve for secondary forest, which is S. oerstedii's preferred habitat, and to establish a viable population of squirrel monkeys. 2 The situation of this tiny population is critical for at least two reasons. First, previous studies of S. oerstedii have shown that groups with less than 15 members face almost certain extinction, indicating your 30 -member troop is probably at high risk. Second, this group is one of only three remaining populations of squirrel monkeys in Costa Rica. Historically, S. oerstedii once occupied a much wider range, inhabiting contiguous tropical wet forest along the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica and Panama at altitudes lower than 300 meters (m). A 1983 census put the Costa Rican population at approximately 200, 000 individuals, with a relatively continuous distribution. By the end of the 1990 s, only 4, 000 S. oerstedii remained. These were confined to two National Parks, one in Manuel Antonio on the Central Pacific Coast and one in Corcovado on the South Pacific Coast. Elsewhere, the species was believed to be extinct...|$|R
40|$|Landscape genetic studies offer a fine-scale {{understanding}} of how habitat heterogeneity influences population genetic structure. We examined population genetic structure and conducted a landscape genetic analysis for the endangered Central American Squirrel Monkey (<b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii)</b> that lives in the fragmented, human-modified habitats of the Central Pacific region of Costa Rica. We analyzed non-invasively collected fecal samples from 244 individuals from 14 groups for 16 microsatellite markers. We found two geographically separate genetic clusters in the Central Pacific region with evidence of recent gene flow among them. We also found significant differentiation among groups of S. o. citrinellus using pairwise F(ST) comparisons. These groups are in fragments of secondary forest separated by unsuitable "matrix" habitats such as cattle pasture, commercial African oil palm plantations, and human residential areas. We used an individual-based landscape genetic approach to measure spatial patterns of genetic variance while taking into account landscape heterogeneity. We found that large, commercial oil palm plantations represent moderate barriers to gene flow between populations, but cattle pastures, rivers, and residential areas do not. However, the influence of oil palm plantations on genetic variance was diminished when we restricted analyses to within population pairs, suggesting that their effect is scale-dependent and manifests during longer dispersal events among populations. We show that when landscape genetic methods are applied rigorously and at the right scale, they are sensitive enough to track population processes even in species with long, overlapping generations such as primates. Thus landscape genetic approaches are extremely valuable for the conservation management of a diverse array of endangered species in heterogeneous, human-modified habitats. Our results also {{stress the importance of}} explicitly considering the heterogeneity of matrix habitats in landscape genetic studies, instead of assuming that all matrix habitats have a uniform effect on population genetic processes...|$|R
40|$|The ASPM (abnormal spindle-like {{microcephaly}} associated) gene {{has been}} proposed as {{a major determinant of}} cerebral cortical size among primates, including humans. Yet the specific functions of ASPM and its connection to human intelligence remain controversial. This debate is limited in part by a taxonomic focus on Old World monkeys and apes. Here we expand the comparative context of ASPM sequence analyses with a study of New World monkeys, a radiation of primates in which enlarged brain size has evolved in parallel in spider monkeys (genus Ateles) and capuchins (genus Cebus). The primate community of Costa Rica is perhaps a model system because it allows for independent pairwise comparisons of smaller- and larger-brained species within two taxonomic families. Accordingly, we analyzed the complete sequence of exon 18 of ASPM in Ateles geoffroyi, Alouatta palliata, Cebus capucinus, and <b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii.</b> As the analysis of multiple species in a genus improves phylogenetic reconstruction, we also analyzed eleven published sequences from other New World monkeys. Our exon-wide, lineage-specific analysis of eleven genera and the ratio of rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (d(N) /d(S)) on ASPM revealed no detectable evidence for positive selection in the lineages leading to Ateles or Cebus, as indicated by d(N) /d(S) ratios of < 1. 0 (0. 6502 and 0. 4268, respectively). Our results suggest that a multitude of interacting genes have driven the evolution of larger brains among primates, with different genes involved in this process in different encephalized lineages, or at least with evidence for positive selection not readily apparent for the same genes in all lineages. The primate community of Costa Rica may serve as a model system for future studies that aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive capacity and cortical size...|$|R
40|$|Habitat modification, when {{it results}} in {{population}} fragmentation, often results {{in the loss of}} genetic diversity due to reduced gene flow, inbreeding, and genetic drift. However, the severity of these effects depends on how diminished dispersal and gene flow become between patches of suitable habitat. An empirical understanding of how habitat change affects dispersal and gene flow within and among patches is essential to predict the effects of increased habitat modification and landscape change on population persistence and processes of divergence. Recent studies in landscape ecology suggest that our understanding of dispersal in a heterogeneous landscape will improve by explicitly considering the heterogeneity of matrix habitats, or unsuitable habitats between patches of suitable habitat. In this dissertation, I describe population genetic structure and dispersal patterns in the Central American Squirrel Monkey (<b>Saimiri</b> <b>oerstedii,</b> Primates: Cebidae), a New World primate threatened with extinction and living in a heterogeneous, human-modified landscape, using analyses that explicitly consider matrix heterogeneity. I focus on the more endangered S. o. citrinellus, whose already restricted distribution in the Central Pacific region of Costa Rica has undergone considerable anthropogenic modification since the early 1900 s. I collected non-invasive fecal samples from S. o. citrinellus across the Central Pacific region, obtaining full genotypes from 233 individuals. I also obtained 11 samples from S. o. oerstedii in the Southern Pacific region of Costa Rica from a collaborator, as well as fine-scale landscape data for the Central Pacific. I analyzed the data using molecular systematics, population genetics, and landscape genetic techniques. In this dissertation, first I explore whether molecular genetic support exists for the subspecies distinction between S. o. citrinellus and S. o. <b>oerstedii.</b> Second, <b>I</b> describe population genetic structure and recent migration patterns within S. o. citrinellus using traditional population genetic methods and Bayesian models. I also compare population genetic structure among males versus females to test for sex-biased dispersal patterns in S. o. citrinellus. Then, using landscape genetic approaches, I describe the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and genetic structure in S. o. citrinellus, and inferred which matrix habitats are costly to dispersal. Finally, I offer explicit recommendations for the conservation management of S. oerstedii. My results provide genetic support for S. o. citrinellus and S. o. oerstedii as separate taxa referred to as subspecies. Also, I found evidence of population genetic structure in S. o. citrinellus, with two genetically distinct populations and lower genetic diversity in the western population. I did not find genetic evidence for female-biased dispersal in S. o. citrinellus as expected. Instead, my results suggest that both sexes disperse, with males dispersing over longer distances. The landscape genetic analysis suggests that landscape heterogeneity is important in determining local population genetic structure in S. o. citrinellus in the Central Pacific region of Costa Rica. Specifically, oil palm plantations are moderate barriers to gene flow between populations, but not other matrix habitats. However, these inferences are specific to the composition and configuration of the Central Pacific landscape, and should not be generalized to all S. oerstedii populations. This study generated important information for conservation management. Based on my results, I recommend that conservation managers house the two S. oerstedii subspecies separately in captive facilities, and only transfer, reintroduce, or translocate among groups of the same subspecies. However, transfers, reintroductions, or translocations of either males or females are both likely to be successful for S. o. citrinellus in the Central Pacific region, pending further behavioral study. I also recommend that, in order to augment dispersal to the isolated western population of S. o. citrinellus, conservation efforts should focus on building biological corridors through or around adjacent oil palm plantations. Also, managers should prioritize the maintenance of existing forest connectivity in the Central Pacific region. The results also have important implications for future studies of evolutionary and ecological processes in heterogeneous landscapes. This study contributes to {{a growing body of research}} that finds differences in dispersal patterns among local primate populations of the same taxon. My results suggest that predictive models for variation in dispersal patterns should consider both variation among the environments of local populations within a species and temporal variation in local environments (e. g. recent habitat disturbance). Finally, this dissertation also supports the idea that matrix heterogeneity should be considered explicitly in studies of dispersal and gene flow, as opposed to assuming that all non-suitable habitats have a uniform effect on these processes. In the future, agent-based simulation approaches combined with ecological niche models and data on adaptive genetic diversity could expand upon this work to inform predictive models for population divergence and speciation under different climate and landscape change scenarios...|$|R
