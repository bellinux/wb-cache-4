30|$|As {{observed}} from Table  6, {{with the}} BRAM-based HW_v 2, we achieve 70 % of <b>space</b> <b>saving</b> {{in terms of}} total number of occupied slices and 89 % <b>space</b> <b>saving</b> in terms of total number of DSP slices, compared to the register-based HW_v 1. Furthermore, we also achieve 44 % <b>space</b> <b>saving</b> in terms of total number of BRAMs, with HW_v 2 compared to HW_v 1, which is unexpected, since {{it is assumed that}} the BRAM-based designs naturally would utilize more BRAMs than the register-based designs.|$|R

We find that a chunksize of 1 KB can provide up to 84 % <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> and even higher savings in network bandwidth whilst trading off error resilience. We also find that a chunksize of 1 KB or larger provides good file-system performance while incurring about 14 % overhead from use of a CAS based naming scheme...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{parameterized}} procedural abstraction. This {{is an extension}} of an optimization whose sole purpose is to reduce code size. Previously published implementations of procedural abstraction have produced <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> if the instruction sequences are exact matches. We show that permanent <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> (compaction) are possible when (1) covering all inexact matches by several procedures and (2) carefully choosing the inexact match instances covered by each procedure. Our algorithms yield substantially better <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> in comparison to approaches constrained to use unparameterized procedures. 1 Introduction Powerful applications that are small and fast have always been desirable. Falling memory prices and higher chip densities mean that internal storage constraints should (theoretically) recede into the background. However, many computer users are unsatisfied as they often find that there is never enough memory for their programs. Compiler optimizations are usual [...] ...|$|R

Furthermore, our BRAM-based HW_v 2 achieved significant <b>space</b> <b>saving</b> compared to our register-based HW_v 1, in this case, 70 % of <b>space</b> <b>saving</b> in terms of total number of occupied slices.

40|$|N-gram {{encoding}} for strings provides good inexact matching performance, but pays a {{large storage}} penalty. We describe {{a method for}} superimposed N-gram coding that provides more than a 40 - 60 % reduction in the storage space required over the typical N-gram implementation while giving good speed and matching performance. Our system uses bit vectors to represent the occurrence of sets of N-grams in lexicon strings. The <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> comes from the notion of superimposing sets of N-grams onto single bit vectors. We also discuss {{an extension of the}} superimposed coding idea which encodes every N-gram with an ensemble of bit vectors {{in such a way as}} to yield even greater <b>space</b> <b>savings.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} produce {{large amounts}} of data. A key challenge is {{how to cope with}} the resulting bottlenecks. This paper introduces a highly efficient data handling method using parallel inter-processor traffic, called TRC. It is used to reconstruct the internal fields inside one or more regions of interest (ROIs) defined by the user. The method is implemented on top of OpenFOAM®, an opensource computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform [1]. A well known CFD benchmark is used to demonstrate its efficiency in terms of the <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> obtained. The benchmark test-case is validated using experimental data from the literature. Several compression algorithms are applied to assess the efficiency of the method within a user-defined ROI, including ZIP and RAR [2, 3]. It is shown that in terms of <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> TRC has an efficiency of an order of magnitude higher, and that the efficiency improves as the size of the uncompressed data gets bigger. The <b>space</b> <b>savings</b> obtained with classic algorithms remain constant for more than 60 Gb of floating point data. The obtained results bring new perspectives to attention regarding data handling techniques for parallel numerical simulations.
