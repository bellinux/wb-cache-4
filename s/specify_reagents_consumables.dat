Through literature review combined with interviews of pathologists and laboratory directors in the U.

Interviews were focused on costs of <b>reagents,</b> <b>consumables,</b> equipment, and personnel. The resulting model showed that testing by IHC alone cost less ($ 90. 07 in the U.

40|$|Recently, super-resolution {{microscopy}} {{methods such as}} stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) {{have enabled}} visualization of subcellular structures below the optical resolution limit. Due to the poor temporal resolution, however, these methods have mostly been used to image fixed cells or dynamic processes that evolve on slow time-scales. In particular, fast dynamic processes {{and their relationship to}} the underlying ultrastructure or nanoscale protein organization cannot be discerned. To overcome this limitation, we have recently developed a correlative and sequential imaging method that combines live-cell and super-resolution microscopy. This approach adds dynamic background to ultrastructural images providing a new dimension to the interpretation of super-resolution data. However, currently, it suffers from the need to carry out tedious steps of sample preparation manually. To alleviate this problem, we implemented a simple and versatile microfluidic platform that streamlines the sample preparation steps in between live-cell and super-resolution imaging. The platform is based on a microfluidic chip with parallel, miniaturized imaging chambers and an automated fluid-injection device, which delivers a precise amount of a <b>specified</b> <b>reagent</b> to the selected imaging chamber at a specific time within the experiment.

40|$|Viral load (VL) {{measurements}} {{are critical to}} the proper management of HIV in developing countries. However, access to VL assays {{is limited by the}} high cost and complexity of exist-ing assays. While {{there is a need for}} low cost VL assays, performance must not be compro-mised. Thus, new assays must be validated on metrics of limit of detection (LOD), accuracy, and dynamic range.

40|$|Background: Cost {{analysis}} in laboratories represents a necessary phase in their scientific progression. Aim: To calculate indirect cost and thus total cost per sample of various tests at Hematopathology laboratory (HPL) Settings and Design: Activity-based costing (ABC) method {{is used to}} calculate per cost test of the hematopathology laboratory. Material and Methods: Information is collected from registers, purchase orders, annual maintenance contracts (AMCs), payrolls, account books, hospital bills and registers along with informal interviews with hospital staff. Results: Cost per test decreases as total number of samples increases. Maximum annual expense at the HPL is on <b>reagents</b> and <b>consumables</b> followed by manpower. Cost per test is higher for specialized tests which interpret morphological or flow data and are done by a pathologist.

30|$|LAMP can be {{performed}} in a high-throughput format for simultaneous analysis of large-number samples in 96 -well microplate [28]. Lower cost, quickness, simplicity, specificity, and sensitivity make LAMP a powerful alternative for PCR {{in the field of}} molecular diagnosis, especially in developing countries. Therefore, considering the advantages of LAMP over PCR, it can be used in most of molecular methods that utilize PCR. One of the molecular methods, which can use LAMP instead of PCR, is ‘immuno-PCR’ or ‘iPCR’. iPCR is usually used for detection as well as quantification of antigens (Ags), which are mostly protein, using PCR. In this method target Ag is captured in a sandwich form between two antibodies (Abs), the capture antibody and the detection antibody, which are specifically bound to the target antigen. The capture Ab, which is pre-immobilized on a solid support surface, captures the target Ag, and the detection Ab, which is pre-conjugated with a double-strand DNA called signal DNA, attaches to the captured Ag. After wash, the signal DNA is amplified by PCR, and hence the presence of PCR products indicates indirectly the presence of target Ag in the sample. In fact, in iPCR, PCR is used for signal amplification. Since PCR method produces millions of copies of target DNA, iPCR converts the presence of a few Ag molecules into a signal, which is easily detectable. Thus, iPCR can detect Ag in very low quantities and is more sensitive than common Ag detecting methods like ELISA [9]. However, iPCR itself may have some technical limitations. Some practical drawbacks make this method difficult to be easily utilized in low-resource laboratories. These limitations include complicated and time-consuming protocol, requirement for specific tools and expert personnel for performing of the method, low signal-to-noise ratio, the risk of cross-contamination among different samples when assaying multiple samples, and technical hurdles in the preparation of detection of antibody-signal DNA conjugates. The real-time iPCR also requires advanced thermal cyclers and more <b>specified</b> <b>reagents</b> compared with iPCR [20].|$|R

We evaluated performance characteristics, workflow, throughput, reliability, and direct costs of these assays. Both assays yielded good correlation of quantitative results (r = 0. 95) among clinical specimens, with a mean difference of − 0. 34 log 10 copies/ml. Testing of healthy donor plasma specimens yielded “target not detected” results by ART, with “HIV- 1 RNA detected, < 40 copies/ml” results for 3. 3 % (3 of 90 samples) of these specimens by CTM. Both the m 2000 sp/m 2000 rt (ART) and docked CAP/CTM 96 (CTM) instrument systems were capable of operating with continuous, uninterrupted workflow. When daily maintenance and cleaning were included, ART and CTM run durations (5 h 52 min and 6 h 4 min, respectively) and hands-on times (53 min and 46 min, respectively) were similar for a run batch size of 24. While ART was more flexible in terms of run batch size, CTM required fewer user interventions and consistently produced higher specimen throughput rates at 8, 16, and 24 h.

Correlations between assays were assessed using Pearson correlation, linear regression and Bland–Altman analysis. The temporal profiles of free cortisol, E 1 G, FSH‐beta, and hCG‐beta were also compared. Results:  The multiplex array was highly correlated with the individual immunoassays for five of the tested hormones (Pearson's correlation coefficient ≥ 0. 75), and yielded temporal patterns of hormone profiles consistent with the individual immunoassays for free cortisol, E 1 G, FSH‐beta, and hCG‐beta. Conclusions:   The Quansys multiplex female hormone array is a valid alternative method to individual immunoassays for the quantification of stress, reproductive and energetic hormones and metabolites in human urine samples {{and can be used}} to examine the dynamic interactions between these hormones.
