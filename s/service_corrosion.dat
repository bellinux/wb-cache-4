40|$|The use of guided waves is now {{widespread}} in industrial NDT for locating metal loss in pipelines, that manifests as pitting, corrosion and general wall thinning. In this paper, a screening technique is assessed {{in terms of}} defect detection and defect sizing capability. Shear Horizontal (SH) guided waves propagate circumferentially around the pipe whilst the scanner is moved axially along the length. This type of tool is preferable to other methods, being applied to {{the exterior of the}} pipe, without requiring full circumferential access, and is able to operate through thin coatings (up to 1 mm thick). It is designed to provide a pipe screening tool for petrochemical pipelines both topside and subsea, particularly for detecting defects at pipe support areas. The system's efficacy in terms of detection and sizing of defects is considered via experimental measurements on artificially induced defects and in <b>service</b> <b>corrosion</b> patches, with results compared to finite element modelling of the interaction of the guided waves with artificial defects.

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a growing}} trend in the {{automotive}} industry to reduce vehicles weight so as to increase fuel efficiency and therefore reduce CO 2 emissions. For many automotive components such as springs, weight reduction is sought through {{an increase in the}} mechanical properties (allowing smaller components size). For ultra high strength springs, a good corrosion resistance becomes essential to avoid surface damage that will be detrimental to the corrosion-fatigue resistance. Corrosion-fatigue failures indeed often initiate on surface defects caused by corrosion in <b>service</b> (<b>corrosion</b> pits). Therefore, while of moderate importance in conventional spring steels, the corrosion resistance of ultra high strength spring steels is of primary importance. Fine changes in steel chemical composition can have an important effect on corrosion resistance. To understand the individual action of each element on the corrosion resistance of spring steels, corrosion products formed on samples exposed to NaCl environments were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, in a purposely designed experimental tool that allows mapping of corrosion products on the steel surface (by nature and mass fraction). Different steel grades were thus characterized after accelerated corrosion tests, and a clear correlation was established between weight loss {{and the nature of the}} corrosion products...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{property}} {{criteria for}} automotive Al-Mg-Si sheet alloys are outlined and investigated {{in the context}} of commercial alloys AA 6016, AA 6005 A, AA 6063 and AA 6013. The parameters crucial to predicting forming behavior were determined by tensile tests, bending tests, cross-die tests, hole-expansion tests and forming limit curve analysis in the pre-aged temper after various storage periods following sheet production. Roping tests were performed to evaluate surface quality, for the deployment of these alloys as an outer panel material. Strength in service was also tested after a simulated paint bake cycle of 20 min at 185 °C, and the corrosion behavior was analyzed. The study showed that forming behavior is strongly dependent on the type of alloy and that it is influenced by the storage period after sheet production. Alloy AA 6016 achieves the highest surface quality, and pre-ageing of alloy AA 6013 facilitates superior strength in <b>service.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> behavior is good in AA 6005 A, AA 6063 and AA 6016, and only AA 6013 shows a strong susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.

40|$|Low alloyed high {{strength}} steels are increasingly {{used in many}} industry sectors to reduce weight and, hence, to save fuel, reduce emissions, and to minimize resource utilization. Those alloys show, however, a tendency for hydrogen induced cracking (HAC), where the hydrogen is formed either during processing or due to <b>service</b> <b>corrosion</b> processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of various zinc-containing topcoats on hydrogen re-embrittlement. In order to cause hydrogen induced cracking, hydrogen does not only need to be formed, but also needs to penetrate and migrate into the material. The hydrogen entry is influenced by various parameters, e. g. temperature, electrostatic potential, humidity, pH-value, oxygen concentration, chloride and promoter concentration, and time. In this study, the influence of different environmental conditions on the hydrogen induced corrosion was investigated by means of electrochemical permeation measurements. The electrochemical permeation measurements were performed under different concentrations of the local oxygen content (5 % NaCl; pH = 3; flushing with different gases). For these chosen environmental conditions, the results show that the local oxygen content has a significant influence on the resulting permeation current. To validate the results of the electrochemical permeation measurements and to examine the susceptibility against hydrogen re-embrittlement of those zinc containing topcoats, incremental step-load-tests were performed under the same environmental conditions. It is shown that the investigated topcoats (electroplated zinc, electroplated zinc-nickel, galvanized zinc, zinc-flake (GEOMET 321 A)) impose a different susceptibility on hydrogen re-embrittlement. Under the tested environmental conditions specimens with electroplated Zn sustain a lower fracture load compared to specimens in heat treated black condition. In contrast, an electroplated zinc-nickel topcoat leads to a higher fracture load...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 An {{evaluation}} {{was made}} of factors contributing to the service failure of a 12 inch diameter cast iron water pipe in Pendleton, Oregon. The quality of the pipe {{was found to be}} acceptable when compared to the acceptance limits established by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. However it exhibited numerous casting defects such as blowholes, gas porosity, lapping zone discontinuities and poor casting surface indicating a poorly cast product. Metallurgical study also revealed a discontinuous solidification pattern which produced a thin separated metal layer at the pipe's outer wall. The cause of the failure, however, was not attributed to any of these defects. Between 71 and 88 inches on the fracture surface, an unusual black surface appearance was observed. Microscopic examination and electron microprobe analysis of the corrosion deposit in this area revealed a very thick adherent layer of corrosion products, found nowhere else on the fracture surface, and a penetrating type corrosive attack. This corrosive attack was determined to be characteristic of graphitic corrosion that occurred {{over a long period of}} time. Based on the results of this evaluation, it was concluded that the failure was not caused by any metallurgical defect, by corrosion alone, or by service stresses. It appeared to be caused by the presence of a longitudinal hairline crack on the inner pipe wall that was formed as a result of impact received before or during installation. Over the four and one-half years of service that the pipe was in <b>service,</b> <b>corrosion</b> and service stresses increased the depth and length of the crack until the pipe was so weakened that a seven feet four inch longitudinal crack opened all the way through the pipe wall over a short period of time...|$|E

50|$|Delayed failure, the {{fracture}} of a component under stress after an elapsed time, is a characteristic feature of hydrogen embrittlement (2).

40|$|Pipelines are {{susceptible}} to degradation over the span of their <b>service</b> life. <b>Corrosion</b> {{is one of the}} most common degradation mechanisms, but other critical mechanisms such as fatigue and creep should not be overlooked. The rate of degradation is influenced by many factors, such as material, process conditions, geometry, and location. Based on these factors, a best estimate for the pipeline service life (reliability) can be calculated. This estimate serves as a guide for maintenance and replacement practices. After a long period of service, however, this estimate requires reevaluation due to the new evidence gathered from monitoring the conditions of the pipeline. Several deterministic models have been proposed to estimate the reliability of pipelines. Among these models is the ASME B 31 G code, which is the most widely accepted method for the assessment of corroded pipelines. However, these models are highly conservative and lack the ability to estimate the true life and health of the pipeline. In addition to the limitations embedded in these deterministic models are the problems with inspection techniques and tools that may be inadequate and susceptible to error and imprecision. What is needed, therefore, is a best-estimate assessment model tha...|$|R
40|$|The major {{problems}} affecting the service life of bridges {{are related to}} {{various factors such as}} fatigue-sensitive details, increased <b>service</b> loads, <b>corrosion</b> deterioration, and the lack of proper maintenance. Among them, corrosion deterioration and fatigue damages of structures particularly to steel girder bridges are the most common ones. Bridges of different structural forms, at different locations or under different climates, may suffer from various degrees of deterioration. Steel girders at different positions of a bridge may also suffer from different degrees of damage. How to effectively maintain the bridge asset at a minimal cost and how to predict the time for future works are crucial, particularly when government funding sources become stretched. A comprehensive bridge management framework assisting stakeholders to appropriately and reasonably prioritize their future maintenance-related works in their bridge stocks, such that stakeholders can better allocate the limited resources, is utmost concerned. This paper proposes an integrated life-cycle management (LCM) strategy on steel girders in bridges in which corrosion deterioration and fatigue damage prediction models are mapped with girders performance conditions. A practical example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed LCM strategy is also illustrated. Copyright © 2012 Kevin K. L. So et al...|$|R
40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) shows a big {{potential}} among metal {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) technologies. However, the large thermal gradients {{and the local}} melting and solidification processes of SLM result {{in the presence of}} a significant amount of residual stresses in the as built parts. These internal stresses will not only affect mechanical properties, but also increase the risk of Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC). A twister used in an air extraction pump of a condenser to create a swirl in the water, was chosen as a candidate component to be produced by SLM in 316 L stainless steel.

Hence, this paper investigates the corrosion propensities of galvanised steel in seawater using specially prepared carbon doped aluminium as sacrificial anode. The 6063 aluminium was doped by adding varied amount of carbon in form of graphite particles to molten aluminium and mechanically stirred vigorously before casting. Then, the commercial galvanised steel and carbon doped aluminium coupons were coupled in a corrosion cell with seawater as the electrolyte. Corrosion simulation lasted seventy days and the data obtained was analysed. Results show that corrosion of the carbon doped aluminium increased with increase in doping of aluminium. The cathodically protected galvanised steel sufferred minimal corrosion rate of 4. 9 x 10 - 2 mpy compared with the undoped aluminium anode which exhibited a huge 38. 9 x 10 - 2 mpy corrosion rate. The microstructure before and after corrosion also revealed that surface attack was more pronounced on the carbon doped aluminium relative to the galvanised steel. It thus appears that doping of aluminium with carbon is an effective corrosion mitigation alternative for galvanised steel in seawater...|$|R

40|$|Aging and {{deterioration}} of underground cast iron pipes is inevitable after their {{long time in}} <b>service,</b> with <b>corrosion</b> being the most predominant mechanism for pipe failures. Although considerable research has been undertaken {{in the past few}} decades, more is on the effects of corrosion on structural capacity of pipes than that on the prediction of their service life. This paper presents a methodology to quantitatively assess the risk of pipe collapse and predict its remaining service life using a time-dependent reliability theory. The concept of stress intensity in fracture mechanics is employed to establish the failure criterion of pipe collapse. An empirical model is derived for maximum pit growth of corrosion from the available data based on mathematical regressions. An example is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method. It is found in the paper that the risk of pipe collapse increases with an increase in the diameter of the pipe for both external and internal corrosion. It is also found that the tougher the pipe is, the smaller the risk of its collapse. The paper concludes that a time-dependent reliability method is a very useful tool to predict the risk of pipe collapse and its remaining service life. The proposed method can help the water industry develop rehabilitation or replacement strategy for existing pipe networks with a view for better management of the pipe asset...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft joints feature {{prominently}} in aircraft structural degradation. Fatigue cracking and corrosion damage can reduce joint strength and degrade <b>service</b> life. <b>Corrosion</b> management can include use of paints and sealants and, increasingly, {{the application of}} Corrosion Inhibiting Compounds (CICs) which retard corrosion, by penetrating into crevices and cracks, and displacing water. A combination of coatings and CIC use can provide effective corrosion protection, but both interact - in different ways - with structural performance and overall system durability. This paper discusses the interaction between these two corrosion protection measures and fatigue performance of joints. The first issue relates {{to a reduction in}} the fatigue life of mechanically-fastened joints after application of CICs (or other lubricants) The lubricating properties of the CICs reduce the friction at the faying surface, which may change the load transfer characteristics of the joint. The paper discusses results from a test program assessing the fatigue life and failure mode of riveted lap joints; the results show a marked reduction in fatigue life for joints containing CICs, and the paper discusses the changes which may be responsible for the reduction. The second issue discussed is the degradation of protective coatings in service. Joints are key locations for coating cracking and failure, since areas such as sheet ends and fastener heads, where displacements are concentrated, will produce concentrated strain in coatings. So far, however, the potential influence of aircraft loading on coating degradation prognostics has received little attention...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion science {{exhibits}} a major division between dry and wet corrosion. Dry corrosion {{is dominated by}} high temperature oxidation of metals and {{is controlled by the}} rate at which oxygen can diffuse through the oxide skin and by stable oxide adhesion to the metal substrate involved. Wet corrosion involves electrolytic interactions that require the presence of an aqueous solution. Good design can prevent onset of in <b>service</b> (wet) <b>corrosion</b> by limiting the contact of the electrolyte. However, changes in operational procedures and manufacture can reverse any good design practice. Furthermore, the combined effects of stress and corrosion can result in a special type of failure known as stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Stress corrosion cracking presents an especially difficult problem, since not only is it highly localised but it can occur in environments that are only mildly corrosive to the material. The damaging concentration of harmful ions in that environment may be quite small and difficult to detect and, {{even in the absence of}} applied stress, residual stresses in a structure can often be of a sufficiently high level to cause SCC and failure in service. The role of the forensic or failure engineer in this arena is often to assess if basic design, manufacture and material choice reflect professional engineering practice.
