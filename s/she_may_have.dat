5|$|As World War I {{continued}} in Europe {{and increased the}} demand for defense-related shipping, American-Hawaiian stopped its sugar service. Ohioans specific activities during this time are not known. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service, or <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{in the group of}} American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps every man, whether {{married or}} unmarried, {{who has lived}} {{to the age of}} fifty or thereabouts, has seen some woman who, in his mind, is the woman, in {{distinction}} from all others. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been a relative; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been a wife; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> simply <b>have</b> shone on him from afar; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> be remembered in the distance of years as a star that is set, as music that is hushed, as beauty and loveliness faded forever; but remembered she is with interest, with fervor, with enthusiasm; with all that heart can feel, and more than words can tell.|$|R

5|$|Most {{accounts}} {{declare that}} Kanhopatra {{was forced into}} the courtesan's life, though she detested it, while some say that Kanhopatra firmly declined to become a courtesan. Some authors believe that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also worked as a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E

5|$|Tubman {{was busy}} during this time, giving talks to {{abolitionist}} audiences and tending to her relatives. In {{the autumn of}} 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about {{the viability of the}} plan.|$|E
5|$|When Geta died in 211, her {{responsibilities}} increased because Caracalla found {{administrative tasks}} to be mundane. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> taken upon {{one of the}} more important civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions and answering correspondence. The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> represented her son and played a role in meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.|$|E
5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation. Anne had been brought up a Lutheran, but <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> discreetly converted to Catholicism at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish Kirk and caused suspicion in Anglican England.|$|E

5|$|Americans exact {{movements}} {{from this}} time through early 1917 are unclear. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She {{may also have been}} in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including American, was requisitioned by the , which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury persuaded Eadbald {{to accept}} Christianity {{and give up}} his wife. He then remarried, and his second wife, {{according}} to Kentish tradition recorded in the 'Kentish Royal Legend', was a woman named Ymme of Frankish royal blood, though recently {{it has been suggested}} that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> instead been the daughter of Erchinoald, mayor of the palace in Neustria, the western part of Francia.|$|E
5|$|Austin and Laura {{married in}} 1896; L. D. was born {{around the next}} year. (L. D. was {{regularly}} referred to after the lynching as L.W. or Lawrence.) In 1900 the extended family moved to Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. According to Jones-Sneed, Laura and Austin were listed in the 1910 census as having two children, L. D., aged 13, and Carrie, aged two. It is not known what became of Carrie. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been the baby one witness said survived the lynching.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|E
5|$|Goodridge {{gave the}} {{portrait}} to statesman Daniel Webster, {{who was a}} frequent subject and possibly a lover, {{following the death of}} his wife; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> intended to provoke him into marrying her. Although Webster married someone else, his family held onto the portrait until the 1980s, when it was auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Gloria and Richard Manney in 1981. The couple donated or sold the miniatures of their art collection, including Beauty Revealed, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In England, Anne {{shifted her}} {{energies}} from factional politics to patronage {{of the arts}} and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting one of the richest cultural salons in Europe. After 1612, she suffered sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. Though she was reported to have been a Protestant {{at the time of her}} death, evidence suggests that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> converted to Catholicism sometime in her life.|$|E

In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E
