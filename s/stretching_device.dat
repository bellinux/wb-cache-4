Numerical sim-ulation using finite element method provides a guideline for optimizing the geometry and maximizing the output strain of the stretched membrane. An unique PDMS-based micro fabrication process was developed for obtaining high parallelization, well controlled membrane thickness and an ultra-thin bot-tom layer that is crucial for the use with confocal microscopes. The stretching experiments are fully automated with both device actuation and image acqui-sition. A programmable pneumatic control system was built for simultaneous driving of 24 stretching arrays. The actuation signals are synchronized with the image acquisition system to obtain time-lapse recording of cells grown on the stretched membrane. Experimental results verified the characteristics pre-dicted by the simulation. A platform with 15 stretching units was integrated on a standard 24 mm 50 mm glass slide. Each unit can achieve a maximum strain of more than 60 %. The platform was tested for cell growth under cyclic stretching.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the transient viscoelastic behavior of weakly strain-hardening fluids in filament stretching devices during uniaxial elongation {{and following the}} cessation of stretching. The numerical results are compared with experimental observations on a concentrated shear-thinning polystyrene solution which is well characterized by a multi-mode Giesekus model. The finite element computations incorporate the effects of viscoelasticity, surface tension, and fluid inertia and the time-dependent moving-boundary problem is solved using the code POLYFLOW. A detailed comparison of multi-mode computations with single-mode solution is presented {{in order to examine}} the differences in the predicted viscoelastic behavior {{and the role of the}} fluid relaxation spectrum. The evolution in the transient Trouton ratio at different deformation rates is compared with experimental measurements and with the theoretical predictions of ideal homogeneous uniaxial elongation. Simulations of the filament <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> using the multi-mode viscoelastic model demonstrate a significant improvement in the agreement between the predicted and observed extensional viscosity at short times. The computed Trouton ratio is also in good agreement with theoretical expectations for ideal homogeneous uniaxial extension, despite the strongly non-homogeneous viscoelastic necking of the fluid column observed during elongation in the filament <b>stretching</b> <b>device.</b> Following the cessation of elongation, numerical simulations predict an interesting and complex evolution in the kinematics of the fluid filament.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new <b>stretch</b> <b>device</b> to investigate the biomechanical responses to an external loading force on a tissue-like material consisting of cells and a collagen gel. Collagen gel, a typical matrix found abundantly in the connective tissue, was attached to an elastic chamber that was precoated with {{a thin layer of}} collagen. Madin–Darby canine kidney cells that were cultured on the collagen gel were stretched in a uniaxial direction via deformation of the elastic chamber. Changes in the morphology and stiffness of the tissue-like structure were measured before and after the stretch using wide-range scanning probe microscopy (WR-SPM). The change in cellular morphology was heterogeneous, and there was a twofold increase in the intercellular junction due to the stretch. In addition to the WR-SPM measurements, this device enables observation of the spatial distribution of cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin and α-catenin using immunofluorescent microscopy.

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} a hand-stretching device {{that was developed}} {{for the management of}} hand spasticity in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients, and the effects of this device on hand spasticity. Methods Fifteen chronic hemiparetic stroke patients with finger flexor spasticity were recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention group (8 patients) or a control group (7 patients). The <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> consists of a resting hand splint, a finger and thumb stretcher, and a frame. In use, the stretched state was maintained for 10 minutes per exercise session, and the exercise was performed twice daily for 4 weeks. Spasticity of finger flexor muscles in the two groups was assessed 3 times, 4 weeks apart, using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Patients in the intervention group were assessed twice (pre- 1 and pre- 2) before and once (post- 1) after starting the stretching program. Results Mean MAS (mMAS) scores at initial evaluations were not significantly different at pre- 1 in the intervention group and at 1 st assessment in the control group (p> 0. 05). In addition, no significant differences were observed between mMAS scores at pre- 1 and pre- 2 in the intervention group (p> 0. 05). However, mMAS scores at post- 1 were significantly lower than that at pre- 2 in the intervention group (p 0. 05). In addition, mMAS scores at post- 1 in the intervention group were significantly decreased compared with those at the 3 rd assessment in the control group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Insight {{into the}} {{microstructure}} of fetal membrane and its response to deformation {{is important for}} understanding causes of preterm premature rupture of the membrane. However, the microstructure of fetal membranes under deformation has not been visualized yet. Second harmonic generation microscopy, combined with an in-situ <b>stretching</b> <b>device,</b> can provide this valuable information. METHODS: Eight fetal membranes were marked over the cervix with methylene blue during elective caesarean section. One sample per membrane of reflected tissue, between the placenta and the cervical region, was cyclically stretched with a custom built inflation device. Samples were mounted on an in-situ <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> and imaged with a multiphoton microscope at different deformation levels. Microstructural parameters such as thickness and collagen orientation were determined. Image entropy was evaluated for the spongy layer. RESULTS: The spongy layer consistently shows an altered collagen structure in the cervical and cycled tissue compared with the reflected membrane, corresponding to a significantly higher image entropy. An increased thickness of collagenous layers was found in cervical and stretched samples {{in comparison to the}} reflected tissue. Significant collagen fibre alignment was found to occur already at moderate deformation in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, second harmonic generation microscopy has been used to visualize the microstructure of fetal membranes. Repeated mechanical loading was shown to affect the integrity of the amnion-chorion interface which might indicate an increased risk of premature rupture of fetal membrane. Moreover, mechanical loading might contribute to morphological alterations of the fetal membrane over the cervical region...|$|E
30|$|The {{technique}} enables simultaneous mechanical stressing of {{a population}} of cells for instance; the shear flow method or <b>stretching</b> <b>devices</b> (Figure 2 E-F). Usually, the experiments are conducted with either a cone or plate viscometer consisting of stationary flat plate in which a laminar flow can be exerted on it [26]. But this approach relies heavily {{on the type of}} substrate to be used as well as the compliant cell. Therefore, substrate manipulation studies are peculiar to the cell of interest as reported previously. This in vitro approach has been adapted by Wang et al. in 1995 in an attempt to impose cyclic deformation representative of in vivo conditions for melanocytes. In 2003, Pfister et al. investigated the stretch injury for neuron cell. By having in vitro setting, the effects of mechanical loading on cell morphology, phenotypes and injury were examined [27]. Different uniaxial, biaxial and pressure controlled elastic membrane <b>stretching</b> <b>devices</b> have been used to deform cells. Previous researches created potential investigations relating forces applied by cell to substrate [28]-[30], the assembly of focal adhesions and the contractile forces with respect to locomotion or cell migration [31]-[33]. Furthermore, this technique also offers alternative means to provide mechanical stimuli using substrate composition [34]. In fact, various manipulations mentioned above were achieved by controlling the chemical compositions of the substrate material or cross linking substance. While this technique affecting the mechanical properties of the substrate, nevertheless {{it is also important to}} sustain the same chemical environment of the cell population for example species, hydration and adhesivity.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{mechanism}} of traumatic brain injury (TBI) processes at the cellular level is vital to obtain characterization of nerve cell damage after mechanical deformation. This understanding is needed to find feasible therapeutic targets for mechanically damaged neurons. To study the cellular level of TBI damage, {{development of a new}} in vitro cellular model of TBI might be done to simulate in vivo cellular TBI. In this research, two studies were performed: (1) the design and construction of an in vitro cell <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> to mechanically injure cells and (2) the characterization of the molecular and cellular level of the TBI mechanism. The cell <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> design allows for the precise control of cell strain and duration of stretching cells such that TBI can be mimicked. Analysis of the cellular and molecular level mechanisms of TBI in the proposed in vitro model might help in the design of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of TBI. Our proposed mechanism of injury due to TBI is as follows: after the cell is stretched, a cellular signaling molecule is released to activate the cellular signaling pathway. The activated cell signal may activate kinases which phosphorylate proteins and initiate new protein synthesis. Newly phosphorylated and synthesized proteins may activate the apoptotic process. Using a variety of pharmacological agents, one could block steps in the hypothesized mechanism and examine the effect of those agents on downstream cellular processes and cell apoptosis. For example, the inhibitions of calcium transport, protein synthesis, and caspases were performed to examine the initial activation of the signaling pathway and the role of both in the apoptosis process. Proteomics of TBI may help the understanding of the mechanism of TBI related protein expression. This work will contribute to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and better treatments for TBI...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} porcine lenses in a lens stretcher {{with regard}} to presbyopia corrective procedures. Methods. A lens <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> was designed, which allows to simultaneously determine all relevant geometrical and optical parameters at each stretch position. The setup {{was used to compare}} the optical and geometrical lens properties of young slaughter pigs (n = 5) with older sows (n = 7). Results. The change of optical power with stretching is about five times larger for young porcine lenses than for sows. For young pigs, the gradient index profile of the crystalline lens significantly contributes to the induced accommodation amplitude. Conclusions. We have shown that sow lenses are a suitable model for in vitro experiments on possible treatments for presbyopia. The rapid decrease in the induced accommodation amplitude with age may be explained by a reduced change of all geometrical lens parameters, which in turn leads to a smaller contribution of the gradient index profile to accommodation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{principle}} of stretching wound margins for primary wound closure is commonly practiced {{and used for}} various skin defects, leading at times to excessive ten-sion and complications during wound closure. Different surgical techniques, skin <b>stretching</b> <b>devices</b> and tissue expanders have been utilized to address this issue. Previ-ously designed skin <b>stretching</b> <b>devices</b> resulted in consider-able morbidity.

To assess the clinical effectiveness and perfor-mance and, to determine the safety of TopClosure ® for gradual, controlled, temporary, noninvasive and invasive applications for skin stretching and secure wound closing, the TopClosure ® device was applied to 20 patients for preoperative skin lesion removal and to secure closure {{of a variety of}} wound sizes. TopClosure ® was reinforced with adhesives, staples and/or surgical sutures, depending on the circumstances of the wound and the surgeon’s judgment. TopClosure ® was used prior to, during and/or after surgery to reduce tension across wound edges. No significant com-plications or adverse events were associated with its use. TopClosure ® was effectively used for preoperative skin expansion in preparation for dermal resection (e. g., con-genital nevi). It aided closure of large wounds involving significant loss of skin and soft tissue by mobilizing skin and subcutaneous tissue, thus avoiding the need for skin grafts or flaps.

Animal models in which fetal lungs have been chronically over or underdistended demonstrate a disrupted mix of type II and type I cells, with static overdistention typically promoting a type I cell phenotype.

We investigated the possible role of mechanical stretch and the associated molecular signaling in ISR. Methods and Results—Stent implantation in rat abdominal aortas induced neointima formation. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the activation of Akt {{in the media and}} neointima of the stented vessels. Western blotting showed increased phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr 308 and Ser 473 and phosphorylation of GSK- 3 in the stented vessels. A <b>stretch</b> <b>device</b> applying static equibiaxial stretch on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells was used to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the stretch activation of Akt. Static mechanical stretch induced the sustained activation of Akt and its upstream phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and the phosphorylation of GSK- 3, its downstream effector in vascular smooth muscle cells. LY 294002, a PI 3 K inhibitor, and N-acetylcysteine, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, inhibited the stretch activation of Akt. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine and wortmannin, another PI 3 K inhibitor, reduced the neointima formation after stent implantation.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} study {{was to assess the}} skin microcirculation of undermined and nonundermined wound edges closed with a skin-stretching device. In eight piglets, 9 X 9 -cm wounds were created on both flanks by excision of the skin and the subcutaneous layer down to the muscular fascia, with general anesthesia. On one flank, the surrounding skin was completely undermined. For a period of 30 minutes, wound closure was performed with a <b>stretching</b> <b>device,</b> rising the principle of load cycling. The device stretched the skin and moved the opposing wound edges toward each other. During this period, laser Doppler flowmetry and transcutaneous oximetry were simultaneously used to monitor microcirculation and oxygenation in the stretched skin of both flanks. Undermining of the surrounding skin produced a 12 percent. decrease in the laser Doppler flowmetry signal and a 21 percent decrease in the transcutaneous oximetry value. Skin stretching resulted in decreases in the laser Doppler flowmetry signals and the transcutaneous oximetry values, whether or not the skin was undermined. Releasing the <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> resulted in rapid normalization of the laser Doppler flowmetry values in undermined and nonundermined skin and a slow return of the transcutaneous oximetry values to close to baseline levels in nonundermined skin. The transcutaneous oximetry values in undermined skin did not return to baseline levels; each period of skin stretching resulted in an additional decrease in the transcutaneous oximetry values. Stretching of undermined skin for 30 minutes produced a significant (p < 0. 0001) decrease in skin oxygenation. As a result, 50 percent. of the undermined stretched skin demonstrated skin necrosis at the wound edges, which was still present after I week. Wound healing in the nonundermined stretched skin proceeded without problems. It is concluded from these experiments that the viability of undermined skin becomes compromised as a result Of significantly decreased oxygen availability in the skin during and after stretching. Consequently, it is recommended that skin stretching be performed on nonundermined skin, rather than undermined skin. In addition, when skin is stretched to close a large defect, it. is logical to rise cyclic loading, so that recuperation of the skin circulation can occur. Furthermore, laser Doppler flowmetry seemed to produce atypical signals in monitoring of skin viability of wound edges closed with a skin-stretching devic...|$|E
40|$|Polyelectrolyte multilayers PEMs {{produced}} by layer by layer LbL self assembly find different applications. Often the PEMs {{are exposed to}} mechanical stress which they have to sustain. A correlation of the mechanical properties of PEM on macroscopic level with the ordering of polyelectrolyte molecules on molecular level is of interest. Our study {{is focused on the}} changes of orientation of the polyelectrolyte molecules when the PEM is under lateral mechanical stress. The PEM was prepared from pyrene PY labeled polystyrene sulfonate PSS PY and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride PDDA on sheets of polydimethylsiloxane PDMS rubber used as substrates. The LbL dipping technique was used for the formation of PEMs. A special <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> was constructed which allows the fluorescence of the films under stress to be observed. The change in the fluorescence spectra which can be attributed to a PYordering change from the PEM under stress of up to 10 was monitored. We observed that PEMs undergo a plastic deformation under external mechanical stretching. We conclude that under mechanical stress the polyelectrolyte molecules organized in polyelectrolyte multilayers experience an irreversible transition from the coiled to decoiled stat...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the transient viscoelastic behavior of weakly strain-hardening fluids in filament stretching devices during uniaxial elongation {{and following the}} cessation of stretching. The numerical results are compared with experimental observations on a concentrated shear-thinning polystyrene solution which is well characterized by a multi-mode Giesekus model. The finite element computations incorporate the effects of viscoelasticity, surface tension, and fluid inertia and the time-dependent moving-boundary problem is solved using the code POLYFLOW. A detailed comparison of multi-mode computations with single-mode solution is presented {{in order to examine}} the differences in the predicted viscoelastic behavior {{and the role of the}} fluid relaxation spectrum. The evolution in the transient Trouton ratio at different deformation rates is compared with experimental measurements and with the theoretical predictions of ideal homogeneous uniaxial elongation. Simulations of the filament <b>stretching</b> <b>device</b> using the multi-mode viscoelastic model demonstrate a significant improvement in the agreement between the predicted and observed extensional viscosity at short times. The computed Trouton ratio is also in good agreement with theoretical expectations for ideal homogeneous uniaxial extension, despite the strongly nonhomogeneous viscoelastic necking of the fluid column observed during elongation in the filament <b>stretching</b> <b>device.</b> Following the cessation of elongation, numerical simulations predict an interesting and complex evolution in the kinematics of the fluid filament. Initially the tensile stresses in the column relax in the non-linear form predicted theoretically, indicating that filament stretching devices can be used to monitor transient extensional stress relaxation, provided that the evolution of the tensile force at the end-plate and the filament radius at the mid-plane are carefully measured. However, at longer times after cessation of stretching, the local extension rate at the axial mid-plane begins to increase rapidly, leading to a 'necking failure' that is greatly accelerated compared to that expected in a corresponding Newtonian filament. The calculations show that this unstable necking is not driven solely by the surface tension but also by the viscoelasticity of the fluid, and is coupled with significant elastic recoil of the material near the end-plates. The rate of necking in the column is a sensitive function of the extensional viscosity predicted by the constitutive model, in particular the magnitude and the rate of strain-hardening that occurs during uniaxial elongation. This phenomenon can also be simply and accurately described by an appropriate set of coupled one-dimensional thin filament equations that use the finite element computations to provide a suitable initial condition for the axial distribution of the polymeric stresses in the filament.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Mechanical stretch {{has been}} shown to induce {{vascular}} remodeling and increase vessel density, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms and the morphologic changes induced by tensile forces to dermal vessels are poorly understood. METHODS:: A custom computer-controlled <b>stretch</b> <b>device</b> was designed and applied to the backs of C 57 BL/ 6 mice (n = 38). Dermal and vascular remodeling was studied over a 7 -day period. Corrosion casting and three-dimensional scanning electron microscopy and CD 31 staining were performed to analyze microvessel morphology. Hypoxia was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mRNA expression of VEGF receptors was performed. RESULTS:: Skin stretching was associated with increased angiogenesis as demonstrated by CD 31 staining and vessel corrosion casting where intervascular distance and vessel diameter were decreased (p < 0. 01). Immediately after stretching, VEGF dimers were increased. Messenger RNA expression of VEGF receptor 1, VEGF receptor 2, neuropilin 1, and neuropilin 2 was increased starting as early as 2 hours after stretching. Highly proliferating epidermal cells induced epidermal hypoxia starting at day 3 (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS:: Identification of significant hypoxic cells occurred after identification of neovessels, suggesting an alternative mechanism. Increased expression of angiogenic receptors and stabilization of VEGF dimers may be involved in a mechanotransductive, prehypoxic induction of neovascularization...|$|R
40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} disk (IVD) {{is a major}} {{pathological process}} implicated in low back pain and is a prerequisite to disk herniation. Although mechanical stress is an important modulator of the degeneration, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The association of human IVD degeneration, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, with annulus fibrosus cell apoptosis and anti-cytochrome c staining revealed that the activation of the mitochondria-dependent apoptosome was a major event in the degeneration process. Mouse models of IVD degeneration were used to investigate {{the role of the}} mechanical stress in this process. The application of mechanical overload (1. 3 MPa) for 24 hours induced annulus fibrosus cell apoptosis and led to severe degeneration of the mouse disks. Immunostaining revealed cytochrome c release but not Fas-L generation. The role of the caspase- 9 -dependent mitochondrial pathway in annulus fibrosus cell apoptosis induced by overload was investigated further with the use of cultured rabbit IVD cells in a <b>stretch</b> <b>device.</b> Mechanical overload (15 % area change) induced apoptosis with increased caspase- 9 activity and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, Z-LEHD-FMK, a caspase- 9 inhibitor, but not Z-IETD-FMK, a caspase- 8 inhibitor, attenuated the overload-induced apoptosis. Our results from human samples, mouse models, and annulus fibrosus culture experiments demonstrate that the mechanical overload-induced IVD degeneration is mediated through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in IVD cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{lymphatic system}} plays an {{important}} role in fluid and protein balance within the interstitial spaces. Its dysfunction could result in a number of debilitating diseases, namely lymphedema. Lymphatic vessels utilize both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to pump lymph. Intrinsic pumping involves the active contraction of vessels, a phenomenon that is regulated in part by nitric oxide (NO) produced by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). NO production by arterial endothelial cells has been shown to be sensitive to both shear stress and stretch. Therefore, because of the unique mechanical environment of the LECs, we hypothesize that mechanical forces play an important role in regulation of the lymphatic pumping. Parallel-plate flow chambers and indenter-based cyclic <b>stretch</b> <b>devices</b> were constructed and used to apply mechanical loads to LECs. In addition, high-throughput micro-scale channels were developed and tested for shear experiments to address the need to increase the productivity and high- resolution imaging. Twenty-four hours treatment of LECs with different shear stress conditions showed a shear-dependent elevation in NO production. Moreover, 2. 5 folds increase in cumulative NO was observed for stretched cells compared to the unstretched cells over six hours period. In conclusion, the upregulation observed in NO production under mechanical stimuli suggest new regulatory mechanisms that can be pharmaceutically targeted. These results provide an unprecedented insight into lymphatic pumping mechanism...|$|R
