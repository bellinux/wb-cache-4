The content of fat, dry matter, non-fat dry matter, lactic acid, pH and viscosity of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> were determined on the 0, 7 th, 14 th and the 21 st day of storage of the product at the temperature of 4 °C. Considerable change in viscosity of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> (p < 0, 05) throughout the maintenance period was determined on the 0 and the 21 st day for both yoghurts. The viscosity of the <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> from producer A was increased from 0, 324 Pa s on the 0 day to 1, 912 Pa s on the 21 st day. At the same time the viscosity of the <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> from producer B was increased from 0, 208 Pa s on the 0 day to 0, 883 Pa s on the 21 st day.

40|$|Amylomaltase-treated starch (ATS) {{has been}} {{described}} as an excellent fat-replacer in set yoghurt. Its functionality as a creaminess enhancer relates to the ability to form domains, which have melting and yielding characteristics in the mouth. This study was intended to understand the functionality of ATS in <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> Sensory evaluation of reduced fat <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> samples showed that the creaminess perception of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> with 1. 5 % fat and 0. 5 % ATS was comparable with the reference full fat yoghurt containing 3 % fat. This showed that ATS was even more effective as a creaminess enhancer in <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> than in set yoghurt. This was related to the higher effectiveness of domain formation during storage after cooling in a dispersed system, as a result of stirring of the yoghurt gel, compared with a gelled set-yoghurt system...|$|E

40|$|Altering the casein: whey protein ratio (CN:WP) is an {{important}} determinant {{of the quality of}} yoghurt. In this study, the textural, rheological, microstructural and volatile aroma compound release properties of non-fat <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurts</b> with varying CN: WP were compared. Yoghurts were manufactured using different fortifiers (whey protein isolate, sodium caseinate, low-heat skim milk powder) to achieve varying CN: WP at total protein levels of 4, 4. 5 and 5 %. At all protein levels, yoghurts with lower CN: WP were firmer and stiffer than those with higher CN: WP. Yield stress of gels increased when the CN: WP deviated from the unfortified CN: WP, 3. 2 : 1. Samples with low CN: WP also had a more elastic gel at 4. 5 and 5 % total protein. Alteration of CN: WP did not significantly alter volatile aroma compound release from yoghurts. The results demonstrate that CN: WP, and not only total protein or total solids, is an essential consideration when formulating non-fat <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurts</b> with acceptable qualities.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on aromatised fat-free <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurts</b> and dealt with the influence of some thickeners andsweeteners on aroma compounds release and rheology. Thickeners (starch, pectin, locust bean gum and guar) and sweeteners (fructose, fructo-oligosaccahrides, aspartame andacesulfame) were added and mixed together in fruit preparations, which were then introduced in yoghurt. Different concentrationsof thickeners and sweeteners {{were used in the}} fruit preparations and were obtained with an experimental design. The headspacecomposition was assessed by solid-phase microextraction during shear conditions in a closed vessel. Rheological properties ofyoghurts were determined to obtain the flow behaviour index n and the consistency index K with the Ostwald law. The presence of pectin in yoghurts, tended to reduce the concentration of aroma compounds in the headspace of the samples. Weobserved also a significant decrease of aroma compounds in the headspace of yoghurt in the presence of starch. In the case of locustbean gum, a significant increase of flavour release was observed. Sweeteners and guar appeared to have no effect. We concluded thatrheological parameters did not explain the difference on aroma release and it seemed that during shear conditions, the compositionof fruit preparations showed a major role on aroma release.

40|$|Dispersion of aroma {{compounds}} in food matrices {{is a common}} process {{in the production of}} many food products. However, the degrees of dispersion on the distribution and subsequent release of these compounds during consumption may have considerable consequences for perception of these flavours. This thesis investigates the effects of a range of dispersion techniques on the delivery and release of aroma compounds from several solid and semi-solid matrices which commonly contain added flavourings. Dispersion was achieved on three main scales ranging from molecular, through micro regions to physical separation or layering. The effects of different levels of mixing were assessed by measuring aroma release in vitro and in vivo via APci-MS. Having defined the stages of mixing, systems were developed to measure the influences of different dispersion techniques on aroma delivery. Layering to physically separate homogenous aroma-rich layers showed no significant effects on aroma release or perception from gelatine sucrose gels. It seems that mastication is very effective in re-mixing these systems and, in vivo there is no difference in aroma release. Although the degree of mixing could be controlled using a static mixer system for yoghurts, no effects of the different levels of mixing were observed on aroma release. <b>Stirred</b> <b>yoghurts</b> showed that mixing could influence equilibrium headspace concentrations but overall release in vivo was inconclusive. Sample selection in these systems may be important for influencing perception. Visual and textural cues may be more important for perception, in these mixing examples, than aroma release. Using co-solvents as dispersion agents significantly increased the ease of dispersion of a range of aroma compounds. Static headspace analysis confirmed that all the carrier solvents influenced the partition of aroma compounds and in vivo release from model confectionery systems. Increasing solvent concentration increased the solubility of a range of aroma {{compounds in}} the liquid phase. Release from gels was also influenced by the presence of solvents with hydrophobic aroma compounds showing patterns of release similar to those of hydrophilic compounds when dispersed using solvents. Finally, this work studied release from phase separated systems where the aroma compound was present as a microdroplet. Release was very intense and rapid and was investigated in aqueous solutions and gelatine-sucrose gels. In this case the release mechanism was not the conventional air-liquid partition but was based on direct release from the air-liquid interface. Release was dependent on both hydrophobicity and vapour pressure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Das Flavoenzym Cellobiose Dehydrogenase (CDH) stammt aus holzzersetzenden Ascomyce-ten und Basidomyceten und findet vor allem in biotechnologischen Bereichen Verwendung. Da die Erzeugung in Pilzen sehr komplex, mit einem hohen Aufwand, sowie mit enormen Kosten verbunden ist, wurde die Hefe Pichia pastoris als Expressionssystem gewählt. Das Enzym wird vorwiegend in der Analytik als Biosensor beispielsweise für die Quantifizierung von Laktose oder anderen Sacchariden eingesetzt. In der pharmazeutischen-, sowie in der Lebensmittelindustrie besteht ein starkes Interesse an der Laktobionsäure, die mittels der CDH produziert werden kann. Bei der Umsetzung aus Laktose wird das Enzym als Biokatalysator eingesetzt. Laktobionsäure hat einen mild-sauren Geschmack und wird in verschiedenen Medizinprodukten eingesetzt. CDH vom Organismus Aspergillus oryzae Klasse II und Klasse III wurden erstmals im Rahmen dieser Masterarbeit produziert, gereinigt und charakterisiert. Mit der CDH Klasse III wurde ein Substratscreening durchgeführt, um heraus zu finden mit welchem Substrat dieses Enzym aktiv ist. Um die besten Bedingungen der gereinigten CDH Klasse II zu bestimmen, wurden ein pH- Wert-, sowie ein Temperaturprofil erstellt. Weiters wurden mittels DCIP und cyt c Messungen kinetische Bestimmungen für Maltose, Laktose, Cellobiose und Glucose durchgeführt. Ein weiteres Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, eine Variante des Organismus Myriococcum thermo-philum mit Mutationen an den Positionen N 700 und N 784 zu produzieren. Dieses Enzym wurde gewählt, da es eine erhöhte O 2 Aktivität hat und somit die H 2 O 2 Produktion optimie-ren kann. Die Oxidation von Laktose zu Laktobionsäure durch den Einsatz dieser MtCDH wur-de charakterisiert. Es wurde auch getestet, ob eine Produktion von Maltobionsäure, Cellobi-onsäure und Gluconsäure mithilfe dieses Enzyms möglich ist. Ein weiteres Ziel war es, das rekombinante Enzym für die Produktion von bakterienfreiem Joghurt einzusetzen. Zur Charakterisierung wurde ein Synärese Test durchgeführt, um die Textur mit einem konventionellen gerührten und einem gesetzten Joghurt zu vergleichen. Es ist gelungen A. oryzae Klasse II und Klasse III zu produzieren. Auf die Ergebnisse der Cha-rakterisierung der Klasse II wird in dieser Arbeit ausführlich eingegangen. Für die Klasse III wurde im Substratscreening kein Substrat gefunden, welches mit diesem Enzym aktiv ist. Es wäre interessant ein anderes Expressionssystem oder eine Klasse III von einem anderen Pilz zu verwenden. Analysen während der Umsetzung von Laktose zu Laktobionsäure haben gezeigt, dass die MtCDH aktiv war und dass die Konzentration der Laktose gesunken ist, währenddessen ist aber ist die Konzentration von Laktobionsäure angestiegen. Vergleichbare Ergebnisse konn-ten bei der Umsetzung von Cellobiose zu Cellobionsäure erzielt werden. Weitere Experimente für die Produktion von Maltobionsäure und Gluconsäure wären von wissenschaftlichem Interesse. Es ist gelungen während der Umsetzung von Laktose aus Kuhmilch zu Laktobionsäure mithil-fe des Biokatalysator MtCDH enzymatisches Joghurt zu produzieren. The {{fungal enzyme}} {{cellobiose}} dehydrogenase (CDH) is a monomeric oxidoreductase, {{consisting of two}} domains connected by a flexible linker which is found in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. CDH from different producers shows differences with respect to substrate specificity, pH-, and temperature optima. There is a high scientific interest in CDH because this enzyme has a wide spread field of application in the analytic area {{as well as in}} the industry. As CDH can be applied in food science, the production of lactobionic acid is of high importance for industrial applications. The production of CDH by fungi is very complex and expensive. Therefore the yeast Pichia Pastoris X 33 was selected as expression system. The yeast species Pichia pastoris is frequently used as an expression system for recombinant protein production and is suitable for the production in shake flasks or in fermenters. One class III CDH gene of Aspergillus oryzae was selected for recombinant production. This is the first time that a class III CDH was produced successfully. In this project the production process in shaking flasks and the purification of the enzyme is described in detail. Purification was done by Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography and Anion Exchange Chromatography. After chromatography process a total protein yield of 6. 91 mg was measured by Bradford assay. With the purified A. oryzae CDH III a substrate screening with cyt c and DCIP assay containing different mono-, di-, tri- and polysaccharides, alcohols and amino acids was done. There was no substrate, which showed any activity with the class III CDH. To compare the characteristics of class III CDH with class II, a class II CDH from A. oryzae was expressed and characterized. This enzyme was also produced in shaking flasks and purified with Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography and Anion Exchange Chromatography. 3. 20 mg of pure A. oryzae CDH II was produced successfully. To compare this enzyme with CDH from other organisms some characteristics were assessed. Kinetic measurements with this enzyme show that the most effective electron donor for A. oryzae CDH II is cellobiose. The optimal pH for this enzyme is at pH 5. 0 for cyt c and for DCIP and the enzyme is best stable at 55 °C. In general, CDH shows low activity with oxygen as electron acceptors and this hampers the in situ production of H 2 O 2. In this work also describes the production process of Myriococcum thermophilum CDH with mutations at positions N 700 and N 748. This MtCDH variant was chosen because it has increased oxygen reactivity and thereby improves the hydrogen peroxide production. After the production in a fermenter, the purification was done by Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography and Anion Exchange Chromatography. After purification a total protein yield of 10. 7 mg was measured. Furthermore, an efficient enzymatic bioprocess is described in which lactose converted into lactobionic acid by MtCDH without the formation of any by products in the bioreactor Sixfors. The conversion of lactose to lactobionic acid consists of the oxidation of the free aldehyde group of glucose on the lactose molecule to the carboxyl group. 15. 78 g of lactobionic acid were produced successfully. The oxidation of cellobiose, maltose and glucose by this CDH variant was also performed in the bioreacter system Sixfors. HPLC data show that the converting process of cellobiose into cellobionic acid worked successfully. Further experiments should optimize the production process of gluconic acid and maltobionic acid. In a further experiment the recombinant MtCDH was used to produce bacteria free yoghurt. Mainly Streptococcus thermophiles and Lactobacillus bulgaricus are used as starter culture in conventionally yoghurt manufacture. The advantage of enzymatic yoghurt is that patients who are immunosuppressive could benefit from yoghurt which is produced with this MtCDH variant. The MtCDH catalysed oxidation of lactose in milk was performed by using the bioreacter system Sixfors. HPLC analyses have shown that lactose decreased during the production process. In the meantime the concentration of lactobionic acid increased. The product was stored for one week at 4 °C and during that time the texture became firmer. Texture is one of the most essential components of yoghurt quality. Therefore a syneresis test was done to compare the texture of a stirred-, set- and enzymatic yoghurt. Syneresis is an extraction of a liquid from a gel. During the syneresis process whey is collecting on the surface of the yoghurt. The texture from the enzymatic yoghurt is comparable with the <b>stirred</b> and set <b>yoghurt</b> but it is not proven yet whether the yoghurt is mutagenic in humans because a recombinant enzyme was used for the production. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physical characteristics of set and stirred yoghurts made at 9 % (w/w) total solids with various casein (CN) -to-whey protein (WP) ratios and with exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing starter cultures (capsular or ropy) during storage. The yoghurt was evaluated for composition, firmness and syneresis of set yoghurt, and for the flow curve and the area of hysteresis loop between the upward and downward curve of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> Viable counts of starter bacteria and concentrations of lactic acid and EPS in the yoghurt were also determined. EPS concentration did not decrease during storage for 28 d. Firmness and syneresis of set yoghurt decreased when the CN-to-WP ratio was reduced from ratio 4 : 1 to 1 : 1 and when EPS starter cultures (especially ropy EPS) were used. <b>Stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> with a CN-to-WP ratio of 3 : 1 and made using ropy EPS-producing starter cultures had a higher shear stress and hysteresis loop area than yoghurt made using capsular EPS- or non-EPS-producing starter cultures. The results suggested that the physical characteristics of set and stirred yoghurts can be improved by varying CN-to-WP ratio and {{by the use of}} EPS-producing starter cultures. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{numerical}} investigation {{was conducted in}} order to obtain correlations for the determination of convective heat transfer coefficients of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> during the cooling stage in a plate heat exchanger, taking into account its rheological features. The main simplification in the simulation method was the assumption of bi-dimensional flow in a flat plate geometry. By combining the resulting theoretical equations for a flat geometry with the geometric parameters usually defined for corrugated parameters (aspect ratio, hydraulic diameter), correlations for the convective coefficients were obtained that compare well to the experimental ones. This simplified and much faster simulation methodology proved to be appropriate for highly viscous, low Reynolds number flow situations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{simulations}} of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> processing in a {{plate heat exchanger}} were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and the results compared with experimental data, showing a very good agreement. A Herschel–Bulkley model for the viscosity and an Arrhenius-type term for the temperature dependence were used to model the thermo-rheological behaviour of yoghurt. The heat exchanger {{used in this study}} operates in a parallel arrangement, thus simplifying the problem to the construction of a single complete 3 D channel. After analysis of the velocity field and fanning friction factors, laminar flow was observed for all the operating conditions used and relations are proposed for the present heat exchanger between fanning factors and Reynolds number and between mean shear rate and mean velocity of yoghurt...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acai pulp {{addition}} and different probiotic bacteria on the fatty acid profile of <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> were examined. Skim milk {{was divided into}} two groups: one containing acai pulp and another without the fruit. Batches were inoculated with yoghurt starter culture and divided into five groups according to probiotic addition. Counts of viable microorganisms were measured at days 1, 14 and 28 of cold storage. Fatty acid profile was determined by gas chromatography at day 1. Acai pulp favoured an increase in Lactobacillus acidophilus L 10, Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bl 04 and Bifidobacterium longum Bl 05 counts {{at the end of}} 4 weeks of cold storage. This study demonstrated that acai pulp addition increased monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents in probiotic yoghurt and enhanced the production of cc-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acids during fermentation of skim milk prepared with B. animalis ssp. lactis Bl 04 and B 94 strains.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} the nature of bonds established between protein particles after stirring that are responsible for the texture improvement of stirred yoghurts, called rebodying. Using a constant model yoghurt at pH 4 · 4, the effects of changes in the physicochemical conditions at stirring were studied on the subsequent rebodying. Short term rebodying was measured as the changes in viscoelastic properties at 4 °C during 20 h after stirring, while long-term rebodying was measured as the viscosity changes during 28 d storage at 4 °C. Moreover, stirred gels obtained from either set gels that were allowed time or not for ionic equilibration were compared. Increasing or decreasing ionic strength did not change the properties of stirred gels. Calcium chloride addition significantly decreased G′ 0 h, G′ 20 h and tan 20 h but did not induce changes in the gel microstructure as observed by confocal scanning microscopy. Yoghurt rebodying could not be explained by fulfilling ionic equilibrium. Moreover, N-ethyl maleimide addition had no effect on the <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> Attractive electrostatic and disulphide interactions were not involved in the gel rebodying and increasing calcium concentration in the set gel limited rebodying...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) heating {{was applied}} to <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> after culturing {{in order to enhance}} the shelf-life and thereby meet industrial demands in countries where the distribution cold chain cannot be implicitly guaranteed. In parallel, a convectional (CV) heating process was also tested. In order to meet consumers’ expectations with regard to texture and sensory properties, the yoghurts were heated to different temperatures (58, 65 and 72 °C). This second part of our feasibility study focused on the changes in microstructure and texture caused by post-fermentative heat treatment. It was shown that there were always microstructural changes with additional heat treatment. Compared to the dense and compact casein network in the stirred reference yoghurt, network contractions and further protein aggregation were observed after heat treatment, {{while at the same time}} larger pore geometries were detected. The changes in microstructure as well as other physical and sensorial texture properties (syneresis, hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, apparent viscosity, G’, G’’, homogeneity) were in good agreement with the temperature and time of the heat treatment (thermal stress). The RF heated products were found to be very similar to the stirred reference yoghurt, showing potential for further industrial development such as novel heating strategies to obtain products with prolonged shelf-life...|$|E
40|$|This {{first part}} of a two-part study focuses on the {{technical}} feasibility of applying radio frequency (RF) heating at different temperatures (58, 65 and 72 °C) to a <b>stirred</b> <b>yoghurt</b> gel after culturing. For comparison, a convectional (CV) heating process was also applied. The aim was to increase the yoghurt shelf-life, by preventing post-acidification {{and the growth of}} yeasts and molds. At the same time, the viability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was investigated in view of existing legal regulations for yoghurts. Additionally, the yoghurt color, aroma and taste profiles were evaluated. It was found that the application of RF heating was effective for the rapid attainment of homogenous temperatures of 58 and 65 °C, respectively. For RF heating at 72 °C, {{it was not possible to}} establish a stable heating regime, since in some cases, there was significant overheating followed by strong contraction of the yoghurt curd and whey separation. Hence, it was decided not to continue with the RF heating series at 72 °C. In the case of CV heating, heat transfer limitations were observed, and prolonged heating was required. Nevertheless, we showed that yeasts and molds survived neither the RF nor CV heat treatment. LAB were found not to survive the CV treatment, but these beneficial microorganisms were still present in reduced numbers after RF heating to 58 and 65 °C. This important observation is most likely related to the mildness of RF treatment. While post-acidification was not observed on yoghurt storage, slight color changes occurred after heat treatment. The flavor and taste profiles were shown to be similar to the reference product. Furthermore, a trained sensory panel was not able to distinguish between, for example, the reference yoghurt and the RF 65 °C sample by triangular testing (α = 5 %), showing the potential of novel strategies for further improvements of heat-treated yoghurt...|$|E
