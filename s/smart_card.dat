40|$|This paper conducts an {{analysis}} of dependability of <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> for biometric authentication. Dependability {{is an important factor}} for evaluating social infrastructure systems, and suitable formalizations of dependability are required from various aspects. This paper formalizes a kind of dependability of <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> for biometric authentication on the basis of leakage of confidential information. As an example of evaluation based on the formalization of dependability, this paper examines the effects of preventing leakage of biometric information from <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> on accuracy of authentication with practical palmprint images. This evaluation gives a trade-off between dependability of <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> and efficiency of the application system of <b>smart</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the United States, when a {{consumer}} presents a payment to a merchant, the merchant typically makes {{a request for}} authorization before accepting the payment. Personal information, such as an account number, address, or telephone number, are often enough to initiate a payment. A serious weakness of this system is that criminals who obtain the correct personal information can impersonate an honest consumer and commit payments fraud.; A key to improving security-and reducing payments fraud-might be payment <b>smart</b> <b>cards.</b> Payment <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> have an embedded computer chip that encrypts messages to aid authorization. If properly configured, payment <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> could provide direct benefits to consumers, merchants, banks, and others. These groups would be less vulnerable {{to the effects of}} fraud and the cost of fraud prevention would fall. <b>Smart</b> <b>cards</b> could also provide indirect benefits to society by allowing a more efficient payment system. <b>Smart</b> <b>cards</b> have already been adopted in other countries, allowing a more secure payments process and a more efficient payments system.; Sullivan explores why <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> have the potential to provide strong payment authorization and thus put a substantial dent into the problems of payments fraud and identity theft. But adopting <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> in the United States faces some significant challenges. First, the industry must adopt payment <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> and their new security standards. Second, card issuers and others in the payments industry must agree on the specific forms of security protocols used in <b>smart</b> <b>cards.</b> In both steps the industry must overcome market incentives that can impede the adoption of payment <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> or limit the strength of their security. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{regional}} ORCA {{card was}} introduced as an integrated <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> for transit {{agencies in the}} Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e-purse web interface. The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the e-purse or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010 a $5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or youth ORCA card. CT removed their paper transfers on January 1, 2010 after the ORCA card made them obsolete.|$|E

5|$|There {{are over}} two dozen public transit {{agencies}} in the Bay Area with overlapping service areas that utilize different modes, with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable contactless <b>smart</b> <b>card,</b> as a universal electronic payment system.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> {{for single}} or return journeys {{may also be}} purchased at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E
