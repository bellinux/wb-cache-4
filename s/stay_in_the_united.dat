5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 {{that he was}} going to join the filibuster with William Walker, who had seized control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Arular, the debut album by M.I.A., {{took place during}} 2003 and 2004, and the album was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} September 2004. Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release, however, first to December and then into 2005. During the recording process, M.I.A. met DJ Diplo, and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album. Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless, Diplo conceived the idea of using the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full-length album. M.I.A. extended her <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio.|$|E
5|$|It {{is alleged}} that Amin became radicalised during his second <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in 1962, when he {{enrolled}} in a work-study group at the University of Wisconsin. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the Columbia University Teachers College, but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head of the Afghan students' association at the college. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend Ali Ahmad Popel, a previous Afghan Minister of Education. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised. Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather West Germany and Lebanon. By {{the time he had}} returned to Afghanistan, the Communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran as a candidate for the PDPA in the 1965 parliamentary election, and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar {{had a great}} showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 {{a minivan}} {{collided}} with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 {{it was reported that}} he was nearly recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings.|$|E

50|$|The 50th (Holding) Battalion, {{which was}} formed on the Isle of Wight in June 1940, absorbed the Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey.

25|$|Most of Gibraltar's Jews {{evacuated}} to the United Kingdom {{during the}} Second World War, when the Allies used Gibraltar {{as a base}} of operations. Some Jews opted to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, but most returned, {{although there was a}} slackening in some of their religious practices. The efforts of the Spanish sephardic Italian born Rabbi Josef Pacifici, who assumed the Gibraltar rabbinate and took control of Jewish education in Gibraltar, helped reverse this tendency. In 1984 Rabbi Ron Hassid became Chief Rabbi.|$|E
25|$|He would split {{his time}} between the Eastern coast of the United States and Havana in 1947, {{a year in which}} he went 11-1-1 with 3 knockouts.

That year, he met some very {{important}} fighters, like former world champion Ike Williams, who beat him by decision in ten, Tommy Bell, against whom Gavilan won by decision, Sugar Ray Robinson, who beat him by decision in ten, and Tony Pellone, with Gavilan obtaining a decision against Pellone.|$|E
25|$|While at the Royal Ethnological Museum Boas became {{interested}} in the Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest, and after defending his habilitation thesis, he left for a three-month trip to British Columbia via New York. In January1887, he was offered a job as assistant editor of the journal Science. Alienated by growing antisemitism and nationalism as well as the very limited academic opportunities for a geographer in Germany, Boas decided to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Possibly he received additional motivation for this decision from his romance with Marie Krackowizer, whom he married in the same year.|$|E

25|$|The {{press in}} Russia {{has offered a}} number of {{alternatives}} to Litvinenko's demise. As one example, Russian state television has taken the view that if Litvinenko knew any important secrets, he would already have made them public during his six-year-long <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. According to this view, {{he was not an}} important person and not worth a loud political scandal. Also a suspicious simultaneousness between the deaths of the so-called oppositionals and big international summits with Russian participation was noted, along with the question who could be interested in worsening Russia's and Putin's image in front of them.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{officials}} {{connected with}} the United Nations arrived in the 1950s and businesspeople associated with Japanese companies began arriving in the late 1950s.

By 1988 there were 50,000 Japanese businesspersons working in Greater New York City, with 77% of them being temporary employees with plans to return to Japan. At that time employees of Japanese companies and their families were over 80% of the Japanese residents of the New York City area.

25|$|Kahlo and Rivera {{returned}} to New York in March 1933, {{as he had}} been commissioned to paint a mural for the Rockefeller Center.

In May, Rivera was fired from the Rockefeller Center project amid an international scandal, as he had included Vladimir Lenin in the mural and refused to change it. He was instead hired to paint a mural for the New Workers School. Although Rivera wished to continue their <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, Kahlo was homesick, and they {{returned to}} Mexico soon after the mural's unveiling in December 1933.|$|E

25|$|As a young girl, Aquino {{spent her}} {{elementary}} school days at St. Scholastica's College in Manila, where she graduated {{on top of}} her class as valedictorian. She transferred to Assumption Convent to pursue high school studies. Afterwards, she and her family went to the United States and attended the Assumption-run Ravenhill Academy in Philadelphia. In 1949, she graduated from Notre Dame Convent School in New York. She then pursued her college education in the U.S. graduating from the College of Mount Saint Vincent in 1953 in New York, with a major in French and minor in mathematics. During her <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, Aquino volunteered for the campaign of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey against then Democratic U.S. President Harry S. Truman during the 1948 U.S. Presidential Election.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{despite her}} initial opposition, Aquino {{decided to run}} in the 1978 Batasang Pambansa elections. A {{reluctant}} speaker, Corazon Aquino campaigned on behalf of her husband, {{and for the first time}} in her life delivered a political speech. In 1980, upon the intervention of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family to leave for exile in the United States, where he sought medical treatment. The family settled in Boston, and Aquino would later call the next three years as the happiest days of her marriage and family life. On August 21, 1983, however, Ninoy ended his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and returned without his family to the Philippines, only to be assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of the Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport or NAIA), which was later renamed in his honor (see Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.). Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later and led her husband's funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} misconception, a U.S. visa does not authorize the alien's entry to the United States, nor does it authorize the alien's stay in the U.S. in a {{particular}} status. A U.S. visa only serves as a preliminary permission given to the alien {{to travel to the}} United States and to seek admission to the United States at a designated port of entry. The final admission to the United States in a particular status and for a particular period of time is made at the port of entry by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. For aliens entering the U.S. in a nonimmigrant visa status these details are recorded by the CBP officer on the alien's Form I-94 (Form I-94W for citizens of the Visa Waiver Program countries entering the U.S. for short visits), which serves as the official document authorizing the alien's <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in a particular non-immigrant visa status and for a particular period of time. 50,000 additional visas are available each year under the visa lottery program.
