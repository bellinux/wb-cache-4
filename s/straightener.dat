25|$|In 1912 Eiffel's {{laboratory}} {{was moved}} to Auteuil, a suburb of Paris, where his wind tunnel with a 2-metre test section is still operational today. Eiffel significantly improved {{the efficiency of the}} open-return wind tunnel by enclosing the test section in a chamber, designing a flared inlet with a honeycomb flow <b>straightener</b> and adding a diffuser between the test section and the fan located at the downstream end of the diffuser; this was an arrangement followed by a number of wind tunnels later built; in fact the open-return low speed wind tunnel is often called the Eiffel-type wind tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Straightening irons, <b>straighteners,</b> or flat irons work by {{breaking}} down the positive hydrogen bonds found in the hair's cortex, which cause hair to open, bend and become curly. Once the bonds are broken, hair is prevented from holding its original, natural form, though the hydrogen bonds can re-form if exposed to moisture. Straightening irons use mainly ceramic material for their plates. Low-end <b>straighteners</b> use a single layer of ceramic coating on the plates, whereas high-end <b>straighteners</b> use multiple layers or even 100% ceramic material. Some straightening irons are fitted with an automatic shut off feature to prevent fire accidents.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The U-type Pulse Tube Cryocooler (PTC) {{involves}} {{a change in}} the direction of gas flow as it proceeds from the regenerator to the pulse tube. The sharp U-bend has an adverse effect on pulse tube cooling action due to formation of eddies and undesirable mixing in the cold end of the pulse tube. The present work deals with experimentation and CFD modeling related to U-type PTCs. Two cases of ‘U’ bends have been studied; gradual ‘U’ bends and sharp ‘U’ bends. Experimentation has been carried out using copper screens of 100 -mesh size as flow <b>straighteners.</b> The optimum performance in terms of low temperature for the case of a gradual U bend was achieved with a stack of 18 flow-straightener screens. The no-load temperature for this case of a gradual ‘U’ bend, with and without flow <b>straighteners,</b> was 57. 7 K and 88. 8 K, respectively, for a charging pressure of 16 bar. When the gradual 180 degree bend at the cold end was replaced by a sharp U bend, the no load temperature increased from 88. 8 K to 137 K without flow <b>straighteners.</b> In order to understand the role of flow <b>straighteners</b> in PTC, a CFD model was developed in FLUENT. The flow <b>straighteners</b> are modeled as a homogeneous porous medium. The results show that the flow <b>straighteners</b> significantly affect velocity patterns in the pulse tube. The theoretical study showed that there exists an optimum number of flow <b>straighteners</b> which improve the cooling power and efficiency of the pulse tube cryocooler. This was in agreement with the experimental results obtained earlier...|$|R

25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a <b>straightener</b> to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E

40|$|Coaxial and U-shaped Pulse Tube Cryocoolers {{involve a}} change in the {{direction}} of the flow as it proceeds from the regenerator through the cold heat exchanger to the (buffer) pulse tube. This rather sharp U-turn in the flow causes non-uniformities over the cross section which may have an adverse effect particularly in the buffer tube, e. g. creating eddies leading to undesirable mixing. Flow <b>straighteners</b> are sometimes introduced to deal with this phenomenon. This study is concerned with a CFD model of the reciprocating flow around a 180 o bend, as appli-cable to U-shaped Pulse Tube Cryocoolers. Cases with and without flow <b>straighteners</b> (FS) have been considered. Special attention is paid to the role of flow <b>straighteners</b> in terms of convective heat loss and pressure loss. It is shown that the flow characteristic in the cold head of the pulse tube cryocooler is critical, and is of greater significance in miniature cryocoolers. The pressure drop in the flow around a sharp bend vs. the one in a straight tube is studied. Both the pressure drop and the convective heat transfer are affected by the Valensi and Reynolds numbers characterizing the reciprocating flow. The CFD software makes it possible to visualize the flow and map out the temperature and velocity fields as they vary in time, as well as to observe local phenomena such as vortices and flow reversal...|$|R
