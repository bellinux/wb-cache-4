50|$|The most {{frequent}} cause {{is running the}} locomotive with too high a level {{of water in the}} boiler and is most apparent when the regulator is opened sharply or steam demand is high. Thus, sensible locomotive management by the operators will help to prevent the occurrence. The phenomenon is particularly evident in areas of impure water, where boiled water creates a foam, or a mist of droplets, filling the space that collects steam {{at the top of the}} boiler, to be drawn down the <b>steam</b> <b>collector</b> pipe in the form of slugs of water. If boiler water is condensed and re-used, any oil or grease must be extracted as this form of contamination is particularly likely to give trouble.|$|E

The whole superheater occupied two-thirds of the total length of the smokebox. To ensure that the superheater tubes received ample heat, a large flue of 10+3/4 in diameter was installed in {{the lower part of the}} boiler between the firebox and the front tube plate, where it connected to the casing of the superheater.|$|E

2500|$|The reactor has two {{independent}} cooling circuits, each having four main circulating pumps (three operating, one standby). The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines {{to a common}} pressure header (one for each cooling circuit), which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the feedwater boils.

The resulting feedwater is led to the steam separators by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|R
5000|$|The {{comparatively}} low {{boiler pressure}} of [...] {{is indicative of}} the opinion held {{at the time that the}} economies to be gained from superheating did not require high boiler pressure. The boiler was equipped with a Schmidt superheater. Steam distribution to the four cylinders was rather unique, being led from the superheater header in the smokebox to a <b>steam</b> <b>collector</b> box which was arranged between the two cylinders of the rear engine unit, from where a branch was led to the cylinders of the front engine unit by a central steam pipe with flexible joints, since this engine unit could move sideways in relation to the boiler barrel.

50|$|Early {{designers}} fitted curved sheets {{below the}} <b>steam</b> <b>collector</b> pipe, {{but these were}} not successful as {{the whole of the}} steam space could contain foam. In districts where the feed water is unsuitable, blowdown valves ("scum valves"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed, are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove precipitated solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the cylinder cocks, which are designed to release trapped water. Once occurring, the problem can affect the level indicated in the boiler's gauge glass and for this reason is difficult to put right without reducing the water level {{to the extent that the}} firebox crown becomes dangerously exposed.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of electricity generation in {{nuclear power plants}} {{is similar to that}} of conventional thermal power plants. The only difference is the heat source. In thermal plants, heat is produced from fossile fuels (coal, gas), generating vast quantities of greenhouse gas, whereas in nuclear power plants, nuclear fuel is used (natural or enriched uranium).In the pressurized water reactors, fuel in the form of fuel assemblies is placed in reactor pressure vessel to which chemically terated water flows. The water flows through channels in the fuel assemblies and removes the heat that is produced during fission reaction. Water coming from the reactor has a temperature of about 297 °C (VVER reactor type); it is then led through the hot arm of the primary piping into heat exchanger - steam generator. In steam generator, water flows through a bunch of pipes and delivers the heat to water from secondary circuit and has a temperature of 222 °C. When cooled down, primary circuit water is led back to reactor core. Secondary circuit water is evaporated in steam generator and the steam is led via <b>steam</b> <b>collector</b> to the blades of a turbine. The turbine shaft turns a generator that generates electric energy.Having delivered its energy to the turbine, steam condensates in condenser, and getting back to water state, it flows back, via heaters, to steam generator. In condenser, the mixture is cooled by a third cooling circuit. In this latter circuit, water is cooled by air flowing from the bottom to the upper part of the cooling tower due to so-called chimney effect. The stream of air takes along water steam and small water droplets, and that is why clouds of steam form above the cooling towers.|$|E

Two benchmark problems concerning hypothetical accident scenarios with leaks in the steam system for a VVER- 440 type reactor and the TMI- 1 PWR have been solved. The first benchmark task has been defined by FZR {{in the frame of}} the international association "Atomic Energy Research" (AER), the second exercise has been organised {{under the auspices of the}} OECD. While in the first benchmark the break of the main <b>steam</b> <b>collector</b> in the sub-critical hot zero power state of the reactor was considered, the break of one of the two main steam lines at full reactor power was assumed in the OECD benchmark. Therefore, in this exercise the mixing of the coolant from the intact and the defect loops had to be considered, while in the AER benchmark the <b>steam</b> <b>collector</b> break causes a homogeneous overcooling of the primary circuit. In the AER benchmark, each participant had to use its own macroscopic cross section libraries. In the OECD benchmark, the cross sections were given in the benchmark definition. The main task of both benchmark problems was to analyse the re-criticality of the scrammed reactor due to the overcooling. For both benchmark problems, a good agreement of the DYN 3 D-ATHLET solution with the results of other codes was achieved. Differences in the time of re-criticality and the height of the power peak between various solutions of the AER benchmark can be explained by the use of different cross section data. Significant differences in the thermohydraulic parameters (coolant temperature, pressure) occurred only at the late stage of the transient during the emergency injection of highly borated water. In the OECD benchmark, a broader scattering of the thermohydraulic results can be observed, while a good agreement between the various 3 D reactor core calculations with given thermohydraulic boundary conditions was achieved. Reasons for the differences in the thermohydraulics were assumed in the difficult modelling of the vertical once-through steam generator with steam superheating. Sensitivity analyses which considered the influence of the nodalisation and the impact of the coolant mixing model were performed for the DYN 3 D-ATHLET solution of the OECD benchmark. The solution of the benchmarks essentially contributed to the qualification of the code complex DYN 3 D-ATHLET as an advanced tool for the accident analysis for both VVER type reactors and Western PWRs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerous WWER- 440 steam {{generators}} showed {{a very serious}} problem of cracking in weld joints which are connecting primary <b>collectors</b> to the <b>steam</b> generator's vessel. As a cause of this cracking was determined stress corrosion cracking mechanism. The weld is connecting austenitic steel collector to the carbon steel vessel, so it is a dissimilar metal weld. There are two approaches how to lower the possibility of stress corrosion cracking in the weld.

The experiments show the particular characteristics of a SJEC with the strong influence of the condenser temperature, Tcond, and evaporator temperature, Tevap, on the coefficient of performance (COP). A decrease in the condenser temperature by 12 °C, in case of an evaporator temperature of Tevap = 7 °C the COP was increased by 57 %, while for Tevap = 13 °C the COP was increased by 41 % and for Tevap = 17 °C the COP was increased by 34. 4 %, respectively. While at a constant condensation temperature an increase in the evaporator temperature, Tevap, from 7 to 13 °C, leads to increased COP values ranging from 14 % to 56. 7 %, and increases Tevap from 7 to 17 °C, lead to increases in COP values ranging from 53 % to 132 %, respectively.

These artifacts are avoided by using a <b>steam</b> jet aerosol <b>collector</b> sampler, based on scavenging of aerosols by droplet formation, in combination with on-line analytical techniques such as ion-chromatography for nitrate and membrane separation followed by conductivity detection for ammonium. The SJAC sampler combines very low blanks with high efficiency of collection of particles.

In addition, inorganic aerosols represent a significant proportion of tropospheric aerosols that have an important impact on human health and the climate system. Currently, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 aerosols are mainly monitored by bulk mass methods. This however gives very little information on the contribution of different aerosol compounds to the total mass and on aerosol sources. In addition, composition data is needed to refine the epidemiological understanding of the aerosol metrics most closely associated with human health impacts. Long term real time measurements of chemically speciated inorganic aerosols and their precursor gases are needed to understand the sources of emissions, and aerosol processes in the atmosphere in order to implement effective emission reduction measures. Furthermore, long-term data sets are necessary to validate national and international chemical transport models, which are used to inform policy. The MARGA (Monitoring instrument for AeRosols and reactive Gases, Applikon Analytical BV, Netherlands) is an instrument that provides long term real time (hourly) measurements of water soluble inorganic aerosols (NH 4 +, NO 3 -, SO 42 -, Cl-) and their gas precursor (NH 3, HNO 3, HNO 2, SO 2, HCl).

In this study, the concentration of organic nitrogen (ON) and major inorganic ions in PM 2. 5 aerosol were measured at the Duke Forest Research Facility near Chapel Hill, NC, during January and June of 2007. A novel on-line instrument was used, which is based on the <b>Steam</b> Jet Aerosol <b>Collector</b> (SJAC) coupled to an on-line total carbon/total nitrogen analyzer and two on-line ion chromatographs. The concentration of ON was determined by tracking the difference in concentrations of total nitrogen and of inorganic nitrogen (determined as the sum of N-ammonium and N-nitrate). The time resolution of the instrument was 30 min with a detection limit for major aerosol components of ~ 0. 1 μg m − 3. Nitrogen in organic compounds contributed ~ 33 % on average to the total nitrogen concentration in PM 2. 5, illustrating the importance of this aerosol component. Absolute concentrations of ON, however, were relatively low (< 1. 0 μg m − 3) with an average of 0. 16 μg m − 3. The absolute and relative contribution of ON to the total aerosol nitrogen budget was practically the same in January and June. In January, the concentration of ON tended to be higher during the night and early morning, while in June it tended to be higher during the late afternoon and evening. Back-trajectories and correlation with wind direction indicate that higher concentrations of ON occur in air masses originating over the continental US, while marine air masses are characterized by lower ON concentrations.
