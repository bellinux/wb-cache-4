25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in title V, and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. Title V allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a <b>Special</b> <b>Agent</b> <b>in</b> charge of a Bureau field office, where previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI were able to certify such requests.|$|E
