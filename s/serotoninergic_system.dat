A TRH test (200 μg i. v.) was performed before and after administration of fenfluramine (FF) 60 mg b. d. for 14 days. In the controls, FF did not modify the expected significant increase in PRL induced by TRH. In obese patients, however, the PRL levels was significantly increased after TRH but the increase was less than in the controls. After FF, the PRL response to TRH was larger than in the pretreatment phase, with values similar to those observed in normal subjects. In neither group FF did change the TSH-stimulating effect of TRH, but the hormonal response in obese patients was greater than in the controls. The restoration of the responsiveness of PRL to TRH after central serotoninergic stimulation confirms the hypothesis that {{a failure of the}} <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>system</b> may occur in human obesity.

The clinical basis of this effect of MDMA is unknown but may relate to its actions on either dopaminergic or <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems</b> in brain. In normal, drug-naive common marmosets, MDMA administration suppressed motor activity and exploratory behavior.

40|$|The spinal serotoninergic {{projection}} {{from the}} raphe magnus {{has been shown}} to modulate nociceptive inputs, and activation of this projection mediates nicotine-elicited analgesia. Here, we investigate the interactions between cholinergic and <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems</b> in the spinal cord, by conducting serotonin [5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) ] efflux experiments on mouse spinal slices. At least three spinal populations of nicotinic receptors are distinguished that affect 5 -HT release. The first could be directly located on serotoninergic terminals, is insensitive to nanomolar concentrations of methyllicaconitine (MLA), and may be subjected to a basal (not maximal) cholinergic tone. The second is tonically and maximally activated by endogenous acetylcholine, insensitive to nanomolar concentrations of MLA, and present on inhibitory neurons. The last is also present on inhibitory neurons but is sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of MLA and not tonically activated by acetylcholine. Multiple nicotinic acetylcholine receptor populations thus differentially exert tonic or not tonic control on 5 -HT transmission in the spinal cord. These receptors may be major targets for nicotine effects on antinociception. In addition, the presence of a tonic nicotinic modulation of 5 -HT release indicates that endogenous acetylcholine plays a role in the physiological regulation of descending 5 -HT pathways to the spinal cord...|$|R

These responses were compared with a CRH test (1 μg/kg) carried out in nine age-matched normal-weight women. Plasma cortisol of obese subjects did not significantly increase after CRH (peak value 127. 1 ± 11. 2 ng/mL v 104. 1 ± 9. 5 ng/mL). This response was lower (P <. 005) than in the controls, in whom the basal cortisol value of 120. 6 ± 11. 8 ng/mL reached a peak value of 221. 2 ± 13. 4 ng/mL. However, after administration of d-FF, CRH significantly increased (P <. 0001) plasma cortisol (peak value 170. 6 ± 18. 0 ng/mL v 111. 5 ± 10. 8 ng/mL) and the response was enhanced (P <. 05) as compared with that obtained before d-FF. The ACTH levels of our patients showed a small increment after CRH injection (peak value 13. 5 ± 1. 7 pg/mL v 9. 6 ± 1. 1 pg/mL), but the hormonal response was lower (P <. 005) than in controls (peak value 38. 1 ± 5. 5 pg/mL v 13. 8 ± 0. 8 pg/mL). However, after d-FF, CRH induced a significant increment (P <. 05) in plasma ACTH at 30 minutes (20. 4 ± 3. 7 pg/mL v 10. 9 ± 0. 9 pg/mL) and 45 minutes (18. 0 ± 2. 6 pg/mL), even though this response was {{not significantly different from}} that observed before d-FF administration.

Settings and Design: The study was carried out at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology between 6 a. m. and 3 p. m. Materials and Methods: ICR mice were subjected to the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) after they had received extract (30 - 300 mg/kg), fluoxetine (3 - 30 mg/kg), desipramine (3 - 30 mg/kg) orally, or water (as vehicle). In a separate experiment, mice were pre-treated with reserpine (1 mg/kg), α-methyl paratyrosine (AMPT; 400 mg/kg), both reserpine (1 mg/kg) and AMPT (200 mg/kg) concomitantly, or p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA; 200 mg/kg) to ascertain {{the role of the}} noradrenergic and <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems</b> in the mode of action of the extract. Statistical analysis used: Means were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls′ post hoc test. P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: In both FST and TST, the extract induced a decline in immobility, indicative of antidepressant-like effect. This diminution in immobility was reversed by pCPA, but not by reserpine and/or AMPT. The extract increased the swimming and climbing scores in the FST, suggestive of possible interaction with <b>serotoninergic</b> and noradrenergic <b>systems.</b> In the TST, the extract produced increases in both curling and swinging scores, suggestive of opioidergic monoaminergic activity, respectively.

Selegiline (0. 25 mgkg(- 1) rat) was administered once every other day for 50 days. Learning parameters were tested through a two-way active avoidance procedure taking place in an Ugo-Basile automated shuttle box device. Enzyme activities and TAS were evaluated spectrophotometrically in brain homogenates of decapitated animals. TAS was significantly lower in aged compared to adult rats and this was reversed by selegiline administration. The decrease of free radical production by selegiline resulted in the stimulation of AChE and (Na(+),K(+)) -ATPase. Mg(2 +) -ATPase activity was not affected by the drug. Selegiline seems to improve the avoidance performance as compared to control groups. It is concluded that: (a) MAO-B inhibition and/or free radical protection on tyrosine hydroxylase by the drug may increase brain catecholamine concentrations resulting possibly in (Na(+),K(+)) -ATPase stimulation; (b) AChE and (Na(+),K(+)) -ATPase activation by the drug could modulate brain cholinergic, catecholaminergic and <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems</b> as well as the neural excitability and metabolic energy production; and (c) selegiline seems to improve the learning performance of aged rats...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with the frontal variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (fv-FTLD), behavioral abnormalities may vary from apathy with motor slowness (apathetic form) to disinhibition with agitation (disinhibited form). These clinical presentations {{may be related to}} specific regional cerebral dysfunction and to deficit in the <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>system.</b> We studied cerebral glucose uptake using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography in 18 patients fulfilling clinical criteria for fv-FTLD and showing, respectively, an apathetic or disinhibited behavioral syndrome. In eight of these patients, we also evaluated the 5 -hydroxytryptamine- 2 A receptor cerebral receptor distribution with [11 C]MDL and positron emission tomography. We found a reduction of frontal glucose metabolism in the whole group of fv-FTLD patients. Apathetic syndrome was associated with a prevalent dorsolateral and frontal medial hypometabolism, whereas the disinhibited syndrome demonstrated a selective hypometabolism in interconnected limbic structures (the cingulate cortex, hippocampus/amygdala, and accumbens nucleus). The in vivo measurements of [11 C]MDL indicated a significant reduction of 5 -hydroxytryptamine- 2 A receptors in orbitofrontal, frontal medial, and cingulate cortices. These 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography changes can be considered as specific functional markers of the different behavioral presentations in fv-FTLD. The <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>system</b> dysfunction provides a rationale for therapeutic trials with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|In current assay the <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>system</b> in newly-born Wistar rats {{underwent}} pharmacological modification by fluoxetine, {{a selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), to investigate its repercussion on testicular parameters in adult animals. Thirty animals were distributed according to treatment: control animals (n = 6), animals treated with 1 mg kg - 1 (n = 6), 5 mg kg - 1 (n = 6), 10 mg kg - 1 (n = 6) and 20 mg kg - 1 (n = 6) of fluoxetine (IP). When 150 days old, {{the animals were}} anesthetized and perfused intra-cardiacally with fixative solution. Testes were routinely processed for inclusion in plastic resin (methacrylate glycol). Further, 4 µm-thick histological sections were stained with toluidine blue/sodium borate 1 % and analyzed histometrically. Pharmacological intervention on the <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>system</b> during the postnatal period of the testes development in Wistar rats with fluoxetine chlorohydrate reduced parameters, such as testicular weight, testis liquid weight and seminiferous tubules diameter. However, testicular parameters, such as daily sperm production (DSP), spermatogenesis efficiency (DSP/g/testis) and cell population in stage VII of adult animals, were not influenced by fluoxetine chlorohydrate usage during neonatal period. Results show that administration of fluoxetine during 21 days after birth may induce adverse changes in the spermatogenesis of adult rats.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>system</b> in the {{regulation}} of apomorphine-induced behavior, a behavior primarily controlled by dopaminergic neurotransmission, was investigated in rats fed on a low tryptophan diet since weaning. It was found that reductions in brain seritonin (5 -HT) produced by diet result in decreased stereotypy after apomorphine administration. This indicates that although stereotyped behavior is primarily mediated by dopaminergic mechanisms, {{it can also be}} modulated by other neurotransmitter including 5 -HT. It was also shown that changes in brain seritonin levels can affect psychomotor stimulant-induced hypothermia...|$|E
40|$|Attention {{problems}} {{form one}} of the core characteristics of Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder. From twin research {{it is clear that}} genes play a considerable role in the etiology and in the stability of ADHD in childhood. Association studies have focused on genes involved in the dopaminergic and <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems,</b> but with inconclusive results. This study investigated the effect of 26 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding for serotonin receptors 2 A (HTR 2 A), Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT), Tryptophane Hydroxylase type 2 (TPH 2), and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Attention problems (AP) were assessed by parental report at ages 3, 7, 10, and 12  years in more than 16, 000 twin pairs. There were 1148 genotyped children with AP data. We developed a longitudinal framework to test the genetic association effect. Based on all phenotypic data, a longitudinal model was formulated with one latent factor loading on all AP measures over time. The broad heritability for the AP latent factor was 82 %, and the latent factor explained around 55 % of the total phenotypic variance. The association of SNPs with AP was then modeled at the level of this factor. N{{one of the}} SNPs showed a significant association with AP. The lowest p-value was found for the rs 6265 SNP in the BDNF gene (p =  0. 035). Overall, our results suggest no evidence for a role of these genes in childhood AP...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCentral {{congenital}} hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a neurorespiratory disease {{characterized by}} life-threatening sleep-related hypoventilation involving an alteration of CO 2 /H+ chemosensitivity. Incidental findings {{have suggested that}} desogestrel may allow recovery of the ventilatory response to CO 2. The effects of desogestrel on resting ventilation have not been reported. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that desogestrel strengthens baseline ventilation by analyzing the ventilation of CCHS patients. Rodent models were used {{in order to determine the}} mechanisms involved. Ventilation in CCHS patients was measured with a pneumotachometer. In mice, ventilatory neural activity was recorded from ex vivo medullary-spinal cord preparations, ventilation was measured by plethysmography and c-fos expression was studied in medullary respiratory nuclei. Desogestrel increased baseline respiratory frequency of CCHS patients leading to a decrease in their PETCO 2. In medullary spinal-cord preparations or in vivo mice, the metabolite of desogestrel, etonogestrel, induced an increase in respiratory frequency that necessitated the functioning of <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems,</b> and modulated GABAA and NMDA ventilatory regulations. c-FOS analysis showed the involvement of medullary respiratory groups of cell including serotoninergic neurons of the raphe pallidus and raphe obscurus nuclei that seem to play a key role. Thus, desogestrel may improve resting ventilation in CCHS patients by a stimulant effect on baseline respiratory frequency. Our data open up clinical perspectives based on the combination of this progestin with serotoninergic drugs to enhance ventilation in CCHS patients...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Concentration of {{dopamine}} and serotonin metabolites (HVA and 5 -HIAA) in the CSF {{was evaluated}} {{before and after}} pharmacological treatment in 19 patients with different neuropsychiatric diseases. In every case a reciprocal modification of the two metabolites occurred after treatment. The result supports the hypothesis of a functional balance between the monoaminergic systems in the central nervous system. Interactions between systems involving different neurotransmitters in the CNS have been indicated by pharmacoclinical, histochemical, and neuro-physiological techniques (Garattini et al., 1978 for review). A close relationship has been established, for example, between the dopaminergic and the chol-inergic system, and their reciprocal connections, both anatomical and functional, explain how an impairment of one system can enhance {{the activity of the}} other (Landinsky et al., 1978). This phenomenon has a relevant clinical application in the treatment of extrapyramidal disorders. Both dopaminergic stimulants and anticholinergic drugs are widely used in Parkinson's disease, whereas in Huntington's chorea, which is commonly regarded as the biochemical counterpart of Parkinsonism, dopamine blocking agents are often successfully employed as well as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Barbeau, 1973). On the other hand, evidence for interaction between the dopaminergic and the <b>serotoninergic</b> <b>systems</b> is unsatisfactory. The two systems display a functional antagonism on common effectors (Hornykiewicz, 1976; Martin et al., 1977), and some neuropharmacological treatments can affect both systems (Pradhan and Bose, 1978). However, the available evidence only suggests that the functional activity of each system may somehow be modified by the other (Green et al., 1976; Hea...|$|R
