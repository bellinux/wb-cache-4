5000|$|Surface grinder, {{which has}} a head that is lowered to a workpiece, which is moved back and forth under the {{grinding}} wheel on a table that typically has a controllable permanent magnet (magnetic chuck) for use with magnetic stock (especially ferrous stock) but can have a vacuum chuck or other fixturing means. The most common <b>surface</b> <b>grinders</b> have a grinding wheel rotating on a horizontal axis cutting around the circumference of the grinding wheel. Rotary <b>surface</b> <b>grinders,</b> commonly known as [...] "Blanchard" [...] style grinders, have a grinding head which rotates the grinding wheel on a vertical axis cutting on the end face of the grinding wheel, while a table rotates the workpiece {{in the opposite direction}} underneath. This type of machine removes large amounts of material and grinds flat surfaces with noted spiral grind marks. It {{can also be used to}} make and sharpen metal stamping die sets, flat shear blades, fixture bases or any flat and parallel surfaces. <b>Surface</b> <b>grinders</b> can be manually operated or have CNC controls.|$|E

50|$|Grinding {{machines}} remove {{material from}} the work piece by abrasion, which can generate substantial amounts of heat. To cool the work piece {{so that it does}} not overheat and go outside its tolerance, grinding machines incorporate a coolant. The coolant also benefits the machinist as the heat generated may cause burns. In high-precision grinding machines (most cylindrical and <b>surface</b> <b>grinders),</b> the final grinding stages are usually set up so that they remove about 200 nm (less than 1/10000 in) per pass - this generates so little heat that even with no coolant, the temperature rise is negligible.|$|E
50|$|In machine-shop terminology, the {{complete}} Digital Read Out system (consisting of a computer, axis-position encoders, and a numeric display) {{is referred to}} by the acronym DRO.

40|$|The general {{error model}} of high {{precision}} <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> is presented by using rigid body kinematics theory and coordinate transformation. To meet the machining requirement of large axisymmetry aspheric lens, the grating parallel grinding method is adopted. Considering high precision <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> {{structure and the}} main error factors affect the machining accuracy of large aspheric, a large axisymmetric aspheric error model is proposed, {{which can be used}} to predict surface accuracy and compensation grinding. The main error factors are discussed and it is shown that the straightness error, positioning error and arc radii error are main errors that effect surface error distribution, meanwhile, surface error value is the mixed result of each individual error. The experiments are carried out and in agreement with the theoretical results. The grinding experiment shows that the model can well predict surface accuracy and surface accuracy is improved after compensation grinding. ? 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R

50|$|Capacitive {{displacement}} sensors {{are often}} used in metrology applications. In many cases, sensors are used “to measure shape errors in the part being produced. But they also can measure the errors arising in the equipment used to manufacture the part, a practice known as machine tool metrology”. In many cases, the sensors are used to analyze and optimize the rotation of spindles in various machine tools, examples include <b>surface</b> <b>grinders,</b> lathes, milling machines, and air bearing spindles. By measuring errors in the machines themselves, rather than simply measuring errors in the final products, problems {{can be dealt with}} and fixed earlier in the manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|The machine {{consists}} of a table that traverses both longitudinally and {{across the face of}} the wheel. The longitudinal feed is usually powered by hydraulics, as may the cross feed, however any mixture of hand, electrical or hydraulic may be used depending on the ultimate usage of the machine (i.e., production, workshop, cost). The grinding wheel rotates in the spindle head and is also adjustable for height, by any of the methods described previously. Modern <b>surface</b> <b>grinders</b> are semi-automated, depth of cut and spark-out may be preset as to the number of passes and, once set up, the machining process requires very little operator intervention.|$|E

Many different instruments have been de-veloped for the measurement of friction and wear. 1 - 5 Often the instrument was de-signed to accommodate some particular type of material, environment, or test con-dition. Studies reported in the dental literature have been limited to wear mea-surements with simulated toothbrushing methods, 6 - 9 or on prosthetic teeth mounted on an articulator. 10 This study will describe the experimental instrumentation for tests under a variety of variables, as well as simulated mouth con-ditions.

50|$|It is also {{possible}} to arrange the weight distribution of the wheels for better balancing. There are several methods of doing this, all being conceptually analogous to tire balancing with wheel weights. Most bench grinders never have these operations performed, because wheel dressing alone is enough to keep them sufficiently balanced, but these additional methods are not unusual for bench grinders and are quite common for machine tools that do grinding, such as <b>surface</b> <b>grinders</b> and cylindrical grinders. This is sometimes achieved by drilling a few holes in the steel flanges that hold the grinding wheels and then finding the angular orientation at which the holes' lack of weight balances out a heavy spot elsewhere on the rotating mass. Another method is a dedicated type of large flange with little weights that can be screwed down wherever needed for balancing (called a balancing flange).|$|E

Being someone who continuously enjoys the outdoors year round, it’s always fun to try new hobbies. The problem with owning a dirt bike is that most people ride during the dryer and warmer seasons of the year. This project would enable the bike to be ridden even during the snowy winter season. Riding a dirt bike in snow has been recently explored by only a few companies. Why not design our own working system? A Honda Cr 250 r dirt bike became the test model and a front mount for a snow ski was designed.

40|$|ELID-grinding of cermets {{has been}} carried out on a {{retrofitted}} Jung <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> with different cast iron-bonded (CIB) diamond wheels. In case of rough grinding, with a wheel of 46 µm abrasives, ELID-grinding is preferable compared to grinding with a conventional resin-bonded wheel or a CIB wheel without ELID. Resin-bonded wheels are characterized by low G-ratios and are prone to chattering effects. Metal-bonded wheels are very durable, and especially for avoiding glazing effects during longer grinding cycles, ELID-grinding is the best choice. The maximal MRR in ‘ELID-roughing’ on the used <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> is measured to be 1 mm³/s, leading to a roughness of about 0. 4 µm Ra. The ‘ELID-finishing’ steps are implemented on the same grinding machine, so the workpiece {{does not need to be}} dismounted. Several sets of experiments based on the Design of Experiments method show that lower axial feeds and higher duty ratios of the power supply improve the surface quality effectively. With the wheel of 10 µm grit size, chattering can be avoided by limiting the theoretical MRR to 0. 05 mm³/s. To obtain a final Sa roughness below 10 nm, the last finishing wheel should remove less than 0. 3 10 - 3 mm³/s. The total processing time of the finishing steps is less than 30 minutes for a workpiece area of 375 mm³. status: publishe...|$|R
