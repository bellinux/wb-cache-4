40|$|Abstract: The paper {{concerns}} diagnostics of <b>servo-drives.</b> The proposed computer-assisted way of {{the feedback}} signals measurements can be applied as a simple and low cost solution useful for inspection and on-line monitoring of the <b>servo-drives</b> motional accuracy and also data collecting for later analysis. Despite {{the fact that the}} feedback devices installed in the <b>servo-drives</b> can be different the square wave signals are commonly used in position and commutation loops as their output signals. This kind of signals can be applied for quite simple in realisation digital measurements of both velocity and position increments. Lack of limitations in the distance and trajectory of the inspected movement as well as possibility to perform and repeat the tests on an operating machine without any interrupting its working process seem to be their valuable features. However, it is necessary to have at disposal quite simple but properly prepared equipment and right software instruments when a manufacturing machine with the <b>servo-drives</b> has to be inspected with different static and dynamic tests by this way.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the product quality improvement in hot rolling mills. The simplest scheme for modeling the rolling process considers the reduction of a strip thickness by passing the hot strip through a preset roll gap between two work rolls. Each rolling stand is driven by a DC motor, which is equipped with a speed controller. Usually the two DC motors are separately controlled; i. e. each servo drive acts only on its motor, by imposing equal set points. An important condition to guarantee for a high product quality is the equalization of the motor torque acting on the two work rolls. Experimental data show that small differences between the angular speeds of the upper and of the lower work rolls lead to sensible differences between the two motor torques, deteriorating the product quality. A combined-control of the upper and lower DC <b>servo-drives</b> reduces the speed fluctuations; different control techniques, - including variable structure PI controllers - are proposed, evaluated and compared by extensive simulation tests...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{increased}} {{requirements for}} dynamic characteristics of hydraulic <b>servo-drives</b> demanded {{the use of}} nonlinear models, {{in addition to the}} linearized mathematical ones. Such models have to take into consideration the physical process features occurring in the hydraulic drive. However, references sometimes mention a discrepancy between the values of real natural frequency of oscillations and the theoretical value of natural oscillation frequency defined by the mathematical model, which takes into account only the standard nonlinearities. To identify reasons of abovementioned divergence the experiments have been conducted to study influence of flow unsteadiness on the auto-oscillation frequency of a hydraulic drive. Modern electrohydraulic throttle-controlled drives are usually equipped with the actuation (control) devices, which have operating speed much higher than that of the power part of a hydraulic drive. This circumstance allows us to use a mechanically controlled hydraulic drive to study the non-stationary characteristics of a spool-type valve. As a result of experiments, it has been found that the fluid flow unsteadiness can be taken into consideration through introducing the auto-oscillations of delay time into calculations. The pilot studied results have a scientific novelty because they for the first time define the influence of the fluid flow unsteadiness in the spool-type valve on dynamics of a hydraulic drive with throttle control. </p...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes a research study in the design, implementation, evaluation and commercialisation of pneumatic motion control systems for modular robots. The research programme was conducted {{as part of a}} collaborative study, sponsored by the Science and Engineering Research Council, between Loughborough University and Martonair (UK) Limited. Microprocessor based motion control strategies have been used to produce low cost pneumatic <b>servo-drives</b> which can be used for 'point-to-point' positioning of payloads. Software based realtime control strategies have evolved which accomplish servo-controlled positioning while compensating for drive system non-linearities and time delays. The application of novel compensation techniques has resulted in a significant improvement in both the static and dynamic performance of the drive. A theoretical foundation is presented based on a linearised model of a pneumatic actuator, servo-valve, and load system. The thesis describes the design and evolution of microprocessor based hardware and software for motion control of pneumatic drives. A British Standards based test-facility has allowed control strategies to be evaluated with reference to standard performance criteria. It is demonstrated in this research study that the dynamic and static performance characteristics of a pneumatic motion control system can be dramatically improved by applying appropriate software based realtime control strategies. This makes the application of computer controlled pneumatic servos in manufacturing very attractive with cost performance ratios which match or better alternative drive technologies.

40|$|A {{programmable}} hybrid mechanism (PHM) is {{a combination}} of a servomechanism with a conventionally driven mechanism and has the potential to combine the advantages of both. A PHM can generate the output movement that is possible in a conventional mechanism and also permit these movements to be modulated using the servo-actuator. PHMs can offer batch-to-batch or even cycle-to-cycle programmability and thus allow development of machines that are capable of handling wider variations in products without incurring delays due to setups. A PHM can provide better tuning of motion characteristics than those obtainable from servomechanisms alone. It has also been claimed that due to the sharing of power between the main drive and the servo drive, the power rating necessary for the servo actuator can be lowered, thus offering a cost advantage compared to the system using only the <b>servo-drive.</b> Research work reported in this emerging area of research has been reviewed here...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{industrial}} and other plant processes today represent systems {{in which a}} motor supplies torque to a drive disk, which in turn through a pulley system drives a larger load. Developing models for these complex systems can become time consuming and expensive. A simple second order system approximation can be developed for these systems under certain system conditions which can greatly reduce the complexity of controlling and modeling the system. A second order feed-forward notch controller can then be introduced to the system which greatly improves performance. The results of this proposed method of approximating complex <b>servo-drive</b> systems show that such reductions in complexity {{can be made with}} positive results.

In order to demonstrate these methods, Simulink in conjunction with MATLAB was used to first run simulations of the proposed method.

40|$|Micromachining {{processes}} {{deal with}} the production of parts characterized by features in the micro range (i. e., with dimension lower than 1 mm). Several works are present in literature analyzing the tool behaviors, the material influence on the process, and the machine design. In fact, the downsize of the process up to the microscale needs a full review of all the knowledge coming from the meso and macro scale. As a consequence, machines suitable for micromachining processes were recently introduced in the market. Usually, these machines are classified by the classical gantry layout structure supported by a granite frame and, in order to guarantee the needed requirements of precision and accuracy in the micro scale, {{they are based on}} fluid-supported axes and active and/or passive vibration control systems. This paper proposes a new concept design: a high precision machine (HPM) based on an innovative layout exploiting a differential mechanism with three motors for two degrees of freedom using pulleys and metal belts. This new layout exhibits relevant advantages. The most significant is that all the worktable servo drives, that moves along x and y axes, are ground-fixed. This allows to isolate the working area of the machine from the servo drives. The system of pulleys and belts holding the working table slides on air bearings in order to minimize the micro vibrations induced by all the drives. A further peculiarity of the machine consists of the double z-axis each of them is motorized by a micrometer slide with linear absolute encoder. The first z-axis is equipped with a spindle for performing micro machining processes (drilling and milling). The second z-axis is equipped with a laser head for micro ablation. The servo drives of the two z-axes are controlled by the same control system of the worktable. Another important feature of the proposed layout is that the differential configuration of the xy mechanism admits the use of a constant speed signal to each control reference with no output displacements. This allows to guarantee non-inversion of motion of the <b>servo-drives</b> and so the avoidance of problems due to backlash and/or static friction. Drives are controlled by position and speed control loops with PID architecture, antiwindup and feed forward strategies. Controllers have been tuned by the use of a genetic algorithm applied to a dynamic model of the system. As a general consideration, the quality of the investigated micro machining processes can be improved with the designed machine structure...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric motors are {{resonant}} vibromotors. They {{represent a}} new actuator generation {{in the field}} of <b>servo-drives.</b> In particular, the travelling wave ultrasonic motor presents a high torque at low speed, a zero speed torque without feeding, low sensitivity to electromagnetic disturbances as well as being a more compact solution if compared to conventional electromagnetic motors. Much researches has been performed by others to determine an analytical model based on the identification of an electromagnetic equivalent circuit or on exploitation of a theoretical model based on numerical approaches, which use finite elements methods. While leading to satisfactory analysis, these modeling methods can hardly be exploited in the design of control algorithms. Indeed, they require considerable processing resources to generate and visualize the results. For this reason, we introduce in this thesis, an analytical model that is easily adaptable to operational applications and control techniques. The proposed analytical model has been validated by comparing measured characteristics with those obtained in simulations, which was possible thanks to the realization of a modular test bench. The travelling wave ultrasonic motor is characterized by strong non-linearity. It also depends highly on the wear state of the materials, which is difficult to model, and on the contact surface between stator and rotor. In addition, the mechanical resonance frequency experiences drift due to the variations of temperature. These considerations of strong non-linearities and parameter sensitivities of the motor represent a challenge for the study and design of an efficient and robust control strategy. We introduce with this thesis a new control approach that guarantees a closed loop response which is independent of the motor operating point. Moreover, the proposed control method allows to avoid the discontinuities typically present with this type of actuator with a very reasonnable hardware requierments. Finally, an important extension in the product range of the piezoelectric actuators is proposed in the last part of this thesis. It acts to develop an fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) compatible haptic interface with one degree of freedom. The use of a robotic interface in conjunction with an fMRI environment would enable neuroscientists to investigate the brain mechanism used to perform tasks with arbitrary dynamics, and could become a critical tool in neuroscience and rehabilitaiton. There is, however, a major problem for robot working within an fMRI environment : conventional actuators and materials interfere with the strong permanent magnetic field and the fast switching magnetic field gradients. Consequently, non-ferromagnetic materials must be used to avoid forces on the device itself, that can compromise its performance and may result in hazardous conditions for the patient or the medical staff. In addition, the materials should be non-conducting to avoid the generation of eddy currents. The travelling wave ultrasonic motor was used because it provides benefits compared to the conventional electromagnetic actuators. Non-ferromagnetic piezoelectric ceramic material is used and as a result motor operation is not affected by the presence of the strong magnetic fields ecountered in the clinical scanners...|$|R

Firstly, a sliding mode observer (SMO), which provides exponential convergence of estimation error, is designed for a class of multivariable perturbed systems.

Compared with the SMO, it will be demonstrated that the PIO is capable of achieving better estimation precision as long as the unknown inputs are continuous.

40|$|Synopsis Considerable {{research}} {{efforts have been}} spent {{over the last two}} decades on improving the design, control, and modelling of pneumatic servo drive systems including the development of dedicated controllers and control valves. However, the commercial updates in employing pneumatic servos are still largely limited to laboratory research usage and the initiatives in developing seem to have lost their momentums. Although this situation has some to do with the rapid development and availability of cost effective electric servo technologies, one reason is considered to be a lack of design and simulation tools for employing pneumatic servo drives. This research has therefore been conducted to address these concerns, and to demonstrate how appropriate tools and environments can be developed and used to aid in the design, control and commissioning of pneumatic servo drives. Because of the inherent high nonlinearities associated with pneumatic systems, it would be highly desirable if the simulation environment could be run in time domain so that it can be mixed with the real system. This would make the simulation more accurate and reliable especially when dealing with such nonlinear systems. Unfortunately, the tools that are available in the market such as Propneu (Festo, 2005) and Hypneu (Bardyne, 2006) are dedicated for pneumatic circuit design only. This research is aimed at developing a mixed reality environment for the control and design of servo-pneumatic systems. Working with a mixed reality environment would include both the capability to model the system entirely as a simulation, the so-called "off-line", as well as being able to use real components running against simulations of others "on-line", or in a Mixed Reality (MR) manner. Component-based paradigm has been adopted, and hence the entire pneumatic system is viewed as a series of component modules with standardised linking variables. The mathematical model of each individual component has been implemented in simulation software which produces time domain responses in order to allow for mixing the simulation with the real system. The main outcome of this research can be seen as a successful development and demonstration of the Component-based Mixed Reality Environment (CMRE), which would facilitate the control and design of servo-pneumatic systems. On the one hand, the CMRE facilitates the identification of some nonlinear parameters such as frictional ynopsis parameters. These parameters could cause great difficulties in servo-pneumatic modelling and control. Accurate friction parameters would give the ability to attain an accurate model, and therefore provide more flexibility in applying different control and tuning strategies on the real system. On the other hand, the CMRE facilitates the design process by enabling the designer to evaluate the servo-pneumatic system off-line prior to building the system. This would reduce the design time, increase the reliability of the design, and minimize the design cost. The concept of the CMRE was validated by tests carried out on laboratory-based prototype <b>servo-drive.</b> Close agreement between the experimental and simulated responses was obtained showing that the models have represented the real system adequately. Case studies were then conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology and environment. In these case studies, PIDVF controller and cascade control structure were successfully implemented, synthesised, and tuned. The results revealed that the CMRE is an easy, accurate and robust way of implementing different control and tuning strategies on servo-pneumatic systems. Furthermore, the research has shown how the CMRE can lead to significant improvements in certain life cycle phases of the system, e. g. commissioning, maintenance, etc. This research has contributed to knowledge in the following: (1) Adopting the mixed reality concept and the component-based approach in order to create a CMRE in facilitating the control and design of servo-pneumatic systems. (2) A method to identify the friction parameters of a single-axis pneumatic machine, (3) Encapsulate existing control methods within the CMRE to be applied on the real system. (4) A scheme for controller tuning, in which the controller is tuned off-line and then applied on the real system, and hence avoided on-line tuning which can be troublesome and time consuming. It is anticipated that the concept of the CMRE can be extended to include multi-axes servo-pneumatic system, servo-hydraulic, and servo-electric drives. Therefore, conceptual model structures have been introduced in this research which can be considered as the foundation for creating similar environments for those systems...|$|E
