25|$|The {{details of}} the {{charging}} process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement {{on some of the}} basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in {{the central part of the}} storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from −15 to −25 Celsius, see figure to the right. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and graupel (<b>soft</b> <b>hail).</b> The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.|$|E
2500|$|The {{differences}} in {{the movement of the}} precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel (<b>soft</b> <b>hail),</b> the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged. [...] See figure to the left. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud.

2500|$|The {{rainfall}} has {{a moderate}} to low variability {{and it is}} spread through the months, but is slightly higher {{during the first half}} of the year. From 1990–1999, Sydney received around 20 thunderstorms per year. In late autumn and winter, east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in the CBD. Depending on the wind direction, summer weather may be humid or dry, with the late summer/autumn period having a higher average humidity and dewpoints than late spring/early summer. In summer, most rain falls from thunderstorms and in winter from cold fronts. [...] Snowfall was last reported in the Sydney City area in 1836, while a fall of graupel, or <b>soft</b> <b>hail,</b> mistaken by many for snow, in July 2008, has raised the possibility that the 1836 event was not snow, either.|$|E

5000|$|Snow is {{extremely}} rare in Sydney and was last {{reported in the}} Sydney area in 1836. T. A. Browne, who kept weather observations, noted that [...] "the years 1836, 1837 and 1838 were years of drought, {{and in one of}} these years (1836) a remarkable thing happened. There was a fall of snow; we made snowballs at Enmore and enjoyed the usual schoolboy amusements therewith". The Sydney Herald reported on the same incident, saying, [...] "for {{the first time in the}} memory of the oldest inhabitants, snow fell in Sydney on the morning of Tuesday last. 27 June 1836, about 7 o'clock in the morning, a drifting fall covered the streets nearly one inch in depth."

50|$|Under some {{atmospheric}} conditions, {{snow crystals}} may encounter supercooled water droplets. These droplets, {{which have a}} diameter of about 10 µm in, can exist in the liquid state at temperatures as low as , far below the normal freezing point. Contact between a snow crystal and the supercooled droplets results in freezing of the liquid droplets {{onto the surface of}} the crystal. This process of crystal growth is known as accretion. Crystals that exhibit frozen droplets on their surfaces are often referred to as rimed. When this process continues so that the shape of the original snow crystal is no longer identifiable, the resulting crystal is referred to as graupel. Graupel was formerly referred to by meteorologists as <b>soft</b> <b>hail.</b> However, graupel is easily distinguishable from hail in both the shape and strength of the pellet and the circumstances in which it falls. Ice from hail is formed in hard, relatively uniform layers and usually falls only during thunderstorms. Graupel forms fragile, oblong shapes and falls in place of typical snowflakes in wintry mix situations, often in concert with ice pellets. Graupel is also fragile enough that it will typically fall apart when touched.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{relative}} stasis of the Maltese climate, historical records present some variations. In {{the capital city}} of Valletta, meteorological officials of the time recorded a temperature of [...] on 19 February 1895, which remains a record for the city. Regarding the island as a whole, a temperature of [...] was recorded on 1 February 1962, at Ta' Qali airfield, in the centre of the island, which was pelted first by frozen precipitation (hail), and later in the day covered by snowfall that lasted through the night, though this temperature is not recognised by the Malta Met Office as it was not an official recording station and didn't use worldwide meteorological standard instruments. Snow, which is virtually unheard of, is officially on the record books of the past 200 years as having occurred in January 1858 (widespread snowfall), March 1877 (light snow without accumulation), February 1895 (snow squalls without accumulation), January 1905 (flurries without accumulation), March 1949 (snow recorded in the interior of the island), and 31 January 1962, On 31 December 2014 [...] "snow" [...] was reported at various locations. however the Malta Met Office has now confirmed these were showers of <b>soft</b> <b>hail</b> or graupel sometimes also called snow pellets, but they are actually small lumps of ice. That Winter went on {{to be one of the}} coldest and stormiest ever experienced in the Maltese Islands. It is thought that most historical reports of snow are likely to have also been graupel.|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{observations}} {{of both the}} precipitation and the lightning associated with thunderstorms show that the lightning is within 3 km of the maximum precipitation echo. The intensity and type of the precipitation is observed with 500 m spatial accuracy using an S-band polarization radar and {{the position of the}} lightning is inferred from a low frequency magnetic direction finding location system. Empirical adjustment to the angles using the redundancy of the lightning data reduce this error. Radar echoes above 45 dBZ may be caused by <b>soft</b> <b>hail</b> or hailstones, but similarly intense echoes may result from melting snow. The data show that a new polarization radar parameter, the linear depolarization ratio, can distinguish between <b>soft</b> <b>hail</b> and melting snow, and that the intense radar echoes associated with melting snow pose no threat of lightning. A lightning risk only exists when the radar indicates that the clouds contain <b>soft</b> <b>hail</b> or hailstones...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} the {{electrification}} associated {{with the growth of}} an artificial pellet of <b>soft</b> <b>hail</b> have been made by REYNOLDS, BROOK & GOURLEY (1957), LATHAM & MASON (1961 a) and MAGONO & TAKAHASHI (1963 a, a). The apparent contradictions between the results of these separate studies are shown to be merely the consequence of the different conditions under which they were performed and it is demonstrated that the temperature gradient theory affords a qualitative explanation for all the results obtained. Strong negative charging of the growing pellet is produced by two processes, both manifestations of the theory: (1) Collision between the pellet and super-cooled droplets which freeze onto its surface and shatter to eject positively charged ice splinters. (2) Momentary contact between ice crystals and a rimed pellet of irregular surface structure; the charge transfer resulting from this process depends markedly upon the violence of the impact. Calculations show that appreciable negative charging of the growing pellet will occur in a thundercloud over ranges of droplet diameter 0 < d < 120 p, pellet radius 0. 25 < r < 2. 5 mm and environmental temperature- 35 " < T <- 4 °C. The combined rate of charging inside a thunderstorm by means of these two processes is estimated to be at least 3 C km-a min- 1, which can easily account for the electrification of a moderate thunderstorm: this riming process may also be able to generate sufficient charge to explain the electrification of extremely severe thunderstorms...|$|E
40|$|Seen by {{the human}} eye, {{precipitation}} particles are commonly drops of rain, flakes of snow, or lumps of hail that reach the ground. Remote sensors and numerical models usually deal with information about large collections of rain, snow, and hail (or graupel [...] also called <b>soft</b> <b>hail)</b> in a volume of air. Therefore, the size and number of the precipitation particles and how particles interact, evolve, and fall within the volume of air need to be represented using physical laws and mathematical tools, which are often implemented as cloud and precipitation microphysical parameterizations in numerical models. To account for {{the complexity of the}} precipitation physical processes, scientists have developed various types of such schemes in models. The accuracy of numerical weather forecasting may vary dramatically when different types of these schemes are employed. Therefore, systematic evaluations of cloud and precipitation schemes are of great importance for improvement of weather forecasts. This study is one such endeavor; it pursues quantitative assessment of all the available cloud and precipitation microphysical schemes in a weather model (MM 5) through comparison with the observations obtained by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) s and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) and microwave imager (TMI). When satellite sensors (like PR or TMI) detect information from precipitation particles, they cannot directly observe the microphysical quantities (e. g., water species phase, density, size, and amount etc.). Instead, they tell how much radiation is absorbed by rain, reflected away from the sensor by snow or graupel, or reflected back to the satellite. On the other hand, the microphysical quantities in the model are usually well represented in microphysical schemes and can be converted to radiative properties that can be directly compared to the corresponding PR and TMI observations. This study employs this method to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated radiative properties by the MM 5 model with different microphysical schemes. It is found that the representations of particle density, size, and mass in the different schemes in the MM 5 model determine the model s performance when predicting a winter storm over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Schemes lacking moderate density particles (i. e. graupel), with snow flakes that are too large, or with excessive mass of snow or graupel lead to degraded prediction of the radiative properties as observed by the TRMM satellite. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the combination of both an active microwave sensor (PR) and passive microwave sensor (TMI) onboard TRMM on assessing the accuracy of numerical weather forecasting. It improves our understanding of the physical and radiative properties of different types of precipitation particles and provides suggestions for better representation of cloud and precipitation processes in numerical models. It would, ultimately, contribute to answering questions like "Why did it not rain when the forecast says it would?...|$|E
40|$|The Hyperspectral Microwave Atmospheric Sounder (HyMAS) {{is being}} {{developed}} at Lincoln Laboratories and accommodated by the Goddard Space Flight Center for a flight opportunity on a NASA research aircraft. The term "hyperspectral microwave" is used to indicate an all-weather sounding that performs equivalent to hyperspectral infrared sounders in clear air with vertical resolution of approximately 1 km. Deploying the HyMAS equipped scanhead with the existing Conical Scanning Microwave Imaging Radiometer (CoSMIR) shortens the path to a flight demonstration. Hyperspectral microwave is achieved {{through the use of}} independent RF antennas that sample the volume of the Earth s atmosphere through various levels of frequencies, thereby producing a set of dense, spaced vertical weighting functions. The simulations proposed for HyMAS 118 / 183 -GHz system should yield surface precipitation rate and water path retrievals for small hail, <b>soft</b> <b>hail,</b> or snow pellets, snow, rainwater, etc. with accuracies comparable to those of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder. Further improvements in retrieval methodology (for example, polarization exploitation) are expected. The CoSMIR instrument is a packaging concept re-used on HyMAS to ease the integration features of the scanhead. The HyMAS scanhead will include an ultra-compact Intermediate Frequency Processor (IFP) module that is mounted inside the door to improve thermal management. The IFP is fabricated with materials made of Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology integrated with detectors, amplifiers, A/D conversion and data aggregation. The IFP will put out 52 channels of 16 bit data comprised of 4 - 9 channel data streams for temperature profiles and 2 - 8 channel streams for water vapor. With the limited volume of the existing CoSMIR scanhead and new HyMAS front end components, the HyMAS team at Goddard began preliminary layout work inside the new drum. Importing and re-using models of the shell, the scan head computer, and the slip rings developed for CoSMIR was the starting point. The next step was to modify the antenna faceplate to accommodate the dimensions of the three dual polarization Gaussian Optics Antenna (GOA) assemblies. Two mechanical concepts for the core technology, the hyperspectral IFP, were captured in a design tradeoff. Connector models considered minimum bend radii for the IFP analog connectors. Hyperspectral imaging is accomplished by strategically using a short wavelength intermediate frequency of 18 - 29 GHz, and thus reducing the size of components in the connection of the front end to the IFP. The SMK (2. 92 mm) Series connector will lay near the hinge line to minimize its flexing. The digital output of the IFP will use a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) that must be accommodated by the scan head computer. To make that computer more reliable, maintainable, and forward compatible with the 52 HyMAS channels, a testbed of the scan head, calibration, and archive computers and the PIC 24 microprocessor that resides on the IFP is in development. The computers will be programmed using a new framework application called Interoperable Remote Component (IRC). This software allows flexibility to program computers that communicate with each other and can adapt easily to the emerging HyMAS requirements for data format, algorithms, and graphical user interface (GUI). It is expected that the CoSMIR instrument will cut over to the IRC after it is adapted on an updated CoSMIR testbed...|$|E
