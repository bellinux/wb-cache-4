5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of barbed wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places <b>safety</b> <b>installations</b> of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, {{following}} {{the decision to}} move the capital and government seat of re-unified Germany to Berlin, {{it was decided to}} abandon the bunker as no concept for civilian use could be found. Only few parts of the fire <b>safety</b> <b>installations</b> had been upgraded, which was a decisive criterion that deterred potential investors. The costs of continuous operation of DM 20 million (about EUR 10 million), however, could have been reduced in event of civil use as preparations for potential nuclear attacks would no longer have been required. It also would have been possible to use only one of the five independent sections. Over the following years the tunnels were cleared out, gutted and sealed, costing €16 million in total. In 2001 deconstruction was interrupted briefly due to considerations whether it might be sensible to have a bunker {{following the}} September 11 attacks. All that remains now are the gutted, concrete-lined tunnels. The access buildings above the Kloster Marienthal vinyard still exist, although the doors have been welded shut.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{scientific}} literatures seem {{to be interested in}} analyzing only the road infrastructure and traffic flow, neglecting the impact produced by road equipment, in this work the overall environmental burden exerted by roads in “operative conditions” (i.e., when the road is equipped with all of the accessories and is therefore ready to be used) is regarded as determined by the concurrent burdens exerted by the road infrastructure, the traffic flow, and the road components (i.e., <b>safety</b> <b>installations).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} more {{flexibility}} {{in all parts of}} industrial manufacturing increasingly affects material handling and distribution. For the field of Automatically Guided Vehicles (AGVs) this especially means: - replacement of fixed guidance lines by flexible driving-paths - renounciation of costly installations, - extension of driving püaths also in out door areas, - acceleration of driving speed, - improvement of <b>safety</b> <b>installations</b> and - flexible programming. Efforts of research institutes and manufacturers aspire to develop vehicles without any guidance line, so-called non-guided vehicles. Thereby a special look out is to be drawn to the localization aspect. In most cases this unit is realised by using dead-reckoning systems in combination with various other methods of position detection. Different methods of dead-reckoning localization have been examined at the free ranging AGV IPAMAR of the Fraunhofer Institute IPA. The results are presented hereafter...|$|E

30|$|There are {{scenarios}} {{in which}} the single staged total evacuation is not practical. In the case of staged total evacuation, some occupants {{may be asked to}} remain in the building for {{a certain period of time}} in order to optimize the flows (Pauls 1994). Those occupants might feel discomfort in remaining in a threatened environment. In addition, when high-density conditions occur in a bottleneck, the maximum flow capacity may drop (Cepolina 2009). The phased evacuation strategy is based on the concept that occupants in the most critical floors such as the fire floor and floors nearby will be prioritised. This strategy is adopted in order to decrease the queuing time in the egress components and reduce people densities in the means of escape. The fire compartmentation plays a key role in this strategy (The Building Regulation 2006). In fact, occupants in the compartment of the fire need to be evacuated, whilst the remaining occupants need to be evacuated only if it is necessary. The effectiveness of this strategy relies also on the fire <b>safety</b> <b>installations</b> available in the building, the level of training of the staff and adequate means of communication within the building (Wong and Luo 2005).|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>safety</b> <b>installations</b> (such as emergency exits, lighting, etc.) is a key factor to improve the evacuation performance of buildings or transportation systems. In fact, even though an installation is designed to achieve a given design goal, it could happen it does not perform as intended. According to the Theory of Affordances, this could be interpreted in relation to different affordances, namely it cannot be (1) sensed (i. e. Sensory Affordance), (2) understood (i. e. Cognitive Affordance), (3) physically used (i. e. Physical Affordance), or (4) it does not fulfil its intended goal (i. e. Functional Affordance). This study investigates how this issue can be addressed combining the Theory of Affordances and the Random Utility Theory. This work shows that ordered choice models are powerful tools to investigate the relations among affordances. In this work, an ordered choice model is estimated using data from a Virtual Reality experiment aimed at investigating the design of flashing lights at emergency exit portals for road tunnel evacuation. The proposed model demonstrates that both Sensory and Cognitive Affordances statistically affect Functional Affordance. The results demonstrate also how participant demographics and installation variables affect Functional Affordance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the development {{as well as}} the on-ground and the in-flight evaluation of a low cost Global Positioning System (GPS) system for real-time tracking of sounding rockets. The flight unit comprises a modified ORION GPS receiver and a newly designed switchable antenna system composed of a helical antenna in the rocket tip and a dual-blade antenna combination attached to the body of the service module. Aside from the flight hardware a PC based terminal program has been developed to monitor the GPS data and graphically displays the rocket's path during the flight. In addition an Instantaneous Impact Point (IIP) prediction is performed based on the received position and velocity information. In preparation for ESA's Maxus- 4 mission, a sounding rocket test flight was carried out at Esrange, Kiruna, on 19 Feb. 2001 to validate existing ground facilities and range <b>safety</b> <b>installations.</b> Due to the absence of a dedicated scientific payload, the flight offered the opportunity to test multiple GPS receivers and assess their performance for the tracking of sounding rockets. In addition to the ORION receiver, an Ashtech G 12 HDMA receiver and a BAE (Canadian Marconi) Allstar receiver, both connected to a wrap-around antenna, have been flown on the same rocket as part of an independent experiment provided by the Goddard Space Flight Center. This allows an in-depth verification and trade-off of different receiver and antenna concepts...|$|E
