5000|$|In {{the absence}} of noise {{enhancement}} or noise correlation, the PRML sequence detector performs maximum-likelihood sequence estimation. As the operating point moves to higher linear recording densities, optimality declines with linear partial-response (PR) equalization, which enhances noise and renders it correlated.

An effective way to achieve near optimal performance independently of the operating point—in terms of linear recording density—and the noise conditions is via noise prediction.

5000|$|As the {{illumination}} typically penetrates {{the sample}} from one side, obstacles {{lying in the}} way of the lightsheet can disturb its quality by scattering and/or absorbing the light. This typically leads to dark and bright stripes in the images. If parts of the samples have a significantly higher refractive index (e.g. lipid vesicles in cells), they can also lead to a focussing effect resulting in bright stripes behind these structures. To overcome this artifact, the lightsheets can e.g. be [...] "pivoting". That means that the lightsheet's direction of incidence is changed rapidly (~1 kHz rate) by a few degrees (~10°), so light also hits the regions behind the obstacles. Illumination can also be performed with two (pivoted) lightsheets (see above) to further reduce these artifacts.Alternatively, an algorithm called VSNR (Variational <b>Stationary</b> <b>Noise</b> Remover) has been developed and is available as a free Fiji plugin.|$|E
50|$|The key concept {{inside the}} perceptual model is Idealisation. The idea behind this is, that POLQA is {{supposed}} to simulate Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests. In an ACR test however, subjects have no comparison to the actual reference signal when they score a speech signal. Instead, {{it is assumed that}} subjects have an understanding of what an ideal signal sounds like and they use this as their own reference. Consequently, if they are asked to score a reference signal which is not absolutely perfect (e.g. it has the wrong volume or contains too much timbre, noise or reverberation), it will be scored worse than perfect. In its idealization step POLQA therefore corrects small imperfections of the reference signals in order to derive the same ideal reference for the comparison to the degraded signal as human subjects would use in their minds. Similar to the idealization of the reference signal, some distortions present in the degraded signal which are hardly perceptible in an ACR test will be partially compensated (e.g. small pitch shifts, linear frequency distortions). The perceptual model starts with scaling the reference signal to an ideal average active speech level of approximately -26dBov. No such scaling is performed on the degraded signal. It is assumed that any deviation of the level of the degraded signal from the ideal -26dBov is to be scored as a degradation of the signal. Next, the spectra of both signals are computed using an FFT with 50% overlapping frames with a duration of between 32ms and 43ms duration (depending on the sample rate). Subsequently small pitch shifts of the degraded signal will be eliminated (Frequency Dewarping). Now, the spectra will be transformed to a psychoacoustically motivated pitch scale, by combining individual spectral lines (FFT bins) to so-called critical bands. The pitch scale used is similar to the Bark scale with an average resolution of 0.3 Bark per band. The result is the Pitch Power Density. At this stage the first three distortion indicators for frequency response distortions, additive noise and room reverberations are calculated.After this, the excitation of each band is derived. This includes the modeling of masking effects in the frequency {{as well as in the}} temporal domain. The result is for each frame of each signal a head-internal representation which indicates roughly how loud each frequency component would be perceived.Now, a further idealization step of the reference signal takes place by filtering out excessive timbre and low level <b>stationary</b> <b>noise.</b> At the same time, linear frequency distortions and <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> are partially removed from the degraded signal.A subtraction of the idealized excitations finally leads to the Distortion Density, which is measure for the audibility of distortions.|$|E

40|$|European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2013, 7 - 12 April, Vienna, AustriaA new, non {{stationary}} {{scheme for}} the statistical magnetotelluric (MT) transfer function estimation {{is used to}} assess the effects of non <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> in MT data processing. The scheme uses Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to process spectral data and is referred to as Empirical-mode-decomposition-based Magneto-Telluric processing (EMT). We compare EMT with BIRRP by Chave and Thomson [2004], a traditional and efficient processing code based on the Fourier Transform. Two tests are performed, first, synthetic, non stationary data is constructed from two non stationary sources to demonstrates the inability of a Fourier based method to deal with non stationary sources. Then, secondly, these sources are used as a noise source. The non <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> is added only to the electric fields and leaves the magnetic and remote channels completely unaffected. Therefore, we can show that the computation of the spectra via Fourier Transform fails, because uncorrelated <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> in the spectra should be cleaned by the remote referencing technique, which is applied in the test. Since any uncorrelated (random) non <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> acts as any random <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> and does not affect the measurements other than decreasing the confidence in the results (larger error bars), this test shows that the mere fact that the added noise is non stationary affects the estimated results by a Fourier Transform based method or even makes it impossible to extract reasonable transfer functions, whereas the EMT algorithm is able to deal with the non stationarity and allows a more precise estimation to a lower signal-to-noise ratio. In summary, we show that non stationary sources can heavily impact on traditional MT processing routines which rely on the Fourier Transform but that this effect can be diminished by relying on a purely non stationary analysis. The non stationary source is specifically designed to disturb the Fourier Transform and to break its assumptions, however the results provide an insight in how bad real non <b>stationary</b> <b>noise</b> can affect MT measurements and encourage to verify these findings on a real world problem with data that is suspected to contain, in particular, non <b>stationary</b> <b>noise,</b> e. g. data that is acquired close to train lines, mining shafts and elevators or electric fencesPeer Reviewe...|$|E
