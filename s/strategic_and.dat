40|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to define <b>strategic</b> business <b>and</b> information technology (IT) alignment; several representations of what it is are available in academic and practitioners’ fields. The literature suggests that firms need to achieve <b>strategic</b> business <b>and</b> IT alignment to be competitive. <b>Strategic</b> business <b>and</b> IT alignment impact business performance and IT effectiveness. We propose a unified <b>strategic</b> business <b>and</b> IT alignment model based on four <b>strategic</b> business <b>and</b> IT alignment models: Strategic Alignment Model (SAM), Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM), information system <b>strategic</b> alignment model <b>and</b> an operational model of strategic alignment. I argue that such a unified model will provide a better understanding of the nature and key aspects of <b>strategic</b> business <b>and</b> IT alignment from different, and sometimes complementary, theories. The unified model represents the concepts and instruments used in these four <b>strategic</b> businesses <b>and</b> IT alignment models. Our principal research goal is to pave the way to develop a common understanding between the different models. The components of the unified <b>strategic</b> business <b>and</b> IT alignment model were ranked with a group of IT experts and business experts from four public universities in Nicaragua.

5|$|As IRO expanded, it coordinated its {{activities}} {{more with the}} Bucharest-based BRCC. On Levski's initiative, a general assembly was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872. At the assembly, the delegates approved a programme and a statute, elected Lyuben Karavelov as the organisation's leader and authorised Levski as the BRCC executive body's only legitimate representative in the Bulgarian lands. After attending the assembly, Levski returned to Bulgaria and reorganised IRO's internal structure in accordance with BRCC's recommendations. Thus, the Lovech Central Committee {{was reduced to a}} regular local committee, and the first region-wide revolutionary centres were founded. The lack of funds, however, precipitated the organisation into a crisis, and Levski's one-man judgements on important <b>strategic</b> <b>and</b> tactical matters were increasingly questioned.|$|E
5|$|As {{retribution}} for the Italian actions at Beirut, {{four days}} after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the Wilyets of Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus to expel all Italian citizens from their jurisdictions, resulting in the deportation of over 60,000 Italians from the region. Despite the retaliatory expulsion of Italian citizens from the area, the battle gave the Italian forces complete naval superiority in the approaches to the Suez Canal and Italian forces in Eritrea could now be reinforced without hesitation, eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region. Thus the battle was both a <b>strategic</b> <b>and</b> tactical Italian victory.|$|E

The 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Drum while the 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division was activated at Fort Benning, moving to Fort Drum in 1988. The division was also assigned a round-out brigade from the Army National Guard, the 27th Infantry Brigade. The division was specially designed as a light infantry division able to rapidly deploy.

In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffes {{target was}} the Marfee heights which lay behind Sedan {{to the south}} east. They {{contained}} the fortified artillery positions and dominated the approaches to the <b>strategic</b> <b>and</b> operational depths beyond Sedan and the Meuse. The Luftwaffe was two hours late in appearing but the effort made was considerable. The attacks were made in Gruppe (group) strength and against the line of maximum resistance along the enemy gun line. To restrict enemy movements and communications, German fighters swept the area to cut land-lines and strafe fortifications, with some shooting of radio antennae off command posts. The attacks isolated the forward defence lines. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 struck first {{in the morning of}} 13 May. In just five hours, 500 Ju 87 sorties had been flown.|$|E
