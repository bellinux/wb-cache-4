500|$|Mansour's run {{for office}} came as a {{surprise}} to Edmund Szoka, the Archbishop of Detroit. At the time, the Vatican allowed members of religious orders to hold political office, but the candidate was required to gain the approval of the local bishop. Mansour did not do so. She told reporters that canon law was an [...] "old set of rules that are invoked when somebody wants to invoke them, and ignored when <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> ignore them." [...] Szoka accepted her excuse that she did not know to ask permission.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the decision, {{and to the}} {{protracted}} {{nature of}} the case itself, was widespread and negative. Five-time Giro winner Eddy Merckx expressed surprise at the result and disappointment that it could further sully the sport's image, saying [...] "It's like <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> kill cycling." [...] Since-ousted race director Angelo Zomegnan called the decision to strip the Giro championship [...] "nonsense," [...] noting that Contador was permitted to ride {{at the time and}} there were no irregularities of any kind during the race. His successor Michele Acquarone was also upset by the decision, believing that damage had been done to the Giro and noting that RCS Sport would need to commission a new trophy to award to Scarponi.|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best-known and most influential works of science fiction. It is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review {{as one of the}} ten best genre books of 1959, in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s, and as the best-known example of military science fiction. It was also a personal landmark for Heinlein; it was one of his best-selling books, and is his best-known novel. The novel has been described as marking Heinlein's transition from writing juvenile fiction to a [...] "more mature phase" [...] as an author. Conversely, Michael Moorcock described it as Heinlein's last [...] "straight" [...] science fiction, before he turned to more serious writing such as Stranger in a Strange Land. To Heinlein's surprise, Starship Troopers won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960. By 1980, twenty years after its release, it had been translated into eleven languages and was still selling strongly. Heinlein nevertheless complained that, despite this success, almost all the mail he received about it was negative and he only heard about it [...] "when <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> chew me out".|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, Fazekas {{noted that}} the {{producers}} felt [...] "bad" [...] about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she [...] "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it." [...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.‚Äù Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E
2500|$|To illustrate: {{one might}} be tempted to give as {{examples}} of qualia [...] "the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the redness of an evening sky". But this list of examples already prejudges a central issue in the current debate on qualia. An analogy might make this clearer. Suppose <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know the nature of the liquid crystal pixels on a television screen, those tiny elements that provide all the distributions of color that go to make up the picture. It would not suffice as an answer to say that they are the [...] "redness of an evening sky" [...] as it appears on the screen. We would protest that their real character was being ignored. One can see that relying on the list above assumes that we must tie sensations not only to the notion of given objects in the world (the [...] "head", [...] "wine", [...] "an evening sky"), but also to the properties with which we characterize the experiences themselves ("redness", for example).|$|E
2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E
