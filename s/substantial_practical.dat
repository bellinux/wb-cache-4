40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the real-time estimation of wave amplitudes and their subsequent {{use as a}} cost function in adaptive active control of bending vibrations in a beam. The amplitude of the wave propagating downstream from the control location is estimated by filtering the outputs of an array of sensors. Minimizing this wave amplitude has significant advantages over the more conventional approach in which velocity at some point is minimized. Expressions for the ideal frequency responses of the wave filters are found for {{the case of an}} array comprising two sensors in the far field. These filters are non-causal. FIR implementations designed using direct and time-delay methods are described, the latter offering some <b>substantial</b> advantages. <b>Practical</b> performance considerations are discussed, including filter length, frequency range, effects of near fields, group delays, accuracy and cross-sensitivity. Simulations and experimental measurements are performed and compared...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic idea}} is that the {{illumination}} pattern is imaged onto a geometrically congruent cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the illumination pattern and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. As in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing schlieren systems which are much easier to build and align than classical schlieren systems. The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a <b>substantial</b> <b>practical</b> barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be {{the same size as the}} field of view. Focusing schlieren systems can use compact optics with a large background illumination pattern, which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the illumination pattern needs to be around twice the size of the field of view to allow for defocusing of the background pattern.|$|E

One industry commentator said: “We have often taken on ex-fashion students either as staff or for work experience, and the majority have never been taught pattern-cutting, yet expecting glittering careers in design” (Everett, 2008) The nature of this design practice research utilizes tacit knowledge.
