2500|$|The level 9 adit was {{the longest}} built at Rhosydd, {{measuring}} [...] from the mouth to the haulage system at the inner end. It had a gradient of 1 in 86 to aid drainage, and took eight years to complete, being completed in 1870 or 1871. During its construction, an internal incline was built downwards from floor 5, so that rock from higher levels could be lowered down to the mine exit. Trucks were moved along the adit by attaching them to an endless rope, which was driven by a [...] diameter pitchback water wheel located {{near the mouth of}} the adit. They were marshalled into rakes of about 12 wagons, with a gripper truck or megryn at both ends. A <b>screw</b> <b>handle</b> was used to attach the front megryn to the rope, both on the line of full trucks in the mine and on empty ones outside the adit. The rope was then set in motion, and when the couplings between the trucks were tight, the gripper on the back megryn was applied. When they reached the far end, the grippers were released, as the water wheel took some time to stop. A similar system was used on the Glasgow Subway when it first opened. For most of its length, there were only three rails in the adit, the centre one being shared by both tracks. They fanned out into double tracks at both ends, and for [...] in the middle, so that trucks moving in opposite directions could pass one another. Communication between the operators at either end was by a bell system.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to hand sowing. Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot seeder, no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot seeder and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot seeder in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot seeder was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and metering transmission drive wheel, an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor seed distributor is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 outlet delivery head, depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment <b>screw</b> <b>handle.</b> The plot seeder is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot seeder and imported plot seeder. Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, seed counter performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot seeder. The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot seeder and imported plot seeder were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot seeder was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot seeder. Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot seeder might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot seeder. Conclusions The constructed plot seeder had up to 18500 cost reduction. The seeder was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot seeder in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot seeder had relative priority to imported one. In addition easily accessories supply and cheaper prime cost are profit of the designed and constructed plot seeder...|$|E

5000|$|Each Toad {{had a large}} guards compartment/cabin {{extending}} {{about two-thirds}} of the length of the van, with the remaining [...] "veranda" [...] open on three sides, but covered with a roof. Full length external footboards and hand rails allowed the guard or a shunter to ride on the outside during shunting movements. On the veranda, in addition to the <b>screw</b> brake <b>handle,</b> sand boxes were fitted to the rear to allow the guard to sand the rails if necessary, to stop the wheels slipping. A full height door allowed access from the veranda to the cabin, matched by a door on the far end of cabin in most versions. Whilst all versions had side entrances on both sides onto the veranda, some version included additional full height side doors into the cabin. Inside the cabin were: tool boxes; cupboards; a light and other electrical systems powered by an axle mounted dynamo; a seat; a combined table/desk, often two, with one collapsible; and a stove powered by wood or coal collected from the lineside. Another two sandboxes were also fitted inside the 'closed' end of the van. These were operated by a linkage from the veranda when the van was travelling with the veranda trailing. The guard was first aid trained, and so the cabin contained the train's main first aid kit. Like the roof, the inside of the cabin was painted white for safety reasons, derived from the practice of the time in hospitals. Windows in both ends of the cabin allowed the guard to see out and keep an eye on his train, but actual operations were only possible from the open veranda, which made this a cold and weather-beaten job all year round.|$|R

The material temperature in this area was only about 55 – 65 % of the setting value when residence time reach to 12  min, while the other areas temperatures could up to above 90 %, and the deviation between the material temperature and the setting value became obvious when the temperature is higher.|$|R
40|$|It is {{customary}} {{to weigh}} the organs removed at necropsy and these measurements provide objective criteria of atrophy, hypertrophy, and disease. However, surprisingly few mortuaries have facilities for weighing whole bodies. When this hospital opened in 1970 attempts to obtain a body weighing machine {{within the limits of}} the budget were un-successful and a simple modification of the body elevating machine was devised which enabled each body to be quickly and easily weighed. Method A gallows beam of 50 mm square structural tube is held permanently in place by a locking screw in a fabricated mounting made of 6 mm steel plate, the whole being galvanised. The long-handled locking screw facilitates easy dismantling if required. The mounting is bolted {{to the top of a}} power-operated Gibbons mortuary stacking machitie (model H 5053 M) (Fig. 1). A spring balance with a capacity of 200 kg, by division of 1 kg, is suspended from the beam, and to the balance four chains are attached which can be fixed by hooks to the four corners of an unmodified steel body tray. The tare is adjusted with the chains and tray in position. Cadavers may be conveniently weighed while being removed from the body store: the tray carrying the body and supported by the elevator is attached to the balance by four chains. The elevator support is then lowered until the tray and the body are freely suspended and the weight is read from the spring balance (Fig. 2). The method was devised to suit the model of stacking machine available in the mortuary. However, it can be adapted to other models which lack the necessary upright frame by building a gallows beam into the fabric of the mortuary at some convenient place (Pike, C., personal communication). This modification of the stacking machine is robust and has functioned satisfactorily for seven years.

40|$|Instrumented handles or dynamometers {{are widely}} used to measure hand forces and/or the biodynamic {{response}} of hand-arm system. To study hand-transmitted vibration exposure, six generations of instrument handles were constructed or initially developed by researchers in ECTB/HELD/NIOSH. This presentation provided a summary of these handles. Their basic characteristics, limitations, and usefulness are described, which may help their appropriate applications and further improvements. Six Designs of Instrumented Handles Handle 1 : The conceptual design is recommended in ISO 10819 (1996) 1 for glove test. The grip force is measured by detecting bending strains on a measuring beam in the handle. A special handle fixture was designed to connect the handle to a shaker. Except the <b>screws,</b> the <b>handle</b> and fixture were made from aluminum. Handle 2 : The design {{is based on the}} principle of shear strain measurement. 2 - 3 Both grip and push forces can be measured simultaneously using this handle. This handle was directly designed for a simulated vibrating tool. Handle 3 : This design is basically composed of a handle base, a measuring cap, and two charge-based sensors (Kistler 9212) sandwiched between the base and cap. The handle was also made from aluminum. The fixture for Handle 1 was also used with this handle. This generation of handle has three different handle diameters (30, 40, and 50 mm). 4 Handle 4 : This design is an improvement from Handle 3. The handle fixture was totally redesigned and it was much stiffer than the previous one. The aluminum measuring cap was replaced with a magnesium cap. Handle 5 : The basic structure of this handle is the same as that for Handle 3. However, the piezoelectric sensors were replaced with two strain gage based sensors (Interface SML- 50). Handle 6 : This handle includes two measuring caps, four piezoelectric sensors, and a handle centre base. The handle fixture was the same as that with Handle 4. Methods for Handle Examinations The static and dynamic characterizations were performed using the methods reported by Dong et al. 5 - 6 Results and Discussion Handle 1 : The static force measurement depended on the hand grip location on the handle. Its natural frequency was less than 200 Hz. 5, 6 Because the transmissibility of gloves may not vary significantly with the applied grip force, this handle may be acceptable for glove test. However, the force measurements with this handle may not be reliable. Handle 2 : The static force measured with this handle was insensitive to the hand acting location. However, when the handle was vibrating, the force signals could be totally distorted. For this reason, it was not used for vibration studies...|$|R
50|$|They {{are based}} on {{different}} physical effects used to guarantee a stable grasping between a gripper and the object to be grasped.Industrial grippers can be mechanical, the most diffused in industry, but also based on suction or on the magnetic force. Vacuum cups and electromagnets dominate the automotive field and in particular metal sheet handling. Bernoulli grippers exploit the airflow between the gripper and the part that causes a lifting force which brings the gripper and part close each other (i.e. the Bernoulli's principle). Bernoulli grippers are a type of contactless grippers, namely the object remains confined in the force field generated by the gripper without coming into direct contact with it. Bernoulli grippers have been adopted in photovoltaic cell handling, silicon wafer handling, {{and also in the}} textile and leather industries.Other principles are less used at the macro scale (part size >5mm), but {{in the last ten years}} they demonstrated interesting applications in micro-handling. Some of them are ready of spreading out their original field. The other adopted principles are: Electrostatic grippers and van der Waals grippers based on electrostatic charges (i.e. van der Waals' force), capillary grippers and cryogenic grippers, based on liquid medium, and ultrasonic grippers and laser grippers, two contactless grasping principles. Electrostatic grippers {{are based on}} charge difference between the gripper and the part (i.e. electrostatic force) often activated by the gripper itself, while van der Waals grippers are based on the low force (still electrostatic) due to the atomic attraction between the molecules of the gripper and those of the object.Capillary grippers use the surface tension of a liquid meniscus between the gripper and the part to center, align and grasp the part, cryogenic grippers freeze a small amount of liquid and the resulting ice guarantees the necessary force to lift and handle the object (this principle is used also in food handling and in textile grasping). Even more complex are ultrasonic based grippers, where pressure standing waves are used to lift up a part and trap it at a certain level (example of levitation are both at the micro level, in <b>screw</b> and gasket <b>handling,</b> and at the macro scale, in solar cell or silicon wafer handling), and laser source that produces a pressure able to trap and move microparts in a liquid medium (mainly cells). The laser gripper are known also as laser tweezers.|$|R
