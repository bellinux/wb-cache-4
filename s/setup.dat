5|$|According to <b>setup</b> {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the <b>setup</b> time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each <b>setup,</b> with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
30|$|Two {{separate}} <b>setups</b> were performed: (A) Small-scale <b>setups</b> (500  mL) and (B) larger-scale <b>setups</b> (10  L). To {{evaluate the}} biodegradation potentials {{of the three}} activated sludge communities, separate <b>setups</b> were performed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the advantages of}} conformal mapping methods {{for the design of}} capacitive sensor <b>setups.</b> If the <b>setups</b> are modeled appropriately, the respective Laplace equa-tions can be solved utilizing conformal mapping methods. These methods yield the equations de-scribing the electric field of the sensor <b>setups.</b> The field equations contain the distinct geometric properties of the sensor <b>setups.</b> An in depth analysis of these equations permits the optimization of the sensor <b>setups</b> with respect to their sensitivities. This approach also facilitates the application of efficient signal processing methods. In addition, we propose a method which expands the applica-tion range of conformal maps produced by the Schwarz-Christoffel transform. This method permits the analysis of more complex sensor <b>setups...</b>|$|R

5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. By 1966, feeling limited by this <b>setup</b> and inspired by Ginger Baker's double bass drum, {{he switched to}} a larger Premier kit. This <b>setup</b> {{did not have a}} hi-hat, since Moon used crash and ride cymbals instead. He remained a loyal customer of Premier.|$|E
30|$|Experiment {{was carried}} out over a 22 -day period. The {{experimental}} <b>setups</b> (<b>setups</b> 3 and 4, Figure  3) were spiked with a maximum of 1  mg/L BTri and TTri, respectively (exact values in Table  3) and sampled twice a week by withdrawing 60  mL from the <b>setups</b> as described above. <b>Setups</b> 1 and 2 (Figure  3) served as controls (no benzotriazole supply) to evaluate whether the benzotriazoles affected the ASC.|$|R

5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were {{not supported by the}} DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional <b>setup</b> method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected <b>Setup</b> method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually <b>setup</b> Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.|$|E

40|$|We derive a propagator based {{formalism}} for optimizing {{phase contrast}} imaging in laboratory <b>setups</b> {{as well as}} in synchrotron <b>setups.</b> We confirm based on five different <b>setups</b> the well known existence of an optimum position for the sample in terms of phase contrast by measuring two types of fibers and evaluating the fringe contrast. Furthermore, we demonstrate for these <b>setups</b> a correlation of our formula and the fringe contrast. Hence, an estimate of this optimum position is given by our formalism which only depends on the source size, the detector blurring, and the total distance between source and detector...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{various kinds}} of {{distributed}} resource sharing <b>setups</b> have been proposed by taking social relationships into consideration. These dissimilar resource sharing <b>setups</b> are tagged as Social Cloud. These <b>setups</b> have appeared in various distributed computing forms such as community cloud, grid, volunteer computing and network services. Such <b>setups</b> are discrete in nature, and hence, do not conceptualize {{the totality of the}} Social Cloud concept. In fact, it is difficult to conceptualize Social Cloud without a general framework. There are three main objectives of this work. First, to present a general framework of Social Cloud.

After only eight {{games as a}} <b>setup</b> pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed <b>setup</b> duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E

5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a <b>setup</b> known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the <b>setup</b> is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has clearly and consistently shown that flow time advantages accrue from splitting production lots into smaller transfer batches or sub-lots. Less extensively discussed, and certainly undesired, {{is the fact}} that lot splitting may dramatically increase the number of <b>setups</b> required, making it impractical in some settings. This paper describes and demonstrates a primary cause of these “extra” <b>setups.</b> It then proposes and evaluates decision rules which selectively invoke lot splitting in an attempt to avoid extra <b>setups.</b> For the closed job shop environment tested, our results indicate that conditional logic can achieve a substantial portion of lot splitting’s flow time improvement while avoiding {{the vast majority of the}} additional <b>setups</b> which would be caused by previously tested lot splitting schemes...|$|R
