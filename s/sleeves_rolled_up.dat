5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
25|$|Ken's batsmanship {{displayed}} different qualities {{which were}} not so glamorous, perhaps, but no less essential: determination, courage, application and overwhelming dedication to the task in hand...How reassuring {{it would have been}} last summer to have seen that familiar figure once again – square-on stance, cap pulled down, <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> jutting jaw, ready for anything that bowlers could unleash.|$|E
500|$|The Dream is an [...] bronze statue {{depicting}} Martin Luther King Jr. It {{is located}} at the intersection of Northeast Holladay Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, outside the northeast corner of the Oregon Convention Center in the Rose Quarter of Portland's Lloyd District. King is shown [...] "stepping forward with conviction to deliver his powerful message". He is surrounded by three allegorical figures: behind and to King's right is a young white man with his <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> who symbolizes the working American; directly behind King is a woman wading ashore who represents the country's immigration history; and behind and to the left of King is a young girl, shown releasing King's coattail, who represents [...] "intergenerational respect".|$|E

60|$|She {{had every}} {{appearance}} {{of being the}} cook for the occasion. Her <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> her hair tumbled and frowzy, and there were several unmistakable marks of grease {{on the front of}} her calico dress.|$|R
60|$|Like his comrade above, his costume {{consists}} of flannel shirt, dark trousers, and big boots. His shirt <b>sleeves</b> being <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> to the shoulders, display {{a pair of}} arms that a sculptor might gaze on with admiration.|$|R
500|$|Although malaria {{was known}} to be endemic in the Milne Bay area, {{precautions}} taken against the disease were haphazard. Men wore shorts and kept their <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up.</b> Their mosquito repellent cream was ineffective, quinine was in short supply and many men arrived without their mosquito nets, which were stowed deep in the ships' holds and took several days to unload. A daily dosage of [...] was prescribed but Field's troops were told not to take their quinine until they had been in the area a week. By this time, many had become infected with the disease. The Director of Medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters was Brigadier Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical medicine. He visited Port Moresby in June, and was alarmed at the ineffectiveness of the measures being taken to combat the disease, which he realised was capable of destroying the entire Allied force in Papua. He made sure that the 110th Casualty Clearing Station left Brisbane for Milne Bay with a fully equipped pathological laboratory and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies, including 200,000 quinine tablets. Unfortunately, some equipment was lost or ruined in transit, and the danger from malaria was not yet appreciated at Milne Bay.|$|E
2500|$|Pattinson executively {{produced}} {{and starred in}} the film Remember Me, which was released on 12 March 2010. Though the film received mixed reviews, some critics praised his performance. Jake Coyle of The Associated Press said that [...] "The young actor has an unmistakable screen presence. However in Remember Me, he pours it on thickly and self-consciously. With low eyes, <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> just so and cigarette drooping artfully from his mouth, Tyler (like Edward Cullen) is a reluctant romantic." [...] Ian Nathan of Empire Online stated that [...] "this {{is the best thing}} he's done." [...] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised his and co-star Emilie de Ravin's chemistry in the film, stating the [...] "scenes between Pattinson and de Ravin exude genuine charm." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{health care}} system of Paris had been {{severely}} strained during the Revolution and the Consulate, with little funding or attention given to hospitals. The Revolutionary government, {{in the name of}} equality, had abolished the requirement that doctors have licenses, and had allowed anyone to treat patients; in 1801 Napoleon's new Prefect of the Seine reported that, of the seven hundred persons listed as [...] "doctors" [...] in the official Almanac of Commerce, only three hundred had formal medical training. A new law on 9 March 1803 restored the title of [...] "Doctor" [...] and the requirement that physicians have medical degrees. Nonetheless, treatment was primitive by modern standards; anesthesia, antiseptics and modern hygienic practices did not yet exist; surgeons operated with their bare hands, wearing their normal street dress with the <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miner {{was just}} sitting down to the table when Morris entered. His <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up.</b> He had his old white hat on his head. He lounged upon one elbow on the table. His whole bearing was swinish.|$|R
60|$|He {{placed his}} elbows on the table. His <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> {{displaying}} his red and much sunburned arms. He wore no coat, and his face was sullen, and held, besides, a certain vicious quality, like that of a bad-tempered dog.|$|R
50|$|In the summer, {{white socks}} are allowed, {{but there is}} not a change in uniform. <b>Sleeves</b> may be <b>rolled</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{show has}} been so {{influential}} that the style of Miami Vice has often been borrowed or alluded to by much of contemporary pop culture in order to indicate or emphasize the 1980s decade. Its influence as a popular culture icon is still seen today, more than 20 years after appearing. Examples of this includes the episode [...] "The One With All The Thanksgivings" [...] from the American sitcom Friends. Flashback scenes from the 1980s in this episode shows the characters Ross and Chandler in pastel colored suits with rolled up sleeves like that of Sonny Crockett. Another example would be the video game , which was published by Rockstar Games in 2002 and {{is set in a}} stylized 1980s Miami inspired fictional city. Two undercover police officers appear in a police sports car within the game when the player obtains a three-star wanted level. The two officers, one white and one black, resemble the two leading characters of Miami Vice. One of the main characters, Lance Vance, was actually voiced by Philip Michael Thomas. In the prequel, , there are two officers in the multiplayer mode named Cracker and Butts, a parody of Crockett and Tubbs; these characters share the same role as the undercover cops in Vice City. In the film Boogie Nights, the movie takes place in the 1970s. The movie progresses into the 1980s and closes with Mark Wahlberg wearing a white linen jacket, <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> and a bright pink shirt tucked into white linen pants. This informs the audience the year is now somewhere in the mid-1980s due to the massive popularity of Miami Vice from 1984–1986.|$|E

60|$|One day Pan saw Jim's wife, {{a pretty}} blonde girl, strong and healthy and rosy cheeked. Her <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> showing round bare arms. Her smile won Pan, {{yet he was}} too shy {{to go in and}} take the cookies she offered.|$|R
50|$|Khaki long-sleeved {{shirt is}} worn by all members {{when they are}} in GS/ Barrack Dress. In summer time, <b>sleeves</b> are <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> above elbow level. In winter time, olive-green {{pullovers}} or Combat Smock jackets can be worn, based on the orders from the commanders.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know you}} couldn't want more, Miss Stokes,' said Albert politely. Joe, who was bare-headed, whose grey flannel <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> to the elbow, and whose shirt was {{open at the}} breast, looked {{modestly}} aside {{as if he had}} no part in the affair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} would like to have me sweep and scrub, and wear an old brown dress, and go round with my <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> as Phebe does?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Sam has {{his shirt}} <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> and is {{pitching}} in," [...] whispered Caleb Walton. [...] "Here we are. Captain Line, {{here is another}} man for my party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{a regular}} play actor. I don't like made-up people. Why does she go {{around with her}} <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> that way, and--and her dress open at the throat?" ...|$|E
60|$|This fact, {{if she had}} {{not known}} it, she might have {{gathered}} from Mr. Silence's expression. He had laid down his coat; his <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> and his arms were tanned, and he stood smoking a cigarette and gazing at her with approbation. She lowered her eyes.|$|R
60|$|She was {{kneading}} out cake dough, and {{she looked}} the loveliest thing he had ever seen. Her <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up.</b> Her neat brown dress {{was covered with a}} big apron, and her collar was open a liffle at the throat, for it was warm in the kitchen. She frowned when she saw him.|$|R
60|$|Pan {{went back}} to the campfire. Supper was in progress, with the capable Mrs. Smith bustling about. Lucy and Alice were assisting. Pan stole a glance at Lucy. Her face was flushed from the wind and sun; she wore a white apron; her <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> to show round strong arms. Bobby and his two puppies were much in the way.|$|R
60|$|The next {{afternoon}} he came bursting into the kitchen, where Maud {{stood with her}} <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> deep in the dish pan, while Stella stood wiping the dishes handed to her.|$|E
60|$|While hard at work, {{with his}} coat off and his <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> Mr. Williams appeared. He {{was quite an}} old man, and in many respects much pleasanter than his partner.|$|E
60|$|He had supped in four minutes. His coat off, his <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> he was {{scrubbing}} {{his hands}} in a tin basin in the sink, using the bar of yellow kitchen soap.|$|E
50|$|The bronze {{sculpture}} shows a man {{seated on}} a large cinder block and at his feet is a carpenter's square. Dressed in only a shirt and pants, his shirt <b>sleeves</b> are <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> above his elbows and his collar is open. His face wears a beard and mustache and his feet are shoe-less. His arms reach {{out in front of}} him, and he looks as if in conversation.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a man}} "hypnotizing" an {{alligator}} at {{an alligator}} farm (possibly the California Alligator Farm, Los Angeles), ca. 1900. A man in {{what appears to be}} casual dress and a brimmed hat bends on one knee and extends his left arm above the body of an overturned alligator. His <b>sleeves</b> are <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> to his elbows. Other alligators are visible on the bank in the background. Foliage from a tree hangs in from above...|$|R

60|$|The {{father was}} afraid of the mention of his wife. The two went indoors. Paul ate in silence; his father, with earthy hands, and <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> sat in the arm-chair {{opposite}} and looked at him.|$|E
60|$|So spoke Matt, {{coming out}} of the cabin, his <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> a pan of dirty dish-water in his hands, arrested in the act of {{emptying}} the pan by the sight of Weedon Scott patting White Fang.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood there}} with his shirt <b>sleeves</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up,</b> his face bronzed a little and now warm and moist from the exercise, with {{something}} proven about him, with a suggestion of a new force which made him different.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} a short swarthy man, bull-necked and deep-chested, {{pushed through the}} people. He was clad in rough russet wool with a scarlet cloth tied round his black curly head. His <b>sleeves</b> were <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> to his shoulders, and his brown arms, all stained with grease and tar, were like two thick gnarled {{branches}} from an oaken stump. His savage brown face was fierce and frowning, and was split from chin to temple with the long white wale of an ill-healed wound.|$|R
60|$|Such a voice {{could only}} {{come from a}} broad chest, and the broad chest belonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a back so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up {{to take a more}} distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier {{standing}} at ease. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger-tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name; but the jet-black hair, made the more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.|$|R
5000|$|EARLY DAYS: DRESS CODE The {{dress code}} was very rigid {{in the early}} 20th century. Boys wore long sleeved shirts and ties; <b>sleeves</b> could be <b>rolled</b> <b>up</b> while on playground, but had to be rolled back down when they re-entered the school. The girls wore long sleeved dresses and long cotton {{stockings}} under them. No skin showed other than hands and faces.|$|R
