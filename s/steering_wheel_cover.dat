5000|$|Custom: Base model, usually {{equipped}} with manual locks/windows, color-keyed vinyl seat and dashboard, and black rubber floor mat. However, a Custom trim truck could still {{share some of}} the same options as the higher-trim trucks. A <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> and Ford logo above the radio was optional. Chrome door handles outside the cab to hoist the driver up and into the cab were also optional. On trucks without air conditioning, vents were not installed into the dashboard, giving the driver only two choices for air direction: [...] "Defrost" [...] and [...] "Heat", with [...] "Heat" [...] on a non-A/C truck being the equivalent of [...] "Floor" [...] on a truck with A/C. The lack of vents on the dashboard does have an advantage, as it leaves room for the installation of aftermarket gauges.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} was revised {{with a new}} {{front grille}} later seen on the eighth-generation Honda Civic which also debuted that year, new rear end styling with triangular LED taillights, daytime running lights (DRLs) and heated side mirrors for US EX models. Heated mirrors and DRLs were previously available only on Accords sold in Canada. The 2006 model year also featured new wheel designs, with 17" [...] wheels being standard on V6 models. Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), traction control, and Brake assist became available on the V6 models for the first time. Previously, the system was named TCS and included the traction control and brake assist, but not stability control.The interior was also slightly redesigned with changes such as a new <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> differently colored gauges and a differently styled shift knob for automatic transmission models. The GPS Navigation system was updated (4th generation) with a faster processor, more memory, and several new features, such as restaurant information from Zagat. A revised maintenance minder system was also added which gave owners reminders for scheduled maintenance such as oil changes based on operating conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Critic Taran Adarsh gave 3.5 stars out of 5 {{and states}} that, [...] "Manjunath {{is a film}} that is realistic, brave and powerful. Critic Subhash K. Jha also gave 3.5 stars out of 5 saying, [...] "The {{director}} pieces together Manjunath's story like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. For The Times of India, Renuka Vyavahare wrote, [...] "One of the least promoted films of the week, Manjunath pleasantly surprises you with its thought-provoking, hard-hitting content and earnest execution. What also set the film apart are its heart-rending parent-child moments and heartfelt performances. Renowned artistes Seema Biswas (as Manju's mother) and Kishor Kadam (Manju's father) deserve awards for their tear-evoking acts." [...] She gave the film 3 stars out of 5. Rajeev Masand for IBN Live gave it a rating of 3/5, calling it [...] "An important story that deserves to be heard." [...] Sify.com gave it 3.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "Don't miss this rare gem. Varma is an astute storyteller, also showcasing a flair for cinematic style.

50|$|As {{a driver}} may have {{his hands on}} the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{for hours at a time}} these are {{designed}} with ergonomics in mind. However, the most important concern is that the driver can effectively convey torque to the steering system; this is especially important in vehicles without power steering or in the rare event of a loss of steering assist. A typical design for circular <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> is a steel or magnesium rim with a plastic or rubberized grip molded over and around it. Some drivers purchase vinyl or textile <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>covers</b> to enhance grip or comfort, or simply as decoration. Another device used to make steering easier is the brodie knob.|$|R
50|$|Other {{items that}} made the SS 50 {{different}} were the chrome sports bar on the back, unique black-and-yellow engine <b>cover,</b> a leather-wrapped <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> handbrake <b>cover</b> and gear knob {{as well as a}} colour-coded instrument cluster to match the leather bolsters on the sports seats.|$|R

5000|$|... 21011 (1974-1981) â€” {{modified}} variant with a [...] engine. Further changes included self-adjusting {{drum brakes}} {{on the rear}} axle, also fitted to the VAZ-2101. Flat front indicator lenses instead of the dome-shaped ones on the VAZ-2101. The [...] "horns", or over-riders, on the bumpers were removed and replaced with a rubber strip running the whole length of the bumper. The rear lights were also smoothed {{in a similar manner}} to the indicator lenses and the passive reflector (previously a separate part underneath the main rear lights) was incorporated as a small, square-shaped part in the rear light cluster itself. The windshield pump was moved down and was operated by foot (rather than by rubber button on the dashboard VAZ 2101, which was operated with the push of a finger). The dashboard had a wood-effect plastic trim; the horn was placed on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover.</b> The front and rear seats became more comfortable. Material and colouring of the instrument panel was changed from the original black on light grey to white on black, the instrument panel lighting was altered as well. On the rear pillars there were rectangular ventilation holes with grille, which were not present on the VAZ-2101. Four decorative horizontal oval holes appeared on the front panel just above the front bumper. The export series were designated the Lada 1300.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, {{both the}} M-412 {{and the related}} M-408 had their bodies redesigned. These were notable for being the first Moskvitch models to feature {{rectangular}} headlights and horizontal rear lights, which {{passed on to the}} 2138/2140 in 1976, replacing round headlights (two on ordinary models, four mainly on export models) and vertical rear lights. Only rear triangular turn signals remained on vestigial tailfins. Until then, the M-412 profited from heightened tailfins and tanned headlight lamps on export models. Another notable (but not unique, as it was used in other Russian cars at the time) feature were the so-called side signals, mounted on the C-pillars on some vehicles and similar to the American [...] "opera lights". The designers [...] "had paid real attention to passive safety", the car was crash-tested, met the standards of safety adopted by the UNECE, and received an international safety certificate as a result of almost five months of tests in France. It was upgraded with dual-circuit braking system, reinforced car-body structure, and passive safety features such as soft grip <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover,</b> soft interior parts, seat belts, and padded dashboard. It was the first Moskvitch to pass safety-features tests in France, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden in 1970-71, and in Western Germany in 1972. The modernized model, both for export and domestic market, received a factory code M-412IE (IE for [...] "export rendition"), to mark, that it fulfils new safety requirements.|$|E

The multi-sensor interface attributes compactness and flexibility to reconfigurable readout integrated circuits (ROICs) and migration of signal processing and computation burdens from a sensor tag to a smartphone. Two reconfigurable ROICs which were designed and fabricated in a 0. 18 -&# 61549;m CMOS process generate raw digital data from environmental and healthcare sensors. Their detected raw data are wirelessly sent to the smartphone where real-time calibration and post-processing are performed optimally for each sensor.

40|$|The AutoPlay prototypes {{have been}} {{designed}} to explore the implementation of non-driving activities into the context of a future autonomous driving situation. The conceptual design goal was to maintain a pleasurable situational awareness of the inactive driver by integrating the driving context as a meaningful input into the interaction system. In this chapter, we introduce the design of three experimental applications for autonomous driving and report on explorative user studies conducted to investigate the impact of the three AutoPlay prototypes: AutoGym, an in-car exertion game that translates car speed and traffic situations into an individual exercise program. AutoJam, a touch sensitive <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover</b> to generate interactive music experiences in a creative interplay with car&# 039;s driving dynamics. AutoRoute, a discovery application for future urban commuting in autonomous cars that enables an exploration of the city based on spontaneous routing and rerouting. Furthermore, we reflect on the outcome of the user studies and propose three motivational affordances of autonomous driving: drivability, performability, and explorability. Each of these concepts, help to understand the motivational possibilities of the autonomous driving situation and facilitates a meaningful alignment of interaction systems and the driving context. We discuss the underlying concepts of the three affordances by relating them to the experiences identified in the user studies. Subsequently the contribution of this chapter is twofold: (1) We introduce the AutoPlay prototypes as inspirational concepts for aligning non-driving activities with the autonomous driving context and (2) we propose three motivational affordances as design targets for the implementation of non-driving activities in order to initiate a broader discussion on the pleasures of autonomous driving beyond instrumental motives...|$|E
40|$|Department of Human Factors EngineeringDriving is {{a commonplace}} but safety {{critical}} daily activity {{for billions of}} people. It {{remains one of the}} leading causes of death worldwide, particularly in younger adults. In the last decades, a wide range of technologies, such as intelligent braking or speed regulating systems, have been integrated into vehicles to improve safetyannually decreasing death rates testify to their success. A recent research focus in this area has been in the development of systems that sense human states or activities during driving. This is valuable because human error remains a key reason underlying many vehicle accidents and incidents. Technologies that can intervene in response to information sensed about a driver may be able to detect, predict and ultimately prevent problems before they progress into accidents, thus avoiding the occurrence of critical situations rather than just mitigating their consequences. Commercial examples of this kind of technology include systems that monitor driver alertness or lane holding and prompt drivers who are sleepy or drifting off-lane. More exploratory research in this area has sought to capture emotional state or stress/workload levels via physiological measurements of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG), or behavioral measurements of eye gaze or face pose. Other research has monitored explicitly user actions, such as head pose or foot movements to infer intended actions (such as overtaking or lane change) and provide automatic assessments of the safety of these future behaviors â€“ for example, providing a timely warning to a driver who is planning to overtake about a vehicle in his or her blind spot. Researchers have also explored how sensing hands on the wheel can be used to infer a driverâ€™s presence, identity or emotional state. This thesis extends this body of work through the design, development and evaluation of a steering wheel sensor platform that can directly detect a driverâ€™s hand pose all around a steering wheel. This thesis argues that full steering hand pose is a potentially rich source of information about a driverâ€™s intended actions. For example, it proposes a link between hand posture on the wheel and subsequent turning or lane change behavior. To explore this idea, this thesis describes the construction of a touch sensor {{in the form of a}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>cover.</b> This cover integrates 32 equidistantly spread touch sensing electrodes (11. 250 inter-sensor spacing) in the form of conductive ribbons (0. 2 " wide and 0. 03 " thick). Data from each ribbons is captured separately via a set of capacitive touch sensor microcontrollers every 64 ms. We connected this hardware platform to an OpenDS, an open source driving simulator and ran two studies capturing hand pose during a sequential lane change task and a slalom task. We analyzed the data to determine whether hand pose is a useful predictor of future turning behavior. For this we classified a 5 -lane road into 4 turn sizes and used machine-learning recognizers to predict the future turn size from the change in hand posture in terms of hand movement properties from the early driving data. Driving task scenario of the first experiment was not appropriately matched with the real life turning task therefore we modified the scenario with more appropriate task in the second experiments. Class-wise prediction of the turn sizes for both experiments didnâ€™t show good accuracy, however prediction accuracy was improved when the classes were reduced into two classes from four classes. In the experiment 2 turn sizes were overlapped between themselves, which made it very difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, we did continuous prediction as well and the prediction accuracy was better than the class-wise prediction system for the both experiments. In summary, this thesis designed, developed and evaluated a combined hardware and software system that senses the steering behavior of a driver by capturing grip pose. We assessed the value of this information via two studies that explored the relationship between wheel grip and future turning behaviors. The ultimate outcome of this study can inform the development of in car sensing systems to support safer driving. clos...|$|E

5000|$|Dodge vans, {{particularly}} Tradesman vans {{from the}} 1971-1977 model years, were very popular {{as the basis}} for many custom vans during the custom van craze that occurred during the mid- to late '70s and early 1980's. Dodge capitalized on this craze, creating a factory customization package called the [...] "Street Van" [...] package. This was advertised alongside the Lil' Red Express and Warlock trucks as [...] "Adult Toys". The Street Van package consisted of a [...] "Street Van" [...] logo on the passenger and driver's side door in lieu of the Tradesman logos, chrome trim on the grille and windshield, simulated wood grain inlays in the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> horn <b>cover</b> and passenger side glare shield, five-slot chrome wheels or white spoked [...] "off-road" [...] type wheels, chrome front and rear bumpers, chrome trim on the gauges, smaller chrome side-view mirrors, patterns and plans to create custom interiors, and membership in the [...] "Dodge Van Clan". This package was available from the 1976 model year until it was discontinued in the early 1980s. This was not an overly popular option from the factory, and Street Vans are somewhat rare.
