5|$|A 2012 {{study by}} Schott and David C. Evans {{found that the}} number {{and shape of the}} {{individual}} nodes on the squamosal <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the examined S. validum skulls varied considerably, and that this variability does not seem to correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation. These researchers found no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae {{and the size of the}} squamosal.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids are {{diagnosed}} {{by the following}} features; short T-shaped frontals that form the rostral boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the caudal vertebrae elongate and spanning several vertebrae; {{the presence of a}} subglenoid fossa on the coracoid.|$|E
5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E

The <b>Shelves</b> <b>of</b> Infinity were {{designed}} and created by the Assembler race on Generios Eight, considered the pinnacle of their race. The pieces {{that make up the}} shelves are constantly phasing in and out of this dimension, so they can never be completely assembled. The <b>Shelves</b> <b>of</b> Infinity were stored in Warehouse ZX under the code ZX419.|$|R

5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
25|$|The Labrador <b>Shelf</b> <b>of</b> Newfoundland and Labrador was a {{prospective}} exploration province {{in the early}} period of eastern offshore exploration. First drilled in 1971, wells in the deeper waters were drilled from dynamically positioned drillships.|$|E
25|$|Woodward also lies in an oil and natural-gas {{area on the}} <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin. In 1956, {{natural gas}} was {{discovered}} in Woodward County. Thereafter, Woodward enjoyed significant growth due to the opening and location of oil field service and drilling companies in Woodward.|$|E

25|$|This square {{structure}} anchors {{the southern}} end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archaeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial.|$|E
25|$|Bering Sea Islands ecoregion: Five major islands (St. Lawrence, Nunivak, St. Matthew, {{and the two}} Pribilof Islands of the St. Paul and St. George) {{and their}} {{adjacent}} islets dot the inner <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the Bering Sea and constitute the Bering Sea Islands ecoregion. Central Yup'ik and Siberian Yupik people settled the larger islands closer to the Alaska mainland.|$|E

25|$|Much {{of biology}} and {{ecology of the}} {{threadfin}} jack is unknown, with the species' diet the only studied aspect of its biology. A study in fishes of the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> Colombia found the species takes predominantly small, benthic fishes of the families Triglidae, Synodontidae, and Batrachoididae. Other common prey included benthic crustaceans, including various crabs and shrimp.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific halibut {{is found}} on the {{continental}} <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Fishing for the Pacific halibut is mostly concentrated in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, off {{the west coast of}} Canada. Small halibut catches are reported in coastal Washington, Oregon, and California. Pacific halibut is broken up into 10 regularity management areas.|$|E
25|$|Both Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal {{are located}} within 200 {{nautical}} {{miles of the}} Philippines’ coast {{on the island of}} Palawan and are located in an area that is not overlapped by the entitlements generated by any maritime feature claimed by China. It follows, therefore, that, as between the Philippines and China, Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal form part of the exclusive economic zone and continental <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|The bumpnose {{trevally}} {{is usually}} founds {{in small groups}} of two or more, swimming along beaches where they take prey which consists of shrimp, small crabs, and fish. Studies on the North West <b>Shelf</b> <b>of</b> Australia have found the species often aggregates with other carangids, particularly Carangoides humerosus, Ulua aurochs, and Selaroides leptolepis, and together these make up {{a large proportion of}} the resident fish fauna. Reproduction in the species is very poorly known, with young fish often showing up in South Africa during summer.|$|E
25|$|Major sea {{ports of}} Russia include Rostov-on-Don on the Azov Sea, Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, Astrakhan and Makhachkala on the Caspian, Kaliningrad and St Petersburg on the Baltic, Arkhangelsk on the White Sea, Murmansk on the Barents Sea, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 the country owned 1,448 {{merchant}} marine ships.

25|$|Former {{students}} of Hindu College were strongly {{in favour of}} Thomas Babington Macaulay’s move for western education. They even went {{to the extent of}} supporting his theory, expounded in 1835, “I am quite ready to take oriental learning at the valuation of orientalists themselves. I have never found one among them, who could deny that that a single <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” That was an age when India’s past was still to be fully realised.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{discharge}} of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is via the five major ice streams (faster flowing ice) entering the Ross Ice Shelf, the Rutford Ice Stream entering Ronne-Filchner <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the Weddell Sea, and the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier entering the Amundsen Ice Shelf. Opinions differ as to the present mass balance of these systems (Bentley 1983, 1985), principally because of the limited data. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is stable {{so long as the}} Ross Ice Shelf is constrained by drag along its lateral boundaries and pinned by local grounding.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} contribution to Nova Scotia's provincial economy is through spin-offs and royalties relating to off-shore petroleum exploration and development. Mostly concentrated on the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> the province's Atlantic coast {{in the vicinity of}} Sable Island, exploration activities began in the 1960s and resulted in the first commercial production field for oil beginning in the 1980s. Natural gas was also discovered in the 1980s during exploration work, and this is being commercially recovered, beginning in the late 1990s. Initial optimism in Nova Scotia about the potential of off-shore resources appears to have diminished with the lack of new discoveries, although exploration work continues and is moving farther off-shore into waters on the continental margin.|$|E
25|$|Because Trinidad and Tobago {{lie on the}} {{continental}} <b>shelf</b> <b>of</b> South America, their biological diversity is unlike that of most other Caribbean islands, and has {{much in common with}} that of Venezuela. The main ecosystems are: coastal and marine (coral reefs, mangrove swamps, open ocean and seagrass beds); forest; freshwater (rivers and streams); karst; man-made ecosystems (agricultural land, freshwater dams, secondary forest); and savanna. On 1 August 1996, Trinidad and Tobago ratified the 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, and it has produced a biodiversity action plan and four reports describing the country's contribution to biodiversity conservation. The reports formally acknowledged the importance of biodiversity to the well-being of the country's people through provision of ecosystem services.|$|E
