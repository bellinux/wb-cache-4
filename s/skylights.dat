40|$|Abstract. A <b>skylight</b> {{polarization}} {{measurement system}} has been designed. With the measurement system, the patterns of <b>skylight</b> polarization measured at four kinds of atmospheric conditions at the spectral range 450 ~ 475 nm are presented. It is obvious that qualitatively the patterns of <b>skylight</b> polarization in sunny skies are in agreement with Rayleigh model. The stronger atmospheric turbidity, the greater disturbance to the patterns of <b>skylight</b> polarization appears in the atmosphere. The cloudy sky has terrible patterns of <b>skylight</b> polarization, this is mainly because it is overclouded and the sunlight is occluded completely. The degree of the <b>skylight</b> polarization P and {{the angle of the}} <b>skylight</b> polarization χ are the greatest in the clear sky. However, some meteorologic factors can disturb the polarized characteristics of <b>skylight.</b> Cloud layer and dust decrease P of <b>skylight</b> polarization and disturb χ of <b>skylight</b> polarization at different atmospheric conditions...|$|R
5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex and the Female Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble with openings dressed in brick. An open saw-tooth roof with southern <b>skylights</b> covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. The two northern shops were later amalgamated by removing the dividing wall.|$|E
5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as <b>skylights,</b> windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via <b>skylights.</b> The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and <b>skylights,</b> the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E
5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small <b>skylights</b> in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2004, the {{official}} {{home of the}} Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building, in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat <b>skylights</b> of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skylight</b> II is an oval {{measuring}} 85 x 60 m. The {{bottom of}} the <b>skylight</b> is half-covered by water, {{at a depth of}} 19 m below the rim. Some plants grow horizontally on the wall of <b>Skylight</b> II.|$|R

5|$|The 250-metre {{long and}} 35-metre tall {{building}} has nine floors, but {{the height of}} the ground floor varies (4.6–4.2 m). This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine. The volume of the building is 280,000 m³, constructed from 4,600tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over 55740 m² of usable office space". The façade is clad with 33,000 m² Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt Travertine marble, punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey. Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis. The top storey is lit from <b>skylights</b> rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height. It forms a clear building conclusion. Until the 1950s, the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Museum {{building}} {{consists of}} a three-level base building that is {{closed to the public}} and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled <b>skylights</b> on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.|$|E
5|$|The prison's {{workshops}} provided {{activities and}} training for the prisoners. They also reduced the cost of maintenance, repairs, and construction by providing an in-house service. The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, {{one of the first}} buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. The five western workshops are a single storey squared limestone rubble building with openings dressed in brick, with an open saw-tooth roof with southern <b>skylights,</b> concealed behind a parapet wall. In 1993 the western workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops.|$|E

The <b>skylight</b> system was developed using outdoor physical model tests and simulation tools Limited on-site measurements and occupant polls were conducted. Market issues were addressed. The <b>skylight</b> systems were found to improve lighting quality and to control excessive daylight illuminance levels compared to a conventional diffusing bubble <b>skylight.</b> Daylighting principles developed in earlier work for vertical glazing systems (light shelves and light pipes) were shown to be applicable in <b>skylight</b> designs at full-scale...|$|R
5|$|The African art and Sackler {{buildings}} were built as twin pavilions, each one story above ground and with similar display space: five galleries each, {{and only one}} with natural light. They are differentiated by their roof adornments: domes on the African art building and pyramids on the Sackler. The African art pavilion was built in red granite and uses the circle shape as its architectural theme, with round windows, rounded entrance staircase, and six, round domes on its roof. Inside, a limestone foyer overlooks the gardens and a curving stair hall leads visitors down curving stairs to the galleries. The galleries are large and customized by exhibition designers into smaller rooms to better suit small objects. The buildings are visible from Independence Avenue, and the new Enid A. Haupt Garden runs {{between them and the}} Smithsonian Institution Building. Underground, the museum and offices occupy the first two levels, and a third level hosts exhibition and educational rooms. Its levels are connected by a three-story enclosed arcade with large <b>skylights</b> set into the gardens above, through several feet of dirt. The pavilion was renovated in the early 2000s with a major donation from Eastman Kodak.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{costs are}} reduced on sunny days, as most Costco {{locations}} have several <b>skylights.</b> During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light {{is coming in}} the <b>skylights</b> and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1980s, the {{perfection}} of the extractor hood allowed an open kitchen again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house to smell. Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are Frank Lloyd Wright's House Willey (1934) and House Jacobs (1936). Both had open kitchens, with high ceilings (up to the roof) and were aired by <b>skylights.</b> The extractor hood {{made it possible to}} build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both high ceilings and <b>skylights</b> were not possible.|$|E
50|$|The building’s most {{noteworthy}} {{feature is}} the atrium rising through all nine stories and crowned by a large pyramidal <b>skylight.</b> In the 1940s, walls were erected on each floor to enclose this court for fire-safety reasons, hiding the atrium, railings, and <b>skylight</b> from public view. Those walls have since been removed, revealing the <b>skylight</b> and the atrium with its elaborate wrought-iron railings.|$|R

40|$|<b>Skylight</b> {{polarization}} {{provides a}} significant navigation cue for certain polarization-sensitive animals. However, {{the precision of}} the angle of polarization (AOP) of <b>skylight</b> for vehicle orientation is not clear. An evaluation of AOP must be performed before it is utilized. This paper reports an evaluation of AOP of <b>skylight</b> by measuring the <b>skylight</b> polarization patterns of clear and cloudy skies using a full-sky imaging polarimetry system. AOP measurements of <b>skylight</b> are compared with the pattern calculated by the single-scattering Rayleigh model and these differences are quantified. The relationship between the degree of polarization (DOP) and the deviation of AOP of <b>skylight</b> is thoroughly studied. Based on these, a solar meridian extracted method is presented. The results of experiments reveal that the DOP is a key parameter to indicate the accuracy of AOP measurements, and all the output solar meridian orientations extracted by our method in both clear and cloudy skies can achieve a high accuracy for vehicle orientation...|$|R
