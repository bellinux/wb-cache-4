500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} {{pulled back in a}} sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers on the scene in various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd like to ask everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's such a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. God bless you all. Thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E

6000|$|... "A very {{pleasant}} evening," [...] he began, {{as soon as}} Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers swept away;--"particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you made her play <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> no instrument at her grandmother's, {{it must have been}} a real indulgence." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> {{things which}} <b>have</b> life. Take an equally notorious example from things {{which have not}} life.|$|R
6000|$|... "The navy, I think, who <b>have</b> done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> us, <b>have</b> {{at least}} an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the {{privileges}} which any home can give. Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just this," [...] {{her voice}} almost a whisper. [...] "I am frightened of it all, {{and when you}} want me I will come to you. No, wait just a little. I could never marry {{the man who was}} {{fighting}} against my father and the people I belong to, while, now I know what you are, I could never ask him to go back on what he felt was right; but, Larry, the men you did <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>have</b> turned against you, and the things they are doing are not right, and would never please you. Can't we go away and leave the trouble behind us? Nobody seems to want us now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well said!' {{answered}} the miller heartily. 'But {{you may be}} sure {{that there will be}} no unseemly rejoicing, to disturb ye in your present frame of mind. All the morning I felt more ashamed than I cared to own at the thought of how the neighbours, great and small, would laugh at what they would call your folly, when they knew what had happened; so I resolved to take this step to stave it off, if so be 'twas possible. And when I saw Mrs. Garland I knew I had done right. She pitied me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> had the house cleaned in vain, and laid in provisions to waste, that it put her into the humour to agree. We mean to do it right off at once, afore the pies and cakes get mouldy and the blackpot stale. 'Twas a good thought of mine and hers, and I am glad 'tis settled,' he concluded cheerfully.|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> {{a first-rate}} {{lawyer and a}} man of {{character}} on my side. Daggett gave the whole thing up, on the spot,--re-conveying to me Clawbonny before he quitted, though the sale would unquestionably be set aside, and subsequently was set aside, {{by means of an}} amicable suit. A great deal remained to be done, however; and I was obliged to tear myself away from Lucy, in order to do it. Probate of the will was {{to be made in the}} distant county of Genessee--and distant it was from New York, in 1804! The journey that could be made, to day, in about thirty hours, took me ten days: and I spent near a month in going through the necessary forms, and in otherwise settling my affairs at the west, as that part of the State was then called. The time, however, was not wasted below. Mr. Hardinge took charge of everything at Clawbonny, and Lucy's welcome letters,--three of which reached me weekly,--informed me that everything was re-established in the house, on the farm, and at the mill. The Wallingford was set running again, and all the oxen, cows, horses, hogs, &c., &c., were living in their old haunts. The negroes were reinstated, and Clawbonny was itself again! The only chants made wore for the better; the occasion having been improved, to paint and new-vamp the house, which Mr. Daggett's parsimony had prevented him from defacing by modern alterations. In a word, 'Masser Mile' was alone wanting to make all at the farm happy. Chloe had communicated her engagement to 'Miss Lucy,' and it was understood Neb and his master were to be married about the same time. As for Moses, he had gone up to Willow Cove, on a leave of absence. A letter received from him, which now lies before me, will give a better account of his proceedings and feelings than I can write myself. It was in the following words, viz.: ...|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Fest became {{embroiled in a}} public dispute with the left-wing writer and Nobel Prize winner Günter Grass, who had {{admitted}} in his autobiography that he had joined the Waffen-SS in {{the last months of}} World War II. Fest criticised Grass, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> joined, but for having concealed the fact for so many years while engaging in political criticism of others over their Nazi pasts. He said: [...] "After 60 years, this confession comes a bit too late. I can't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority, a rather smug one, could pull this off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more reason <b>for</b> <b>having</b> it said quickly. Unpleasant things {{should always be}} got over without delay." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Have {{you lost}} your reason {{as well as all}} sense of duty, Grace?" [...] he stormed. [...] "What is this beggarly farmer, the nephew of my bitterest enemy, that you should give up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him? <b>Have</b> you counted the cost--hardship, {{degrading}} drudgery, and your father's displeasure? And would you choose these instead of your natural position as mistress of Carrington?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I owe it {{partly to}} you," [...] he answered. [...] "You <b>had</b> done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Blanche. You <b>had</b> <b>so</b> {{cultivated}} {{her mind and}} polished her manners that her attractions were doubled, and I fell an easy victim to them." ...|$|R
60|$|Sigurd {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} to hear his Queen scold him <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> she <b>had</b> never said an angry word to him before; but {{he thought it was}} quite excusable in this case, and tried to quiet the child along with her, but it was no use. Then he went and wakened the sailors, and bade them hoist the sails, <b>for</b> a breeze <b>had</b> sprung up and was blowing straight towards the harbour.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> what I <b>have</b> {{heard from}} {{others on the}} subject of my Uncle George. My own {{personal}} experience of him is limited to what I remember as a mere child. Let me say something, however, first about my parents, my sister and myself.|$|R

60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> compunction <b>for</b> <b>having</b> ever wronged him, even by a shapeless thought, did I feel within me, {{that the}} {{confession}} of having done so was rising to my lips. But for the reluctance I had to betray {{the confidence of}} Agnes, but for my uncertainty how to approach the subject with no risk of doing so, it would have reached them before he said, 'God bless you, Daisy, and good night!' In my doubt, it did NOT reach them; and we shook hands, and we parted.|$|R
6000|$|The hunter was right. A {{quarter of}} an hour had barely elapsed when our sturdy mariner re-entered the encampment, blowing like a grampus and perspiring at every pore! Oliver was close at his heels, but not nearly <b>so</b> <b>much</b> exhausted, <b>for</b> he <b>had</b> not been obliged to [...] "beat the track." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sue {{jumped up}} and kissed Jude with passionate devotion. [...] "Yes--so it is, dearest! And we'll have him here! And if he isn't yours it {{makes it all the}} better. I do hope he isn't--though perhaps I ought not to feel quite that! If he isn't, I should like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> us to <b>have</b> him as an adopted child!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> {{what she}} <b>has</b> done <b>for</b> {{ourselves}} that we're grateful to her," [...] remarked a corporal, {{who sat on}} Simkin's right, [...] "as <b>for</b> what she <b>has</b> done <b>for</b> our wives, widows, and children, through the Soldiers' and Sailors' Wives' Aid Association. Lookin' arter them when we're away fightin' our country's battles has endeared her to us more than anything else." ...|$|R
60|$|Gerald {{went out}} and {{drew a deep breath}} when he reached the landing. He felt shaky and ashamed, but knew he had won. The {{shutting}} of the door gave Osborn some relief. The anger and disgust Gerald excited had confused his brain, but now the lad had gone he saw no light. There was but one way of escape, and this a way it was almost unthinkable that he should take. The strange thing was he should hate it <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> he <b>had</b> never indulged his children or thought about their happiness. Yet he shrank from forcing his daughter to marry Thorn, whom he approved while she did not.|$|R
6000|$|... "To a false and rotten society, yes--you are," [...] he returned. [...] "But Mel, {{that society}} is a mass of maggots. It is such women as you, such men as Blair, who carry the spirit onward.... <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> that. I <b>have</b> spoken to try to show you where I hold you. I do not call your--your trouble a blunder, or downfall, or dishonor. I call it a misfortune because--because--" ...|$|R

50|$|People with sociotropy {{tend to have}} {{a strong}} need for social acceptance, which causes them to be overly nurturant towards people who they do not have close {{relationships}} with. Sociotropy {{can be seen as the}} opposite of autonomy, because those with sociotropy are concerned with interpersonal relationships, whereas those with autonomy are more concerned with independence and do not care <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> others. Sociotropy <b>has</b> been correlated with feminine sex-role orientation in many research experiments.|$|R
60|$|It was {{astonishing}} that we {{had been}} permitted by the enemy to do <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for,</b> as I <b>have</b> already said, we had completed the fortification {{with the exception of the}} trench, while during the forenoon much had been done toward strengthening the fences on either side, putting up additional steps of wood and earth so that men might mount to discharge their weapons, and in nearly every portion of the work the breastworks were raised six feet high.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know very}} well that it is not {{anything}} to do with you," [...] she whispered. [...] "You are too kind to me all the time. Only," [...] she went on, a little hesitatingly, [...] "don't you realize--can't you see how differently most of the girls here are dressed? I don't mind <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> myself--but you--you <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many friends. You keep on seeing people whom you know. I am afraid they will think that I ought not to be here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{imagine what}} to-day {{would have been}} if we were at Rocksand," [...] said Fred. [...] "I, obliged {{to go back to school}} directly, and you, taking leave of {{everything}} there which would seem to you so full of her; and Uncle Geoffrey, just bringing you here without any time to stay with you, and the place and people all strange. I am sure that she who thought <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> you, must <b>have</b> rejoiced that you are at home here already." ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR ALDRICH,--Thank {{you ever}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the book--I <b>had</b> already {{finished}} it, and prodigiously enjoyed it, in the periodical of the notorious Howells, but it hits Mrs. Clemens just right, <b>for</b> she is <b>having</b> a reading holiday, now, {{for the first}} time in same months; so between-times, when the new baby is asleep and strengthening up for another attempt to take possession of this place, she is going to read it. Her strong friendship for you makes her think she is going to like it.|$|R
5000|$|Fr. Tommy Maher, trainer {{of seven}} All-Ireland-winning Kilkenny teams, said {{of him in}} 1975: [...] "At this stage, I must say Eddie Keher is the {{greatest}} I've seen. The second greatest was Christy Ring. Up until last year, perhaps, I would have reversed that order. But I have no doubt at all now, because Keher <b>has</b> done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the game, <b>has</b> played it so brilliantly, scores so brilliantly and at all times then a thorough gentleman - a credit to the game.".|$|R
60|$|The {{flight of}} the Grand Duke from Florence in 1859, and his conciliatory address to his late {{subjects}} after Villafranca, in which by fair promises he hoped to win {{them back to their}} allegiance; the union of Tuscany with the kingdom of Italy; the removal of the Austrian flags from Milan; Garibaldi's crusade in Sicily; the movement upon Rome in 1862; Aspromonte,--all these events, with the shifting phases of public feeling throughout that time, the alternate hopes and fears of the Italian nation, are celebrated in the later Stornelli of Dall' Ongaro. Venice has long since fallen to Italy; and Rome has become the capital of the nation. But the unification was not accomplished till Garibaldi, who <b>had</b> done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Italy, <b>had</b> been wounded by her king's troops in his impatient attempt to expel the French at Aspromonte.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' again said Violet. 'I like <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> you to <b>have</b> him,--you who,' she hesitated, {{unable to}} say the right words, 'who DID IT before his papa or I saw the little fellow;' then pausing--' Oh, Mr. Martindale, Sarah {{told me all about}} it, and I have been longing to thank you, only I can't!' and her eyes filling with tears, she put her hand into his, glancing at the cathedral cup, which was placed on the mantel-shelf. 'It was so kind of you to take that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One more--received by {{the lawyers}} this time. My unknown {{correspondent}} has written {{to them to}} withdraw his proposal, and to announce that he has left Perth. The lawyers recommended me to stop my uncle from spending money uselessly in employing the London police. I have forwarded their letter to the captain; and he will probably be in town to see his solicitors as soon as I get there with you. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> what I <b>have</b> done in this matter. Dear Lady Lundie--when we are at our journey's end, {{what do you mean}} to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your heart {{does not}} blame, {{do not let}} your reason blame me <b>for</b> {{thinking}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of your sympathy." [...] After a while he went on, his voice still lower and faltering, as if hope faltered--"Constance, you <b>have</b> done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> me.... You <b>have</b> made my life <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{more to me than}} it was.... Will you do more still? ... Will you let me think that the sympathy, the affection you have so long felt for me, may in time ripen to another feeling which will make us even more to each other than we are now?" ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing so profoundly moving {{had come}} into his life {{since the death of}} his mother, and as he rode on down the road he did a great deal of thinking. First it gave him a {{pleasant}} sensation to think a woman should care <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him. He <b>had</b> lived a homeless life <b>for</b> years and <b>had</b> come into intimate relations with few women, good or bad. They had always laughed with him (not at him, for Claude was {{able to take care of}} himself), and no woman before had taken him seriously, and there was a certain charm about the realization.|$|R
