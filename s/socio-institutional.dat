50|$|Schifirneţ {{has studied}} {{historical}} particularities the modern evolution of Romanians. The modernisation has begun with political institutional construction {{and not with}} the building of capitalist economy. The Romanian modernization was against boyars and social traditional structures. But a lot of traditional elements had outlived the new capitalist political-juridical organism from Romanian society. Romania is still a country which faced a late modernization; {{in the same time}} it has got many elements of modernity which fail to coagulate stable modern structures in all departments of society. Schifirneţ launched and developed the concept of tendential modernity. This concept explains the role of modernity for building political and legal institutional framework necessary to develop modern nation in a society with underdeveloped economy. Throughout its history, the Romanian state gave priority to the national construction and the problems related to the economic and social development were postponed or subordinated to the national issue. Tendential modernity describes the evolution of modernization processes within the societies that are only partially functional. Schifirneţ thinks that it is useful to analyze the Romanian modernization processes under the notion of tendential modernity. This means the development in the opposite direction: from the affirmation of national spirit and political construction towards economical development. In Romanian society modernity is a trend, which coexists with obsolete institutional forms and ancient substance. Tendential modernity penetrates slowly and hard through the complicated network of <b>socio-institutional</b> structures of the traditional and patriarchal Romanian society. Since it has no clear dominant form, it is a mosaic modernity. Modernity is the framework and the element which supports the Romanian nation, but not by means of economical way, as a basis of a national state. Modernity is a tendency, an ideal in the construction of a nation.|$|E

40|$|Usually, {{immigrants}} {{have been studied}} as employed work force. However, they often choose to become entrepreneurs. According to the relevant literature, there are evidences that immigrants are more entrepreneurially active than local inhabitants. However, results from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor for Spain show {{that this is not}} consistent across the urban-rural divide. Explanation for variances in entrepreneurship in rural as compared to urban areas have been linked to specific <b>socio-institutional</b> traits that exert a differentiated impact on the entrepreneurial activity levels of specific segments of the population. The objective {{of this study is to}} verify how the entrepreneurial activity of rural immigrants responds to <b>socio-institutional</b> traits that have been identified as key explanatory factors of entrepreneurial behaviour. To carry out this research, the Spanish Global Entrepreneur Monitor (GEM) data set from 2008 was used. We conduct a comparative analysis between three population groups: immigrants as compared to non-immigrant, rural immigrant as compared to urban immigrant, and rural immigrants as compared to rural non-immigrants. To do this, a rare events logit regression model was applied. The results indicate that the probability to become an entrepreneur is greater for immigrants. The same is true for an individual residing in a rural area. However, contrary to Spaniards, rural immigrants are not more likely to become entrepreneurs. We find explanation for this in the econometric analysis of the selected <b>socio-institutional</b> traits...|$|E

40|$|A {{shift in}} the techno-economic {{paradigm}} will affect regions; regions, however, are path-dependent units. This path-dependency often leads to considerable <b>socio-institutional</b> inertia {{in the process of}} transformation whereby regions aim to remain competitive in the face of worldwide competition. The present article assesses the role of the dynamic capabilities of social capital in the process of regional adaptation. A survey conducted in the Lahti urban region in Finland is used as empirical data. The results of the survey reveal the respondents' fairly good awareness of the prevailing techno-economic paradigm and of the strong <b>socio-institutional</b> inertia confronting change in practice. The results suggest, however, that there are systematic differences in responsiveness between local politicians and other decision-makers. The study concludes with a discussion of the relevance of shared common views on the development needed within the region. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors.

This study investigated whether alcohol-specific rules mediate and/or moderate the effect that early pubertal and psychosocial timing (personal, relational, <b>socio-institutional)</b> has on adolescents' alcohol use. Mediation and moderation models were tested conducting ordinal logistic structural equation modeling in a cross-sectional sample of 1, 893 Dutch adolescents (49 % males), aged 13 - 15 years. Findings showed that early pubertal, relational and <b>socio-institutional</b> timers were at greater risk to initiate alcohol use and for heavy episodic drinking. Alcohol-specific rules more often mediated, rather than moderated, the effect of early timing on alcohol use. Alcohol-specific rules are mostly relaxed when adolescents mature, rather than reinforced, indicating that parents partly facilitate adolescents' drinking...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the global {{recession}} of 2009 marks the ending of a global development cycle {{which began in the}} early 1950 s. The long-wave rhythm of production and prices in the global development cycle is generated by the life cycle of investment and innovation during a technological revolution, related changes in supply and demand for natural resources, and inertia and transformation in the <b>socio-institutional</b> framework within which development takes place. From this perspective, the global recession is interpreted as a blocked structural transition. Whilst failings in the financial system triggered the global financial crisis, that crisis and the recession are more deeply rooted in contradictions in the global development trajectory. A paradigm shift in development theory and practice is a crucial element of the <b>socio-institutional</b> transformation now necessary to re-boot the global development cycle.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the case of}} the largest steel plant in Europe, located in Taranto (Italy), to argue that its current crisis is not simply {{dictated}} by technological or managerial failings. Rather, the article contends, its problems stem from a regulatory crisis and, specifically, from the failure of the deregulation model pursued after the industry’s process of privatization. Such a model has hinged upon the logic of a big private firm that, on the one hand, has sought to disembed itself from the <b>socio-institutional</b> context and, on the other, has set and followed its own rules with disruptive effects on the local society and environment, {{as well as on the}} plant’s economic viability.

40|$|Addressing {{the global}} {{challenges}} {{of climate change}} (CC), food security and poverty alleviation requires enhancing the adaptive capacity and mitigation potential of land use systems. To this end, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) aims to identify land use practices that sustainably increase productivity, enhance climate change (CC) adaptation and contribute to CC mitigation. A transition towards CSA requires technical, but also <b>socio-institutional</b> changes, for improved smallholder agricultural systems. Such changes may be triggered by stakeholder participation processes that stimulate social learning and collective action. This article evaluates whether a role-playing game (RPG) is an effective participatory tool to encourage social learning and collective action among local stakeholders towards adoption of CSA strategies. We designed and implemented an RPG with three groups of farmers in Apuí (Southern Amazonas), evaluating the game’s impact on social learning by interviewing each farmer {{before and after the}} RPG.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a set of}} {{criteria}} is proposed {{for the evaluation of}} the potential contribution of modelling tools to strengthening the multifunctionality of agriculture. The four main areas of evaluation are (1) policy relevance, (2) the temporal resolution and scope, (3) the degree to which spatial and <b>socio-institutional</b> scales and heterogeneity are addressed and (4) the level of integration in the assessment of scientific dimensions and of the multiple functions of agriculture. The evaluative criteria are applied to the portfolio of modelling approaches developed and applied in a joint project of the French research institute INRA and the Dutch Wageningen University & Research Centre. The CLUE-S model focuses on prediction of changes in multifunctional land-use at regional scale, given a set of predetermined scenarios or policy variants, e. g. for ex-ante policy assessment and initiation of discussions on regional development. The two other modelling approaches are complementary and aim to address multifunctional farming activities. The Landscape IMAGES framework generates a range of static images of possible but sometimes distant futures for multifunctional farming activities in a small region or landscape. It supports the exploration of trade-offs between financial returns from agriculture, landscape quality, nature conservation and restoration, and environmental quality. Co-Viability Analysis generates trajectories of states and farming decisions fulfilling a given set of ecological and productive constraints representing a desired and sustainable future. The three modelling approaches differ in their policy relevance, in the ways that spatial and <b>socio-institutional</b> scales are addressed and in their degree of explicitation of interaction between the various functions of agriculture, but jointly cover most of the desired capabilities for assessment of multifunctionality. Caveats were particularly identified in the integration of the <b>socio-institutional</b> dimension and the related heterogeneity. Although the model portfolio did not completely satisfy the demands of the set of evaluative criteria, it is concluded that, due to their complementarities, in combination the three models could significantly contribute to further development and strengthening of multifunctionality...|$|E
40|$|We try to {{construct}} a bridge between an institutional perspective on poverty and poverty interventions (Bastiaensen, De Herdt & Vaessen 2002) and a more operational screening instrument {{to be used for}} a local <b>socio-institutional</b> analysis of anti-poverty interventions (LSIA). While reviewing existing research approaches, we discuss three fundamental issues that need {{to be taken into account}} in order to develop a more operational instrument for a <b>socio-institutional</b> analysis of development interventions. The first point is that poverty analysis should focus on the local level, since the final poverty effects of intervention clearly play at this level. This requires an appropriate understanding of what is meant as ‘the local level’, an issue we will deal with in both economic and sociological terms. Second, we must acknowledge that a locality is a pluriform social landscape whose dynamics are co-determined by interdependent but autonomously deciding actors of different kinds and with different interests and worldviews. The third and final issue is that one should be sufficiently aware of the role and position of the researchers. In the process of generating and interpreting information, researchers are ‘discursively’ interacting with local actors in their institutional environments. As we will see, the problem for the researchers is not unlike that of the development experts. ...|$|E
40|$|Does the new {{technological}} paradigm {{based on}} {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) create new windows of opportunity or further obstacles for catching up countries? The paper discusses this question by taking neo-Schumpeterian long wave theory as the basic framework of analysis. According to this approach, the current rapid diffusion of the ICT-based paradigm marks the initial phase of a fifth long wave period. The first part of the paper focuses on the major changes that characterize the techno-economic system in the fifth long wave, and points out that the new paradigm is leading to several new opportunities for developing economies. If public policies will actively foster the development process by rapidly investing in the new technologies and in the related infrastructures and skills, these new opportunities will indeed be successfully exploited. The second part of the paper shifts the focus to the <b>socio-institutional</b> system, and argues that institutional changes driven by some major actors in the industrialized world are creating a new international regime where the scope and the resources available for State interventions are significantly reduced. The paper concludes by suggesting the existence of a temporary mismatch between the techno-economic and the <b>socio-institutional</b> system, which makes the catching up process more difficult for large parts of the developing world. ...|$|E

While Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) projects have often promoted communicative competence in classrooms where English is taught as a second or foreign language (Chitanana, 2010), they have failed {{due to a lack}} of common conditions between the participating classrooms (O'Dowd & Ritter, 2006). This case study explores the potential to promote communicative competence in primary classrooms in Sri Lanka. It addresses (i) if two sample primary school classrooms in Sri Lanka and Australia have the classroom and <b>socio-institutional</b> conditions required to participate in a collaborative project and (ii) if it can be integrated into the existing primary school curriculum in Sri Lanka. Data were gathered using questionnaires and face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 12 participants from Sri Lanka and Australia, and online data from the websites of the participants' institutions for triangulation purposes.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the macro-level {{phenomena}} associated with electronic commerce (EC), and it is mainly being informed by a study of the history of commerce. Commerce in its modem form first appeared in early 13 th century in Italy where the political conditions were conducive for it. Trade facilitated the exchange of goods, thereby enhancing the efficiency between production and consumption. Even more important than this was its role in the creation of many modem business practices and institutions. Trade also raised the level of human capital, and promoted the spread of ideas and information, and with them people's attitudes and modes of behaviour. Traders formed an important source of information for military conquerors like Genghis Khan. The current historical context favorable to EC is globalization. The emergence of network organizations has provided many of the practices supporting business-to-business electronic commerce. EC holds the potential to reduce time and transaction costs. However, the most profound implications of EC are likely to be beyond this; they are likely to be at the macro-level or <b>socio-institutional</b> level. Some implications are already around while others are in the process of formation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to use {{historical}} insights from modern commerce as entry points to examine the macro-level phenomena associated with electronic commerce (EC). Commerce in its modern form first appeared in early 13 th century Italy where conducive political conditions existed. Trade facilitated the exchange of goods, thereby enhancing the efficiency of processes between production and consumption. Even more important was its role in raising the level of human capital, promoting the spread of ideas and information, changing people’s attitudes and behaviour. Some modern business practices and institutions which evolved with modern commerce are bookkeeping, modern banking, commodities market, putting out systems (or outsourcing as we know it now), insurance, stock exchange, and venture capital. The current historical context favorable to EC is globalization. The emergence of network organizations helped to establish some of the practices supporting business-to-business electronic commerce.

However, the historical perspective suggests that the most profound implications of EC are likely to be at the macro-level or <b>socio-institutional</b> level.
