5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E

25|$|By comparison, {{the budget}} for the pilot episode of the 1964 Australian topical revue series The Mavis Bramston Show was just AU₤1500.

25|$|The Labor state government, under premier Doug Lowe, {{backed down}} from the {{original}} proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new Wild Rivers National Park. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme. While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.|$|E
25|$|Those that {{argue in}} favor of the claim that humans are the direct cause of the ground sloths’ {{extinction}} point out that the few sloths that remain are small sloths that {{spend most of their time}} in trees, making it difficult for them to be spotted by humans. Although these sloths were sufficiently hidden, they <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been affected by the climate changes that supposedly wiped out the ground sloths. Additionally, after the continental ground sloths disappeared, insular sloths of the Caribbean remained for approximately 6,000 years longer (these islands were not colonized by humans until about 5500 yr BP).|$|E

The final BCS poll had seven teams from the SEC and the Big Ten {{ranked in the top}} twelve, but by the rule only two from each conference were eligible to play in BCS games, offering the opportunity to argue that both conferences are over-ranked, that the Big Ten schedule does not produce a true conference champion, or that the limit of 2 teams from any one conference is inappropriate.|$|E

25|$|The Giants wasted {{several seconds}} in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and {{took it upon himself}} to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E

He was already ill and old for his years, so would probably not have succeeded Heath as party leader, but might have prevented Thatcher from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The Colts had two late {{opportunities}} to score on separate drives. On the first drive, the Colts faced a 4th down {{from inside the}} Charger 20-yard line. They decided against a field goal which <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left them down by 1 point. Trying for the score, Peyton Manning was hurried by a blitzing Shawne Merriman as his throw came up short. The Chargers took over on downs but failed to get a first down. After a long punt by Mike Scifres, the Colts had less than 2 minutes {{to try to win}} the game. Once again, the Chargers defense stifled the Colts, taking over on downs with seconds to play.|$|E

500|$|In 1907, the Naval General Staff made a {{proposal}} for a radical reconstruction that was similar to the proposals to reconstruct [...] and [...] made before the Russo-Japanese War that involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-calibre guns and the compound armor replaced by Krupp armor. This new proposal differed from the older one in that eight [...] guns replaced the ten six-inch guns originally planned.

500|$|The Japanese started {{designing}} the B64 class, which {{was similar to}} the Alaska but with [...] guns. News of the Alaskas led them to upgrade the design, creating Design B-65. Armed with 356mm guns, the B65s would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had only sufficient protection to keep out eight-inch shells. Much like the Dutch, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like the Alaskas, the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as super-heavy cruisers.|$|E
500|$|At the 2010 Comic-Con, Welling {{stated that}} Rosenbaum {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Lex in the series and wanted to return in some degree for the show's final season, but {{that he needed to}} finalize the details.

After months of speculation, the actor finally agreed to appear in the finale. Rosenbaum explained that his return was for the fans, stating, [...] "I appreciate all of their passion, their relentlessness, and even their threats." [...] Had Rosenbaum not elected to return, Souders explained that Lex <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> played a part, but would have been more of [...] "a puppeteer behind the scenes" [...] {{and the fact that he}} was still living would have [...] "been a reveal at the end of the show", sans the dialogue.|$|E
500|$|In baseball, {{batting average}} (AVG) {{is a measure}} of a batter's success rate in {{achieving}} a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). In MLB, a player in each league wins the [...] "batting title" [...] each season for having the highest batting average that year. The American League (AL) winner is known as the [...] "Rod Carew American League Batting Champion", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the [...] "Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion". Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title. However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the highest batting average, he wins the title. Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs. Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to [...]349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records. Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134). He also held NL career marks in {{categories}} such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951). He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category. [...] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military. [...] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. [...] His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. [...] He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. [...] His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road. [...] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191. [...] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he <b>still</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been 354 hits short of tying Ty. [...] His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) {{he would have had to}} play to age 47 to attain the hits record.|$|E
