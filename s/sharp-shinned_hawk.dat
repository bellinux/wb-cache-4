5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk,</b> though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk,</b> which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk,</b> {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk,</b> which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk.

500|$|One {{important}} use of American kestrels is in falconry. It {{is often}} considered a beginner's bird, though the careful weight control {{needed to maintain}} the kestrel's desire to aggressively hunt takes skill. Falconers experienced in extracting the best performance the species is capable of report they are highly reliable on the normal game of sparrows and starlings. More aggressive individuals are sometimes capable of capturing prey up to approximately twice their own body weight, allowing the occasional capture of true game birds such as quail and dove. However, most falconers interested in the reliable taking of such game do prefer larger falcons or hawks. The advantage the American kestrel offers the experienced falconer is its suitability to simple and urban falconry not requiring large tracts of land {{or the use of}} hunting dogs. This form of falconry is sometimes referred to as [...] "micro-falconry" [...] or [...] "micro-hawking." [...] The other small raptor species commonly used in micro-falconry are the Merlin, the <b>Sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk</b> (the smallest accipiter), and the European kestrel (a true kestrel).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of habitat {{parameters}} and human disturbance on the nesting success of goshawks, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s <b>hawks,</b> and <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawks</b> in an area within the Cache National Forest of Utah and Idaho. This research should provide the wildlife manager with information of value in planning recreation areas, roads, timber cuttings, and other activities where impacts are considered. Of the three accipiter species studied, the goshawk showed the greatest preference for isolation from man. It nested at higher elevations (X= 2, 065 m); farther from human disturbance (X= 250 m); higher in trees (X= 12 m) / farther into cover (X= 55 m) [generally in a mature forest]; and in proximity to water (X= 394 m) with considerable horizontal visibility form the nest (X= 53 m). The average number of young fledged from goshawk nests was 1. 4. The nesting Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s hawk was more tolerant to human disturbance (X= 147 m); nested closest to water (X= 220 m); at moderate elevation (X= 1, 782 m); and in average of 8 m above ground. Their range over-lapped that of recreational activities and also that of <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawks.</b> Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s hawks fledged an average of 1. 6 young per nest. The <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawks</b> nested farthest from water (X= 444 m); at about the same elevation as Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s hawks (X= 1, 789 m); closer to human disturbance (X= 161 m); closer to the ground (X= 6 m); and in nests with short horizontal visibility (X= 14 m). The <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawks</b> fledged an average of 2. 1 young per nest. As a general rule, all of the accipiters studied preferred to nest on the lower part of a north-facing slope with a well-developed tree canopy. Goshawks appeared to be most sensitive to man, while the Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s and <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawks</b> were similar in habitat requirements and had nesting sites in closer proximity to human activities...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk</b> is {{sometimes}} separated into four species, {{with the northern}} group (see distribution) retaining both the scientific name and the common name: <b>sharp-shinned</b> <b>hawk</b> (A. striatus). In addition to the nominate taxon (A. s. striatus), it includes subspecies perobscurus, velox, suttoni, madrensis, fringilloides, and venator. The three remaining taxa, each considered a monotypic species if split, are the white-breasted hawk (A. chionogaster; Kaup, 1852), plain-breasted hawk (A. ventralis; Sclater, 1866) and rufous-thighed hawk (A. erythronemius; Kaup, 1850). The breeding ranges of the groups are entirely allopatric, although the wintering range of the nominate group partially overlaps with the range of chionogaster (as {{is also the case}} with certain taxa within the nominate group). This allopatry combined with differences in plumage (see appearance) and, apparently, certain measurements, has been the background for the split, but hard scientific data are presently lacking (AOU). Disregarding field guides, most material published in recent years (e.g. AOU, Ferguson-Lees et al. p.586, and Dickinson et al.) has therefore considered all to be members of a single widespread species – but not without equivocation: Ferguson-Lees et al. say that if they were to make a world list, they would include the three taxa as separate species (p.75), and the AOU's comment includes the note [...] "split almost certainly good".|$|E
