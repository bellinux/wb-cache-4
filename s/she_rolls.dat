500|$|At the {{beginning}} of this 30 Rock episode, Liz tells Jack that she and Jenna used to perform improvisation at corporate retreats. In a flashback, the audience shout out Sling Blade and Oprah as suggestions for Liz and Jenna to do. Liz does the impression of the Sling Blade character, but Jenna believed that Liz was Oprah. Tracy becomes intrigued with the idea of having his foot replaced with a wheel, after Dr. Spaceman informs him that if diabetes is left untreated he could lose a foot, to which he asks Dr. Spaceman [...] "Could I replace it with a wheel like Rosie from The Jetsons?" [...] Rosie is the humanoid robot maid for the title family, and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> about on a set of caster wheels. When the TGS writers learn from Jenna that she will be employing method acting, Frank suggests that she do her research of Janis Joplin on Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia. When Frank sees Jenna getting ready to eat a cat, he stops her and tells her that ALF, an extraterrestrial, eats cats. After admitting that she hooked up with Frank, Jenna reveals that Dog the Bounty Hunter is the second grossest guy she has ever been with.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{considers}} the Arethusa a good sea-boat, {{and that she}} steams well against a moderate head sea and strong wind, but that <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> heavily when the sea is abeam or abaft; she is therefore unsteady as a gun-platform under these conditions, and, on account of her quick and heavy rolling, 'accurate shooting would be an impossibility, and machine guns in the tops would be useless.' ...|$|E
60|$|Pig-wig's head bobbed {{lower and}} lower, until <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> over, a little round ball, fast {{asleep on the}} hearth-rug.|$|R
60|$|There was scarce {{a breath}} of wind now, and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> so I thought she would have turned turtle.|$|R
60|$|The {{young lady}} sighed. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> {{her eyes at}} Mr. Waddington in a manner which {{was meant to be}} languishing.|$|R
2500|$|Damage in M {{is handled}} {{differently}} as well. M {{does not use}} Hit Points. Instead, characters have a fourth Saving Throw called the Toughness Save ("Damage Save" [...] in the previous edition) {{which is based on}} their Constitution scores (just like Fortitude). Weapons and powers that do lethal and subdual damage do not roll any dice to determine damage. Instead, damaging attacks are ranked based upon their overall power. For example, a fairly fit but normal human may throw a punch that inflicts +1N (non-lethal) damage, while the irradiated simian mastermind with enhanced strength and razor-sharp claws throws out +12L (lethal) damage. When a character is struck by an attack, he or <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> a Toughness Save against a target number equal to the rank of the attack plus 15. Success allows the character to shrug off the attack with minimal effect, while failure results in injury according to the degree of failure and the type of damage. Accumulated damage applies a penalty to further saves, increasing the chances of any given attack taking the character down.|$|E
2500|$|The Maiden Queen {{featured}} breeches roles, {{where the}} actress appeared in men's clothes under one pretense or another, and as Bax supposes [...] "was {{one of the}} first occasions upon which a woman appeared in the disguise of a man"; if nothing else this could draw an audience eager to see the women show off their figures in the more form-fitting male attire. The attraction had another dynamic: the theatres sometimes had a hard time holding onto their actresses, as they were swept up to become the kept mistresses of the aristocracy. In 1667, Nell Gwyn made such a match with Charles Sackville, titled Lord Buckhurst at that time. She supposedly caught his eye during an April performance of All Mistaken, or The Mad Couple, especially in one scene in which, to escape a hugely fat suitor able to move only by rolling, <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> across the stage herself, her feet toward the audience and her petticoats flying about. A satire of the time describes this and also Hart's position now, in the face of competition from the upper echelons of society: ...|$|E
2500|$|On Holy Thursday, 2 April 1874, {{when she}} was 15 months old, she {{returned}} to Alençon where her family surrounded her with affection. [...] "I hear the baby calling me Mama! as she goes down the stairs. On every step, she calls out Mama! and if I don't respond every time, she remains there without going either forward or back." [...] (Madame Martin to Pauline, 21 November 1875) She was educated in a very Catholic environment, including Mass attendance at 5:30 AM, the strict observance of fasts, and prayer {{to the rhythm of}} the liturgical year. The Martins also practiced charity, visiting the sick and elderly and welcoming the occasional vagabond to their table. [...] Even if she wasn't the model little girl her sisters later portrayed, Thérèse was very sensitive to this education. She played at being a nun. Described as generally a happy child, she was emotional too, and often cried: [...] "Céline is playing with the little one with some bricks... I have to correct poor baby who gets into frightful tantrums when she can't have her own way. <b>She</b> <b>rolls</b> in the floor in despair believing all is lost. Sometimes she is so overcome she almost chokes. She's a nervous child, but she is very good, very intelligent, and remembers everything." [...] At 22, Thérèse, then a Carmelite, admitted: [...] "I was far from being a perfect little girl." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> over, {{drawing the}} clothes about her, and Mary Louise softly left the darkened room {{and went down}} to breakfast.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> {{him over}} on his chest, and left him to {{struggle}} to {{the shelter of the}} rock while she went for more wood.|$|R
60|$|With {{the same}} practical, business-like directness, but perhaps a certain unbusiness-like haste superadded, <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> up the {{manuscript}} and dispatched {{it with the}} letter.|$|R
60|$|The yelling Ghost {{before him}} stands, See! <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> her eyes around, Now {{she lifts her}} bony hands, Now her {{footsteps}} shake the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{she may not}} do," [...] called Eric to Skallagrim, [...] "if once <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> side on {{to those}} seas Ran has her, for she must fill and sink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruined from end to end," [...] {{said the}} man of machinery. [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>rolls,</b> the forward {{cylinder}} will come down and go through her bottom. Both columns are clean cut through. There's nothing to hold anything up." ...|$|E
60|$|Light {{she rode}} in the rude tide-rip, to {{left and right}} <b>she</b> <b>rolled,</b> And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.|$|R
6000|$|Her tear-washed mind became vaguely friendly. With an {{unconscious}} comfort it focussed {{down to the}} robin. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> over, sat up, and imitated his friendly [...] "cheep." ...|$|R
60|$|I snorted, and he laughed, {{and the old}} sow grunted with contempt, and {{her little}} eyes twisted towards us with a demoniac leer as <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> past.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} between daybreak and sunrise {{of the morning}} of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, 'There <b>she</b> <b>rolls!</b> there she rolls!' Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.|$|E
6000|$|... "They notice nothing, these others," [...] he remarked, with {{a little}} wave of the hand. [...] "It is always the woman who counts. You are right, monsieur. She dances like a stick. She has good calves and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> her eyes. The canaille applaud. It is always like that. Your health, monsieur!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>rolls</b> up {{her left}} sleeve; clasps her arm with [...] the thumb and fingers {{of her right}} hand; and looks [...] down at the bruise. Then she raises her head and [...] looks {{straight}} at him. Finally, with a superb [...] gesture she presents her arm to be kissed. Amazed, [...] he looks at her; at the arm; at her again; [...] hesitates; and then, with shuddering intensity, [...] exclaims) ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Trimble bowled {{over the}} grand manner {{as if it}} had been a small fowl and she an automobile. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> over it and {{squashed}} it flat.|$|R
60|$|The Silver Shoes took {{but three}} steps, {{and then she}} stopped so {{suddenly}} that <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've niver put us out o' bounds," [...] said Mother Yeo. [...] "Bide yeou still, {{my little}} dearrs." [...] <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> {{into the inner}} room to make the score.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{talk about}} her. She used to be married to someone, and she {{divorced}} him. And then she was married to someone else, and he divorced her. And I'm certain her hair wasn't that colour two years ago, and I don't think a woman ought to make up like that, and her dress is all wrong for the country, and those pearls can't be genuine, and I hate the way <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> her eyes about, and pink doesn't suit her a bit. I think she's an awful woman, and I wish you wouldn't keep on talking about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I said--"She is {{warmer than}} Dian: [...] <b>She</b> <b>rolls</b> through an ether of sighs-- [...] She revels {{in a region}} of sighs. [...] She has seen that the tears are not dry on [...] These cheeks, where the worm never dies, [...] And has come past {{the stars of the}} Lion, [...] To point us the path to the skies-- [...] To the Lethean peace of the skies-- [...] Come up, in despite of the Lion, [...] To shine on us with her bright eyes-- [...] Come up, through the lair of the Lion, [...] With love in her {{luminous}} eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Darlin' Joe,' (a touch more affectionate than yours--eh! skipper?) `if our dear darlin' babby {{will let}} me, I'm a-goin' to write you a letter-- there, I know'd she wouldn't. She's bin and capsized the wash-tub, though, as you know, she can't walk yet, but <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> about most awful, Joe, {{just what you}} say the Evening Star does in a gale on the North Sea. An' she's got most dreadful heels--oh! you've no idear! Whativer they comes down upon goes--' There's a big blot here," [...] said Joe, with a puzzled look, [...] "`goes--whativer they comes down upon goes--' No, I can't make it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|So <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> the Stone {{over the}} little hillock, {{and just as}} she did so her {{attention}} was attracted by a curious noise that sounded like [...] "Pop! pop! pop!" ...|$|R
50|$|Into the {{narrowing}} channel, {{between the}} shoreAnd the sunk torpedoes lying in treacherous rank;She turned but a yard too short; a muffled roar,A mountainous wave, and <b>she</b> <b>rolled,</b> righted, and sank.|$|R
60|$|See, now, if Gudruda were gone, if <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> {{a corpse}} into those boiling waters, Eric might yet be hers; or, {{if he was}} not hers, yet Gudruda's he could never be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, young masters, {{you will}} take those two bunks on the top there. John Lirriper and I will sleep on the lockers {{underneath}} you. The man and the boy have the two on the other side. I {{put you on the}} top because there is a side board, and you can't fall out if <b>she</b> <b>rolls,</b> and besides, the bunks are rather wider than the lockers below. If the wind is fair you won't have much of our company, because we shall hold on till we moor alongside the wharves of London; but if it's foul, or there is not enough of it to take us against tide, we have to anchor on the ebb, and then of course we turn in." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{is rather}} slow. We still drift, drift, drift along--at {{intervals}} a spanking breeze and then--drift again--hardly move {{for half a}} day. But I enjoy it. We have such snowy moonlight, and such gorgeous sunsets. And the ship is so easy--even in a gale <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> very little, compared to other vessels--and in this calm we could dance on deck, if we chose. You can walk a crack, so steady is she. Very different from the Ajax. My trunk used to get loose in the stateroom and rip and tear around the place {{as if it had}} life in it, and I always had to take my clothes off in bed because I could not stand up and do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's blowing {{about as}} hard as it can be," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>rolls</b> fit to take the masts out of her. There don't seem no chance of the gale breaking, and none of the other ships of the fleet are in sight. That's about all I have to tell you, except that I told the captain that if he didn't get the hatches lifted a little we should be all stifled down here. He says if there's a bit of a lull he will ask them to give us a little fresh air, and in the mean time he says that any who are good sailors may go up on deck, but it will be at their own risk, for some of the seas go pretty nearly clean over her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> over, {{scrambling}} into a cross-legged posture on the bed. He {{could see}} her eyes shining. But she did not speak; she seemed to know that in silence was her strength.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{it is my}} turn, old lady," [...] ejaculated Higgs, and {{straightway}} {{missed her}} clean {{from a distance of}} five yards. A second shot was more successful, and <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> over, dead.|$|R
5000|$|Investigation of {{the ships}} loss was {{rendered}} difficult {{by the lack of}} any survivors, but one former member of her crew, Able Seaman John Varling, testified that he had found her [...] "exceedingly crank, as being overweight.. <b>She</b> <b>rolled</b> 32 degrees, and Captain Stirling is reported as having been heard to remark that had <b>she</b> <b>rolled</b> one degree more she must have gone over and foundered. The young sailors were either too timid to go aloft or were incapacitated by sea-sickness... Varling states that they hid themselves away, and could not be found when wanted by the boatswains mate." ...|$|R
