40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{field in}} the coatings industry is the coating of porous media, with broad applications in paper, apparel, textile, electronics, bioengineering, filtration and energy sector. A primary industrial scale process {{that can be used}} to coat porous media in a fast and flexible manner is <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> <b>extrusion.</b> A major concern when coating porous media with a wetting fluid is fluid penetration into the substrate. Although some level of penetration is desirable to obtain specific material properties, inadequate or excessive fluid penetration can negatively affect the strength, functionality or performance of the resulting material. In spite of its apparent industrial importance, limited modeling and experimental work has been conducted to study fluid penetration into porous media during fabrication. The effects of processing parameters on the penetration depth, the effects of penetration on material quality, and the method to predict and control the penetration depth are not well understood. This dissertation is composed of two parts. Part I is an applied study for coating onto porous media. This part focuses on the first objective of this dissertation which is to elucidate clearly the feasibility, advantages and disadvantages of the direct coating method as a potential fabrication route for membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEA samples are fabricated using both traditional and the direct coating methods. Then, the quality and performance of the MEA samples are examined. Experimental results in Part I demonstrate that it is feasible to fabricate MEAs using the direct coating method. However, Nafion® solution penetrates into the catalyst layer during the coating process and causes lower performance of fuel cells, which is the motivation for Part II of this thesis. The objective of Part II is to fundamentally understand the fluid penetration process and predict the penetration depth when directly coating porous media, using a comprehensive approach. A series of computational and analytical models are developed to predict the penetration depth for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with or without capillary pressure. Finally the accuracy of developed models are validated through experiments. The relative error between the predicted and experimentally measured penetration depth is generally lower than 20 %. Ph.

Includes bibliographical references and (some col. illustrations). Coating tensioned-web running over <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> is an efficient way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> pre-metering and carefully controlled web transport. It is different from conventional <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating, where the coating gap is maintained by the clearance between backup roll and <b>slot</b> <b>die,</b> in that coating gap is maintained by elastohydrodynamic balance between the tension-resultant force of the curved and tensioned web and the pressure in the coating bead; with this setup much thinner coating gap is made than is possible in conventional <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating. For successful operation in tensioned-web coating system, properly designed die is necessary. In conventional <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating, pressure profile in the coating bead is well understood and efficiently predicted by considerations based on the one-dimensional viscocapillary model. The model to describe the pressure and gap profiles in tensioned-web <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating needs to incorporate {{the interaction between the}} liquid flow and the web deformation, leading to a nonlinear system of equations. In this thesis, coating bead flows and gap profiles in both single-layer and two-layer tensioned-web <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating were studied by theoretical model based on shell theory and lubrication approximation, hybridized with two-dimensional flow model when two-dimensional flow model is necessary, and visualization using bench-top web transport system with <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> mounted. The results from visualization and theoretical model study show that a tensioned-web <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating die {{can be viewed as a}} combination of component foil bearings. Interpreting the results in this manner, it is easier to predict how the change in die shape and process condition will affect the pressure and gap profiles and therefore easier to design the die shapes required to achieve desired process states, as thin and fast coating, stable two layer coating, or to predict and remove the appearance of microvortexes. By the two-dimensional model on the flow of the two-layer coating, positioning of separation line and appearance of the microvortexes inside the feed slot were studied with the changes in operation condition...|$|R

40|$|In {{aluminium}} extrusion processes, friction inside the bearing channel {{is important for}} controlling the surface quality of the extrusion products. The contact materials show a large hardness difference, one being hot aluminium, and the other being hardened tool steel. Further, the contact pressure is high, which means that contact at the bearing–aluminium interface is fully plastic.

This roughness based contact model is applied on the mesoscopic scale to calculate the length stick- and slip zones in the bearing–extrudate interface.
