40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{anaerobic}} fluidised bed reactor (AnFBR) of 2000 L capacity was studied {{to determine its}} performance to treat palm oil mill effluent (POME). The pilot plant was operated at ambient temperature with diluted POME as substrate. It took 17 days for the start-up of the reactor with pre-seeded sand media. The AnFBR was capable to remove {{a large portion of}} organics at relatively shorter retention time. Maximum and minimum COD removal efficiency of 85 % and 65 % were attained at a loading rate of 4. 0 and 13. 8 kgCOD/m 3. d.

40|$|The {{present study}} focused on the {{influence}} of the apparent viscosity of activated sludge on mixed liquor oxygen transfer rates, and examined whether both could be modified by the addition of an organic polyelectrolyte. Batch experiments carried out using mixed liquor samples in stirred tank reactors revealed that Î±-factors, which incorporate any difference in oxygen mass transfer coefficient values between clean water and mixed liquor samples, showed exponential relationships when plotted against increases in mixed liquor apparent viscosities and sludge mixed liquid suspended solids values. Furthermore, oxygen mass transfer coefficients increased exponentially with increases in the Reynolds number, a parameter which reflects liquid turbulence levels Oxygen mass transfer rates of five sludge samples collected from four full scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) also increased by about 10 % after flocculation, while with a sludge sample collected from the lab scale reactor, it decreased by about 5 %. One likely explanation is that the apparent viscosities of the WWTPs and the lab-reactor sludges decreased and increased respectively after flocculation. Such changes probably reflect changes in the volume fraction of mixed liquor suspended solids as indicated by changes in <b>sludge</b> <b>volume</b> <b>indices,</b> particle size values and endogenous respiration rates before and after flocculation. These findings assist in developing an understanding of how oxygen mass transfer characteristics may be affected by activated sludge suspensions, and hence assist in reducing the operational costs of WWTPs...|$|R
40|$|Thesis ((M. Environmental Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. From June to November 2007, a {{microscopic}} {{analysis was conducted}} on the activated sludge from eleven selected wastewater treatment plants (WWTP's) belonging to the City of Cape Town. The primary objective was the identification of the dominant and secondary filamentous organisms. Other important criteria included were the floe character, diversity, filament index (Fl) and identification of the protozoan and metazoan communities. The operational data determined from routine analyses of the sludge, influent and effluent were used to assess the relationship of the filamentous population to wastewater characteristics and to compare this with previous findings. Fl values of > 3 and dissolved <b>sludge</b> <b>volume</b> <b>indices</b> (DSVI's) of > 150 were chosen as representing the possibility of bulking conditions being present. The five most prevalent dominant filaments were Type 0092, Type 1851, actinomycetes, Microthrix parvicella and Type 021 N, being present in 74 %, 31 %, 22 %, 17 % and 14 % of samples respectively. Type 0092 {{did not appear to be}} associated with bulking in any of the WWTP's, although it was often incidentally present as a co-dominant species when bulking conditions existed. All three WWTP's with the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration harboured Type 1851 as the major dominant species, irrespective of whether the plants treated domestic or industrial effluent. Conditions suggestive of bulking were present in two of these WWTP's. Contrary to expectations, Type 1851 was often found as a dominant species where domestic waste was the primary influent. Type 021 N and actinomycetes were strongly implicated when bulking occurred. The overgrowth of these filaments appeared to be related to factors such as nutrient deficiency (Type 021 N) or the presence of large amounts of low molecular weight substances in the influent. Microthrix parvicella did not cause major bulking problems. There was a strong association between low levels of nitrates/nitrites in the clarifier supernatant and good phosphorous removal, irrespective of the configuration of the WWTP. The converse was also true. Master...|$|R

40|$|Predicting {{the flow}} behaviour, most notably, the {{apparent}} viscosity and yield stress of sludge mixtures inside the anaerobic digester is essential {{because it helps}} optimize the mixing system in digesters. This paper investigates the rheology of sludge mixtures {{as a function of}} digested <b>sludge</b> <b>volume</b> fraction. <b>Sludge</b> mixtures exhibited non-Newtonian, shear thinning, yield stress behaviour. The apparent viscosity and yield stress of sludge mixtures prepared at the same total solids concentration was influenced by the interactions within the digested sludge and increased with the volume fraction of digested sludge - highlighted using shear compliance and shear modulus of sludge mixtures. However, when a thickened primary - secondary sludge mixture was mixed with dilute digested sludge, the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased with increasing the volume fraction of digested sludge. This was caused by the dilution effect leading to a reduction in the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic interactions when dilute digested sludge was added. Correlations were developed to predict the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixtures {{as a function of the}} digested <b>sludge</b> <b>volume</b> fraction and total solids concentration of the mixtures. The parameters of correlations can be estimated using pH of sludge.

For each case, the steam bump potential was evaluated starting the simulation with a realistic best estimate initial temperature distribution {{as well as with}} a conservative potentially possible axial temperature distribution in the sludge. To include further conservatism in estimating the consequent release of radioactive material, steam bump analyses were also performed suppressing steam condensation with subcooled liquid in waste. In addition,calculations were performed with in leakage flow paths corresponding to open risers and pump and sluice pit cover blocks as well as with normal in leakage flow paths due to drain pipes and infiltration paths. Therefore, the report presents the steam bump evaluations encompassing from an extremely conservative case of initiating a steam bump with local saturation temperature throughout the sludge with condensation suppressed and open risers to a realistic potential case with loss of cooling of initiating at steam bump with only the bottom layer with local saturation temperature with condensation included considering only the normal in leakage flow paths. The results show that in all cases the consequences from an energetic bump may not be acceptable, and the safe operation should include keeping peak sludge temperatures below local saturation values.

MethodsWe analyzed 248 consecutive patients who underwent surgical ventricular reconstruction at a single center. There were 14 perioperative deaths (5. 6 %). The 234 surviving patients had pre- and postsurgical ventricular reconstruction echocardiographic measurement of end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and stroke <b>volume,</b> each <b>indexed</b> to body size and ejection fraction. A total of 120 patients had echocardiography data at follow-up (median 8 months). ResultsOverall, surgical ventricular reconstruction resulted in reductions in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (â 30 % Â± 18 %) and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (â 37 % Â± 20 %), and increases in ejection fraction (21 % Â± 18 % relative increase). However, stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decreased from 35 Â± 8 mL/m 2 preoperatively to 28 Â± 7 mL/m 2 early postoperatively (a 17 % Â± 24 % relative reduction, PÂ <Â . 0001); 165 patients (71 %) exhibited a decrease and 69 Â patients (29 %) exhibited an increase or no change in stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> after surgical ventricular reconstruction. Stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> reduction was strictly related to end-diastolic volume reduction. Patients who initially had a stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decrease showed recovery, so {{that at the time}} of chronic follow-up there was no significant difference between the groups.
