40|$|A {{rocket engine}} <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> {{component}} development test was recently {{conducted at the}} Marshall Space Flight Center. This <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> is intended to power a rocket engine turbopump by the combustion of Lox and RP- 1.

During testing the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> injector was modified to improve distribution of outer wall coolant and the igniter boss was modified to investigate {{the use of a}} pyrotechnic igniter. Expected chamber pressure oscillations at longitudinal acoustic mode were measured for three different chamber lengths tested. High amplitude discrete oscillations resulted in the chamber-alone configurations when chamber acoustic modes coupled with feed-system acoustics modes. For the full <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> configuration, which included a turbine inlet manifold, high amplitude oscillations occurred only at off-design very low power levels.

40|$|Testing of a {{powerpack}} configuration (turbomachinery and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly) and {{the first}} complete engine system of the liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen propellant J- 2 X rocket engine have been completed at the NASA Stennis Space Center. The combustion stability characteristics of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assemblies on these two systems are of interest for reporting since considerable effort was expended to eliminate combustion instability during early development of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly with workhorse hardware. Comparing the final workhorse <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly development test data to the powerpack and engine system test data provides an opportunity to investigate how the nearly identical configurations of <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assemblies operate with two very different propellant supply systems one the autonomous pressure-fed test configuration on the workhorse development test stand, the other the pump-fed configurations on the powerpack and engine systems. The development of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly {{and the elimination of}} the combustion instability on the pressure-fed workhorse test stand have been reported extensively in the two previous Liquid Propulsion Subcommittee meetings 1 - 7. The powerpack and engine system testing have been conducted from mid- 2011 through 2012. All tests of the powerpack and engine system <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> systems to date have been stable. However, measureable dynamic behavior, similar to that observed on the pressure-fed test stand and reported in Ref. [6] and attributed to an injection-coupled response, has appeared in both powerpack and engine system tests. As discussed in Ref. [6], these injection-coupled responses are influenced by the interaction of the combustion chamber with a branch pipe in the hot gas duct that supplies gaseous helium to pre-spin the turbine during the start transient. This paper presents the powerpack and engine system <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> test data, compares these data to the development test data, and provides additional combustion stability analyses of the configurations...|$|R

50|$|A {{turboshaft}} engine {{may be made}} up of two major parts assemblies: the 'gas generator' and the 'power section'. The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> consists of the compressor, combustion chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles, and one or more stages of turbine. The power section consists of additional stages of turbines, a gear reduction system, and the shaft output. The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> creates the hot expanding gases to drive the power section.

50|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> {{control valve}} was a {{pneumatically}} operated poppet-type that was spring-loaded to the closed position. The fuel and oxidizer poppets were mechanically linked by an actuator. The valve controlled {{the flow of}} propellants through the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> injector. When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> control valve actuator assembly which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the maximum acceleration which causes shock for a missile {{is very important to}} prevent abnormal operation of a missile and decrease size and cost of missile components. Because the maximum acceleration created by operation of an ejection <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> occurs in the initial ejection stage, the design parameters which affect initial ejection stage were examined. The igniter and the nozzle closure were selected as design parameters of a <b>gas</b> <b>generator.</b> The maximum acceleration created by the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> was examined experimentally by changing of the design parameters.

5000|$|During transition, {{fuel to the}} <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> was not reduced, as in the Griffon 02 {{when the}} {{external}} flow was burning, but thrust available from the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> automatically decreased {{as a consequence of}} operating at a fixed turbine temperature limit and with increasing compressor inlet temperature. The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> RPM was kept at 100% to maintain maximum thrust. The transition to partial ramjet operation may be viewed as complete when, at cruise, the exhaust gas from the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> had no residual energy left for thrust production and all the engine thrust came from the afterburner. The afterburner may be viewed as a ramjet combustor with energy transfer from the turbine exhaust gas. In this characterization as a partial-ramjet the ram air burned in the combustor was about 8% of the turbine exhaust that was reheated (most of the 20% ram air was used for cooling [...] ). The airflow through the intake was being induced, or pumped, by the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> and heated with maximum afterburner, which gave a thrust distribution, at Mach 3+, of 54% inlet, 17.6% engine, 28.4% propelling nozzle.|$|R
