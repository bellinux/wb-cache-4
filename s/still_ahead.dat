5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On this train journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems <b>still</b> <b>ahead.</b> At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E

The 1500 meters saw an upset, as the leading favorite, Gene Venzke, only placed fourth and failed to qualify; Venzke had set a world record during the indoor season and an American record outdoors, but had lost his best shape after an injury in training.

25|$|Huxley's {{interest}} in education went still further than school and university classrooms; {{he made a}} great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated.

For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the Westminster Review, the Saturday Review, the Reader, the Pall Mall Gazette, Macmillan's Magazine, the Contemporary Review. Germany was <b>still</b> <b>ahead</b> in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.|$|E

Beatty ordered a reversal of course, now attempting to lead the German fleet northwards towards the British Grand Fleet. At this point a second signalling error occurred with flag signals sent to the 5th BS ordering it also to turn about. A signal was raised by Lion and seen by Barham as it steamed past the now retreating Lion in the opposite direction. However, the signal was not lowered (which was {{the point at which}} {{it was supposed to be}} carried out) until the battleships were dangerously close to the German fleet and under heavy fire, and then the order was to 'turn in succession'. This means each ship turns as it reaches exactly the same spot in the ocean, and in this situation marked out a perfect target area upon which the German fleet could aim as each British ship passed through it in turn. The last ship, Malaya, seeing the firefight ahead turned early.|$|E

25|$|A {{defensive}} stop on USC's next {{possession and}} a 15-yard punt return gave Texas the ball near midfield, and the Longhorns capitalized when Young found Thomas for 14yards on one play, and Taylor running 30yards {{for a touchdown}} on another. Pino's extra point extended the Longhorns' lead to 16–7. On the next drive, Leinart threw a pass intended for Reggie Bush that was grabbed by Texas linebacker/safety Drew Kelson. But Kelson landed on his back after catching the pass and the ball popped out. The pass was ruled incomplete; equipment issues again prevented a review. USC's drive continued with a Leinart pass to wide receiver Dwayne Jarrett, the top Trojan receiver of the day with ten catches totaling 121yards, a quarterback keeper of 14yards, and a Bush 12-yard run took the Trojans to the Texas 13-yard line with 40seconds {{to play in the}} half. But two sacks by defensive tackle Frank Okam pushed USC back 13yards and forced the Trojans to use two timeouts. Consequently, Danelo's 43-yard field goal allowed USC three points, and the half ended with Texas <b>still</b> <b>ahead,</b> 16–10.|$|E
25|$|The 1987–88 {{campaign}} {{was the most}} successful yet – Luton achieved a famous 3–2 victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final at Wembley. Luton stunned the holders by taking a 1–0 lead early on through Brian Stein, and leading by that score at half time. By the 74th minute Arsenal had overhauled them, leading 2–1, and were <b>still</b> <b>ahead</b> with ten minutes to go with Luton's goal continually under siege throughout the second half. The match spun on its head when stand-in goalkeeper Andy Dibble turned Nigel Winterburn's penalty around the post with ten minutes left – had Winterburn scored, Arsenal would have almost certainly have won the final 3–1. In the last seven minutes Luton, galvanised by new self-belief, scored twice to win 3–2, Brian Stein sealing the win with the last kick of the match. On top of this, Luton finished ninth in the First Division, reached the FA Cup semi-finals before falling to Everton at Villa Park, and played at Wembley in the Simod Cup final against Reading, which they lost 4–1. The League Cup triumph, still Luton's only major trophy, {{would have been enough}} for UEFA Cup qualification; but at this time all English teams were banned from European competitions due to the Heysel Stadium Disaster.|$|E

These results left the Dodgers and Giants tied in the league at 101–61, necessitating a tie-breaker to decide the NL pennant. The two teams had also played closely against one another {{during the regular season}} to this point, with each winning 9 of their 18 match-ups prior to the tie-breaker. Dodgers' manager Walt Alston and Giants' manager Alvin Dark could not agree on dates and sites for the tie-breaker, so they flipped a coin to decide home field advantage. Alston won the flip, opting to play the first game in San Francisco and the remaining two games in Los Angeles. The Dodgers had been more successful at home in the season, holding a 53–28 (.654 winning percentage) record there while going 47–34 (.580) on the road. Alston had also won the flip for the 1959 tie-breaker, which the Dodgers had gone on to win, and had chosen the same format.|$|E
