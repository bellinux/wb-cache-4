50|$|The white, wooden {{church was}} {{designed}} by Rasmus M. Overrein and built in 1878. It was consecrated on 13 November 1878 by the bishop Andreas Grimelund. It was built to replace the old church which was a <b>small</b> <b>stave</b> church that stood nearby in western Kvam from 1671 until 1878.|$|E
50|$|The white, wooden {{church was}} {{completed}} in 1728 with a capacity of about 110 people. During a renovation in 1959, tombs under the church floor were discovered, {{dating back to the}} Bronze Age. They also found coins from the 14th century. Findings indicate that in the 15th century, there was a <b>small</b> <b>stave</b> church measuring about 4.5 x 5 m on the same site as the present church.|$|E
5000|$|According to legend, Olav Trygvason built Avaldsnes Church, {{apparently}} as a manor chapel for the king's residence. This {{would probably}} have been quite a <b>small</b> <b>stave</b> church. Construction of the present day church, called [...] "St. Olav's Church of Avaldsnes" [...] (Olavskirken) was started approximately 1250 AD, on the order of King Håkon Håkonsson. It was not completed until nearly 1320. Dedicated to St. Olav, {{it was one of the}} greatest Norwegian stone churches from the Middle Ages and it was one of only four the royal collegiate churches in Norway. The church was an important station of the Pilgrim's Route to Nidaros which ran along the coast.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} only 12 by 4 m and has only 40 seats, {{making it the}} <b>smallest</b> <b>stave</b> church still in use in all of Scandinavia. The parish only {{includes}} one small, rather isolated valley, with only 116 parishioners, making it the second smallest parish in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{archipelago}} of Grip, {{northwest of}} Kristiansund was (until 1964) the smallest municipality of Norway. Today it is a deserted fishing village, {{but is a}} popular tourist attraction for the special architecture and unique location. Norway's <b>smallest</b> <b>stave</b> church, which was constructed {{in the end of}} the 15th century is also located at Grip.|$|R
5000|$|Undredal is a {{small village}} in the {{municipality}} of Aurland in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. The popular tourist destination of Undredal is located along the Aurlandsfjorden which is a branch off the massive Sognefjorden in Norway's [...] "fjord-country." [...] It sits along the Aurlandsfjorden, about 5 km south of the mouth to the Nærøyfjord. Undredal {{is home to the}} <b>smallest</b> <b>stave</b> church in Northern Europe, Undredal Stave Church.|$|R
5000|$|Hol Old Church (Hol gamle kirke) {{is presumed}} to date from the 13th century, but the exact dating is unknown. The church is the oldest parish in Hol and is first {{mentioned}} in a letter from 1328 as a <b>small</b> <b>stave</b> church with covered side porches (svalganger). The church has been expanded several times, in the 16th century, in 1697 and in 1798-99. It was rebuilt in 1888 and 1938. It is believed that {{the floor of the}} church was made using columns from the old stave church. The pulpit and baptismal font are from the Renaissance period (1697) and the altarpiece from 1703. The pulpit is placed above the altar.|$|E
50|$|Roskilde {{was named}} the new capital of Denmark by King Harald Bluetooth around the year 960. The king had {{previously}} resided in Jelling, where he built a church and raised the Jelling stones, but after uniting the Danes and Norwegians, a move was necessary to enable the monarch {{to stay close to}} the centre of power in the new kingdom. Moving to Roskilde, Bluetooth built a royal farm and next to it, a <b>small</b> <b>stave</b> church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Little is known of the Trinity Church, let alone its architecture, but despite its brief history at least two events are known to have taken place. In Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, there is an account of how the king's son, Sweyn Forkbeard, raised a rebellion against him, forcing him to flee to Jomsborg. When Bluetooth died in 985/986, the army that had been raised against him brought his body to Roskilde and buried him in the church he had built. At Christmas in 1026, Ulf the Earl was murdered by one of Cnut the Great's housecarls. Though the sources differ, this happened either inside the church (Chronicon Roskildense) or at the royal farm (Saxo Grammaticus's Gesta Danorum). Ulf had been married to Cnut the Great's sister Estrid, who was outraged by the murder and demanded a weregild.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} a single-nave church of the [...] "Møre"-type, {{characterized}} by central posts in the external wall and crossbeams. The small nave measures only 16 by 7.5 m and the choir is only 7 by 7.5 m, {{making it one of}} the <b>smallest</b> <b>stave</b> churches in existence. When the church was rebuilt in 1633, the front door was moved from the nave's west side to the south side. In 1776 it was rebuilt, and again in 1810 to add a tower.|$|R
50|$|The {{island of}} Grip, located {{northwest}} of Kristiansund {{is also a}} part of the municipality. It was Norway's smallest municipality, and {{also one of the most}} remote until it merged with Kristiansund in 1964. Today the island of Grip holds status as a deserted fishing village, but in the summer season it is a popular tourist attraction due to the very special location and architecture. Grip Stave Church, the second <b>smallest</b> <b>stave</b> church of Norway (Undredal <b>Stave</b> Church is <b>smaller),</b> is also located at Grip. It is also where Grip Lighthouse is located.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>small</b> Norwegian <b>Stave</b> Church-style chapel {{dedicated}} to St. Hubertus (the {{patron saint of}} hunting) was built in 1893, and Theerbude was renamed [...] "Kaiserlich Rominten" [...] (Imperial Rominten) on 13 September 1897. Over the following years, a youth hostel and an orphanage were built, and the village became a popular tourist resort. An [...] "Empress-wing" [...] {{was added to the}} lodge in 1904.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} listed in Aslak Bolt's {{cadastre}} and later records. Hans Strøm in 1766 described the old stave church: [...] "It is a <b>small</b> and modest <b>stave</b> church, that is not particular in any way. The building is maintained by the congregation that also owns it." ...|$|R
50|$|A piano score (or piano reduction) {{is a more}} or less literal {{transcription}} for piano of a piece {{intended for}} many performing parts, especially orchestral works; this can include purely instrumental sections within large vocal works (see vocal score immediately below). Such arrangements are made for either piano solo (two hands) or piano duet (one or two pianos, four hands). Extra <b>small</b> <b>staves</b> are sometimes added at certain points in piano scores for two hands to make the presentation more complete, though it is usually impractical or impossible to include them while playing. As with vocal score (immediately below), it takes considerable skill to reduce an orchestral score to such smaller forms because the reduction needs to be not only playable on the keyboard but also thorough enough in its presentation of the intended harmonies, textures, figurations, etc. Sometimes markings are included to show which instruments are playing at given points. While piano scores are usually not meant for performance outside of study and pleasure (Liszt's concert transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies being one group of notable exceptions), ballets get the most practical benefit from piano scores because with one or two pianists they allow the ballet to do many rehearsals at a much lower cost, before an orchestra has to be hired for the final rehearsals. Piano scores {{can also be used to}} train beginning conductors, who can conduct a pianist playing a piano reduction of a symphony; this is much less costly than conducting a full orchestra. Piano scores of operas do not include separate staves for the vocal parts, but they may add the sung text and stage directions above the music.|$|R
50|$|In {{doubt of}} what he should do, Oswald puts a <b>small</b> wooden <b>stave</b> between his neck and shoulder, and {{challenges}} the gorilla to knock it off. The gorilla throws a right hook and Oswald is sent bouncing off the walls, but the stave remained in place. The gorilla then flicks the tiny piece of wood off with its finger which worked. Little did the gorilla know that the flicked stave starts knocking down a number of nearby ornaments. This domino effect lead to toppling a statue holding a torch, causing it to light the fuse of a cannon which is aimed at the gorilla. Upon being struck by the cannonball, the gorilla was reduced to bones. The doll, at last, {{comes out of the}} chamber and exaggeratedly gives Oswald hugs.|$|R
50|$|Esrum Abbey {{began as}} a Benedictine foundation, perhaps in about 1140, and was built near a pre-Christian {{religious}} site, later called Esrum Spring, where a <b>small</b> wooden <b>stave</b> chapel may have existed before the abbey was established. The foundation {{was taken over by}} the Cistercians in 1151 on the authority of Archbishop Eskil of Lund, and was counted as a daughter house of Clairvaux. Esrum in its turn became in the course of time the mother house of a number of other important Cistercian foundations: Vitskøl Abbey and Sorø Abbey in Denmark; Ryd Abbey, now in Schleswig-Holstein; and Kołbacz Abbey near Szczecin. Monks from Esrum also founded Dargun Abbey in Mecklenburg in 1172, but abandoned it after hostile military action in 1198, and the later history of Dargun rests on its re-foundation in 1208 from Doberan Abbey. The former community from Dargun went on however to found Eldena Abbey.|$|R
50|$|Japanese armour was {{generally}} constructed from many <b>small</b> bamboo <b>staves</b> (tetsu) and/or leather (nerigawa) scales (kozane) and/or plates (ita-mono), connected {{to each other}} by rivets and macramé cords (odoshi) made from leather and/or braided silk, and/or chain armour (kusari). Noble families had silk cords made in specific patterns and colors of silk thread. Many of these cords were constructed of well over 100 strands of silk. Making these special silk cords could take many months of steady work, just to complete enough for one suit of armour. These armor bamboo plates were usually attached to a cloth or leather backing. Japanese armour {{was designed to be}} as lightweight as possible (thus the use of bamboo) as the samurai had many tasks including riding a horse and archery in addition to swordsmanship. The armour was usually brightly lacquered to protect against the harsh Japanese climate. Chain armour (kusari) was also used to construct individual armour pieces and full suits of kusari were even used.|$|R
500|$|Part of this {{creative}} experimentation was a trial-and-error approach. Liszt constructed compositions {{with varying}} sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, on a <b>small</b> number of <b>staves</b> with {{some indication of}} the orchestration. After an assistantAugust Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard, Liszt would then make further revisions; he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made {{in the light of}} practical experience. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: [...] "I needed to hear them in order {{to get an idea of}} them." [...] He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained [...] "works in progress" [...] as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.|$|R
