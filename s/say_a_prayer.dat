500|$|Described {{as having}} a garage rock {{inspired}} guitar riff, [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] is a fast-paced pop rock song with a [...] "crunchy electro" [...] sound. MusicOMH reviewer John Murphy said that the song [...] "marries a garage rock guitar sound to strange, almost Aphex Twin-like sound effects."

In 2005, [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] won the award for the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the onset}} of a thunderstorm, {{according}} to Nikola's own description, he felt a great excitement; he heard some music in the thunder, all his muscles tightened, and something made him go. He would take a sickle and a scythe, a warp beam on which a twin sister had wound warp yarns, the bag with the last-year's pellets, and the bottle with last-year's dew.

For these protective services, Nikola had been receiving wheat and maize from his fellow villagers.
