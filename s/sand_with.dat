5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the <b>sand</b> <b>with</b> sticks, her keeper decided {{to give her a}} brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors all over the world joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{consists of}} the Permo-Triassic New Red Sandstone in the south, and the Middle Coal Measures of the Manchester Coalfield to the north. The upper soils are a mixture of clay and <b>sand,</b> <b>with</b> a subsoil of clay. The Astley area encompasses smaller, suburban and semi-outlying areas, including Blackmoor, Astley Green, Gin Pit and Cross Hillock. The isolated hamlet of terraced houses at Gin Pit was built by the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries Company. Peace Street, Lord Street and Maden Street were named after directors of the company.|$|E
40|$|The {{harmfulness}} {{assessment of}} moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> a geopolymer binder {{and a new}} hardener, in {{an aspect of the}} emission of substances from the BTEX group, was performed. Within the expedience project the new series of hardeners for the inorganic GEOPOL binder was developed. Before the introduction of the new system of moulding sands it was necessary to estimate their influence on the environment. To this aim the gasses emission from moulding sands subjected to the influence of liquid cast iron was tested with regard to the content of the gases from the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes). For the comparison the analogous investigations of the up to now applied moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> the geopolymer binder, were performed. It was found that both systems of moulding sands binding emit similar amounts of gases, as well as similar amounts of substances from the BTEX group. Moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> the GEOPOL binder are much more environmentally friendly than moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> organic binders. The content of the BTEX group substances in gases emitted from moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> the GEOPOL binder was approximately 10 -times lower than in case of the moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> organic binders...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{extender}} and bender element {{tests were}} conducted investigating the small-strain Poisson's ratio of variable <b>sands,</b> <b>with</b> {{a focus on the}} effect of stress anisotropy in order to quantify the sensitivity of Poisson's ratio to the applied deviatoric stress. Four different uniform sands were tested, including a biogenic sand, a crushed rock and two natural sands, covering a wide range of particle shapes. From these sands, eleven samples were prepared in the laboratory and were tested under variable stress paths, maintaining a constant mean effective pressure while increasing the deviatoric compressive load. Under the application of these given stress paths, the data analysis indicated that the sensitivity of Poisson's ratio to the stress ratio was more pronounced for <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> irregularly shaped particles in comparison to <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> fairly rounded and spherical grains. For <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> very irregularly shaped particles, the increase of Poisson's ratio from the isotropic to the anisotropic stress state reached 50 %, while this increase for natural <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> fairly rounded particles was in the order of 20 %...|$|R

5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and <b>sand,</b> <b>with</b> significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; {{but even in the}} oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.|$|E
5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the <b>sand,</b> <b>with</b> a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the <b>sand</b> <b>with</b> the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{of modern}} {{moulding}} <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> organic and inorganic binders requires the reclamation treatments {{in order to}} be able to reuse the matrices of spent sands. The spent sands, depending on the applied binding agent, are characterised by various abilities of the matrix reclamation. The results of investigations of the reclamation of spent moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> the Rudal binder and spent <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> the Rezolit binder in the system of uniform sands and of mixed ones, are presented in the paper.

5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the <b>sand</b> <b>with</b> 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E
5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite <b>sand</b> <b>with</b> a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the structural, technological and ecological {{features of the}} new type of silicate binders. The binders are used in foundry practice to produce moulds and cores, especially for castings made from non-ferrous metal alloys. The nanostructure of binders was described, i. e. the size and decay of nanoparticles of the diffuse binder phase. The technological research showed the beneficial mechanical properties of moulding <b>sands</b> prepared <b>with</b> these binders at both ambient temperature and at temperatures of up to 900 oC (the residual strength), compared to the moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> traditional silicate binders. The residual strength of moulding <b>sands</b> <b>with</b> the new binder decreased by about 50 % at 800 oC.

40|$|A proper {{management}} of sand grains of moulding sands requires knowing basic properties of the spent matrix after casting knocking out.
