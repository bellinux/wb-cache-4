500|$|Doggett tells Reyes that, {{in order}} to resolve the situation, she must turn off his {{respirator}} and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes {{to go back to}} her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett's respirator. [...] As <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "You need {{hardly have}} told us that," [...] Edgar said. [...] "Our plight speaks for itself. Call your wife, I pray you, or female servants; they will {{know what to do}} to bring the young maid to herself. But tell her to let the girl know as soon as <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> that her father is alive, and is, I trust, not seriously wounded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you {{indebted to}} {{for what is}} going to happen to-day?" [...] he went on, more and more passionately. [...] "You are indebted to Me. Who among you all stood alone in refusing to believe that she was blind for life? I did! Who brought the man here who has given her back her sight? I brought the man! And I am the one person who is to be left in ignorance of how it ends. The others are to be present: I am to be sent away. The others are to see it: I am to hear by post (if any of you think of writing to me) what she does, what she says, how she looks, at the first heavenly moment when <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on the world." [...] He flung up his hand in the air, and burst out savagely with a bitter laugh. [...] "I astonish you, don't I? I am {{claiming}} a position which I have no right to occupy. What interest can I feel in it? Oh God! what do I care about the woman to whom I have given a new life?" [...] His voice broke into a sob at those last wild words. He tore at the breast of his coat as if he was suffocating--and turned, and left me.|$|E

6000|$|Gradually Numerian's voice grew calmer. He {{raised his}} {{daughter}} in his arms, and bent wistfully {{on her face}} his attentive and pitying eyes. 'Returned, returned!' he murmured, while he gazed on her, 'never again to depart! Returned, beautiful and patient, kinder and more tender than ever! Love me and pardon me, Antonina. I sought for you in bitter loneliness and despair. Think not of me as what I was, but as what I am! There were days when you were an infant, when I had no thought but how to cherish and delight you, and now those days have come again. You shall read no gloomy task-books; you shall never be separated from me more; you shall play sweet music on the lute; you shall be all garlanded with flowers which I will provide for you! We will find friends and glad companions; we will bring happiness with us wherever we are seen. God's blessing goes forth from children like you--it has fallen upon me--it has raised me from the dead! My Antonina shall teach me to worship, as I once taught her. She shall pray {{for me in the}} morning, and pray for me at night; and when she thinks not of it, when she sleeps, I shall come softly to her bedside, and wait and watch over her, so that when <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> they shall open on me--they are the eyes of my child who has been restored to me--there is nothing on earth that can speak to me like them of happiness and peace!' ...|$|E

60|$|Jill awoke with a start. <b>She</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and shut}} them again at once. The sun {{was very strong}} now.

She can make limbs disappear from and reappear in the current dimension so as to stop physical attacks. When <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> she emits an inexhaustible stream of Element that engulfs everyone and creates a territory where she can further use powers such as selectively making the clothing of the girls disappear. She thus proclaims herself the Master of Lingerie. Minori ranks Minerva the highest of the ability users. She is voiced by Rina Sato in the Japanese version, and by Leah Clark in the English dub.|$|E
