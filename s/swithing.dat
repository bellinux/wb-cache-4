40|$|Abstract. This paper {{develops}} a sliding-mode controller with fuzzy {{rules for the}} single magnetic levitation system with delay, different signals and interference. The control algorithm comprises a sliding-mode controller which is designed for enhancing robustness when plant uncertainties, and a fuzzy controller which is designed for smoothing the control input when switching at these boundary manifolds. An algorithm is presented for selecting the coefficients of the <b>swithing</b> plane such that the overall closed-loop system has stable eigenvalues. A control input is shown to be smoothing and overcome the chatter. The performance of the single magnetic levitation system is obtained by simulation and experimental results which show that the proposed fuzzy sliding-mode controller algorithm is effective for tracking different signals with interference. The single magnetic levitation system inherently has nonlinear properties[1]. With regard to such a nonlinear system, various linear controllers have been introduced[2, 3, 4].

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{macroeconomic}} and monetary news on U. S. Government bond rate level and volatility. Specifically, it checks if these news affect differently interest rate level and volatility during "stable" and "unstable" periods. "Unstable" periods correspond to the periods marked by a great uncertainty on Government bond market. To do this, first we distinguish the "stable" and "unstable" periods by estimating interest rate dynamics with a markov <b>swithing</b> ARCH process, proposed by Hamilton and Susmel (1994). The results of this first estimation suggest that U. S. interest rate volatility is higher during periods of financial crises, war time periods and during periods marked by economic or policy instability. We use these results to evaluate interest rate mean and volatility response to U. S. macroeconomic and monetary news with an EGARCH model, proposed by Nelson (1991). The results show that news announcements do not have important impact on interest rate volatility during "stable" periods. In contrast, they strongly affect market volatility during "unstable" periods. Finally, we check whether positive and negative news announcements influence differently bond rate volatility during "unstable" periods. The results suggest that negative news have important effects on the bond market volatility compared {{to the effects of}} positive news. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{efficacy}} of once-weekly TPTD {{had not been}} tested for GIOP. A double-blinded randomized clinical trial for primary osteoporosis patients confirmed that once-weekly TPTD increased lumbar BMD dose-dependently after 24 and 48  weeks, although the radiogrammetric density of cortical bone {{did not differ significantly}} (Fujita et al. 1999). This study found that once-weekly TPTD for 18  months significantly increased YAM of the lumbar spine, as well as reducing fracture events. Prior fracture is an important risk factor for future fractures (Klotzbuecher et al. 2000). In our study, TPTD prevented the fracture events in the six patients who had one fracture event during 18  months before TPTD. A female SLE patient, who had two fractures within 18  months before starting TPTD, suffered only one fracture during TPTD treatment. Furthermore she was treated with denosumab after once-weekly TPTD, she did not fracture under denosumab. <b>Swithing</b> from TPTD to denosumab improved bone mineral density effectively in postmenopousal osteoporosis (Leder et al. 2015). Preseding once-weekly TPTD might be beneficial for prevention of fracture. Additionally, YAM was improved at 18  months in our study, but it was not increased at 12  months. We assumed the reason that patients enrolled in this study were very severe with osteoporosis. This fact showed that we needed TPTD treatment for 18  months in order to improve GIOP. Taken together, 18  months of once-weekly TPTD reduced fractures in GIOP patients.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a regime {{switching}} model which can generate long memory (fractional integration) {{in each of}} the regime states. This property is relevant in a number of cases. For instance, the deregulated market for electricity power in the Nordic countries is characterized by electricity spot prices {{with a high degree of}} long memory. It occurs that in some time periods bilateral prices are identical whereas in other periods the prices differ. The latter occurs when a capacity congestion exists across regions and multiple price areas will result. If the price series are fractionally integrated this means that in some regimes, an extreme form of fractional cointegration amongst prices will exist. We define a Markov switching fractional integration model from which the fractional orders of integration in separate states can be estimated using Maximum Likelihood techniques. The model is adapted to data for the Nordic electricity spot market, and we find that regime <b>swithing</b> and long memory are empirically relevant to co-exist. In particular, we find that the price behaviour for single markets can be very different depending upon the presence or absence of bottlenecks in electricity transmission. Using Monte Carlo forecasting we find that the regime switching model appears to be especially attractive in forecasting relative prices.

40|$|Abstract: A {{great part}} of King Alfred’s renown comes from his {{translations}} of Latin writings into Old English. The group of translations that he gets credit for, however, {{has changed over the}} years. Presently four translations are attributed to him: the Pastoral Care, the Boethius, the Soliloquies, and the first fifty Prose Psalms. The first three works openly name Alfred as translator and provide strong internal evidence that they are Alfred’s work. The Prose Psalms, however, lack Alfred’s name. Although now widely endorsed as Alfred’s on the basis of studies by Janet Bately and Patrick O’Neil, the Prose Psalms do not allow the same confidence in Alfred’s authorship as with the three named translations. Bately’s and O’Neill’s arguments exhibit several weaknesses. Their conclusion, moreover, breaks down when stylometric analysis is applied to the translations associated with Alfred. The statistical methods employed in this study indicate that Alfred should not be regarded as the translator of the Prose Psalms after all.

60|$|In {{this passage}} {{it is easy}} to see that the {{variations}} which make it into modern English are for the most part of a very simple kind. Some of the words are absolutely identical, as his, on, he, and, land, or north. Others, though differences of spelling mask the likeness, are practically the same, as sæ, sæde, cwæth, thæt, lang, for which we now write sea, said, quoth, that, long. A few have undergone contraction or alteration, as hlaford, now lord, cyning, now king, and steorbord, now starboard. Stow, a place, is now obsolete, except in local names; styccemælum, stickmeal, has been Normanised into piecemeal. In other cases new terminations have been substituted for old ones; huntath and fiscath are now replaced by hunting and fishing; while hunta has been superseded by hunter. Only six words in the passage have died out wholly: buan, to abide (bude); <b>swithe,</b> very; wician, to dwell; cirr, an occasion; fandian, to enquire (connected with find); and bæcbord, port, which still survives in French from Norman sources. Dæg, day, and ænig, any, show how existing English has softened the final g into a y. But the main difference which separates the modern passage from its ancient prototype is the consistent dropping of the grammatical inflexions in hlaforde, Ælfrede, ealra, feawum, and fandian, where we now say, to his lord, of all, in few, and to enquire.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of type Ia supernovae {{as well as}} other concordant observations suggest that the expansion of our universe is accelerating. A dark energy component has usually been invoked as the most feasible mechanism for the acceleration. However, the effects arising from possible extra dimensions can mimic well the role of a dark energy through a modified Friedmann equation. In this work, we investigate some observational constraints on a scenario in which this modification is given by H 2 = 8 πG 3 (ρ + Cρn). We mainly focus our attention on the constraints from recent {{measurements of}} the dimensionless coordinate distances to type Ia supernovae and Fanaroff-Riley type IIb radio galaxies compiled by Daly and Djorgovski (2003) and the X-ray gas mass fractions in clusters of galaxies published by Allen et al.

It is found that n = 0. 06 + 0. 22 − 0. 18 and Ωm = 0. 30 + 0. 02 − 0. 02, at the 95. 4 % confidence level, which is consistent within the errors with the standard ΛCDM model.

We used bi-stable stimuli to explore {{if there is any}} different bi-stable perception between anisometropic amblyopia and nerotypical subjects. We considered that it should be a particularly useful probe to study the mechanisms of motion integration and segmentation, and help us to find unravel in more detail any deficit in the amblyopic visual motion system. 	METHODS: The stimulus comprised two same rectangular-wave gratings presented through a circular aperture 7. 7 ° in diameter on a middle-gray background, moved in directions 90 ° apart with the same speed. Contrast was defined in RGB units (30 % and 5 %), with both gratings having the same parameters. The coherent motion direction were horizontal and vertical. Subjects were instructed to ﬁxate the fixation point throughout the stimulus presentation (120 seconds), and report the percepts with two keyboard keys passively. 	RESULTS: We found that there were no substantial differences in their perception of motion rivalry grating stimuli. With the contrast decreasing, these two groups performed different in details, such as the change in percept duration times, frequency of perceptual <b>swithes.</b> For the two percepts (coherent and transparent), the tendency of amblyopes and normal was totally oppositely. To horizontal and vertical motion direction, both amblyopes and normal have different perceptual switching frequency. 	CONCLUSIONS: Althougth the global performance was normal in amblopes, their perceptual switching frequency, percepts duration time were both different from normal person, indicating their abnormal visual motion system. Due to the clearly contrast related effects, the higher SNR in amblopes might be a reasonable excuse.

He quoth that he lived in the land northward along the North Sea. He said though that the land was very long from there, but it is all wasteland, except that in a few places here and there Finns Sami encamp, hunting in winter and in summer fishing by the sea. He said that at some time he wanted to find out how long the land lay northward or whether any man lived north of the wasteland. Then he traveled north by the land. All the way he kept the waste land on his starboard and the wide sea on his port three days. Then he was as far north as whale hunters furthest travel. Then he traveled still north as far as he might sail in another three days. Then the land bowed east (or the sea into the land — he did not know which). But he knew that he waited there for west winds (and somewhat north), and sailed east by the land so as he might sail in four days. Then he had to wait for due-north winds, because the land bowed south (or the sea into the land — he did not know which). Then he sailed from there south by the land so as he might sail in five days. Then a large river lay there up into the land. Then they turned up into the river, because they dared not sail forth past the river for hostility, because the land was all settled {{on the other side of}} the river. He had not encountered earlier any settled land since he travelled from his own home, but all the way waste land was on his starboard (except fishers, fowlers and hunters, who were all Finns). And the wide sea was always on his port. The Bjarmians have cultivated their land very well, but they did not dare go in there. But the Terfinn’s land was all waste except where hunters encamped, or fishers or fowlers.|$|R
