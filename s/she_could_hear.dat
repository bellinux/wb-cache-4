25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except {{to go to}} church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E
25|$|West's {{friend and}} fellow artist Tammy Wynette stated that she had put aside visiting her in the hospital, saying that she planned {{to allow her to}} heal first, {{something}} she admitted to later regretting. In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death. On his last visit (the day of West's death), Rogers recalled that although he was told it was unlikely that West could hear him, he still spoke to her for a considerable amount of time in the hope <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> what he was saying.|$|E
25|$|Bakari {{reported}} having no life jacket and only minimal swimming skills, but {{she managed to}} hold on to a piece of fuselage wreckage. Most of the time that was to elapse before her rescue was night. She reported later that initially there must have been other survivors as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> them after the crash but later the voices became silent. In the morning of the next day Bakari came to realize she was alone at sea having been drifting for hours without food and water. She also {{reported having}} seen a ship on the horizon that was, however, too far away to take notice of her.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time it was noted that Genie took {{pleasure}} in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had been playing with. Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed was because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Stefan (Nikitin) was {{a medical}} doctor and this {{assisted}} his survival in the concentration camps through work as a camp doctor. He often allowed the overworked and underfed prisoners {{to be allowed to}} stay in hospital to recuperate. The camp authorities became aware of this and warned him that a new trial was probably awaiting him that would have a possible maximum sentence of fifteen years for wrecking Soviet industrial effort by taking workers from their jobs. The bishop was told by a nurse of a woman named Matrionushka in the Volga city of Penza who he should ask to pray for him, and he was told that Matrionushka did not need a letter because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him if he asked for her help. He shouted for her help, and the threatened trial did not happen, and he was released several weeks later. He moved to Penza in order to find Matrionushka. When he met her, she supposedly knew intimate details about him and that he had asked for her help, and she told him that he had prayed to the Lord for him. She was soon arrested, however, and transported to a Moscow prison where she died.|$|E
500|$|... "All Is Full of Love", {{the closing}} track of Homogenic, was the album's last song {{to be written}} and recorded. Produced by Björk, the {{original}} version of the song was replaced [...] "at the last minute" [...] by Howie B's version. It {{was inspired by the}} spring while producing the album in Málaga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Björk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then she realized it was spring after <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.|$|E

500|$|American {{producers}} Tricky Stewart and Dream {{had written}} the track [...] "Umbrella" [...] in 2007 with pop singer Britney Spears in mind. Her label rejected the song before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> it, stating they had enough songs for her to record; at the time, Spears was working on her fifth studio album Blackout. The producers then reached out to Mary J. Blige, {{who did not have}} time to consider the song for her next album. Finally, L.A. Reid, then-CEO of Def Jam Recordings, bought the record and forwarded it to Rihanna. Initially, Stewart was unsure whether Rihanna was the right artist for the song, but after they had recorded the [...] "ella, ella" [...] catch phrase for the track, he felt optimistic. Rapper Jay Z added rap vocals. Stewart also co-wrote and produced [...] "Breakin' Dishes" [...] with Nash.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another notable segment Dawkins {{visits a}} psychic for £50 who said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> or {{see his father}} [...] "on the other side."

2500|$|Cotten {{was born}} in 1893 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to a musical family. Her parents were George Nevill (also spelled Nevills) and Louisa (or Louise) Price Nevill. Elizabeth was the {{youngest}} of five children. At age seven, she began to play her older brother's banjo. By the age of eight, she was playing songs. At the age of 11, after scraping together some money as a domestic helper, she bought her own guitar. The guitar, a Sears and Roebuck brand instrument, cost $3.75. Although self-taught, she became proficient at playing the instrument. By her early teens she was writing her own songs, one of which, [...] "Freight Train", became one of her most recognized. She wrote the song in remembrance of a nearby train that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> from her childhood home. The 1956 UK recording of the song by Chas. McDevitt and Nancy Whiskey was a major hit and is credited as one of the main influences on the rise of skiffle in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Freeze is {{featured}} in [...] Mr. Freeze's freeze gun {{can be found}} in the evidence room at the Gotham City Police Department. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side misson [...] "In From The Cold". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryochamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies [...] "merely days". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Fries'.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} the dead man with pale, grim eyes. Out in the hallway the doctor's voice further {{increased}} her despair. He {{was talking to the}} police on the telephone, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> distinctly <b>hear</b> his every word.|$|R
60|$|Amy. It {{was very}} cruel, though, {{to the poor}} lady, sir, my mistress; she almost broke her heart for you at first, for fear of what might befall you, and at last because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> from you.|$|R
60|$|Presently the hen espied {{a hollow}} {{underneath}} the King's rocky throne, and crept into it unnoticed. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>hear</b> the chattering {{of those around}} her, but it was almost dark underneath the throne, so that soon she had fallen fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|Jeanne obeyed her breathlessly. At first <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing.

From somewhere underground {{it seemed to her}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a faint hammering.|$|E
60|$|And {{all around}} was this cradle of snow, {{and there was}} firm snow underfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles. It was night, and silence.

She seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion.|$|E
60|$|She listened, {{listened intently}} for several minutes. People were passing {{in the street}} below. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> their {{footsteps}} upon the pavement.

He himself had deadened the sound by closing the door. She moved a little nearer to him.|$|E
