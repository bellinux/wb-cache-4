40|$|A {{decline in}} 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) use in Adelaide, Australia from 2009 to 2010 was {{confirmed}} by us previously. Reports suggested that the shortage in MDMA supply was {{associated with an increased}} prevalence of other <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants,</b> but quantitative measurements were unavailable. To obtain objective data on the community use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants,</b> we collected wastewater samples from multiple treatment plants in Adelaide, Australia from 2009 to 2011 and analysed them using solid-phase extraction/liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (SPE–LC–MS/MS), targeting MDMA and some of the most reported synthetic cathinones and piperazines. Data were temporally compared. MDMA and six other <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants</b> were detected and quantified in wastewater samples. While MDMA level decreased markedly from 2009 to 2010 and remained low in 2011, localized increased use of mephedrone, methylone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), benzylpiperazine (BZP), 3 -trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), but not methcathinone, was observed in 2010 and 2011. This suggested that the decline in MDMA use was associated with an increase in the use of a number of other <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants.</b> However, the lag time from the decrease in MDMA to the increase in use of a number of these stimulants, together with the highly regionalized use of all <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants</b> except methcathinone indicates that there was no direct population wide substitution in response to the reduction in MDMA. ...|$|R

40|$|Illicit {{stimulant}} use is {{a global}} problem, and accurate and timely information on population stimulant use is essential. However, traditional monitoring methods based on surveys and reporting systems have some limitations, which include {{the accuracy of the}} data collected, its relevance to the population as a whole, and the long delays in reporting in a rapidly changing drug scene. These limitations are problematic when using the collected data to develop health and policing policies. Analysis of community wastewater has been suggested to be an objective and quick method to provide supplementary data. However, a detailed knowledge of the pharmacology and chemistry of drugs is required combined with development and validation of techniques before this method is universally applied. The general aims of this thesis were to develop and validate the method of wastewater analysis, and then apply it to monitor illicit stimulant use in the general population. The analytical method used in this study was mainly solid-phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry. Firstly, pre-analysis loss of drugs and metabolites were evaluated. The results from this study showed that negligible loss of the studied drugs occurred after filtration, and all analytes except cocaine and 6 monoacetylmorphine are relatively stable in wastewater. For cocaine use monitoring, its metabolite benzoylecgonine is a more suitable analytical target for stability reasons. To stabilise 6 -monoacetylmorphine, the addition of sodium metabisulphite is recommended. Secondly, wastewater analysis was applied to monitor the use of illicit stimulants cocaine, methamphetamine and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) in the State of South Australia, Australia. Data were collected for international comparisons, geographical comparisons and weekly use pattern assessments. Continued monitoring of the wastewater revealed a decline in MDMA use in Adelaide, which provided objective data to support the globally reported MDMA shortage starting from 2009. Since late 2000 s, there has been an increase in the use of novel <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants.</b> It was suggested that this increase might be associated with the MDMA decline, but it was also possible that these two phenomena were not related. To verify these hypotheses, an analytical method for the analysis {{of some of the most}} reported <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants</b> was developed, validated and applied. Results showed some sporadic increases in the use of new <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants</b> during 2010 and 2011, but these increases were not directly linked with the MDMA decline, suggesting the novel <b>synthetic</b> <b>stimulants</b> have not replaced MDMA. In conclusion, this thesis developed and validated the method of wastewater analysis and gained important information on stimulant use in the population, which cannot be obtained via other monitoring approaches.

Here, the monoamine-releasing properties of 5 -IT, its structural isomer 6 -(2 -aminopropyl) indole (6 -IT), and MDMA were compared using in vitro release assays at transporters for dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) in rat brain synaptosomes. In vivo pharmacology was assessed by locomotor activity and a functional observational battery (FOB) in mice. 5 -IT and 6 -IT were potent substrates at DAT, NET, and SERT. In contrast with the non-selective releasing properties of MDMA, 5 -IT displayed greater potency for release at DAT over SERT, while 6 -IT displayed greater potency for release at SERT over DAT. 5 -IT produced locomotor stimulation and typical stimulant effects in the FOB similar to those produced by MDMA. Conversely, 6 -IT increased behaviors associated with 5 -HT toxicity. 5 -IT likely has high abuse potential, which may be somewhat diminished by its slow onset of in vivo effects, whereas 6 -IT may have low abuse liability, but enhanced risk for adverse effects. Results indicate that subtle differences in the chemical structure of transporter ligands can have profound effects on biological activity. The potent monoamine-releasing actions of 5 -IT, coupled with its known inhibition of MAO A, could underlie its dangerous effects when administered alone, and in combination with other monoaminergic drugs or medications. Consequently, 5 -IT and related compounds may pose substantial risk for abuse and serious adverse effects in human users...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the sex-specific differences to feeding responses of the shore crab Carcinus maenasthroughout the year. Results demonstrate that female shore crabs exhibit stronger feeding responses than males throughout the year with a significantly reduced feeding response in males during the summer months' reproductive season. We also studied the possible function(s) of the moulting hormone, 20 -hydroxyecdysone (Crustecdysone) that {{has been described as}} a potential female-produced sex pheromone to initiate male reproductive behaviour in a number of crustaceans.
