50|$|It is also fitted <b>with</b> <b>handrails,</b> so {{that the}} boom {{could be used to}} provide spacewalkers with access to the shuttle's underbelly in case {{in-flight}} repairs are required.|$|R
50|$|The Umicore Indoor Track is {{a running}} track that runs around the Agrium soccer field, beside the Sherritt Arena {{and through the}} Apple Fitness Centre. It boasts 344 m of track with two lanes for walkers, joggers, or wheelchairs. The track is {{complete}} <b>with</b> <b>handrail</b> for safety.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} to the homestead is off the avenue lined with phoenix palms (Phoenix canariensis) and is accessed via a set of concrete stairs with decorative pillars to the timber stairway <b>with</b> <b>handrail,</b> and a trellis with trailing vines straddling the stairs. Additional entrances are located on {{the east and west}} sides.|$|R
50|$|A detrainment {{device is}} {{moved from a}} stored {{location}} into an operational position, usually above the coupler {{at the end of}} a passenger car. A detrainment device may consist of a manually placed, hinged, foldable or telescopic ladder or ramp. A detrainment device may allow evacuation to track level, or to a coupled railcar. A detrainment device may be fitted <b>with</b> <b>handrails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since these {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} with permanently coupled tenders, their cabs {{did not need}} side entrances <b>with</b> double <b>handrails</b> like their predecessors of 1880 and 1881 did with their optional tenders. Access was by pairs of steps, mounted on the engine {{as well as on}} the tender, <b>with</b> one <b>handrail</b> attached to the engine and the other to the tender.|$|R
50|$|The Enhanced ISS Boom Assembly is used {{to extend}} the reach of Canadarm2 and {{provides}} detailed inspection capability. There are lasers and cameras {{at the end of}} the boom able to record at a resolution of a few millimeters. The boom is also fitted <b>with</b> <b>handrails,</b> so that it can assist spacewalkers during EVAs as was done on STS-120 to repair the solar arrays.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of extensive tidal flats and sandy beaches in Dongyin, the pebble beach in Dongao (東澳) is one of few ports that give access to the sea. The stairs connected to the port used to be very steep, but after renovation, they are now well established <b>with</b> <b>handrails.</b> Tourists can stay {{under the shade of}} huge stones away from blistering sun. The pebbles at the port are suitable for resting and dabbling.|$|R

The 100 -inch reflecting telescope points upwards while being supported by a riveted metal apparatus. A concrete floor, <b>with</b> <b>handrails,</b> encircles the gigantic apparatus while stairs lead down {{to the base of the}} astronomical instrument. In the background, the dome shape of the observatory ceiling is visible...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{houses have}} stairs <b>with</b> a <b>handrail</b> made <b>with</b> [...] "gypserie" [...] {{which is a}} type of Plasterwork seen only in Provence.|$|R
50|$|Access {{is given}} to the {{principal}} entrance of the building on the eastern facade, via the verandah and a simple straight open tread stair. The four panelled timber entrance door is flanked by six-pane vertical sash window opening. A different type of window frame, located to the south of this arrangement, indicates a later addition to that side of the building. The verandah is supported on square timber posts, with simple two rail balustrade <b>with</b> <b>handrail,</b> and this arrangement continues on the stair.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 8 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 6000 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle load of 15 lt 19 lcwt 2 qtr kg. To improve the crew's rearward vision, the top sides of the tender's coal bunker were set inwards {{and the top of}} the water tank was rounded. An unusual characteristic for a tender was a frame which extended behind the water tank to form a platform, equipped <b>with</b> <b>handrails</b> for use by shunting crew.|$|R
50|$|Whiteface Castle, {{built with}} granite {{excavated}} during the road construction, dominates the summit area. From the adjacent parking lot {{there are two}} routes to the summit proper. The first route is the Stairway Ridge Trail, a footpath <b>with</b> <b>handrails</b> and intermittent cement and stone steps approximately 0.2 mi long. The second is a 424 ft long tunnel into {{the core of the}} mountain. At {{the end of the tunnel}} is an elevator, which rises 276 ft, approximately 27 stories, to the summit.|$|R
25|$|The SD70ACe/LCi {{is a low}} clearance, export {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The LCi in the model {{designation}} stands for Low Clearance international as these locomotives are designed to negotiate the tight clearances under the mine equipment. External differences between the SD70ACe and SD70ACe/LCi models include the addition of marker lights, number boxes lower in the body rather than {{on top of the}} cab, windscreen protector panels (to deflect abrasive iron ore when in mid train position), fire suppression canisters, louvre style vents, different horn and subtle differences <b>with</b> <b>handrails.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} has a high-ceilinged section {{overlooked by}} a mezzanine. Interior columns have capitals resembling Egyptian prototypes. The mezzanine and stair railings are slender horizontal bars <b>with</b> birch <b>handrails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{types of}} moving walkway have a grooved surface {{to mesh with}} combplates at the ends. Also, nearly all moving {{walkways}} are built <b>with</b> moving <b>handrails</b> similar to those on escalators.|$|R
40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 7 (4) : 339 - 345, 2014. Inclined {{treadmill}} {{walking is}} a commonly performed activity to increase cardiovascular health. Handrail support {{on a treadmill}} provides an individual the opportunity to change their posture {{with respect to the}} walking surface. Differences in metabolic cost during inclined walking due to postural changes <b>with</b> <b>handrail</b> use are unknown. To test the hypothesis that metabolic cost will differ depending on how handrail support is used, respiratory gas analysis was performed during inclined walking in 13 healthy subjects. Energy expenditure was quantified while each subject walked in four conditions: 5...|$|R

5000|$|The upper cave, [...] "Kız", is {{not open}} to the public due to the {{approximate}} 60,000 total bats of eleven different species dwelling on the walls and ceilings of the cave. Only 200 m of [...] "Kuru" [...] Cave and 250 m of [...] "Sulu" [...] Cave are open as part of the show cave. The [...] "Kuru" [...] cave is open year-round. The main entrance enters [...] "Sulu" [...] Cave, which is followed by a paved gallery complete <b>with</b> <b>handrails.</b> The passage to the area beyond 250 m is permitted only to experienced cavers for exploring purposes.|$|R
50|$|Accessibility for the {{disabled}} was assessed by West Virginia University. The assessment found the campground, picnic area, lake fishing and swimming pool to be accessible. The 2005 assessment found issues <b>with</b> certain <b>handrails.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009, stairs <b>with</b> a <b>handrail</b> were {{installed}} to facilitate visitors' {{access to the}} crash site. Japan Transport Minister Seiji Maehara visited the site on August 12, 2010, to pray for the victims.|$|R
50|$|Stairs <b>with</b> {{inadequate}} <b>handrails,</b> or too steep, encouraging {{trips and}} falls. The steps should be spaced widely with low risers, and surfaces should be slip-resistant. Softer surfaces can help limit impact injuries by cushioning loads.|$|R
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges <b>with</b> <b>handrails</b> replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|R
50|$|A 2.4 metres (8 feet) wide {{verandah}} {{runs around}} the west, {{north and east}} of the early house, and has a dowel balustrading <b>with</b> the <b>handrail</b> sitting on the top rail and bold Y-shaped moulded brackets to the posts. Timber steps alight from the north side and west sides. An extended verandah at the northeast corner has weatherboard infill balustrading. The west and east verandahs to the south extension have dowel balustrading, <b>with</b> a <b>handrail</b> separate from the top rail and only the west verandah has the Y-shaped brackets matching those on the early verandah. There is a batten infill to the understoreys of the early house and the extension.|$|R
50|$|The Mountain Lab {{has many}} {{custom-made}} features {{that were made}} specifically for the Mountain Lab by Chris “Gunny” Gunnarson and the Snow Park team, a renowned team of snowboard park designers. Signature features include a box {{that runs through the}} living room of the house, a wallride at the end of the run, a staircase complete <b>with</b> <b>handrails,</b> a large pink disarmed missile, and two road gaps set up in a line. More traditional features include a down rail, a down flat down rail, a large C rail, a hollow trailer that houses a jump, various flat boxes, a tabletop jump, and a hip transfer.|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} bridge {{at the north}} end of the pool is approximately 30 metres long. It leads to further concrete paths behind which a low coarse rubble retaining wall is located. Approximately halfway between the bridge and the Falls there are pool steps and a metal handrail attached to the concrete pathway. On the north eastern bank, steps <b>with</b> <b>handrails</b> lead to the Malanda Caravan Park. Further past these steps, towards the base of the Falls, are remnant concrete foundations, piping and the remains of a vertical boiler structure. The latter is riveted steel plate and is possibly associated with the water pumping activities of the Railways Department.|$|R
