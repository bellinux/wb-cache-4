40|$|In 2013, the President, Secretary of Defense, {{and members}} of Congress responded with shock and outrage to {{perceptions}} of increased sex assaults committed by military personnel upon other military personnel.

This Article evaluates <b>substantive</b> military <b>criminal</b> <b>law,</b> UCMJ art. 120, 10 U. S. C. § 920, and Military Rules of Evidence 404 (a) and 405 (c). Drawing on lessons learned from state and federal laws, the Article then makes recommendations regarding statutory changes in military criminal sexual assault and procedural statutes. Specifically, the author recommends amending <b>substantive</b> military <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> to add the offense of “Indecent Act” back into UCMJ art. 120; modifying the definition of force; eliminating the increased emphasis on whether the victim’s fears are “reasonable”; removing the focus from the accused’s perceptions of the victim; returning the statutory limitations on the affirmative defense of mistake of fact as to consent; adopting California’s evidentiary threshold for giving affirmative defense instructions on mistake of fact as to consent and consent; and creating a statutory structure to restrict judicial appellate discretion in determining the need for certain lesser-included offense instructions. The author supports a statute-based amendment of Military Rules of Evidence 404 (a) and 405 (c) to clarify that general military character or good soldier evidence is not admissible to show probability of innocence for sexual assault offenses...|$|R

In it, he argues that there is a danger in too much variation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Rather, it is better to see the criminal law not as a purely codified enterprise but as a series of localized resolutions to twelve recurrent issues: (1) The tension between <b>substantive</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> and the procedures of criminal investigation and prosecution. (2) The distinction between criminal punishment and other state-induced burdens, like deportation. (3) The treatment of a suspect as a subject or as an object (or as a person or as a means for influencing other persons). (4) The difference between causation and occurrence of harm. (5) The problem of attribution of wrongdoing to a given person or persons. (6) The difference between an offense and a defense. (7) The difference between negligence and intent. (8) The role of self-defense contrasted with necessity. (9) The relevance or irrelevance of a mistake to criminality. (10) The role of attempt or incompleteness of an offense. (11) The difference between perpetrators and accessories. (12) The conflict between legality and justice.|$|E

40|$|International {{criminal}} procedure is {{in a second}} phase of development, moving beyond the common law/civil law dichotomy and searching for its sui generis theory. The standard line is that international {{criminal procedure}} has an instrumental value: it services the general goals of international criminal justice and allows punishment for violations of <b>substantive</b> international <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> However, international <b>criminal</b> procedure also has an important and often overlooked intrinsic value not reducible to its instrumental value: it vindicates the Rule of Law. This vindication is performed by adjudicating allegations of criminal violations that occurred during periods of anarchy characterized {{by the absence of}} domestic procedural law. This suggests a theoretical insight: the anti-impunity norm and its concern with punishment should be read in tandem with a meta-theory that emphasizes that international criminal procedure has an irreducibly intrinsic value because it returns legal process to procedural vacuums. The present literature generally ignores this non-consequentialist value. In addition to this theoretical reorientation, several practical consequences follow, including a revised understanding of the principle of legality, the importance of local procedures, the use of guilty pleas and plea bargaining, and in absentia trials. Although the meta-theory does not dictate which of these procedural devices should be used, it does provide a new standard with which to evaluate them...|$|R
40|$|In this monograph, {{the author}} argues for the {{integration}} of the concept of forgiveness into <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> through incorporating restorative justice practices such as victim-offender mediation. Although forgiveness is not a purpose in itself nor can it be enforced, <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> should provide room for forgiveness. Contrary to retribution, in the sense of channelled revenge, forgiveness has, after all, proven its practical usefulness in conflict resolution and in paving the way for reconciliation. The author contends that it is about time that <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> is aimed at peace-making. This will inevitably entail significant changes to <b>substantive</b> and procedural <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> Ultimately, morality, law and politics should focus on achieving a harmonious, peaceful and, wherever possible, non-violent society. Civilisation is about more than merely substituting unbridled revenge by channelled revenge (retribution). The ideals glimmering on the horizon are repaying evil with goodness, restoration and forgiveness. This monograph discusses the views of several ethicists, philosophers, theologians, psychologists and legal scholars and seeks to provide answers to the following questions: what is forgiveness? How is it brought about? Are retribution and forgiveness each other’s opposites? Why is forgiveness important? Which view of mankind does it reflect? Does forgiveness belong to the public domain? How can it be shaped to fit into the criminal justice system? And what role does restorative justice play in this regard?

5000|$|The public {{authority}} justification is well-accepted, {{and it may}} be available even in cases where the particular criminal statute at issue does not expressly refer to a {{public authority}} justification. Prosecutions where such a [...] "public authority" [...] justification is invoked are understandably rare, see American Law Institute Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 3.03 Comment 1, at 23-24 (1985); cf. Visa Fraud Investigation, 8 Op. O.L.C. 284, 285 n.2, 286 (1984), and thus there is little case law in which courts have^ analyzed the scope of the justification with respect to the conduct of government officials. Nonetheless, discussions in the leading treatises and in the Model Penal Code demonstrate its legitimacy. See 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <b>Substantive</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law</b> § 10.2(b), at 135 (2d ed. 2003); Perkins & Boyce, Criminal Law at 1093 ("Deeds which otherwise would be criminal, such as taking or destroying property, taking hold of a person by force and against his will, placing him in confinement, or even taking his life, are not crimes if done with proper public authority."); see also Model Penal Code § 3.03(l)(a), (d), (e), at 22-23 (proposing codification of justification where conduct is [...] "required or authorized by," [...] inter alia, [...] "the law defining the duties or functions of a public officer," [...] "the law governing the armed services or the lawful conduct of war," [...] or [...] "any other provision of law imposing a public duty"); National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws, A Proposed New Federal Criminal Code § 602(1) (1971) ("Conduct engaged in by a public servant {{in the course of his}} official duties is justified when it is required or authorized by law."). And the Department's Office of Legal Counsel ("OLC") has invoked analogous rationales when it has analyzed whether Congress intended a particular criminal statute to prohibit specific conduct that otherwise falls within a government agency's authorities. See, e.g., Visa Fraud Investigation, 8 Op. O.L.C. at 287-88 (concluding that a civil statute prohibiting issuance of visa to an alien known to be ineligible did not prohibit State Department from issuing such a visa where [...] "necessary" [...] to facilitate an important Immigration and Naturalization Service undercover operation carried out in a [...] "reasonable" [...] fashion).|$|E

This will be followed by an analysis of the hybrid courts that have been established thus far. Furthermore, the advantages and reasons for which hybrid courts have been established in recent decades will be discussed, especially regarding their potential advantages as a transitional justice instrument. Moreover, disadvantages of hybrid courts and their deficiencies in the past will be addressed. Subsequently, the role of hybrid courts within the international legal system and their utility in the future will be discussed. This will include, on the one hand, the scope of the jurisdiction of hybrid courts in relation to other national and international criminal courts, especially vis-à-vis the ICC. On the other hand, it will be addressed whether hybrid courts will – or should – be established in the future, given the creation of the permanent ICC as well as the shortcomings of hybrid courts in the past. Against this background, the impact of hybrid courts on the further development of international <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> will be assessed in the third section of the paper (Chapter 4). In this regard, the discussion will focus on a representative selection of hybrid courts, namely the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL). It will be discussed how their legal bases as well as their jurisprudence relate to the previous state of international <b>criminal</b> <b>law,</b> and whether they constitute adverse diversifications or positive contributions to international <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> In a concluding section (Chapter 5), the results of the study will be analysed and possible correlations between the structural elements of hybrid courts and their impact on international <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> will be discussed.

40|$|New {{challenges}} of cross-border crime have sparked Member States’ {{awareness of the}} need to work closely together. At the same time, policy makers are looking for a knowledge based system of effective and efficient policies, both for the prevention and the fight against crime. To do so, one will need quantitative data on the levels, structures and trends of crime, on the measures taken to prevent and fight crime, and where possible, international comparisons to evaluate the allocation of resources. Hence the recent attention given to the lack of European statistical data. In June 2007, the European Commission launched a tender for the development of an EU-level Offence Classification System, focusing on terminology, concepts and definitions used, in the field of crime statistics. This paper presents the results of preliminary research conducted during the preparation of a research proposal following the above mentioned tender. As the European Commission expressly stated that an EU reference instrument needed to be created based on the existing harmonised offence definitions, the preliminary research was limited to these harmonised definitions: the authors will therefore analyse the current status questionis of <b>Substantive</b> European <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law.</b> Chapter one and two, dealing with the origin of the definitions, will reveal that 63 offence labels are defined in 101 instruments, of which framework decisions are not the most important source.
