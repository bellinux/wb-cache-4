25|$|A {{revolver}} {{works by}} having several firing chambers {{arranged in a}} circle in a cylindrical block that are brought into alignment with the firing mechanism and barrel one at a time. In contrast, other repeating firearms, such as bolt-action, lever-action, pump-action, and semi-automatic, have a <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> chamber and a mechanism to load and extract cartridges into it.|$|E
25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a medium that stays fluid for some time, may want one that dries hard, or may want a medium that remains {{somewhat}} sticky. If the medium dries hard the artist can build up layers of color, which will fuse {{together in a}} <b>single</b> <b>firing.</b> This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the artist can add to the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface.|$|E
50|$|On August 24, some {{media outlets}} {{reported}} that it had become the largest wildfire in Washington state history, surpassing the Carlton Complex fire of 2014. The Okanogan Complex fire has not merged into a <b>single</b> <b>fire,</b> and so the Carlton Complex remains the state's largest <b>single</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Mechanical {{efficiency}} was {{improved by}} reversing {{the action of}} the push rod. The firing impulse was generated at a low point of the cam instead of at the lobe of the cam as in Saulnier's patent. Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being [...] "pulled" [...] rather than [...] "pushed") which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of the gear, each revolution of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> lever engaged the gear and fired the gun in one action, rather than the gear having to be [...] "turned on" [...] and then fired, as with some earlier gears.|$|E
50|$|Considering even-firing engines only, {{unlike a}} {{four-stroke}} straight-four, -six or -eight cylinder engine, each five-cylinder crank configuration will support only a <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> order (plus reverse).|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{two-stroke}} engines, all inline engines are similarly limited in having a <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> order for a given crank configuration; because a complete cycle occurs every 360 degrees, {{there is no chance}} to share piston phases without having simultaneous ignitions, so the inline-five is at no disadvantage in this case.|$|E

5000|$|The Medusa M47 is a {{revolver}} manufactured by Phillips & Rodgers {{in the late}} 1990s, {{and is based on}} the Smith and Wesson K frame, capable of cambering and firing around 25 different calibers.

50|$|The JM cloche {{closely resembles}} the GFM cloche {{in size and}} construction. It exists in three versions, all {{designed}} Model 1930: small, large and two-man. JM cloches had a <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> port, which was flanked on either side by trapezoidal observation ports. The blank rear was frequently backed by a concrete-covered embankment, which provided additional cover and reduced the prominence of the cloche.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the clay}} composition, Bizen wares are fired slowly {{over a long}} period of time. Firings take place only once or twice a year, with the firing period lasting for 10-14 days. Red pine is used for {{firewood}} because the resin it contains helps to produce a high temperature fire. Thousand of logs might be used in a <b>single</b> <b>firing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both Ancient Roman {{pottery and}} medieval Chinese pottery could be fired in {{industrial}} quantities, {{with tens of}} thousands of pieces in a <b>single</b> <b>firing.</b> Early examples of simpler kilns found in Britain include those that made roof-tiles during the Roman occupation. These kilns were built up the side of a slope, such that a fire could be lit at the bottom and the heat would rise up into the kiln.|$|E

50|$|According to the New Zealand Fire Service Act 1975, a chief fire {{officer in}} the New Zealand Fire Service {{commands}} a <b>single</b> <b>fire</b> district. This may be a volunteer fire brigade, with a <b>single</b> <b>fire</b> station, in an outer-urban or rural area, or it may consist of several fire stations in a metropolitan area, staffed by career firefighters. Auckland and Wellington, with their geographic sprawl, have their career stations divided into multiple districts - two in Wellington (Wellington City, which includes Porirua, and Hutt), and five in Auckland (Auckland City Central, Auckland City East, North Shore, Waitakere (west), and Manukau (south)). The other fourteen cities in New Zealand that have career firefighters are sufficiently compact geographically to allow each one to be a <b>single</b> <b>fire</b> district.|$|R

5000|$|The LSM {{was one of}} a type of {{amphibious warfare}} ships {{alongside}} the Landing Ship Tank and Landing Ship Infantry. In the Normandy landings of 1944, some of the larger landing craft had been fitted with artillery, ship guns and rockets (e.g. LCI(R) [...] ) to aid the bombardment of the German defences. A British LCT(R) could deliver 1,000 3-inch rockets in <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> onto the beaches - said to be the firepower of 80 cruisers.|$|E
50|$|It has {{space for}} 8 {{soldiers}} with their equipment plus 2 crew members. The troops enter and leave via twin {{doors in the}} rear of the hull which open outwards, each door are fitted with one single bulletproof window and one firing port. The roof of the crew compartment is fitted with 6 hatches and each side of the hull can be fitted with three to four bulletproof windows with one <b>single</b> <b>firing</b> port under each window.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} available to record brain activity—including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI)—but these do not allow for single-neuron resolution. Neurons are the basic functional units in the brain; they transmit information through the body using electrical signals called action potentials. Currently, single-unit recordings provide the most precise recordings from single neurons. A single unit is defined as a <b>single,</b> <b>firing</b> neuron whose spike potentials are distinctly isolated by a recording microelectrode.|$|E
