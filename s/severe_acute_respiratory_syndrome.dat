The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E

In March 2008, prior to the full effect of the financial crisis of 2007–2010 on the global economy, the airport was predicted to handle 50million passengers by 2012 due to the opening of casinos in Singapore and the phased liberalisation of the Asean aviation sector.

It is caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS-CoV. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.|$|E

25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{has also}} been connected with the current spread of <b>Severe</b> <b>Acute</b> <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (SARS). This is partly because migrants can {{have a difficult time}} moving to new environments, as they lack the natives’ resistance to local diseases and infections. Many migrants are also at greater risk of becoming sick because of the marginal conditions in which they live. However, as described above, the majority of the attention has been on circular migrants as disease carriers. Contact with migrant workers places their rural partners at greater risk for acquiring STDs. Due to the nature of their work, circular migrants are gone from home often and for great lengths of time, which can disrupt the balance of their family and sex lives.|$|E
25|$|Michael Gribskov, then at UCSD's San Diego Supercomputer {{department}} and {{now at the}} department of biological sciences at Purdue University, was elected president in 2003. That year ISMB took place in Brisbane, Australia, which {{was the first time the}} meeting was held outside North America or Europe. This phase brought many uncertainties for the society when attendance dropped to one half of budgeted expectations due to travel fears and restrictions related to outbreaks of <b>Severe</b> <b>Acute</b> <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Syndrome</b> or SARS, the start of the war in Iraq, and the location, which broke with the pattern of North American and European venues. Although scientifically successful, the financial losses of ISMB 2003 left ISCB financially unstable for the first time in its history.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, an {{epidemic}} of <b>severe</b> <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SARS) broke out in China. (See Progress of the SARS outbreak.) The spread of SARS brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government implemented a series of measures to strengthen its public health system. This effort coincided with acceleration in efforts to control tuberculosis. Within 3 years, implementation of the WHO-recommended DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy, Shortcourse) strategy to control tuberculosis increased from 68% to 100% of counties and the detection of cases of smear-positive tuberculosis by the public health system more than doubled, from 30% of new cases to 80%. Together with a tuberculosis treatment success {{rate of more than}} 90%, China achieved the 2005 global targets for tuberculosis control.|$|E
30|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work of Kermack and McKendrick [1] on compartment modeling, mathematical modeling {{has become an}} important tool in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases.

25|$|The {{challenge}} {{of managing the}} <b>severe</b> <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SARS) epidemic (November 2002 to June 2003) is often credited with further motivating the government to take aggressive policy action on HIV-related issues. SARS showed not only how infectious diseases could threaten economic and social stability but also the effect of China's policies on international health problems. Policymakers announced a change of focus from purely economic goals to increasing the focus on health and social wellbeing and, as a result, increased support for public health agencies. In controlling SARS, contact {{between the government and}} international agencies such as WHO, UN, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was essential and further stimulated stronger international collaboration for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Intervention strategies necessary for SARS control have been translated into HIV/AIDS prevention – e.g., real-time electronic case reporting.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis is a {{major public}} health problem in China. China has the world's third largest cases of {{tuberculosis}} (after India and Indonesia), but progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control {{can be linked to}} a malfunctioning health system. The spread of <b>severe</b> <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public health system. After the government realized the impact that the SARS outbreak had on the country, they increased leadership in their health department. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public health problems and, among other efforts, increased public health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system to improve transparency, reach and speed, and started a program to rebuild local public health facilities and national infrastructure.|$|E

500|$|Sarsgaard hosted Saturday Night Live (SNL) on January 21, 2006. In his {{introductory}} monologue, {{he tried}} {{to point out that}} he was a nice guy despite his sometimes macabre roles. Video clips were then played of Sarsgaard scaring the SNL cast. One sketch featured the <b>Severe</b> <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SARS) global scare, which was still fresh in many minds, and one of the skits included a promotion for the Peter Sarsgaard [...] "SARS-Guard", a reference to the mania of facemasks worn in public by those fearing infection.|$|E
500|$|They {{are also}} {{implicated in the}} {{emergence}} of SARS (<b>severe</b> <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>syndrome),</b> since they serve as a natural host for the type of virus involved (the genus Coronavirus, whose members typically cause mild respiratory disease in humans). A joint CAS/CSIRO team using phylogenetic analysis found that the SARS Coronavirus originated within the SARS-like Coronavirus group carried by the bat population in China. However, note that they only served as the source of the precursor virus (which [...] "jumped" [...] to humans and evolved into the strain responsible for SARS): bats do not carry the SARS virus itself.|$|E
500|$|As {{humans have}} changed their {{behaviour}} during history, so have viruses. In ancient times the human population was too small for pandemics to occur and, {{in the case of}} some viruses, too small for them to survive. In the 20th and 21st century increasing population densities, revolutionary changes in agriculture and farming methods, and high speed travel have contributed to the spread of new viruses and the re-appearance of old ones. [...] Like smallpox, some viral diseases might be conquered, but new ones, such as <b>severe</b> <b>acute</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SARS), will continue to emerge. Although vaccines are still the most powerful weapon against viruses, in recent decades antiviral drugs have been developed to specifically target viruses as they replicate in their hosts. The 2009 influenza pandemic showed how rapidly new strains of viruses continue to spread around the world, despite efforts to contain them.|$|E
