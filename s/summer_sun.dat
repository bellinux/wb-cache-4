5|$|Pygmy sundews: A {{group of}} roughly 40 Australian species, they are {{distinguished}} by miniature growth, {{the formation of}} gemmae for asexual reproduction, and dense formation of hairs in the crown center. These hairs serve to protect the plants from Australia's intense <b>summer</b> <b>sun.</b> Pygmy sundews form the subgenus Bryastrum.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
25|$|The under-layer {{provides}} insulation {{against both}} severe Anatolian winters and the fierce <b>summer</b> <b>sun,</b> while the outer-layer repels water and snow.

25|$|Dohäsan was {{the primary}} {{calendar}} keeper among the Kiowa {{throughout most of the}} 19th century. He added many innovations to Kiowa pictorial art. In his winter count, he added an image for each year's <b>summer</b> <b>Sun</b> Dance. To painted tipi designs, Dohäsan introduced images of counting coup. When he died, his nephew Agiati became a calendar keeper, followed in turn by Agiati's son, Silver Horn (1860–1940), one of the most prolific of all Kiowa artists.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} logo for {{the tournament}} was unveiled at a special event in Melbourne, in October 2012. Designed by Sydney agency, WiteKite. The logo depicts a stylised player, kicking a football from {{the east coast of}} Australia across country towards Asia. The ball also represents the Australian <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> arcing west from Australia to Asia. The four golden bands forming the map of Australia represent the four host cities. The design is embraced by the AFC holding device.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the lack of}} employment for many of those arriving at the Durst Ranch, living conditions for the temporary field hands were particularly abysmal. Workers lived in tents in the hot <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> on a barren hillside, paying Durst 75 cents per week for the privilege as a rental fee. More workers were on hand than could be accommodated in these tents, however, forcing some to make do in the elements under crude structures constructed from poles and burlap sacks.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{repeat the}} entire process three more times until the ice pier is {{approximately}} 6.7m (22ft) thick. Wooden utility poles drilled about four deep into the final ice pier support electrical and telephone service to the pier. Moreover, during the final construction phase, personnel mount shorter poles in the ice edge to serve as bollards to secure the pier to the shore at McMurdo. A 15–20cm (6–8in) layer of volcanic gravel tops off the pier to provide a non-slip surface and to insulate the ice from the <b>summer</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{style of}} Maury known as rancio is {{produced}} when the wine is racked into clear glass demi-johns or bonbonne and {{left out in}} the <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> to oxidize and age. This causes many of the colour compounds and tannins in the wines to fall out, leaving a thick, dark coloured deposit in the bonbonne. This deposit is allowed to stay in the bonbonne to influence the colour and flavour of resulting vintages of wine that are aged in the container. Once the wine has finished aging for the summer it is usually blended with wine that has spent time aging in large foudres oak cask or sold separately as Maury Rancio.|$|E
25|$|Only 27 intrepid French {{settlers}} {{were able}} to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today's Denton County in Texas (northwest of Dallas). The small group arrived June 2, 1848, and immediately began a frenzied effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting {{at the same time to}} plow and farm the prairie. Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> began to bake the ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of cholera and malaria, illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest. Making a bad situation still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1986 Mariani briefly joined The <b>Summer</b> <b>Suns,</b> {{which played}} {{a blend of}} 1960s folk rock and 1970s power pop with an {{emphasis}} on melody. The band was formed by Kim Williams (ex-Louie Louie, Holy Rollers) on lead vocals, guitar and bass guitar, and had a variable line-up that included Mariani, Chambers and Zapunovich as well as other Perth musicians. In October they issued a debut single, [...] "Rachel Anne", on Williams's own label, Easter Records. Mariani left for other commitments but returned in 1989 for a new line-up of The <b>Summer</b> <b>Suns</b> with Williams now joined by Moon and Steve Kind on bass guitar. They issued a second single, [...] "All Away", in September before Mariani moved on again.|$|R

500|$|The {{remaining}} Highlanders, {{now under}} the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Hughes-Hallet of the Seaforths, had been lying prone under a harsh <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> {{for most of the day}} with the Boers still attempting to encircle them from the south. In the late afternoon, those who remained alive stood up and fled west towards the main body of British troops. This unexpected move left many of the field guns which had been advanced to the front line over the course of the morning exposed to the Boers. [...] Only a lack of initiative on the part of the Boers saved the guns from being captured. [...] The gap created by the hurried withdrawal of the Highland Brigade was filled by the Gordons and the Scots Guards.|$|E
500|$|Retrospectively, Beating as One {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the band's best work. AllMusic reviewer Fred Thomas described it as [...] "a definitive master statement. The subtly shifting moods and wide, curious palette of stylistic exploration resulted in a lasting indie rock classic, essential listening and also something of a blueprint for much of what followed from like-minded bands for years to come." [...] The A.V. Club editor John Krewson remarked that the album marked the point when the band started to [...] " [...] on electronica" [...] with songs such as [...] "Moby Octopad" [...] and [...] "Autumn Sweater", calling it [...] "an example of a band having great fun exploring the possibilities of pop music." [...] In his review of the band's 2003 album <b>Summer</b> <b>Sun,</b> Christgau praised Beating as One as Yo La Tengo's [...] "career album", commenting that [...] "It's no challenge or insult to state categorically that they'll never top it."

[...] But {{there was only one}} documented civilian death during the battle: Ginnie Wade (also widely known as Jennie), 20 years old, was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen in town while she was making bread. [...] Another notable civilian casualty was John L. Burns, a 69-year old veteran of the War of 1812 who walked to the front lines {{on the first day of}} battle and participated in heavy combat as a volunteer, receiving numerous wounds in the process. Despite his age and injuries, Burns survived the battle and lived until 1872. Nearly 8,000 had been killed outright; these bodies, lying in the hot <b>summer</b> <b>sun,</b> needed to be buried quickly. Over 3,000 horse carcasses were burned in a series of piles south of town; townsfolk became violently ill from the stench. [...] Meanwhile, the town of Gettysburg, with its population of just 2,400, found itself tasked with taking care of 14,000 wounded Union troops and an additional 8,000 Confederate prisoners.|$|E

500|$|It {{consists}} of two spirals: one principal and one ancillary. The latter left-hand spiral captured both spring and fall equinoxes; its artifice was revealed by a descending spear of light, itself filtered through the slabs, that shined upon it and split it in two. The former and larger whorl to its right was lit by the titular [...] "sun dagger", which bisected it through another interplay of slab and sun. It struck it, brilliantly, as the <b>summer</b> <b>sun</b> attains its solstice midday peak. The Chacoans {{were said to be}} marking, as artist, [...] "Sun Dagger" [...] discoverer, and leading proponent Anna Sofaer puts it, [...] "the middle of time". Each turn of the 9.25-turn large spiral was found to mark one year in the 18.6-year [...] "lunar excursion cycle" [...] of the rising mid-winter full moon. This record is kept by a slab-cast lunar shadow whose edge strikes in succession each ring. As the full [...] "minimum moon" [...] closest to the winter solstice rises, the shadow's edge precisely strikes the center of the larger spiral; it steps outward year by year, ring by ring, until it strikes the outermost edge of it during the full [...] "maximum moon", again in mid-winter.|$|E
