The sludge is loaded via a series of transfer, settle, decant, and filtration return steps until the STSC sludge transportation limits are met.

40|$|Although {{the rare}} earth {{elements}} (REE) are playing {{a key role in}} our lives, their recycling ratio is close to 1 % [1]. The biggest markets for REE are lamp phosphors (LP) and permanent magnets, making up almost 75 % of all REE trade. This work focuses on LP recycling. The most common recycling route for the LP is leaching, followed by solvent extraction (SX) [2]. SX is usually undertaken by batteries of mixer – settlers in series. The phosphors studied is yttrium oxide (YOX) red phosphors which is of highest economical importance [1] since it contains 20 wt. % REE (95 mol % Y and 5 mol % Eu). Microstructured extractors are known for high mass transfer area per volume. They were previously used for actinide [3] and REE [4] separation. However, currently there is no study on SX of Eu and Y in microchannels especially with the perspective of industrial application. Our aim is to optimize process parameters and investigate the possible improvements of retrofitting a microchannel mixer and a milliliter size <b>settling</b> <b>vessel</b> to the existing SX of red phosphors. For the SX experiments, a synthetic aqueous leachate of Eu and Y was used with a total REE concentration of 0. 1 mol. L- 1. The pH of the aqueous phase was varied with HCl between 1 and 4. The organic phase was the industry standard extracting agent di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (DEHPA) in kerosene. The mixer was assembled using 0. 1 – 0. 75 mm FEP tubing. The 810 mm tube was fitted to a T-junction which was fed by 2 syringe pumps to supply the two phases (Fig. 1). The total flow rate was varied between 0. 03 and 4. 5 ml. min- 1 giving slug flow regime with passage time of 314 and 2. 5 seconds, respectively. The phase ratio was varied between 0. 1 and 2. The settler volume was 1 ml, which was sufficient to give a settling time varying from 0. 2 to 30 min. The optimum residence time was found to be 30 s in the mixing channel, allowing extraction equilibrium to be reached, while 20 s in the settler was found to yield effective separation. Overall, the mixing – settling time is up to 25 times faster than in conventional systems. Forward and reverse mass transfer coefficients were calculated by fitting an analytical model to the experimental data (Fig. 2). The optimum pH, phase ratio and DEHPA concentration are found, making these results applicable to the current REE recycling route. Reference 1 : K. Binnemans, p. T.

Hematopoietic stem cell-derived microglia, nevertheless, represents a promising tool for the correction of genetic defi cits in the brain. We thus investigated the fate of primary human monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages, following transplantation into the adult mouse brain overpassing the BBB. Furthermore, we documented the ability of such cells to deliver a ly sosomal enzyme into the brain following genetic modi fication with a recombinant adenoviral vector carry ing the human β -glucuronidase cDNA.

They {{have been applied}} to DMX a three-dimensional model of polydisperse cohesive spheres flowing into a cylindrical <b>vessel,</b> <b>settling</b> and then subject to vibration. The model takes account of gravitational potential energy, linear and tangential 'particle spring' potential energies and net work done by the particles, normal and angular kinetic energies, dissipated energies due to linear and tangential damping and friction, and the work done by the vibrating vessel on the particle system. Energy monitoring enhances understanding of the physics and further validates the program code. It {{was found that the}} numerical technique inherently introduces artificial energy components, but that these can be explicitly monitored. Energy conservation was thus verified and the artificial components explained. Simulations of various particle types and sizes were performed monitoring all the energy components with time. The results show that explicit dissipated energy calculation is required and cannot be simplified as the remainder term of total minus potential and kinetic energies, and that energy is dissipated mainly in normal damping and gross sliding. Total energy dissipation is not sensitive to particle stiffness, but moderately sensitive to damping and friction. However, the maximum rate of energy dissipation is significantly affected by the damping coefficient and the particle stiffness, and only negligibly by the friction coefficient. Initial studies showed that in some low energy vibration the artificial energy component is not negligible and its effect must be considered in some DEM applications...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy is a novel, {{non-invasive}} cancer treatment. Radioactive hollow microspheres, i. e., microcapsules, {{are attractive}} for in situ cancer radiotherapy {{because they can}} effectively reach tumors without <b>settling</b> in blood <b>vessels.</b> In particular, microcapsules 20 - 30 µm in size are expected to exhibit not only a radiotherapy effect but also embolization that blocks the nutrient supply to cancer cells. β-ray irradiation is the most suitable source for in situ radiotherapy because of its moderate range. Several kinds of β-emitting yttria (Y 2 O 3) microcapsules have therefore been developed. Yttrium phosphate (YPO 4) should have a longer irradiation effect than that of Y 2 O 3 because the half-life of 31 P (14. 3 days) is longer than that of 90 Y (64. 1 hours). However, the preparation of YPO 4 microcapsules has not been reported to date. In the present study, YPO 4 microcapsules were fabricated using a water/oil (W/O) emulsion prepared by first dispersing a YPO 4 sol into toluene containing a surfactant, with mechanical homogenization. The emulsion was then added into butanol to dehydrate the water phase and precipitate microcapsules. These were then heat-treated to improve their mechanical strength and chemical stability. Microcapsule fragility at low YPO 4 sol concentrations in the water phase was attributed to the thinness of the microcapsule shell. The size of the microcapsules decreased with increasing emulsification speed. The chemical stability of the prepared microcapsules is {{similar to those of}} previously reported YPO 4 and Y 2 O 3 microspheres in weakly acidic conditions. Thus, little leakage of radioactive species into nearby healthy tissues is expected. The obtained microcapsules are expected to be highly effective for cancer radiotherapy...|$|R

But the cables were no sooner taut than the numerous anchors resisted, and brought the bark head to wind. Maso felt the yielding of the vessel's stern, as she swung furiously round, and he cheered aloud. The trembling of the timbers, the dashing against the pointed beak, and that high jet of water, which shot up over the bows and fell heavily on the forecastle, washing aft in a flood, were so many evidences that the cables were true.

40|$|Solid particles, {{suspended}} in a fluid {{and subject to}} an external force, such as gravity, settle if {{the density of the}} particles is higher than the density of the fluid. This process, which separates fluid and particles, is called sedimentation. It is important for a variety of processes in nature and industry. While naturally occuring particles {{come in a variety of}} shapes with smooth and rough surfaces, many of the fundamental issues of the sedimentation process can be studied with spherical particles. Experimentally, this situation can be realized, for instance, for glass beads which <b>settle</b> in a <b>vessel.</b> For these systems, theoretical predictions and experiments agree about the average settling rate of the particles, which depends on the concentration of the particles in the fluid. In contrast, there is much controversy about the fluctuations of the particle velocities. Available theories assume that the flow past a particle obeys the steady Stokes equation, i. e. the flow is proportional to the instantaneous particle velocity and decays as $ 1 /$distance from the particle. Caflisch and Luke (Phys. Fluids, 28 : 759, 1985) pointed out that due to these long-range hydrodynamic interactions, the fluctuations diverge for a homogeneous distribution of particles: At a distance $r$ from a particle, the fluctuations of the flow produced by that particle decay as the velocity squared, i. e. as $ 1 /r^ 2 $. Since a spherical shell at distance $r$ and of width $dr$ contains $r^ 2 dr$ particles, all shells contribute equally to the fluctuations and the integral over all shells diverges with the volume of the vessel. While numerical simulations confirm the divergence, it is in marked contrast to experiments, which show that the flow is correlated on a finite length and that correlation length and fluctuations are finite and independent of the vessel size. To uncover the discrepancy between simulations and experiments, a number of theoretical studies have looked at effects of the wall, vertical stratification of the sediment or particle concentration fluctuations. However, no conclusive explanation of the discrepancies has emerged. All theories and simulations for sedimentation above assume that the flow past the particles is steady Stokes flow. This assumption is believed to be fairly robust. In this work, the assumption is dropped and the flow is assumed to be unsteady Stokes flow, i. e. the temporal evolution of the velocity field is taken into account. How does unsteady Stokes flow differ from steady Stokes flow? The differences between steady and unsteady flow are known since the equations were formulated. In his seminal 1851 article, which is most of all famous for the equations which describe the steady flow around a steadily moving sphere, Stokes also provided the equations for the time-dependent flow past a sphere whose center of mass is in oscillatory motion. However, the consequences of the differences between the two cases and in particular their implications for sediment fluctuations have not been studied. As we show here, taking the time-dependence into account goes a long way towards resolving many of the puzzles. In order to see the effects of a time-dependent solution rather more clearly and not clouded by technicalities, we consider the situation of diffusional spreading from localized, sat fluctuating sources. For a homogeneous distribution of sources it is shown that the fluctuations of the concentration field are finite if the full time-dependent equation is used for the concentration field. In contrast, if the concentration field is approximated by the quasisteady concentration field, the fluctuations diverge. The concentration field model suggests new experiments to check time-dependence effects. Moreover, we show that the velocity fluctuations of a particle suspension are finite if the flow around the particles is described by the time-dependent Stokes equation. The fluctuations are regularized essentially due to a cut-off of the steady Stokes flow velocity field. Taking this cut-off into account, the velocity fluctuations for a particle suspension is found in agreement with experimental measurements. Time-dependence of Stokes flow is shown to be important for the dynamics of a particle suspension. This thesis initiates further investigations on particle suspensions and related problems, which take into account time-dependent Stokes flow...|$|R
