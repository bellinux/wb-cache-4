50|$|The process {{started with}} paper made from cotton rags. Before the {{processing}} of wood pulp and chemical wood pulps in the mid-19th century, the dominant fibre source for paper making was cotton and linen rags. The cotton rag sheet produced for conversion to vulcanized fibre is made like a sheet suitable for saturating. A paper is made for saturating by omitting any sizing additive, either beater added or surface applied. Today most paper sheets made for writing, printing, and coating have internal (beater added) sizing provided by rosin, alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA), or alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> provided by starch. A sheet made for saturating {{would have none of}} those chemical ingredients.

40|$|That <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> has {{an impact}} on {{attention}} has been well-known in advertising research for almost a century; however, theoretical accounts of this effect have been sparse. To address this issue, we review studies on <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> effects on eye movements in this paper. While most studies find that large objects {{are more likely to be}} fixated, receive more fixations, and are fixated faster than small objects, a comprehensive explanation of this effect is still lacking. To bridge the theoretical gap, we relate the findings from this review to three theories of <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> effects suggested in the literature: a linear model based on the assumption of random fixations (Lohse, 1997), a theory of <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> as visual saliency (Pieters et al., 2007), and a theory based on competition for attention (Janiszewski, 1998). We furthermore suggest a fourth model – demand for attention –which we derive from the theory of competition for attention by revising the underlying model assumptions. In order to test the models against each other, we reanalyse data from an eye tracking study investigating <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> and saliency effects on attention. The reanalysis revealed little support for the first three theories while the demand for attention model showed a much better alignment with the data. We conclude that <b>surface</b> <b>size</b> effects may best be explained as an increase in object signal strength which depends on object size, number of objects in the visual scene, and object distance to the centre of the scene. Our findings suggest that advertisers should take into account how objects in the visual scene interact in order to optimize attention to, for instance, brands and logos...|$|R

The parameters determined were the dispersive {{component of the}} surface free energy, the enthalpy of adsorption and the entropy of adsorption of polar and apolar probes, the Lewis acidity constant, Ka, and the Lewis basicity constant, Kb. It can be concluded that the dispersive component of the surface free energy, ?sd decreases with temperature, in the range 50 – 90 °C. The temperature coefficient of ?sd, d?sd/dT, is - 0. 35 mJm - 2 K- 1. The values of Ka and Kb were determined to be 0. 11 ± 0. 011 and 0. 94 ± 0. 211, respectively.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>sizing</b> at high at solids {{contents}} from 8 % to 30 % yields up to 75 % {{savings in}} afterdrying capacity. Decreasing the wetting {{of the sheet}} will also increase paper machine efficiency by {{reducing the number of}} web breaks. Also, the same afterdrying capacity can be used for both MSP coating and <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> at size solids contents of 20 %- 30 %. <b>Surface</b> <b>sizing</b> solids contents of up to 30 % have not been used due to the insufficient stability of starch at elevated solids contents and maintaining the binding power of the starch. Also the ability to maintain the amount of starch at the MSP application at very high solids contents has been lacking. Here, both the chemistry of the starch solutions and the application technology used needed to be developed in order to produce the desired applied starch amount at starch solids contents of up to 30 % with desired binding properties. The features of the base paper also needed to be adjusted to fit the features of high solids <b>surface</b> <b>sizing.</b> The findings of this study prove {{that it is possible to}} use a wide variety of starch viscosities and molecular weights even at increased solids contents. Increasing starch solids contents with more stable starches is therefore not restricted to highly degraded starches only with their lower binding power. When the solids content of the starch solution is increased from 8 % to 30 %, less starch penetrates into the sheet and more starch remains on the paper surface. The concentration of starch on the surface of paper decreases sheet porosity, oil absorption and internal strength, as well as increases its surface strength and bending stiffness. At very high solids contents internal strength behavior also suggests that starch may locally penetrate into the larger sheet pores. This observation is supported by pore size distribution analysis. The base paper for high solids <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> can also be optimized by adjusting the press to dryer web draw. Here, the aim could be to minimize the press draw below 2 % when internal strength or air permeability are critical. A method for obtaining more informative starch distribution curves was developed to provide a helpful tool in characterizing the effect of various process parameters on the z-distribution of starch in the sheet. An additional feature of this method is the definition of a dimensionless penetration number Qtot that can be used to quantitatively compare the penetration of <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> starch in different paper samples. A novel interpretation is presented of the role of <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> starch with respect to the elastic modulus and bending stiffness properties of the sheet. When increasing the elastic modulus or bending stiffness of the sheet, starch may merely promote shrinkage potential instead, which leads – when shrinkage is not allowed – to increased drying stress that, in turn, leads to an increase in the elastic modulus of the sheet and a further increase in bending stiffness. reviewe...|$|E

30|$|Sizing is {{a widely}} used process to impart water {{resistance}} to paper and paperboard by treating fiber substrate with hydrophobic substance. There {{are two types of}} sizing: <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> and internal sizing. Internal sizing chemicals used in papermaking at the wet end are Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) [14 – 16], alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA) [17] and rosin [18]. <b>Surface</b> <b>sizing</b> agents consist of mainly modified starches and other chemicals, such as waterborne polyurethane [19, 20], styrene/acrylic type polymers [21 – 23]. <b>Surface</b> <b>sizing</b> agents are amphiphilic molecules having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to fibers substrate and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent, which can prevent water to wetting the paper sheet. What is wetting? Wetting is the ability of liquids to form interfaces with solid surfaces. To determine the degree of wetting, the water contact angle that is formed between the liquid and the solid surface is measured, which is a good indicator of wetting or dewetting. The smaller the water contact angle and the smaller the surface tension, the greater the degree of wetting [24]. The Young’s equation describes wetting if 0 ° ≤ θ <  90 ° and non-wetting if θ >  90 °, which mean a water drop spreading out to increase the contact surface on a hydrophilic surface, but minimizing the contact surface on a hydrophobic surface. By the same token, for paper or paperboard, the greater the water contact angle, the better the water resistance. From the Young’s equation, the high surface tension of solid is more easily wetted than that of low surface tension. <b>Surface</b> <b>sizing</b> agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to reduce the surface tension of the sheet, which make the paper sheet water-repellent and which is also the <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> mechanism.|$|E

The penetration degree of the ink pigment was RPS 1 < RPS 3 << RPS 2 << RP and the results were found to be related to the polar component of the surface energy.

40|$|Paper {{materials}} are cost effective and lightweight, {{they can easily}} be recycled and their use {{as an alternative to}} plastics is advantageous from an environmental and sustainability perspective. However, competing with plastics for packaging applications is a challenge for cellulosic products. The material needs to be strong and stiff also when exposed to liquids or moisture during transportation and storage. To achieve this for paper materials, which are intrinsically hydrophilic {{due to the nature of}} the cellulose, they need to be hydrophobized.  In the paper industry the hydrophobization process is referred to as sizing and sizing can be achieved in two ways: adding the hydrophobic compound to the pulp (internal sizing) or on the formed paper surface (<b>surface</b> <b>sizing).</b> Recent development in paper hydrophobization has been towards <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> since this method gives better retention of the hydrophobic compound and is also more effective on recycled fibers. There is a plethora of <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> products and these products are very efficient in making the paper surface more water resistant, but there is a lack of fundamental knowledge on how they work. The type of <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> products studied in this thesis is hydrophobic nanoparticle suspensions and four different particle types have been explored. They have the same polymeric core but different surface charges and chemistries. In the <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> application, the suspension is mixed with a starch solution where the starch is added to increase the surface strength of the paper. However, in this thesis it is shown that the starch can have a more active role in controlling the degree of hydrophobization. In the study of the colloidal systems it was found that cationic particles form aggregates with the starch and by maximizing this aggregation a paper surface takes up significantly less water. The aggregation behavior was thoroughly studied and the aggregation could be tuned by amylopectin content, temperature and time. An increased ionic strength had a pronounced effect on the electrosterically stabilized aggregates. Larger aggregates were formed at intermediate ionic strength and when the ionic strength was high enough the system collapsed and large flocs were formed. Both these effects were detrimental for the performance.     In the <b>surface</b> <b>sizing</b> procedure the particle/starch mixture is applied on the paper surface and the liquid penetrates into the paper matrix due to external pressure and capillary forces. The distribution of the hydrophobic polymer on and in the paper was evaluated with time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). The surface distribution did not correlate with the water uptake results, indicating that it is not merely the outermost surface that needs to be hydrophobized in order to have a sufficiently low water uptake.
