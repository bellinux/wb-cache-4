40|$|The basic {{surface wind}} was {{computed}} from the gradient wind with modifications by typhoon translation and <b>supergradient</b> <b>wind</b> inside the eye. For {{the data of}} Typhoon 9119 (MIREILLE), a good relationship between the maximum basic surface wind speed {{and the rate of}} wooden house damages was obtained with the correlation coefficient of 0. 91. Using this method, a hindcast of wind damages of Typhoon 9019 (FLO) was executed and a significant result was obtained. The basic surface wind was also related well to the rate of electric pole dameges by Typhoon 9119 with the correlation coefficient of 0. 54. Therefore, the basic surface wind is considered to be valuable for the prediction of disasters by severe winds in typhoons hitting Japan. In the near future, two methods for prediction of damages by high wind in typhoons will be developed. One of the methods can be used for the prediction of wind disasters at the real time, and the other for the prediction of disaters expected in such a long period as 100 years for design purpose...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of the {{tropopause}} temperature on the intensity of idealized tropical cyclones (TCs) superimposed on background states of radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) in a three-dimensional (3 D) mesoscale model. Simulations are performed with constant sea surface temperature and an isothermal stratosphere with constant tropopause temperature. The potential intensity (PI) computed from the thermodynamic profiles of the RCE state (before the TCs are superimposed on it) increases by 0. 4 – 1 m s⁻¹ for each 1 K of tropopause temperature reduction. The 3 D TC experiments yield intense tropical cyclones whose intensities exceed the PI value substantially. It is further shown that the discrepancy may be largely explained by the <b>supergradient</b> <b>wind</b> in the 3 D simulations. The intensities of these 3 D TCs increase by ~ 0. 4 m s⁻¹ per 1 K of cooling in the tropopause temperature in RCE, on {{the low end of the}} PI dependence on the tropopause temperature. Sensitivity experiments with a larger horizontal grid spacing of 8 km produce less intense TCs, as expected, but similar dependence (~− 0. 5 m s⁻¹ K⁻¹) on tropopause temperature. Equilibrium TC solutions are further obtained in 200 -day experiments with different values of constant stratospheric temperature. Similar relationships between TC intensity and tropopause temperature are also found in these equilibrium TC solutions...|$|E
40|$|In Part I of this study, the {{association}} between the secondary eyewall formation (SEF) and the broadening of the outer swirling wind in Typhoon Sinlaku (2008) was documented. The findings from Part I help {{lay the groundwork for}} the application of a newly proposed intensification paradigm to SEF. Part II presents a new model for SEF that utilizes this new paradigm and its axisymmetric view of the dynamics. The findings point to a sequence of structure changes that occur in the vortex’s outer-core region, culminating in SEF. The sequence begins with a broadening of the tangential winds, followed by an increase of the corre-sponding boundary layer (BL) inflow and an enhancement of convergence in the BL where the secondary eyewall forms. The narrow region of strong BL convergence is associated with the generation of supergradient winds in and just above the BL that acts to rapidly decelerate inflow there. The progressive strengthening of BL inflow and the generation of an effective adverse radial force therein leads to an eruption of air from the BL to support convection outside the primary eyewall in a favorable thermodynamic/kinematic environment. The results suggest that the unbalanced response in the BL serves as an important mechanism for initiating and sustaining a ring of deep convection in a narrow <b>supergradient</b> <b>wind</b> zone outside the primary eyewall. This progressive BL control on SEF suggests that the BL scheme and its coupling to the interior flow need to b...|$|E
40|$|An {{observational}} study of tropical cyclone spin-up {{is performed using}} dropsondes and satellite imagery from Supertyphoon Jangmi and Hurricane Georges. Additionally, ELDORA data are analyzed in Tropical Storm Jangmi. The dropsonde analysis shows that the peak tangential wind occurs persistently within the boundary layer and suggests that significant <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> are present there. However, {{as a result of}} data limitations arising from asymmetries and irregular placement of dropsondes in both time and space, a strongly conclusive statement about the presence of <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> in Tropical Storm Jangmi is not possible. A dense deployment of dropsondes across the RMW is recommended to resolve the pressure gradient with sufficient accuracy to validate that <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> exist at the tropical storm stage. An examination of ELDORA data in Tropical Storm Jangmi indicates that multiple rotating updrafts are present near the eye underneath cold cloud tops of - 65 C. Analysis of the infrared satellite imagery from both storms suggests that rotating updrafts are omnipresent before and during rapid intensification. The findings of this study support a new theoretical model positing that spin-up of the maximum winds occurs within the boundary layer and rotating deep convective cells are predominant during tropical cyclone intensification.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the evolution of tangential and radial flows of Typhoon Nari (2001) during its landfall in Taiwan, absolute angular momentum (AAM) and radial wind budgets of Nari are conducted by analyzing the MM 5 simulation results with high spatial and temporal resolutions (2 -km horizontal grid spacing and 2 -min output interval). The AAM is nearly conserved outside the eyewall and above the boundary layer while Nari is over the ocean; after landfall, the enhanced surface friction and turbulent mixing produces mostly negative local tendencies of AAM above terrain. For the landfall storm, both the radar observation and model simulation indicate that the radial inflows at lower levels become thicker and stronger over land, and the sloping radial outflow jet is maximized at the midlevel above rugged topography. The midlevel radial outflows result from supergradient accelerations of 20 - 35 m s- 1 h- 1 and <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> of 5 - 9 m s- 1. The enhanced imbalance accelerations imply that the gradient wind balance is no longer appropriate to describe tangential winds over terrain. Near the eyewall, the <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> can be as strong as 9 m s- 1 above terrain and subgradient winds up to - 21 m s- 1 are found at the surface on the lee side. The stronger force imbalances of the landfall Nari produce larger local changes of AAM and radial momentum, leading to more quickly-evolved vortex flows and secondary circulations over Taiwan¡¦s steep terrain...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple slab {{model for}} the {{boundary}} layer of a hurricane is re-examined and a small error in the original calculation is corrected. With this correction, the development of <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> is a ubiquitous feature of the solutions. The boundary layer shows two types of behaviour in the inner core of the vortex depending on {{the depth of the}} layer and the maximum tangential wind speed above the layer. For small depths and/or large tangential <b>wind</b> speeds, large <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> develop and lead to a rapid deceleration of the inflow such that the inflow becomes zero at some radius inside the radius of maximum tangential wind speed above the boundary layer. For large depths and/or small tangential wind speeds, the solutions do not become singular until within a few kilometres of the rotation axis. The transition between the two regimes is very abrupt. Interpretations are given for the foregoing behaviour. Other aspects of the boundary-layer dynamics and thermodynamics are investigated including: the dependence on mixing by shallow convection; the effects of a radially varying boundary-layer depth; the effects of downward momentum transport; the dependence of thermodynamical quantities on the boundary-layer depth; and the radial variation of equivalent potential temperature. Predicted values of the last quantity are in acceptable agreement with observations made in category-five hurricane Isabel (2003). The version with radially varying depth gives more realistic vertical velocities in the inner-core region of the vortex. The limitations and strengths of the slab model are discussed.

40|$|A first observationally-based {{estimation}} of departures from gradient wind balance during secondary eyewall formation is presented. The study {{is based on}} the Atlantic Hurricane Edouard (2014). This storm was observed during the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS 3) experiment, a field campaign conducted in collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A total of 135 dropsondes are analyzed in two separate time periods: one named the secondary eyewall formation period and the other one referred to as the decaying-double eyewalled storm period. During the secondary eyewall formation period, a time when the storm was observed to have only one eyewall, the diagnosed agradient force has a secondary maxima that coincides with the radial location of the secondary eyewall observed in the second period of study. The maximum spin up tendency of the radial influx of absolute vertical vorticity is within the boundary layer in the region of the eyewall of the storm and the spin up tendency structure elongates radially outward into the secondary region of <b>supergradient</b> <b>wind,</b> where the secondary wind maxima is observed in the second period of study. An analysis of the boundary layer averaged vertical structure of equivalent potential temperature reveals a conditionally unstable environment in the secondary eyewall formation region. These findings support the hypothesis that deep convective activity in this region contributed to spin up of the boundary layer tangential winds and the formation of a secondary eyewall that is observed during the decaying-double eyewalled storm period...|$|E
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Secondary eyewall {{formation}} (SEF) impacts {{tropical cyclone}} (TC) intensity and structure, but the inner core dynamics {{of this phenomenon}} are not well understood. Numerical models suggest that a supergradient jet {{at the top of}} the TC boundary layer (TCBL) associated with boundary layer convergence and forcing of deep convection may play a critical role in SEF. There is a lack of consensus on the importance and magnitude of supergradient jets, due in part to limited high-resolution observations near the surface. A new spline-based, 3 D variational analysis technique called Spline Analysis at Mesoscale Utilizing Radar and Aircraft Instrumentation (SAMURAI) is used to combine airborne Doppler radar, GPS dropwindsonde, and in situ flight level observations to estimate the magnitude of the <b>supergradient</b> <b>wind</b> (SGW). A detailed error analysis is presented for wind, pressure gradient, and SGW retrievals using synthetic observations in the primary eyewall of a Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulated Hurricane Rita (2005). The new methodology is then used to examine the SGW in the primary and secondary eyewalls of the real Hurricane Rita on 22 September. Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment (RAINEX) field campaign observations from two aircraft are used to estimate the magnitude of the SGW for the northern quadrant of the TC and for the azimuthal average. Results from the simulated primary eyewall show the methodology is successful at retrieving the tangential and radial wind fields with low errors. The pressure gradient field has a higher error, especially when dropsondes were included in the analysis. The resulting SGW magnitudes are negatively affected by the pressure gradient errors, resulting in unrealistic supergradient maxima near the surface. The root mean square error in the retrieved SGW is ~ 5 m s- 1, consistent with an analytic error analysis. The results from the real observations provide new estimates of the magnitude of SGW in mature primary and secondary eyewalls. The primary eyewall was found to have a SGW maximum of 22 m s- 1 and the secondary eyewall was found to have a SGW maximum of 16 m s- 1 for the axisymmetric analysis. The new methodology shows promise to estimate SGW and quantify its importance in TCBL dynamics and SEF, but additional error analysis is necessary to refine the estimates...|$|E
40|$|The {{assumption}} of gradient wind balance is customarily made {{so as to}} derive the theoretical upper-bound intensity of a mature tropical cyclone. Emanuel's theory of hurricane potential intensity (E-PI) makes use of this assumption, whereas more recent studies by Bryan and Rotunno demonstrate {{that the effect of}} unbalanced flow can result in maximum winds that are well in excess of E-PI (superintensity). The existence of <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> has been verified in a slab boundary layer model developed by Smith. Here, the authors apply the slab boundary layer model within the framework of classical E-PI theory to investigate the sensitivity of <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> to the radius of maximum gradient wind (RMGW) and four nondimensional model parameters. The authors find that the Rossby number, the drag coefficient, and the modified Rankine decay parameter all have a considerable influence on the strength of the unbalanced flow. In contrast, the ratio of surface exchange coefficients has little noticeable effect on superintensity. The inclusion of horizontal momentum diffusion leads to a weaker superintensity, but the qualitative features of the model remain similar. To further elucidate these findings, the authors use the boundary layer model to examine the modified E-PI theory proposed by Emanuel and Rotunno. They assume a constant Richardson number for the outflow. The boundary layer model driven by the modified E-PI solution depends on just three model parameters rather than the four parameters used in the classical E-PI framework. Despite this apparent advantage, the results obtained in the framework of the modified E-PI are less realistic than those computed with the classical E-PI approach...|$|R
40|$|Cloud flare-ups {{along the}} inner eye {{wall of a}} {{hurricane}} lead to enhancement of cloud scale divergence, which in turn leads to a large local enhancement of the departure from balance laws {{and can lead to}} local <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds.</b> This scenario is tested using the results from a mesoscale microphysical model at horizontal resolution of 1. 33 &#x 2009;km for the simulation of hurricane Katrina. Rainwater mixing ratio tags growing cloud elements. The departure from balance laws includes terms such as the local, horizontal and vertical advections of divergence, divergence square and a term invoking the gradient of vertical velocity. It is noted that these terms collectively contribute to a substantial local enhancement of the departure from balance laws. Departures from balance laws are related to the radial gradient wind imbalances in a storm-centred coordinate. In this study, several examples, from the hurricane Katrina simulations, that display this scenario of rapid intensification are illustrated. Organisation of convection in the azimuthal direction seems important for the hurricane scale; cloud flare-ups away from such regions of azimuthal organisation fail to contribute to this scenario for the overall intensification of the hurricane...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] observational study of tropical cyclone intensification is performed using dropsondes, in situ flight-level data, satellite imagery, and Electra Doppler Radar (ELDORA) during the spinup of Tropical Storm Jangmi (2008) in the western North Pacific. This event was observed with research aircraft during the Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS 08) field experiment {{over the course of}} 3 days as Jangmi intensified rapidly from a tropical storm to a supertyphoon. The dropsonde analysis indicates that the peak azimuthally averaged storm-relative tangential wind speed occurs persistently within the boundary layer throughout the spinup period and suggests that significant <b>supergradient</b> <b>winds</b> are present near and just within the radius of maximum tangential winds. An examination of the ELDORA data in Tropical Storm Jangmi reveals multiple rotating updrafts near the developing eye beneath cold cloud top temperatures ≤ - 65 °C. In particular, there is a 12 -km-wide, upright updraft with a peak velocity of 9 m s¯¹ with collocated strong low-level (z < 2 km) convergence of 2 x 10 ¯³ s¯¹ and intense relative vorticity of 4 x 10 ¯³ s¯¹. The analysis of the corresponding infrared satellite imagery suggests that vortical updrafts are common before and during rapid intensification. The findings of this study support a recent paradigm of tropical cyclone intensification in which rotating convective clouds are important elements in the spinup process. In a system-scale view of this process, the maximum tangential wind is found within the boundary layer, where the tangential <b>wind</b> becomes <b>supergradient</b> before the air ascends into the eyewall updraft.
