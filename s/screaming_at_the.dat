5|$|Leslie takes {{possession}} of the jinniyah and asks for his brother {{to be returned to}} life. Anson is returned, but in a decaying state, complete with injuries from the crash. Leslie's second wish is for Anson to talk, which results in Anson <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of his lungs and telling his brother that he is cold. Back at the morgue, Scully finds the body has disappeared and Mulder suspects it is because of Leslie's wish. They go to the Stokes residence and Anson blows the house up trying to light the stove in an attempt to warm up. Mulder questions Jenn, the jinniyah, who says she's 500 years old. According to her, she gained her powers after wishing for great power and long life from another genie. She also says that Mulder unrolled her so he now has three wishes of his own. Mulder wishes for peace on earth and she wipes out the entire human population. With his second wish, Mulder undoes his first wish. Mulder then writes down his third wish to be very specific. However, just before making the final wish, Scully helps Mulder realize that the power of a genie should not be used to force people to be good, and so he ultimately wishes for Jenn to be free.|$|E

500|$|In August 2015, it was {{announced}} that the song would be released as part of a public service announcement (PSA) video, directed by Catherine Hardwicke, to raise awareness about sexual assaults in college campuses. The Hollywood Reporter described it as casting [...] "an emotional spotlight on young women in vulnerable situations that college students will readily recognize". Hardwicke said of the PSA's important message: [...] "You can't watch the documentary without <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen. We tried to capture those stories in a very visceral way and add another voice to this powerful call to action." [...] Production costs were underwritten by the film's executive producers, Paul Blavin and Regina K. Scully. The video was released the same day as the digital release, with Gaga tweeting out a link to it and adding: [...] "We hope u feel our love & solidarity through the song & perhaps find some peace in knowing u r not alone through this film". Warren believed that the PSA video highlighted her observations about victims coming forward to speak about the assault on them: ...|$|E

500|$|This episode starts by {{depicting}} the game show Wheel of Fortune. When Brian is watching Malcolm in the Middle on television, a scene begins showing {{the mother of}} the fictional family <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> children and father. Jane Kaczmarek was asked to do the voice as she was the original actor in the series; however, she refused. MacFarlane said that he gets a message that Kaczmarek wishes to portray that character as likable, and does not wish to jeopardize that. The father during that scene was voiced by Bryan Cranston, the original actor in the series, who accepted the role. Seth MacFarlane comments that [...] "this is the first real Quagmire story we've ever done." [...] A scene was made of Stewie attending a meeting similar to those at Alcoholics Anonymous; however, the meeting was designed for those who are too addicted to breast milk. The format of Wheel of Fortune is somewhat similar to the layout of the modern-day program, but the scene also features several aspects which are now no longer broadcast, such as not automatically being given R, S, T, L, N, and E, and were featured in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerous" [...] was {{developed}} from another song titled [...] "Streetwalker", which Jackson wrote for his 1987 Bad album. During recording sessions in September 1990 for Dangerous, Jackson recorded a 6:40 minute demo of [...] "Dangerous", {{which he wrote}} with Bill Bottrell. Teddy Riley later added writing and produced it with Jackson in early 1991. According to music commentator Nelson George the demo is [...] "very different to the final version. Here the keyboards are spacey, in strong contrast to the taunt, mechanical rhythm track. Throughout the song, Jackson keeps up a spoken word rap about the dangerous woman who is this song's subject. Overall it is much moodier". The demo was released in November 2004, on [...] A different, longer version also exists, with Jackson heard <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning—after a sound protection wall fell on {{him as he was}} about to record. [...] "The genesis of the songs we co-wrote [...] ", said Bottrell, [...] "consisted of Jackson humming melodies and grooves, and him then leaving the studio while I developed these ideas with a bunch of drum machines and samplers". [...] "Dangerous" [...] is played in the key of D minor with Jackson's vocal range being from Ab2 to B5. The song's tempo is moderate at 113 beats per minute.|$|E

During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together. But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, [...] " [...] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible."

2500|$|In {{his memoir}} Decision Points, President George W. Bush {{claimed that the}} strike {{confirmed}} that Syria had been pursuing a nuclear-weapons program and that [...] "intelligence is not an exact science", relating that while {{he had been told}} that U.S. analysts only had low confidence that the facility was part of a nuclear-weapons program, surveillance after the airstrike showed parts of the destroyed facility being covered up. Bush wrote that [...] "if the facility was really just an innocent research lab, Syrian President Assad would have been <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Israelis {{on the floor of the}} United Nations". He also wrote that in a telephone conversation with Olmert, he suggested that the operation be kept secret for a while and then made public to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that might force Syrian retaliation.|$|E
2500|$|Tom Gill of the Hooded Utilitarian {{felt that}} the story [...] "Sewer" [...] was {{depicting}} an alienating society, especially with the non-expressive characters who repress themselves and their problems to [...] "survive in the darker backwaters of modern industrial society". The protagonist <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> disco indicated an [...] "emotional breaking-point". The two frames where it seems the characters would show concern for the aborted fetus {{are part of a}} [...] "nihilistic theatre of cruelty". [...] Gill also says that [...] "Sewer" [...] was likely inspired by Yoshiharu Tsuge's earlier story [...] "Sanshôuo", with both artists being serialized in Garo. The combination of a fetus and the sewer would also appear in [...] "My Hitler" [...] and a six-volume epic titled Jigoku no Gundan, indicating [...] "intense obsessions" [...] by Tatsumi. Other stories in the collection that focus on childbirth include [...] "Black Smoke", [...] "The Burden", and [...] "Test Tube", which have in common Tatsumi's themes of sexual humiliation, economic inadequacy, and disgust related to reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|From a young age, William Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions. The first may have {{occurred}} {{as early as the}} age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist [...] "saw God" [...] when God [...] "put his head to the window", causing Blake to break into <b>screaming.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of eight or ten in Peckham Rye, London, Blake {{claimed to have}} seen [...] "a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars." [...] According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber. On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.|$|E

2500|$|During a fall movie preview, Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Malkovich [...] "easily racks {{up the most}} laughs" [...] among the cast as the foul-mouthed and short-tempered ex-CIA man. The first scene Malkovich {{performed}} was a phone call in which he shouts several obscenities at Pitt and McDormand. But Malkovich could {{not be on the}} sound stage for the call because he was rehearsing a play, so he called in the lines from his apartment in Paris. Regarding the scene, Malkovich said, [...] "It was really late at night and I was <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of my lungs. God knows what the neighbors thought." [...] Swinton plays Malkovich's wife who engages in an affair with Clooney, although the two characters do not get along well. Clooney's and Swinton's characters also had a poor relationship in their previous film together, Michael Clayton, prompting Clooney to say to Swinton {{at the end of a}} shoot, [...] "Well, maybe one day we'll get to make a film together when we say one nice thing to each other." [...] Swinton said of the dynamic, [...] "I'm very happy to shout at him on screen. It's great fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of her lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that {{she was not going to}} go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} {{preceding}} the band's full formation, Love and Erlandson would write and {{record in the}} evenings at a rehearsal space in Hollywood, loaned {{to them by the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers; during the day, Love worked as a stripper to support the band and purchase amplifiers and their backline for live shows. Hole's first official rehearsal took place at Fortress Studios in Hollywood with Love, Erlandson and Lisa Roberts on bass. According to Erlandson, [...] "these two girls show up dressed completely crazy, we set up and they said, [...] "okay, just start playing something." [...] I started playing and they started <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of their lungs for two or three hours. Crazy lyrics and screaming. I said to myself, [...] "most people would just run away from this really fast. But I heard something in Courtney's voice and lyrics." [...] Initially, the band had no percussion until Love met drummer Caroline Rue, and later recruited a third guitarist, Mike Geisbrecht. Hole's first show took place at Raji's, a small bar in Hollywood, in September 1989. By early 1990, Geisbrecht and Roberts had both left the band, which led to the recruitment of bassist Jill Emery.|$|E

2500|$|Los Angeles Times {{film critic}} Michael Wilmington felt that Darkman {{was the only}} film at the time [...] "that {{successfully}} captures the graphic look, rhythm and style of the superhero books." [...] Terrence Rafferty of The New Yorker said, [...] "Raimi works from inside the cheerfully violent adolescent-male sensibility of superhero comics, {{as if there were}} no higher style for a filmmaker to aspire to, and the absence of condescension is refreshing." [...] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars. However, Richard Corliss in Time said that Raimi was not [...] "effective with actors" [...] and Peoples Ralph Novak called Darkman, a [...] "loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Joe Brown wrote, [...] "Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still pops out all over the place – Darkman is a frenetic funhouse ride that has you laughing and <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{version of}} [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" [...] {{included}} on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 was recorded at Varsity Stadium in Toronto, Canada on September 13, 1969. The Plastic Ono Band for that performance was assembled {{on short notice}} and included Ono, Lennon, Clapton, Voorman and Alan White on drums. [...] After Lennon played some of his recent songs and rock 'n' roll classics, Ono sang a two-song set consisting of [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" [...] followed by [...] "John John (Let's Hope for Peace)." [...] Audience reaction to her set was muted, and some booing was reported, more directed at [...] "John John" [...] than [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko." [...] John Blaney explains that the audience [...] "had come to listen to good ol' rock 'n' roll, not a Japanese woman <b>screaming</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of her voice," [...] but [...] "one could at least get into the groove of 'Don't Worry Kyoko.'" [...] Chip Madinger and Mark Easter claim that despite the audience's cold reception, the band [...] "did an admirable job" [...] backing Ono on the song. Ken Bielen and Ben Urish claim that the audience may have been startled by [...] "Ono's full-throttle vocals and Lennon and Clapton's hard core guitar sounds.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its {{theatrical}} {{release in}} the United States, critics generally responded with enthusiasm to Bava's film, {{many of whom}} recognized the director as a potential master of the horror genre. Variety noted, [...] "There is sufficient cinematography ingenuity and production flair [...] to keep an audience pleasantly unnerved." [...] Time said the film was [...] "a piece of fine Italian handiwork that atones for its ludicrous lapses with brilliant intuitions of the spectral." [...] The Motion Picture Herald stated that [...] "A classic quality permeates this gruesome, shocking, horrifying story of a vengeful, bloodthirsty vampire." [...] Castle of Frankenstein described the film as [...] "one of the best horror thrillers of recent years." [...] David Pirie, in The Time Out Film Guide, called the movie, [...] "A classic horror film [...] The exquisitely realized expressionist images of cruelty and sexual suggestion shocked audiences in the early '60s and occasioned a long-standing ban by the British censor. The visual style still impresses..." [...] Carlos Clarens felt that [...] "the quality of the visual narrative was superb—the best black-and-white photography to enhance a horror movie {{in the past two}} decades. Bava also showed himself as a director of a certain promise..." [...] Eugene Archer in The New York Times, however, hated the film, noting that [...] "Barbara Steele, a blank-eyed manikin with an earthbound figure and a voice from outer space, is appropriately cast as a vampire: not the Theda Bara kind, but the genuine blood-drinking variety. Mario Bava, ostensibly the director of this nonsense, allows this female Bela Lugosi to quench her thirst four times before she burns, <b>screaming,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stake [...] As a setting for unadulterated horror, it will leave its audiences yearning for that quiet, sunny little motel in Psycho." [...] Ivan Butler opined that the film [...] "appears to offer horror, beauty and the ludicrous in about equal proportions." ...|$|E
