25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on <b>shot</b> <b>size,</b> throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E

5000|$|In a shot tower, lead {{is heated}} until molten, then dropped through a copper sieve {{high in the}} tower. The liquid lead forms tiny spherical balls by surface tension, then solidifies as it falls. The {{partially}} cooled balls are caught at {{the floor of the}} tower in a water-filled basin. The now fully cooled balls are checked for roundness and sorted by size; those that are [...] "out of round" [...] are remelted. A slightly inclined table is used for checking roundness. To make larger <b>shot</b> <b>sizes,</b> a copper sieve with larger holes is used. However, the maximum size is limited by the height of the tower, because larger <b>shot</b> <b>sizes</b> must fall farther to cool. A shot tower with a 40-meter drop can produce up to #6 shot (nominally 2.4mm in diameter) while an 80-meter drop can produce #2 shot (nominally 3.8mm in diameter).

5000|$|A useful {{method for}} remembering the {{diameter}} of numbered shot in inches is simply to subtract the <b>shot</b> <b>size</b> from 17. The resulting answer is {{the diameter of}} the shot in hundredths of an inch. For example, #2 shot gives 17-2 = 15, meaning that the diameter of #2 shot is 15/100 or 0.15". B shot is [...]170 inches, and sizes go up in [...]01 increments for BB and BBB sizes. In metric measurement, it is easy to remember that #5 shot is 3 mm; each number up or down represents a 0.25 mm change in diameter, so e.g. #7 shot is 2.5 mm.|$|E
5000|$|American Trap {{typically}} uses {{lead shot}} ammunition, with shot sizes (for lead shot) ranging between #7 ½ and #9 (2.0-2.4 mm).

The [...] "shot" [...] in a [...] "shotshell" [...] consists of 300-450 +/- small spheres. Shotshells are allowed a maximum payload weight of 32 g of shot. Velocity may vary, but is limited based upon shot mass: 1290 ft/s for 32 g, 1325 ft/s for 28 g, and 1350 ft/s for 24 g. Maximum loads are generally only needed for longer [...] "handicap" [...] yardages or the second shot in Doubles Trap. When required at certain trap clubs or ranges, steel shot is used with slightly larger <b>shot</b> <b>size.</b> (e.g. #6 or #7).|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "wind tower" [...] method, {{patented}} in 1848 by the T.O LeRoy Company of New York City, {{which used}} {{a blast of}} cold air to dramatically shorten the drop necessary meant that tall shot towers became unnecessary, but many were still constructed into the late 1880s, and two surviving examples date from 1916 and 1969. Since the 1960s the Bliemeister method is used to make smaller <b>shot</b> <b>sizes,</b> and larger sizes are made by the cold swaging process of feeding calibrated lengths of wire into hemispherical dies and stamping them into spheres.|$|R
5000|$|Buckshot {{is simply}} shot formed to larger diameters {{so that it}} can be used against bigger game such as deer. Sizes range in {{ascending}} order from size #B to Tri-Ball. It is usually referred by the size, followed by [...] "buck", e.g. [...] "#000" [...] is referred to as [...] "triple-aught buck" [...] in America or [...] "triple o buck" [...] in other English speaking countries. Buckshot is traditionally swaged (in high volume production) or cast (in small volume production).

5000|$|For buckshot, {{the numbers}} usually start at 4 (6.1 mm, 0.24 in) {{and go down}} to 1, 0, 00 ("double aught"), 000, and finally 0000 (9.7 mm, [...]38 in). A {{different}} informal distinction is that [...] "bird shot" [...] pellets are small enough {{that they can be}} measured into the cartridge by weight, and simply poured in, whereas [...] "buckshot" [...] pellets are so large they must be stacked inside the cartridge in a fixed geometric arrangement in order to fit. The diameter in hundredths of an inch of bird shot sizes from #9 to #1 can be obtained by subtracting the <b>shot</b> <b>size</b> from 17. Thus, #4 bird shot is 17 - 4 = 13 = 0.13 in in diameter.

5000|$|Most {{shotguns}} {{are used}} to fire [...] "a number of ball shot", in addition to slugs and sabots. The ball shot or pellets is {{for the most part}} made of lead but this has been partially replaced by bismuth, steel, tungsten-iron, tungsten-nickel-iron and even tungsten polymer loads. Non-toxic loads are required by Federal law for waterfowl hunting in the US, as the shot may be ingested by the waterfowl, which some authorities believe can lead to health problems due to the lead exposure. Shot is termed either birdshot or buckshot depending on the <b>shot</b> <b>size.</b> Informally, birdshot pellets have a diameter smaller than 5 mm and buckshot are larger than that. Pellet size is indicated by a number; for bird shot this ranges from the smallest 12 (1.2 mm, 0.05 in) to 2 (3.8 mm, 0.15 in) and then BB (4.6 mm, 0.18 in).|$|E
5000|$|Rat-shot (or snake shot) is {{very small}} lead shot (typically #12 - 1.3 mm (0.05")) loaded in {{cartridges}} for use in rifled firearms as opposed to more traditional smoothbores such as shotguns.

50|$|For hunting, <b>shot</b> <b>size</b> must {{be chosen}} {{not only for}} the range, but also for the game. The shot must reach the target with enough energy to {{penetrate}} to a depth sufficient to kill the game. Lead shot is still the best ballistic performer, but environmental restrictions on the use of lead, especially with waterfowl, require steel, bismuth, or tungsten composites. Steel, being significantly less dense than lead, requires larger shot sizes, but is a good choice when lead is not legal and cost is a consideration. It is argued that steel shot cannot safely be used in some older shotguns without causing damage to either the bore or to the choke due to the hardness of steel shot. However, the increased pressure in most steel cartridges is a far greater problem, causing more strain to the breech of the gun. Since tungsten is very hard, it must also be used with care in older guns. Tungsten shot is often alloyed with nickel and iron, softening the base metal. That alloy is approximately 1/3 denser than lead, but far more expensive. Bismuth shot falls between steel and tungsten shot in both density and cost. The rule of thumb in converting appropriate steel shot is to go up by two numbers when switching from lead. However, there are different views on dense patterns versus higher pellet energies.|$|E

However, naval personnel {{often do not}} have access to dry fire training opportunities and therefore may be at risk for losing perishable marksmanship skills. The purpose of the study was to determine if the use of a simulator is at least as effective in marksmanship training as traditional dry fire techniques. A between-groups study with a random selection of volunteers (blocked by previous marksmanship experience) was conducted to determine if participants who completed simulation-based training showed greater improvement and retention of marksmanship skills than participants completing dry fire training. The main measures were the qualification scores, average <b>shot</b> group <b>size,</b> <b>shot</b> group <b>size</b> and mean point of impact to center zeroing point length. The experiment utilized a simulated M 9 Berretta for the qualification. Results demonstrate that simulation training improved performance on the seven-yard line to a greater extent than current naval training.

5000|$|Naval {{artillery}} {{during the}} Age of Sail simply was not accurate, {{regardless of whether}} the cannon was a gun or a carronade. Almost all barrels were smoothbore, not rifled, and tolerances had wide variations on everything from the actual roundness and straightness of the barrel to <b>shot</b> <b>size</b> in relation to the bore (windage). Sights were rudimentary or non-existent, and elevation was controlled by wedges and guesswork. As a result, effective or decisive naval battles were generally fought at ranges under 100 yards where the carronade's heavier ball was useful and its shorter range was not a huge problem. Technological improvements changed the capabilities of naval armament by the nineteenth century, but muzzle-loading smoothbore cannon were still not very accurate. Consequently naval tactics in line of battle counted on the effect of rapid broadsides at short range, to which the carronade could make a significant contribution. In smaller vessels such as frigates, privateers, and raiders, the captains still appreciated long guns for their increased range, since they were not expected to engage in fighting in line-of-battle, but rather often found themselves engaged in long chases or attempts to work to windward. It was often better tactically to attempt to shoot the opponent's rigging down at range rather than close in for direct combat, where the weaker hulls of lighter vessels were at risk. They also often found themselves far from home or harbors, where repairs and spare yards, masts or rigging could be found. Generally, although the power of the [...] "smashers", as they were called, was acknowledged, most captains continued to prefer long guns.|$|E

40|$|Test {{samples of}} grey and {{compacted}} graphite cast irons with pearlitic matrix were shot-peened to different surface conditions using twelve {{different combinations of}} <b>shot</b> <b>size,</b> peening intensity and peening coverage percentage. Relatively high surface compressive residual stresses varying between 245 to 565 MPa were observed and the compressive residual stresses reached a depth between 280 µm and 770 µm. Within the range of peening parameters used, the compacted graphite cast iron with its vermicular graphite showed a somewhat better response to the same shot-peening treatment than the grey cast iron containing flake graphite, giving a larger peening affected zone with higher compressive residual stresses. For both the cast irons, an increase in peening coverage percentage, <b>shot</b> <b>size</b> or peening intensity led often to a lower surface compressive stress. However, peening using a higher intensity greatly increased the degree and extent of plastic deformation and therefore increased the magnitude and penetration depth of the subsurface compressive residual stresses, while the effect of increasing <b>shot</b> <b>size</b> also depends on the peening intensity. On the other hand, measurements on the grey cast iron samples showed that the peening coverage has {{little effect on the}} depth profile of residual stress...|$|E
