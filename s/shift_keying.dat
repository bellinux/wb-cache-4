The NPRM specifically states this, and this information may be found in its entirety in the December 1951 Issue of QST. While the New RTTY Handbook gives ARRL no credit, it was published by CQ Magazine and its author was a CQ columnist (CQ generally opposed ARRL at that time).|$|E
25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E

25|$|Radioteletype {{evolved from}} these earlier {{landline}} teleprinter operations. The US Department of the Navy successfully tested printing telegraphy between {{an airplane and}} ground radio station in August 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, MA radio station to the R.M.S. Majestic. An early implementation of the Radioteletype was the Watsongraph, named after Detroit inventor Glenn Watson in March 1931. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US Military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. The Navy called radioteletype RATT (Radio Automatic Teletype) and the Army Signal Corps called radioteletype SCRT, an abbreviation of Single-Channel Radio Teletype. The military used frequency <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> technology and this technology proved very reliable even over long distances.|$|E

5000|$|Exactly what Caps Lock does {{depends on}} the {{operating}} system and driver, and the keyboard layout implemented. On non-IBM PC-compatible computers it may also depend on the keyboard hardware. Usually the effect {{is the same as}} pressing <b>keys</b> with the <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> depressed; letters are capitalised, and non-letter characters are generated as if the <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> were depressed. For example, on most keyboards the [...] "5" [...] key generates [...] "5" [...] in non-shift mode and [...] "%" [...] if the <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> is pressed.

2500|$|International Morse code {{today is}} most popular among amateur radio operators, {{in the mode}} {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "continuous wave" [...] or [...] "CW". (This name was chosen to distinguish it from the damped wave emissions from spark transmitters, not because the transmission is continuous.) Other keying methods are available in radio telegraphy, such as frequency <b>shift</b> <b>keying.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Colloquial {{usage of}} the term 'PSK31' in amateur radio usually implies {{the use of the}} most {{commonly}} used variant of PSK31: binary phase <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (BPSK). [...] BPSK uses no error control, but an allied mode, QPSK31 quadrature phase <b>shift</b> <b>keying,</b> uses four phases instead of two, to provide a degree of forward error correction. [...] It is simple to switch from BPSK to QPSK if difficulties arise during a contact. [...] When QPSK is used; after encoding into varicode, the binary signal is further transformed into a quaternary set of phase shifts. [...] A sliding window of five bits is used to select one of the four possible phase shifts, providing a means of error correction by spreading each bit of data across adjacent bits. [...] Successful decoding of an input bit requires a large number of phase shift sequences to be received, causing a 20-bit, 640-millisecond latency (delay) in the output of the decoder.|$|E
2500|$|PSK31 or [...] "Phase <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying,</b> 31 Baud", also BPSK31 and QPSK31, is {{a popular}} computer-sound card-generated {{radioteletype}} mode, used primarily by amateur radio operators to conduct real-time keyboard-to-keyboard chat, most often using frequencies in the high frequency amateur radio bands (near-shortwave). [...] PSK31 is distinguished from other digital modes {{in that it is}} specifically tuned to have a data rate close to typing speed, and has an extremely narrow bandwidth, allowing many conversations in the same bandwidth as a single voice channel. This narrow bandwidth also concentrates the RF energy [...] in a very narrow bandwidth, allowing relatively low-power equipment (25 watts) to communicate globally using the same skywave propagation used by shortwave radio stations.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the <b>shift</b> <b>key</b> while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all <b>keys</b> are already <b>shifted),</b> will also <b>shift</b> <b>keys</b> which are not being shifted by Caps Lock alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps Lock <b>shifts</b> all <b>keys,</b> pressing <b>Shift</b> will temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps Lock only <b>shifts</b> alphabet <b>keys,</b> pressing <b>Shift</b> will temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where Shift will temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the <b>Shift</b> <b>key</b> {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R

2500|$|After World War II, amateur radio {{operators}} in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators {{with the understanding}} that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. [...] "The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society" [...] was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to [...] "The VHF Teletype Society" [...] and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype QSO of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSW's test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of [...] "The RTTY Society of Southern California" [...] publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at {{the beginning and the end}} of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.|$|E

However, a full nodal network representation in generation models is often not possible due to computational limitations. Therefore, reduced zonal network models are needed. A crucial step in the nodal-zonal network reduction is the calculation of injection <b>shift</b> <b>keys</b> (ISKs). Injection <b>shift</b> <b>keys</b> denote the nodal contribution to the zonal generation balance and are needed to compile different nodes into one equivalent node.
