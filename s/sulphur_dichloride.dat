40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of new organicmaterials for electronic applications. Several new ring-formingmethods are employed to construct sulphur heterocycles: Tandemelectrophilic aromatic substitution and acid-catalyzedtransetherification of methoxythiophene, double electrophilicaromatic substitutions with ethane- 1, 2 -disulphenyl chloride,and also, the reaction of dienes with <b>sulphur</b> <b>dichloride.</b> Twonew condensed thiophenes have been incorporated in end-cappedoligothiophenes. An improvement of the synthesis of [3, 2 -b: 29 ̆ 2, 3 -d]thiophene is reported, with some attempts toincorporate it in oligomers. A synthesis of substitutednaphthalenes is also described. A new method of producingdisubstituted thiophenes from substituted butadienes anssulphur dichloride is employed in a new route to 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene, a very important monomer for conductingpolymers.

Two complexes of the noveltribromosulphonium cation, SBr 3 + AlX 4 (X = Cl, Br), have been prepared and Raman spectra assigned {{on the basis of}} a pyramidal, C 3 v, SBr 3 + ion. Mixing solid trichloro-and tribromosulphonium tetrachloroaluminates produced a solid containing mixed chlorobromosulphonium cations, SClnBr 3 -n+ AlCl 4 - (O<n< 3). Reactions involving sulphurdichloride, bromine and aluminium trichloride orantimony pentachloride yielded solids whose Raman Spectraare assigned to mixtures of mixed chlorobromosulphoniumtetrachloroaluminates or hexachloroantimonates. No pure compounds involving the ions SCl 2 Br+ or SClBr 2 + were isolated. The Raman spectrum of sulphur tetrachloride is substantially in agreement with recently published work and can be assigned reasonably {{on the basis of a}} structure involving SCl 3 + and Cl- ions. However, there are differences from the selenium and tellurium analogues. Reaction of dimethyl sulphide with chlorine or bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid (aluminium trihalide, tin tetrahalide or antimony pentachloride) yielded a series of complexes of the dimethylhalo-sulphonium cation, (CH 3) 2 SX+ (X=Cl, Br). Analogous complexes of the methyldihalosulphonium cation,CH 3 SX 2 + (X = Cl, Br), were prepared from dimethyl disulphide. Reactions of antimony pentachloride in the presence of bromine yielded complexes of the pentachlorobromoantimonate anion, SbCl 5 Br-, in contrast to similar reactions involving <b>sulphur</b> <b>dichloride.</b> Raman spectra are assigned for the methylhalosulphonium ions. Reactions of dimethyl sulphide and bromine gave two isomeric complexes which, on the basis of the analytical and spectral evidence, were assigned as the charge-transfer species, (CH 3) 2 SBr 2, or an ionic complex (CH 3) 2 SBr+Br-. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dichloride</b> and bromine, sometimes in the presence of chlorine, yielded a series of solids stable only at low temperatures. Analysis of their Raman spectra suggested the presence of mixed chlorobromosulphonium cations associated with various halide or polyhalide anions. <p...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers 1 ' 2 it {{has been}} shown that sulphur mono-iodide can be prepared by the action of dry potassium iodide on a dilute solution of sulphur monochloride in carbon tetrachloride. It is further shown that the velocity of decomposition of the iodide is considerably diminished by a lowering in temperature. In the present paper, an attempt is made to show that sulphur diiodide (SI 2) can also be prepared by employing a similar experimental technique. Spong, 3 while estimating the chlorine content of sulphur dichloridc, shook up aqueous potassium iodide with a solution of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dichloride</b> in carbon tetrachloride. He noticed that the carbon tetrachloride layer turned reddish-orange in colour; he concludcd however that the colour was due to the formation of ‘a complex containing sulphur chloride and iodine As will be shown later, this reddish-orange colour is really due to sulphur diiodide and not due to any complex as postulated by Spong 3. ...|$|E
