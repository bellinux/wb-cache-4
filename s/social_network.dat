40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{evidence}} that digital <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> look fundamentally different from <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> We show that online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> look like a contagion spread over traditional models for <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Thus, if these tradi-tional models are correct, then digital <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> differ in key properties, and we will need different models to describe each. This also indicates that using data from digital <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> may mislead us {{if we try to}} use it to directly infer the structure of <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Additionally, we describe a framework that we call “poten-tial networks ” that may help to use information from digital networks to infer the structure of <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Poten-tial networks is a two phase model of <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> The first phase is the“potential”network. However, this network may not be directly observed and might not even exist an any normal manner. A random process is run over a po-tential network to produce a behavioral network, the second phase, which can be observed. We then discuss applications of this two-phase framework...|$|R
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} <b>social</b> <b>network,</b> they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything.

Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a <b>social</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E

40|$|Online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> such as Twitter and Facebook {{have gained}} {{tremendous}} popularity for information exchange. The availability of unprecedented amounts of digital data has accelerated research on information diffusion in online <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> However, {{the mechanism of}} information spreading in online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> remains elusive due {{to the complexity of}} social interactions and rapid change of online <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Much of prior work on information diffusion over online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> has based on empirical and statistical approaches. The majority of dynamical models arising from information diffusion over online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> involve ordinary differential equations which only depend on time. In a number of recent papers, the authors propose to use partial differential equations(PDEs) to characterize temporal and spatial patterns of information diffusion over online <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Built on intuitive cyber-distances such as friendship hops in online <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> the reaction-diffusion equations take into account influences from various external out-of-network sources, such as the mainstream media, and provide a new analytic framework to study the interplay of structural and topical influences on information diffusion over online <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> In this survey, we discuss a number of PDE-based models that are validated with real datasets collected from popular online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> such as Digg and Twitter.
