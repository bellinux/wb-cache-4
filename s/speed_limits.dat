The design of 400-series highways {{has set the}} precedent {{for a number of}} innovations used throughout North America, including the parclo interchange and a modified Jersey barrier design known as the Ontario Tall Wall. As a result, they currently experience the lowest accident and fatality rate comparative to traffic volume in North America.|$|E

5000|$|Normally, {{the end of}} a lowered <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> {{is marked}} with a sign reading [...] "State <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> 55", {{indicating}} that the statewide <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> applies. In areas where a curve or other road condition makes the state <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> inadvisable, a sign reading [...] "End XX m.p.h. Limit" [...] may be used, with XX replaced with the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> value. A [...] "State <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> 55" [...] sign should be installed after the curve. This sign is sometimes misused in locations where the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> changes to a speed other than 55 mph. This is mainly applied on both undivided and divided rural non-freeway routes. Though rarely seen, some divided roadways are set as low as 45 mph but mainly stay at the state <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 55 mph; in one exceptional case, that of the Scajaquada Expressway, the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> was lowered to 30 mph in 2016 after a fatality.|$|R
5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a {{workable}} majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which {{he did in the}} 1905 provincial election. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the University of Alberta, a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of Strathcona, just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Non-use of {{seat belts}} is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing seat belts. The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E

5|$|The {{last eight}} trains were ordered in 2002 and {{delivered}} in 2004â€“2006, finalising the fleet of 18 trains. At that point {{it had become}} clear that the <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on the rail network were mostly too low for the trains to run at their maximum operating speed, {{even though they were}} chosen specifically to prevent the costly work of straightening existing lines. Work on lines has continued, and, on modernised lines, the speed difference between the Pendolino and non-tilting trains has become minimal. The Sm3 was able to attain its maximum operating speed in regular traffic only in 2006, when a new rail line was opened between Kerava and Lahti and the full Pendolino fleet was available. Seven of the original 23 options never came to be.|$|E
5|$|The loop was {{originally}} proposed in 1986 {{as part of}} a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. The first was related to suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Another controversy dealt with rebuilding the streets {{as part of a}} downtown beautification project; the downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on city streets in Michigan, including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop.|$|E

5|$|Menem {{began his}} {{presidency}} assuming a non-confrontational approach, and appointing {{people from the}} conservative opposition, and business people to his cabinet. To prevent successful legal cases against the projected privatizations, the Supreme Court's numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority. Other institutions that restrained or limited executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of his proposals, he used the Necessity and Urgency Decree {{as an alternative to}} send bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented. In addition, he developed a bon vivant lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to Pinamar driving a Ferrari Testarossa in less than two hours, violating <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> He divorced his wife Zulema Yoma and expanded the Quinta de Olivos presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, barber, and even a buffoon.|$|E
5|$|The 1973â€“1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions.

40|$|Abstract: Provided with in-field crash-investigation and {{reported}} information from 4476 real accident episodes, a log-linear model {{is used to}} capture the relationship between speed and its predictors such as <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> While by introducing a binary logit model, the estimated speed may contribute explanatory power on subject driverâ€™s injury severity. From {{the results of the}} first model, we can surmise that higher speed goes with higher <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> and <b>speeding</b> violation happens frequently at lower or higher <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> like an U shape. Most interestingly, the second model estimation shows that <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> can influence collision severity via estimated speed, e. g., higher <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is associated with higher estimated speed, which in turn is related to more serious injury until the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of expressway or freeway due to higher standard of engineering design.

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Homogeneity {{of driving}} speeds is an {{important}} variable in determining road safety; more homogeneous driving speeds increase road safety. This study investigates the effect of introducing dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> systems on homogeneity of driving speeds. A total of 46 subjects twice drove a route along 12 road sections in a driving simulator. The <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> system (staticdynamic), the sophistication of the dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> system (basic roadside, advanced roadside, and advanced in-car) and the situational condition (dangerous non-dangerous) were varied. The homogeneity of driving speed, the rated credibility of the posted <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> and {{the acceptance of the}} different dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> systems were assessed. The results show that the homogeneity of individual speeds, defined as the variation in driving speed for an individual subject along a particular road section, was higher with the dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> system than with the static <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> system. The more sophisticated dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> system tested within this study led to higher homogeneity than the less sophisticated systems. The acceptance of the dynamic <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> systems used in this study was positive, they were perceived as quite useful and rather satisfactory.
