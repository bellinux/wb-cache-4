50|$|After the war the Vigra {{performed}} {{coast guard}} duties until 1953. All three submarine chasers were mothballed at Marvika and formally decommissioned in 1959.The Vigra was first sold to Sea Scouts for 1 NOK and finally sank near Malmö {{where she was}} used as a <b>sand</b> <b>barge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{ship was}} first used to carry jute between eastern India and Scotland. When {{less than two years}} old the ship entered the [...] "tramp trades", taking cargoes {{anywhere}} in the world. In 1910, after sailing for a quarter century, the ship was dis-masted off Cape Horn and barely made it to the Falkland Islands. Rather than re-rigging the ship its owners sold it for use as a floating warehouse at Punta Arenas, Chile. Wavertree was converted into a <b>sand</b> <b>barge</b> at Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1947. This ship was discovered in 1967 at the Riachuelo River in Buenos Aires by an American citizen working on a <b>sand</b> <b>barge</b> and acquired by the South Street Seaport Museum in 1968. The ship was sent to the Arsenal Naval Buenos Aires for restoration. In 1969 after restoration was complete, the ship was towed to New York. The vessel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 13, 1978.|$|E
50|$|Tholen {{established}} his reputation in The Hague with his landscapes {{of the countryside}} around Kampen and views of the woods near Baarn. He also frequently painted views of The Hague, the woods of Scheveningen {{and a series of}} interiors in which a window typically provides a view outside: a garden, a street illumined by sunlight or the rhythmically grouped roofs of a city. He painted the fishing boats on the beach in Scheveningen, but in contrast to Jacob Maris (whom he greatly admired), Tholen did not employ the desolate sea as a backdrop, but rather, the bustling village. He used the hustle-bustle of the city more often as a theme than was generally the case in the Hague School, depicting such subjects as construction sites, slaughterhouses, stonecutters and the sand excavations and <b>sand</b> <b>barge</b> captains on the canal between The Hague and Scheveningen.|$|E
5000|$|... 5 February 1972 - Phelim Grant and Charles McCann, both Catholic {{members of}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army, {{were killed in a}} {{premature}} explosion while placing a bomb (50 lb of gelignite) on a barge on Lough Neagh, near Crumlin. It was apparently intended to sink several <b>sand</b> <b>barges</b> moored at Ballyginniff, near Crumlin.|$|R

50|$|The vessel Albatros traded {{along the}} Southern African coast, sailing to Mauritius on one occasion, taking {{two months and}} ten days for the round trip. In March 1874, en route from Knysna to Cape Town and under captain Knud Thomasen, she struck a reef off Cape Agulhas and went down. The {{passengers}} and crew were stranded for three days on Dyer Island before being rescued by local fishermen and then travelling by wagon to Caledon. The Thesens' next vessel was the 191-ton brig Ambulant which, in 1883, was the first ship to take on cargo at the new Government Wharf off Thesen's Island, the cargo consisting of 3 000 railway sleepers to Cape Town. Competition from the Castle and Union Lines forced Thesen's to shut down this route and Ambulant was sold off in 1884. This was followed in 1895 by the 427-ton mail packet Agnar, a steamship nicknamed 'Agony' by the local school children she regularly carried to boarding schools in Cape Town. She stayed in service for some 40 years, as troop carrier for the British colonial government in the Boer War (1899-1902) and for the German government in the Herero Wars in German South-West Africa (1904-1907). She {{was taken over by}} a business in Madagascar in 1934 and was lost in a cyclone off Mauritius in 1938. The 706-ton Ingerid was taken into service in 1901 and the 600-ton Karatara in 1913. The 1019-ton Outeniqua joined the fleet in 1915, the 139-ton Clara converted from a <b>sand</b> <b>barge</b> and suction dredger and the 216-ton Nautilus in 1917. The Outeniqua was the company's flagship, could accommodate fifty passengers and remained in service until 1945. In 1916 the Thesen Line became the Thesen's Steamship Company, but the coastal shipping trade was languishing. Vessels which had been conscripted during World War I were free to ply commercial routes after the War, leading to keen competition. Improvements in the road and rail infrastructure, particularly the opening of the George-Knysna railway line in 1928, led to cheaper tariffs for travel by land. The Thesen family sold off four of its eight vessels, and in 1921 the entire company with the remaining Agnar, Ingerid, Outeniqua and Clara. The buyer was the English-based Houston Line, which continued to use Thesen's red swallowtail with white star.|$|E
40|$|Built as the "City of Cleveland" in 1880 at Wyandotte, Michigan, she ran on Lake Superior in 1880 - 1881 {{and then}} {{transferred}} to the Detroit-Mackinac route in 1882. On Feb. 24, 1885 the name was changed to "City of Alpena" {{at the time a}} second "City of Cleveland" was built. The "City of Alpena" stayed on the Detroit-Mackinac route until 1892 - 1893 when she was sold to the new Cleveland & Buffalo line. The name was changed to "State of Ohio" and she was placed on the Cleveland-Buffalo route along with her partner "City of Mackinac", which was sold at the same time, her name being changed to "State of New York". In 1898, she was chartered to run out of Chicago to St. Joseph, Michigan and in 1899 placed on the Cleveland-Toledo route. She was destroyed at her dock in Cleveland by fire May 20, 1924. Her iron hull was later converted into a <b>sand</b> <b>barge</b> and was stranded in Sandusky Bay harbor, Lake Erie, in 1929...|$|E

50|$|Port Construction: The Port's main {{construction}} and engineering outfit is CCCC First Harbor Engineering (中交第一航务工程局有限公司). Four subsidiary companies carry out {{all forms of}} project engineering and construction, from roads to breakwaters. As of 2010, First Harbor Engineering First Company (the main boat outfit) had a fleet of 74 work vessels. As {{in the case of}} dredgers, the sheer scale of construction in the Port means that many other outfits deploy hundreds of vessels. As of 2008, there were 418 construction vessels operating at the Port, including 236 <b>sand</b> <b>barges</b> and fluvial workboats.|$|R
50|$|Sumaira Abdulali of Awaaz {{foundation}} {{raised some}} specific queries under the Right to Information Act regarding {{number of licences}} issued to <b>barges</b> carrying <b>sand</b> from Raigad district to Mumbai and Navi Mumbai along {{with the name of}} barges owners, conditions for operations as well as the number of inspections deployed to check if any contraband material was being smuggled into the jetty. The MMB did not respond for several months, then foundation filed these queries with the Maharashtra State Information Commission. Thereafter, the concerned agencies responded that neither The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) nor Directorate-General of Shipping (DGS) nor The Indian Coast Guard maintain any records of the number of barges that move {{in and out of the}} inland waters on a day -to -day basis.The new sand mining policy stipulates that the barges should be registered and the list should be updated with the local Tehsildar.

50|$|With the Union Victory and {{occupation}} of the south, transport was administered by the US Army and Navy. The year 1864 brought an all-time low water mark on Upper Mississippi mark for all subsequent measurements. Stern wheelers proved more adaptable than side wheelers for barges.Immediately after the war, passenger steamboats become larger, faster and floating palaces began to appear; on the freight barges salt, hay, iron ore, and grain were carried. A few boats specialized in pushing huge log rafts downstream to lumber mills. By 1850, a system of moving barges and log rafts lashed alongside and ahead of the towboat was developed which allowed greater control than towing on a hawser. This type of service favored sternwheel propelled boats over sidewheelers and promoted other improvements as well. Towboats became a distinct type by 1860. Sand and gravel for construction was dredged up from river bottoms, and pumped aboard cargo barges. Simple hydraulic dredging rigs on small barges did the work. Towboats moved the dredge and <b>sand</b> <b>barges</b> around as needed.|$|R

50|$|While {{surrounded}} by acres of natural forest, marshlands, and coastline, {{the beach is}} actually man-made. Urban planner Robert Moses {{came up with the}} concept and planned its construction. The process involved filling in approximately one third of Pelham Bay with landfill, followed by a total of 1.2 million cubic yards of <b>sand</b> brought by <b>barge</b> from Sandy Hook, New Jersey and the Rockaways in Queens. The landfill was placed among Rodman's Neck, Twin Island, and Hunters Island; the latter two are no longer islands since being connected to the mainland Bronx by the landfill. The beach opened in 1936.|$|R
50|$|On the {{southern}} breakwater, barge construction was used. The southern side of Sebastos {{was much more}} exposed than the northern side, requiring sturdier breakwaters. Instead of using the double planked method filled with rubble, the architects sank barges filled with layers of pozzolana concrete and lime <b>sand</b> mortar. The <b>barges</b> were similar to boxes without lids, and were constructed using mortise and tenon joints, the same technique used in ancient boats, to ensure they remained watertight. The barges were ballasted with 0.5 meters of pozzolana concrete and floated out to their position. With alternating layers, pozzolana based and lime based concretes were hand placed inside the barge to sink it and fill {{it up to the}} surface.|$|R
2500|$|The beach project {{involved}} {{filling in}} approximately [...] of LeRoy's and Pelham Bays with landfill, {{followed by a}} total of [...] of <b>sand</b> brought by <b>barge</b> from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and the Rockaways in Queens. Moses had originally wanted to use sand for the new land, but thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper to use, so the material of choise was switched to landfill. Work on placing the fill began in early 1935, but officials opposed the use of garbage to fill in the land. The landfill was placed among Rodman's Neck, Twin Island, and Hunter Island. After the garbage began washing onto the beach through the as-yet-incomplete seawall, work on the filling operation was halted. The board allocated $500,000 (...) for [...] of sand, {{and the rest of the}} land reclamation project was done using sand from Sandy Hook and the Rockaways. The sand-filling operations officially began in April 1936. Two seawalls were built: one made of boulders on the east side of the fill facing Pelham Bay, and a smaller wall on the west side facing LeRoy's Bay, now a lagoon. The fill was then landscaped with flowers, shrubs, and various genera of trees, while the naturally planted chestnut, oak, hickory, black locust, and black cherry trees on either side of the fill were kept as is.|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Success of the Hawaii Beef Industry {{relies heavily}} on {{accessing}} mainland markets for finishing of cattle. Stocker calves are shipped to the mainland, usually Washington (WA) or California (CA), for finishing instead of being kept locally due to limited land, shipping costs of grain, and limited holding capacity within processing facilities located on the islands. Transportation via cowtainers is {{the most widely used}} mode due to availability, consistency, and efficacy. Cowtainers are custom modified freight containers equipped with water bins, feeders, and windows to allow for adequate airflow throughout the cowtainer. Objectives of this study were to examine environmental conditions within the cowtainer and to evaluate physiological parameters of weaned calves being shipped to determine response to long-haul shipping. An additional objective was to determine the animals’ ability to recover post-shipment. Two shipments of weaned, Angus and Charolaise, female calves (n= 48) were transported to WA or CA. Each shipment, the calves were divided by weight class and placed into custom cowtainers. Cowtainers were equipped with instruments measuring temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) once every minute. Vaginal temperatures (T°) were taken every minute by an inserted temperature instrument. Blood was collected prior to shipment (P), upon arrival (A), and 6 days post-arrival (PA). Blood work was sent to Antech Diagnostics for blood profile analysis used to determine physiological status of the animals. Blood was analyzed for substance P, a neuropeptide involved with pain and stress response, quantities. Cowtainer temperature and humidity were used to calculate the temperature humidity index (THI) of the microclimate within the cowtainer. Events with THI in a potential mild heat stress risk included trucking to Kawaihae, Kawaihae, and on the barge. Events with THI in a potential moderate heat stress risk included <b>barge,</b> <b>Sand</b> Island, Matson, and Oakland. Cowtainer THI ranged from “no-stress” to “moderate stress” stage, never reaching a THI value within the “severe” stage or above following the THI table from the Armstrong (1994) study. It should be noted that investigators in this field are incorporating wind speed and solar radiation into their calculations. Cattle shrink was 6. 4 % and 7. 5 % for the WA and CA shipments from P to A, respectively. From A to PA, weight gain was 9. 9 % for the WA shipment. Cattle body (vaginal) temperature above normal body temperature range (39. 44 °C) occurred at handling and processing, loading onto the cowtainers, and unloading from the cowtainers, particularly, events that were novel to the animals. Temperature returned to normal at times when animals were allowed to rest and adapt to the new environment. The times at which temperature was above normal body temperature range were short-term and return to normal values. Cattle in the top level had significantly higher body temperatures than cattle located in the bottom level in the WA shipment while on the barge (P = 0. 04). On the Matson ship in the WA shipment, cattle located in the outboard-located cowtainer had higher body temperatures compared to animals located in the center-located cowtainer (P = 0. 01). In the serum chemistry and complete blood cell count profiles, results for combined shipments showed stage had a significant effect on many parameters (P 0. 05). Substance P values showed a significant increase from P to A (p 0. 05). Additionally, there was no overall effect of level on body temperature response (P > 0. 05). Cowtainer microclimate data may be useful in determining events, particularly in relation with season as shown by differences in shipments, within the transportation process that are potentially high-risk areas for heat stress and therefore factors for eliciting a stress response. By identifying these areas, recommendations on methods {{to reduce the risk of}} heat stress may be provided to minimize heat stress risk for future shipments. The results obtained from the calves in this study showed minor, short-lived changes in indicators of stress, such as temperature and hematological parameters with shipping, however, animals quickly returned to a homeostatic physiological state. Characteristics of the cattle such as coat-color and body weight could be used to determine placements of animal in the cowtainer, specifically for summer months when ambient solar radiation, humidity, and temperatures are higher. Although the cattle appear to be able to make a full recovery after shipment based on the indicators of stress measured, the data collected provides information on the higher areas of risk and provides explanations for the importance of placement of cattle within the cowtainer that may be used to further improve the process of shipping and therefore, further improve the welfare of the animals during transportation. Decrease in the amount of stress animals experience in their lifetime would allow optimal growth, development, and performance, thereby increasing the economic value of each animal and improving welfare. It is recommended for cowtainer placement on the Matson ship to be placed closer to the center of the ship as cattle temperatures were significantly (P = 0. 01) lower compared to those located in the outboard-located cowtainer in the WA shipment. Placement of cattle based on weight groups should be made based on balancing of the cowtainer to ensure even distribution of weight in the cowatiner. Coat color impact on body temperature needs to be further investigated due to the inconsistent results across shipments...|$|R
