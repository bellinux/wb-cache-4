The aim {{of this article is}} to show that {{sensitivity to}} order should be accounted for without altering the standard formulation of plural logic. In particular, sensitivity to order does not call for a more fine-grained notion of plural reference. We point out that the phenomenon in question is quite broad and that current proposals are not equipped to deal with the full range of cases in which order plays a role. Then we develop an alternative, unified account, which locates the phenomenon not in the way in which plural terms can refer, but in the meaning of special expressions such as in that order and respectively...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{programming}} for approximate string matching {{is a large}} family of different algorithms, which vary significantly in purpose, complexity, and hardware utilization. Many implementations have reported impressive speed-ups, but have typically been point solutions – highly specialized and addressing only {{one or a few}} of the many possible options. The problem to be solved is creating a hardware description that implements a broad range of behavioral options without losing efficiency due to feature bloat. We report a set of three component types that address different parts of the approximate string matching problem. This allows each application to choose the feature set required, then make maximum use of the FPGA fabric according to that application’s specific resource requirements. Multiple, interchangeable implementations are available for each component type. We show that these methods allow the efficient generation of a large, if not complete, family of accelerators for this application. This flexibility was obtained while retaining high performance: We have evaluated a sample against <b>serial</b> <b>reference</b> codes and found speed-ups of from 180 x to 500 x over a high-end PC. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} on-chip parallelism {{has some}} substantial implications for HPC applications. Currently, hybrid programming models (typically MPI+OpenMP) are employed for mapping software to the hardware {{in order to}} leverage the hardware?s architectural features. In this paper, we present an approach that automatically introduces thread level parallelism into Chombo, a parallel adaptive mesh refinement framework for finite difference type PDE solvers. In Chombo, core algorithms are specified in the ChomboFortran, a macro language extension to F 77 {{that is part of}} the Chombo framework. This domain-specific language forms an already used target language for an automatic migration of the large number of existing algorithms into a hybrid MPI+OpenMP implementation. It also provides access to the auto-tuning methodology that enables tuning certain aspects of an algorithm to hardware characteristics. Performance measurements are presented for a few of the most relevant kernels with respect to a specific application benchmark using this technique as well as benchmark results for the entire application. The kernel benchmarks show that, using auto-tuning, up to a factor of 11 in performance was gained with 4 threads with respect to the <b>serial</b> <b>reference</b> implementation...|$|E

40|$|Summary. [...] This report {{describes}} a compressor {{which was designed}} to give a mean stage temperature rise of 30 des C. It has six stages so that the overall pressure ratio at the design point is 4. 5 : 1. Full details of the factors which led to the form adopted and of the design itself are given in the report. The test results fully substantiated the design assumptions. In particular, using standard design data, it is possible to achieve temperature rises of about 30 deg C without sacrificing unduly any desirable performance features. Such temperature rises were considerably above those being used at the time this work was carried out, and are in fact substantially above the mean value used in present-clay designs. Details of the stage characteristics and the matching of the compressor have been given in the report, together with some other points of special interest. 1. Introduction.

40|$|SAC is {{a purely}} {{functional}} array processing language designed with numerical applications in mind. It supports generic, high-level program specifications {{in the style}} of APL. However, rather than providing a fixed set of builtin array operations, SAC provides means to specify such operations in the language itself in a way that still allows their application to arrays of any dimension and size. This paper illustrates the specificational benefits of this approach by means of a high-level SAC implementation of the NAS benchmark MG realizing 3 -dimensional multigrid relaxation with periodic boundary conditions. Despite the high-level approach, experiments show that by means of aggressive compiler optimizations SAC manages to achieve performance characteristics in the range of low-level Fortran and C implementations. For benchmark size class A, SAC is outperformed by the <b>serial</b> Fortran- 77 <b>reference</b> implementation of the benchmark by only 23 %, whereas SAC itself outperforms a C implementation by the same figure. Furthermore, implicit parallelization of the SAC code for shared memory multiprocessors achieves a speedup of 7. 6 with 10 processors.
