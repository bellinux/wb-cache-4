5|$|John F. Tierney {{was born}} September 18, 1951, in Salem, Massachusetts. His mother, Doris H. (née Gelineau) Tierney, was a Salem native who worked a <b>split</b> <b>shift</b> at the New England Telephone Company, where she {{remained}} for 42 years. His father, Albert R. Tierney, was a bookkeeper for Nabisco {{and a local}} fuel company. Tierney {{was one of three}} children, along with his brother Michael A. and sister Catherine. His father was of Irish descent and his mother was of half French-Canadian and half Irish ancestry. He moved with his family to his grandmother's home when he was five years old. He began working at the Kernwood Country Club in Salem as a caddie when he was 8 and soon adopted a paper route. He later attended Salem High School. When he was young, Tierney campaigned for his uncle, a Peabody ward councilor, and he ascribes his political interest in part to this experience.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{also stated}} that a {{railroad}} switch showed evidence of damage consistent with the Metrolink passenger train [...] "running through" [...] the trailing switch points while they were set to allow the freight train to proceed onto the adjacent track, forcing {{them out of the}} way. [...] "The switch bars were bent like a banana. It should be perfectly straight," [...] according to the NTSB official. The NTSB member in charge of the investigative team said they were also concerned with possible fatigue issues related to the engineer's <b>split</b> <b>shift.</b> The engineer worked an 11.5-hour shift split with a 3.5-hour break, leaving only nine hours away from work between workdays.|$|E

30|$|The time-use effects {{associated}} with working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> {{do not differ}} much by gender. To check this hypothesis formally, I re-estimated each time-use regression in the combined sample of men and women, allowing the intercept and all slope coefficients to depend on gender. I then tested whether the interaction term between working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> and the dummy for gender was statistically significant. In all five instances, the claim of equality of effects was well within confidence bounds. But {{if that is the}} case, why would working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> be a significant predictor of ROM 2 for women only? One possible explanation is that the common absolute time variations represent different relative time changes. For example, female straight-shifters spend 158  min at leisure on a working day, whereas their male counterparts spend 199  min, meaning that the common reduction in leisure time {{associated with}} a split schedule is relatively more important for women. However, the effect of working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> on ROM 2 underwent little change when a quadratic function in leisure was included among the regressors.|$|R
30|$|Although {{the effects}} of working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> on time {{allocation}} are generally similar across the sexes, {{this is not so}} in the case of feeling role overloaded. Among male full-time employees the type of schedule is unrelated to the role overload condition, but working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> increases the feeling among their female counterparts of being at least sometimes overwhelmed by tasks and having too little time to complete them. However, when the definition of role overload is narrowed to the condition of feeling very often overwhelmed by tasks, the type of schedule appears to be irrelevant for women as well. Overall, therefore, working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> exerts a lower impact on the likelihood of role overload than other types of shift work (Williams 2008).|$|R
30|$|Working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> reduces {{leisure time}} on working days by {{approximately}} 7  min for {{both women and}} men. The effect is statistically significant at around the 10  %. The main contributor to the reduction for men is {{in the domain of}} sports and outdoor activities, which shrinks 10  min (see Table B. 13). Males working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> do not make up for time lost on days off (see Table B. 14), but the evidence suggests that female split-shifters do exercise some 6  min longer on days off than comparable women on a straight schedule.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of kanji encodings {{was the beginning}} of the <b>split.</b> <b>Shift</b> JIS supports kanji and was developed to be completely backward compatible with JIS X 0201, and thus is in much embedded electronic equipment.|$|E
30|$|According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005), only 0.5  % of US {{workers in}} 2004 worked <b>split</b> <b>shifts.</b> For Canada, {{the figure was}} 3.9  % in 2005 (Williams 2008).|$|R
30|$|The {{other three}} {{activities}} are {{negatively associated with}} working <b>split</b> <b>shifts.</b> Female split-shifters spend 12  min less than comparable straight-shifters on housework on working days. Among males, the figure is 11  min less. As shown in Table B. 10, the main contributor to these reductions is time spent shopping for consumer goods and services. Shopping less intensively on working days could be made up for by shopping more intensively on days off. To investigate this possibility, I estimated regressions for shopping time in the full sample of diaries, including among the regressors a binary variable equal to one if the diary pertained to a day off, and an interaction term between this dummy and the dummy for working <b>split</b> <b>shifts.</b> The main results are in Table B. 11. By adding the estimate in the interaction term to the estimate on working <b>split</b> <b>shifts,</b> {{we can see that}} split-shifters do not shop more intensively than straight-shifters on days off. This result and those in Aguiar and Hurst (2007) suggest that split-shifters might be paying more for the same basket of goods.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine empirically the effects that working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> have on Spanish workers’ well-being, time use, and {{productivity}} (hourly wages). The study adds to the literature in several regards. For the US and Canada, Presser (e.g., 1988, 1994), Kostiuk (1990), and Williams (2008), among others, examine the prevalence and consequences of shift work, which they define as anything other than a regular daytime schedule. But since very few US and Canadian workers work <b>split</b> <b>shifts,</b> they do not specifically study split schedules. 1 In contrast, this paper focuses on the split schedule, which is the normal daytime work schedule in Spain. Amuedo-Dorantes and de la Rica (2009) look at the effect of working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> on wages, and show that full-time workers are not compensated with higher wages for having such a schedule. But wage gaps may also result from productive characteristics, which offer an avenue for exploring the existence of differences in productivity across work schedules. ARHOE (2013) does contain a theoretical analysis of the consequences of the split work schedule for workers’ time use and productivity, while the current paper studies these issues empirically.|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-'90s, Labonte {{was in a}} {{band called}} Perpetual Doom. The band played death metal and its members were {{teenagers}} at the time. The original vocalist of Perpetual Doom was Scott Estes; Labonte, however, took over the vocal position in 1993 after Estes joined the Navy, and also played the guitar. In August 1993, Phil left to join the United States Marine Corps. Perpetual Doom remained inactive for nine months in Phil's absence. In June 1994, upon Phil's return, Perpetual Doom resumed writing with increased intensity. Other members included Ken Robert (vocals, guitar, now of <b>Split</b> <b>Shift),</b> Bill Brault (bass, now in <b>Split</b> <b>Shift),</b> and Stephen [...] "Steve" [...] Gonsalves (drums), {{who went on to}} become a paranormal investigator and future cast member of Ghost Hunters.

30|$|The broader {{definition}} of RO (ROM 2) has a pronounced {{effect on the}} impact of working <b>split</b> <b>shifts</b> for women, the estimated marginal effect of which becomes much larger and statistically different from zero at the 1  %. Holding other factors fixed, female full-time employees are, on average, 0.048 more likely to experience RO when working <b>split</b> <b>shifts,</b> which represents a 12  % increase in the average incidence of ROM 2 (0.394). In contrast, the type of schedule is again unrelated to the incidence of RO for men. These effects are lower in magnitude than those reported in Williams (2008), where Canadian workers (both men and women) on anything other than a regular daytime schedule were about 15  % less likely than day workers to have no role overload.|$|R

The total maximum over multiple shifts is 18 hours.|$|R
50|$|Children (8-13) {{were not}} covered by this Act: {{it had been the}} {{deliberate}} intention of the 1833 Act that a mill might use two sets of children on a relay system and the obvious method of doing so did not require <b>split</b> <b>shifts.</b> A further Act of 1853 set similar limits on the hours within which children might work.|$|R

50|$|The {{political}} alliances in <b>Split</b> <b>shifted</b> over time. At first, the Unionists and Autonomists were allied {{against the}} centralism of Vienna.

The great upheavals in Europe in 1848 gained no ground in Split, and the city did not rebel.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{associations}} between casualized employment and turnover intention in home care. Casualized employment refers to employment conditions of non-permanent contracts, part-time or casual hours, involuntary hours, on-call work, <b>split</b> <b>shifts,</b> pay per visit, and hourly pay with variable hours. Casualized employment also refers to perceived employment insecurity and labour market insecurity. Data are from a survey of 991 visiting nurses, therapists and home support workers in a medium-sized city in Ontario, Canada. Results show that, controlling for many other factors, casual hours and perceived employment insecurity and labour market insecurity are positively and on-call work is negatively associated with home care workers' turnover intention. Non-permanent contract, part-time hours, involuntary hours, <b>split</b> <b>shifts,</b> and non-salaried pay are features of the market-modelled home care work environment and therefore may not be associated with turnover intention. Results provide evidence on the effects of casualized employment strategies on home care workers' turnover intention.

50|$|In March 2009, the 7 {{year old}} Benld Elementary school was {{damaged beyond repair}} and {{ultimately}} condemned. This damage was caused by mine subsidence. This left 700+ students without a school. The students were then moved to the Gillespie High School and Middle School campus where they finished {{the remainder of the}} year on a <b>split</b> <b>shift</b> schedule. High school and middle school students attended school from 6:30am -Noon and elementary aged students attended from 12:30pm until 5:00pm. The students started the 2010 school year on the <b>split</b> <b>shift.</b> November 2, 2010 all students returned to a normal schedule with the elementary kids now attending class in 3 different locations.(modular units, middle school classrooms & the S.S. Simon & Jude Catholic School)The district was only allowed to collect $350,000 in mine subsidence insurance due to limits imposed by the state of Illinois. The district is in line to receive funding from the Capital Development Board to help with {{the construction of a new}} elementary school. The school is responsible for 20% of the $22million budget to build a new school. The school district is actively pursuing grants to fulfill their responsibility. The Ben-Gil Boosters, an organization formed to help raise funds for the construction of the new school, won $250,000 in April 2010 through Pepsi's Refresh Everything Campaign. The new school is adjacent to the district's middle school and high school in Gillespie, Illinois. Its name has been changed to Ben-Gil Elementary School, to reflect both communities.|$|E
