25|$|The main causes were Norovirus, {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal <b>Salmonella</b> <b>spp.,</b> {{although the}} causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates {{to an average of}} approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against <b>Salmonellae</b> <b>spp.</b> in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides.

2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>spp.,</b> P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E

40|$|On {{commercial}} turtle farms {{more than}} 40 % of the hatchlings excrete detectable levels of <b>Salmonella</b> and Arizona <b>spp.</b> when hatched from nonsanitized eggs incubated in sawdust or dirt-filled chambers. Over a 3 -year period on 10 farms, more than 10 (6) turtle eggs were treated {{in an attempt}} to hatch Salmonella-free turtles. Eggs were sanitized in disinfectant, treated by temperature- or pressure-differential dip methods in solutions containing 500 micrograms or more of gentamicin sulfate per ml, and hatched in sanitized plastic chambers free of bedding material. The <b>Salmonella</b> and Arizona <b>spp.</b> infection levels for turtles produced from treated eggs were 0 and 1. 12 % for years 1 and 2, respectively, whereas infection levels for hatchlings produced from nontreated eggs during these periods were 47 and 44 %, respectively.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{preliminary}} assessment of the hydrochemical and microbial groundwater quality of the Merdja plain (Tébessa area). Twenty samples of groundwater collected from Bekkaria (Site 1) to Ain Chabro (Site 2) were assessed for their suitability for human consumption. Groundwater from the aquifer in the Merdja area can be divided into two major groups according to geographical locations and chemical compositions. Water in the center part of the study area is characterized by the dominance of chloride, sulfate, sodium, and potassium; whereas waters in the limestone aquifers in the west are dominated by the same cations but have higher concentrations of bicarbonate. Microbiological parameters were determined in 13 groundwater samples collected from the study area.

Dairy herds with enteric bacteria with known low tetracycline susceptibility were enrolled for the study. Fecal samples from preweaned calves and environmental samples were collected from eight dairy herds in Michigan and New York State. Samples were collected monthly for 3 months prior to and 12 months after four of the eight herds discontinued medicated milk replacer feeding. <b>Salmonella</b> and Campylobacter <b>spp.</b> and E. coli were isolated, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using automated broth microdilution. A total of 804 intervention and 1, 026 control calf fecal samples and 122 intervention and 136 control environmental samples were collected for testing. No differences in owner-reported morbidity and mortality between treatment groups were seen. The intervention was significantly associated with increasing tetracycline susceptibility in E. coli and Salmonella. Tetracycline susceptibility increased in intervention herds for the first 3 months after switching to nonmedicated milk replacer but declined in subsequent months. Discontinuing the practice of feeding medicated milk replacers to calves increased tetracycline susceptibility in E. coli and Salmonella on dairy farms, without increasing cattle disease, but declines in effectiveness after 3 months suggest that other factors contribute to decreasing susceptibility on the farm...|$|R
50|$|Organic acids {{are used}} in food {{preservation}} because of their effects on bacteria. The key basic principle on the mode of action of organic acids on bacteria is that non-dissociated (non-ionized) organic acids can penetrate the bacteria cell wall and disrupt the normal physiology of certain types of bacteria that we call pH-sensitive, meaning that they cannot tolerate a wide internal and external pH gradient. Among those bacteria are Escherichia coli, <b>Salmonella</b> <b>spp.,</b> C. perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter species.|$|E

The prevalence of Salmonella and Shigella, the causative agent for Salmonellosis and Shigellosis, respectively, their antibiogram and growth potential were the main objectives of this review. Foodborne diseases related to unhygienic food handling practices remain a major public health problem across the globe. The problem is severe in developing countries due to limitations in securing optimal hygienic food handling practices. Data shows that an estimated 70 % of cases of diarrheal diseases are associated with the consumption of foods contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. Among these microorganisms Salmonella and Shigella are the major ones. In most studies of Antibiograms tests, <b>Salmonella</b> and Shigella <b>spp.</b> showed high resistance to the commonly used antibiotics which indicate serious problems in antimicrobial therapy globally, especially in developing countries. In challenge studies, <b>Salmonella</b> and Shigella <b>spp.</b> reached the infective dose within 4 to 24 hours of inoculation, respectively in various food samples. In this review, it is noted that these potentially pathogens are still public health problems.
