"The Emperor's New Clothes" [...] (...) {{is a short}} tale {{written by}} Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that they say is {{invisible}} {{to those who are}} unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. When the emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, no one dares to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not see any suit of clothes on him for fear that they will be seen as [...] "unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent". Finally, a child cries out, [...] "But he isn't wearing anything at all!" [...] The tale has been translated into over 100 languages.|$|E

"If from antiquity to the present, {{and since}} the {{beginning}} of man, there are men who have seen the bodies of ghosts and spirits and heard their voices, how can we <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not exist?

But those who deny the existence of the spirits say: [...] "Many in the world have heard and seen something of ghosts and spirits. Since they vary in testimony, who are to be accepted as really having heard and seen them?" [...] Mo Tzu said: As we are to rely on what many have jointly seen and what many have jointly heard, the case of Tu Po is to be accepted." ...|$|E

A union organizer known only as “the activist” tells everyone that the latter peasant was the murderer. They bury Kozlov and Safronov before receiving a letter from Prushevsky, who says that Nastya has begun attending nursing school. Nastya's working class rhetoric, which she first used in order to fit in, is now violent in nature. She writes, [...] "Liquidate the kulaks as a class. … Greetings to the collective farm, but not the kulaks." ...|$|E

So that teaching, with them, though it has, indeed, its solicitudes and cares, as every other responsible employment must necessarily have, is, after all, a calm and quiet pursuit, which they follow from month to month, and from year to year, without any extraordinary agitations, or any unusual burdens of anxiety and care.|$|E
