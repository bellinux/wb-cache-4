5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to <b>store</b> <b>the</b> library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room to <b>store</b> <b>the</b> museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E

40|$|Iris {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} biometric techniques. In many proposed biometric recognition technique, template’s are <b>store</b> in <b>the</b> database for comparison. But there exists a vital problem in <b>storing</b> <b>the</b> template in the database since it can be easily bootlegged. In order to overcome these issues a novel method for person identification by their Iris, through securely <b>storing</b> <b>the</b> template is proposed. Visual Cryptography Encryption (VCE) technique is used for securely <b>storing</b> <b>the</b> iris template. By means of VCE, shares are generated for the iris template which is <b>stored</b> in <b>the</b> database instead of <b>storing</b> <b>the</b> entire template. Shares are generated by pixel expansion method. Authentication is provided by comparing the shares. Comparison is done by using Hamming Code. So it is a very effective method of person identification. The proposed method gives an extra security in iris recognition...|$|R
30|$|The SID (or domain dictionary) is the {{keystone}} of our NLIDB, since it <b>stores</b> <b>the</b> information {{necessary for the}} interface to correctly interpret a query.

50|$|It {{is also a}} way {{to store}} a large array of numbers, {{where many of the}} entries are zero.
