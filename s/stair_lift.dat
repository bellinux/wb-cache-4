5000|$|The {{music video}} opens to {{a video of}} a {{crocodile}} scaring a herd of antelope. It then cuts to a scene where 2-D wakes up and changes clothes in 212 Wobble Street, London, SW21 7QJ. He exits his room and checks another one, finding other band member Noodle fast asleep. After that, he looks in a bathroom and finds a masked figure representing André 3000, surrounded by light blue-skinned [...] "sweat collectors". Disgusted, 2-D looks in another room {{that turns out to}} be shrouded in complete darkness with the sounds of sheep, chickens and a man crying, which in turn is a reference to a Motorola commercial which band member Murdoc Niccals appeared in. Murdoc then scares 2D by popping up in the room, and he proceeds to go down the stairs using a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> as 2-D goes to the living room as the Doncamatic submarine makes a cameo appearance behind him, and finds a previous character from the third album Plastic Beach named the Boogeyman reading a newspaper (while the DARE music video plays on the TV). He goes down to the kitchen and opens a cabinet, only to find the masked figure stuffed inside it. Calmly shutting the door on him, he cooks toast and puts it on his plate along with, without realizing, a human ear from a bowl of them near the toaster. 2-D then opens a refrigerator and finds the masked figure stuffed inside it, who gives 2-D a milk carton and jelly. At the dining table, he reads a fictional newspaper comic entitled The Gorillaz, showing comics called [...] "The Funnies" [...] which features a comic of Murdoc hugging 2-D. Murdoc, having finally finished going down the stairs, goes up to 2-D and angrily hits him with a Gorillaz Converse shoe, unlike the comic, leaving the former very upset. 2-D decides against eating the toast upon realising that it has an ear on it, turns off the radio (which also cuts the song) and leaves the house, while Murdoc starts a transmission from his radio station, playing the intro to the Gorillaz song 5/4. Once outside, he receives a notice of eviction from a baboon mailman representing James Murphy, and smiles, looking relieved. The car from the music video of Stylo is [...] "parked" [...] outside. The camera points up, revealing a still-giant Russel Hobbs sleeping on the roof of the house and the remains of the windmill island (nicknamed [...] "The Slowboat") from the Feel Good Inc. and El Mañana music videos floating in the sky.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} wheelchair <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> with an intelligent control system that aim to apply for helping the mobility of ageing, disabled and wheelchair people who are suffered from any inconvenience causes of building stair usages and also served for the fire stair evacuation path in the same time. The <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> is controlled by PLC with the fuzzy proportional plus integral (F-PI) controller combined on their driver functions called as fuzzy ladder control which can generate an appropriate setting voltage and torque to maintain a target position and speed of <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> when it move along the stair path with shorter time of accessing, travelling and dwelling process. To gain the precise value of target position and speed, the DC motor drive with smart steering gear box that are coupled on two stair guide rails is designed for acting easily as a linear moving control by F-PI controller. By several tests of the unknown characteristics of wheelchair users, the F-PI controller can solve this kind of problems with more efficiency because of the main advantage of fuzzy logic is that no mathematical model is required but can be achieved higher performance with the effective tuning parameters especially in an initial setting process. For more efficiency, the RFID detection method is applied to use for identifying and automatically accessing of wheelchair users who want to use this <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> with some important data such as their name, ag...|$|E

40|$|For every society, it is {{important}} to know the effective and efficient health care interventions that ensure a more efficient use of scarce health care resources. Care of dementia is extremely resource demanding and has a great impact on both the formal care systems and the condition for informal carers. Occupational therapy (OT) is likely to be useful in dementia care. It is also recommended by the occupational therapists that a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> is the right solution for old or many younger individuals with disabilities who want to stay independently in their own home. From the policy perspective, nonetheless, the questions of cost-effectiveness of such interventions are vital. This study aims to assess whether municipality occupational therapy is a costeffective service option for home-based persons with reduced function in Norway. Two types of subjects have been considered for the analyses: older patients with dementia and people who use and are supposed to need a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> in their apartments. To get the information regarding the OT intervention and its effects on the differences in health care quantities used by the dementia patients between case (OT users) and control (usual care users) groups, a rigorous literature review has been conducted. Based on our literature search, we have considered the study from the Netherlands (the study based on randomized control trials). We estimate economic benefits/costs from the point of societal perspective. Employing the number of health care units used per patient during three months follow-up period that estimated in the study from the Netherlands, and using Norwegian wages/prices for different health care units, we present a hybrid estimate of the economic effects of OT intervention for the dementia patient in Norway. All costs have been calculated from the employee costs multiplied by a percentage for employer premiums as social taxes, holidays, and employee other benefits. Overall, our estimates indicate that community OT intervention for people with dementia is cost-effective in Norway. Our estimates demonstrate that with a probability of 95 %, on average it saves NOK 42, 427 (95 % CI: 33, 678 and 51, 176) over three months per successfully treated dementia patient with OT. The main cost savings are from reduced informal care for the intervention group (NOK 48, 387. 42), around 90 % of total costs are owing to informal care costs. Based on the information collected through a small scale interviews with the user of a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> and potential-user (persons that have been concluded to need a <b>stair</b> <b>lift,</b> and are waiting for the installation), a quantitative cost-effectiveness analysis has been conducted. From the self-assessed descriptions provided by the informants, it is rather apparent that having a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> is effective in improving the users’ daily livings, quality of life, and reducing informal cares time. Based on some restrictive assumptions, it seems that the intervention is cost-effective as well. From a societal view point, particularly in terms of informal care costs, our tentative conclusion is that community OT appears to be a cost-effective intervention strategy for the patients with dementia in Norway. Similar conclusion can also be drawn for the <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> intervention. Yet, to be more confident on our conclusions, we recommend further comprehensive research on these issues...|$|E
30|$|The {{fractures}} {{were treated}} nonoperatively with elastic tubular bandage. The patient was advised to avoid pulling herself up the banister with her forearms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of an agent-based lift (elevator) model developed within building EXODUS software intended to represent evacuation scenarios. The main components of the lift model are described including the lift: kinematics, attributes and dispatch control. The agent–lift interaction model is also described, including the lift bank selection, the lift waiting area behaviour (wait location selection and wait duration) and the lift car selection and entry. The lift model is used to investigate a series of full building evacuation scenarios based on a hypothetical 50 floor building with four staircases and a population of 7840 agents. The analysis explores the relative merits of using up to 32 lifts (arranged in four banks) and various egress lift dispatch strategies to evacuate the entire building population. Findings from the investigation suggest that the most efficient evacuation strategy utilizes a combination of lifts and stairs to empty the building and clear the upper half of the building in minimum time. Combined <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> evacuation times {{have been shown to be}} as much as 50 % faster than stair only evacuation times. The introduction of the agent milling behaviour resulted in reductions in evacuation times compared with the same scenarios without milling behaviour...|$|E

50|$|In {{multi-story}} commercial buildings, shear walls form {{at least}} one core (Figure 3). From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including <b>stairs,</b> <b>lifts,</b> toilets and service risers. Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core. From the structural point of view, a shear core could strengthen the building’s resistance to lateral loads, i.e., wind load and seismic load, and significantly increase the building safety.|$|R
25|$|The {{ticket hall}} for the railway station opens off {{the centre of}} {{eastern side of the}} concourse, and in turn gives access via ticket {{barriers}} to a pedestrian overbridge with <b>stairs</b> and <b>lifts</b> down to the railway platforms. A second concourse opens off the main concourse {{at the southern end of}} its eastern side, and this runs parallel and to the south of the platforms, giving access by <b>stairs,</b> <b>lifts</b> and escalators to the tram stop, the station car park, taxi rank, vehicular pick-up and drop-off points and Queen Street. The tram stop spans the station from north to south to the east of the main entrance, at a higher level than the concourse, and to the east of that a second footbridge links the platforms and carries the previously referred to footpath 28.|$|R
