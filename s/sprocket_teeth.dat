40|$|The study's {{aim was to}} get ANSI <b>sprocket</b> <b>tooth</b> {{profile and}} {{involute}} <b>sprocket</b> <b>tooth</b> profile for effects on dynamic tension of chains in the silent chain drive, and analyse and compare {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the different tooth profiles to choose more practical tooth profile from the two sprockets. Current collector was used to test the dynamic tension when straight sprocket and involute sprocket engaged with the same silent chain. And experimental data measured were analyzed in the amplitude domain and frequency domain. Test results indicate that the probability of tension appearing in the different numerical size and power spectral densities of load in the different frequencies of the involute tooth form are better than of straight tooth form, which show that the involute sprocket has been good working properties. In addition, taking the advantages of involute tooth profile into account in the process, the involute tooth form is recommended in universal <b>sprocket</b> <b>tooth</b> form of the actual use...|$|R

"Hyperglide HG" [...] - Cutaways on {{the rear}} gear {{sprockets}} (called the cassette if it slides onto a freehub body) that allow smoother downshifting (shifting from a small sprocket to a bigger one) as the cutaways allow the chain to roll from one sprocket to another without lifting as far off the <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth.</b> This allows {{a certain amount of}} gear shifting under power, though this remains hard on the drivetrain.|$|E
50|$|Chain wear, {{often called}} chain stretch, becomes {{an issue with}} {{extensive}} cycling. The wear is removal of material from the bushings and pins (or half-bushings, in the Sedis design) rather than elongation of the sideplates. The tension created by pedaling is insufficient to cause the latter. Because the spacing from link to link on a worn chain is longer than the 1/2 in specification, those links will not precisely fit the spaces between teeth on the sprockets, resulting in increased wear on the sprockets and possibly chain skip on derailleur drivetrains, in which pedaling tension causes the chain to slide up {{over the tops of}} the <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth</b> and skip to the next alignment, that reduces power transfer and makes pedaling uncomfortable.|$|E

Tested the noise characteristics among the new type double-pitch silent chain, the double-pitch roller chain and the short-pitch silent chain for conveyor and analysed the results. The results show that this new type of chain could effectively increase the transmission speed, ease chordal action, reduce the impact between chian plates and the <b>sprocket</b> <b>tooth,</b> and noise reduction effect is obvious.

50|$|In bicycle chains, skip-link chain has {{the same}} one-inch spacing as the earlier block chain. Due to the asymmetry, the rollers fit over long teeth used with earlier block chain, but due {{to the use of}} rollers, {{efficiency}} is better than block chain. Skip-link chain is typically arranged with the long plates also the wide-spaced outer plates, which mimics the visual effect of block chain. Since <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth</b> run on rollers, they cannot be usefully wider than the width of the narrow-spaced links, so the tooth can be no wider than with a symmetrical chain. Thus, skip-link chain spreads wear over half the number of teeth and has worse sprocket durability than a symmetrical roller chain. Chain wear is dominated by wear between pins and bushings, and this is the same as a modern roller chain.|$|E
5000|$|CS perfs: In 1953, the {{introduction}} of CinemaScope by Fox Studios required {{the creation of a}} different shape of perforation which was nearly square and smaller to provide space for four magnetic sound stripes for stereophonic and surround sound. These perfs are commonly referred to as CinemaScope (CS) or [...] "Fox hole" [...] perfs. Their dimensions are 0.0780 in (1.85 mm) in width by 0.0730" [...] (1.98 mm) in height. Due to the size difference, CS perfed film cannot be run through a projector with standard KS <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth,</b> but KS prints can be run on sprockets with CS teeth. Shrunken film with KS prints that would normally be damaged in a projector with KS sprockets may sometimes be run far more gently through a projector with CS sprockets because of the smaller size of the teeth. Magnetic striped 35 mm film became obsolete in the 1980s after the advent of Dolby Stereo, as a result film with CS perfs is no longer manufactured.|$|E
50|$|The {{roller chain}} design reduces {{friction}} compared to simpler designs, resulting in higher efficiency and less wear. The original power transmission chain varieties lacked rollers and bushings, {{with both the}} inner and outer plates held by pins which directly contacted the sprocket teeth; however this configuration exhibited extremely rapid wear of both the <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth,</b> and the plates where they pivoted on the pins. This problem was partially solved by the development of bushed chains, with the pins holding the outer plates passing through bushings or sleeves connecting the inner plates. This distributed the wear over a greater area; however the teeth of the sprockets still wore more rapidly than is desirable, from the sliding friction against the bushings. The addition of rollers surrounding the bushing sleeves of the chain and provided rolling contact with the teeth of the sprockets resulting in excellent resistance to wear of both sprockets and chain as well. There is even very low friction, as long as the chain is sufficiently lubricated. Continuous, clean, lubrication of roller chains is of primary importance for efficient operation as well as correct tensioning.|$|E

5000|$|A {{sprocket}} or sprocket-wheel is a profiled {{wheel with}} teeth, or cogs, that mesh with a chain, track or other perforated or indented material. The name 'sprocket' applies generally to any wheel upon which radial projections engage a chain passing over it.

40|$|The {{effect of}} load speed on {{straight}} and involute tooth forms is studied using several finite-element models. It is {{found that for}} rapidly rotating gears and sprockets, the load speed along the tooth surface can significantly affect the tooth vibration. Indeed, {{it is found that}} for sufficiently high load speeds and for sufficiently slender tooth forms, the tooth deflection can, at times, be directed opposite to the load direction. Comparisons are made of various dynamic models of gear and <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth.</b> It is shown that for stubby tooth forms there is considerable difference between results obtained with finite element models and results obtained with Timoshenko beam models. Finally, it is shown that gear or sprocket vibrations can be induced by the shape of the tooth form itself. This effect becomes increasingly significant at higher speeds...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for modeling and simulating roller-chain drives using multibody formulations. The presented approach models the chain links as spatial decoupled dynamic bodies. The chain links are modeled using two different dynamic representations for the pin-link and the bushing-link. The bushing-link is modeled with two descendent dynamic bodies to represent the rollers. The adjacent pin and bushing links are connected by compliant bushing force elements. An efficient search algorithm is used to detect the contact between the roller and the <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth</b> while a nonlinear force module is used to predict the contact force. A generalized sprocket representation is used to model the sprocket. The spatial motion of the chain links allows the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the links as well as simulating sprockets misalignment. Using the compliant connection between links avoids using the iterative calculation needed to satisfy the joint constraint equations leading to more efficient calculation scheme. The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion are solved using recursive approach. Complex roller chains drives, bicycle chain and conveyance systems can be easily modeled and analyzed using the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the <b>sprocket</b> <b>teeth.</b> If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|E
