6000|$|Miss Annie, <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the door, now {{regarded}} Lawrence with {{a certain}} degree of thoughtfullness on her countenance, which presently changed to a half smile. [...] "If I were perfectly sure," [...] she said, [...] "that she would reject you, I would try to get her here, and have the matter settled, but I don't know her very well yet, and can't feel at all certain as to what she might do." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Ancliffe grasped her {{and pushed}} her through a vent he had made. Allie crawled {{backward}} {{and she could see}} Hough <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> It seemed that he swayed. Then as she rose further her view was cut off. Although she had not looked around, she was aware of a dimly lighted storeroom. Outside the shots had ceased. She heard something heavy fall suddenly; then a patter of quick, light footsteps.|$|E
6000|$|He {{pressed the}} {{agitated}} girl into a seat, {{returned to the}} outer room and opened the door. Immediately outside, in the passage, appeared Grandfer Cantle singing in concert with those <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the house. He {{came into the room}} and nodded abstractedly to Wildeve, his lips still parted, and his features excruciatingly strained in the emission of the chorus. This being ended, he said heartily, [...] "Here's welcome to the newmade couple, and God bless 'em!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{interpreter}} gave {{a sort of}} grunt, but he said nothing. The conversation went no farther, however, just then; for, by this time, the Indians came stealing out of the house, {{every man}} of them armed, looking dusky, prepared and full of wariness. Manytongues did not keep them long, but soon told his story. After this, his authority appeared, in a great measure, to cease. Flintyheart was now {{the most prominent of}} the party, though Prairiefire, and another warrior, were also connected with the orders given to the rest. I observed that Eaglesflight had no part in these arrangements, which were peculiarly military, though he appeared armed and ready, and went forth on the sudden call, like the rest. In five minutes, the Indians were all off, principally in pairs, leaving the interpreter and myself <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> together, <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the deserted house.|$|R
500|$|Saved {{from the}} Titanic is now {{considered}} a lost film, as the only known prints were destroyed in a fire at Éclair Studios in March 1914. Its only surviving visual records are a few production stills, printed in the Moving Picture News and Motion Picture World, showing scenes {{of the family and}} a <b>still</b> of Dorothy <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a map of the North Atlantic pointing to the location of the Titanic. Frank Thompson highights the film as {{one of a number of}} [...] "important movies that disappeared", noting that it was unique for having [...] "an actual survivor of the Titanic playing herself in a film" [...] while wearing [...] "the very clothes [...] [...] [...] in which she abandoned ship": ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning at dawn Leonard rose and, accompanied by Francisco, walked into the courtyard. This time the soldiers {{did not try to}} stop them, but the priests were <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Juanna's door, looking like spectres in the grey mist. They went to them and signified by signs that they would worship the Queen, but were sternly refused admission in words which they could not understand, but that Soa, who was listening, afterwards translated to them.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the first}} {{suggestion}} that anything untoward had happened. I took no notice, and {{did my best to}} engage Mrs. Strickland in talk. The Colonel, <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the fireplace, uttered no word. I wondered how soon I could decently take my leave, and I asked myself why on earth Mrs. Strickland had allowed me to come. There were no flowers, and various knick-knacks, put away during the summer, had not been replaced; there was something cheerless and stiff about the room which had always seemed so friendly; it gave you an odd feeling, as though someone were lying dead {{on the other side of}} the wall. I finished tea.|$|E

40|$|Deduction may {{be wrong}} if we miss the part of human perception. In this paper we design a field {{experiment}} to measure the driver's perceptual car width. That car is <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of that driver inside a vehicle cab. We deduce our perceptual car following model {{based on the results}} above and also show its connection with the GM's car following model The model we present here is not very like the one based on the general driver's perceptual model. Additionally we establish a car-following simulation model based on our findings. The simulation performances are interpreted in terms of car following stability, shock wave phenomena, and some macroscopic traffic parameters...|$|R
5000|$|One {{application}} of the Geneva drive is in movie projectors: the film does not run continuously through the projector. Instead, the film is advanced frame by frame, each frame <b>standing</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the lens for 1/24 of a second (and being exposed twice in that time, resulting in a frequency of 48 Hz). This intermittent motion is achieved using a Geneva drive. (Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled indexing mechanism or stepper motor, which allows for fast-forwarding the film.) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors go back to 1896 to the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the Teatrograph of Robert William Paul. Previous projectors, including Thomas Armat's projector, marketed by Edison as the Vitascope, had used a [...] "beater mechanism", invented by Georges Demenÿ in 1893, to achieve intermittent film transport.|$|R

I think he is thinking, ‘Run me down if you can!’ And the first tank stopped exactly {{in front of him and}} there was some talking going on. And the next thing, he is climbing on top of the tank and he is speaking with the driver. Later on he climbed down and he’s <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the tank." ...|$|E
