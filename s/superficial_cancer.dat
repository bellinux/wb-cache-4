40|$|Background:A {{considerable}} {{percentage of}} gallbladder cancers {{are accompanied by}} <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread adjacent to themain tumor, therefore cholecystectomy for early gallbladder cancer must be performed carefully to avoid leaving cancer cells at the surgical margins. Methods: Thirty-two patients with gallbladder cancer invading no more than perimuscular connective tissueunderwent surgical resectionatourmedical center. After theoperation, resected specimens were investigated macroscopically and microscopically to clarify the clinicopatholo-gical features and the risk factors of <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread. Results: Sixty-six percent of all cases (21 cases) had <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread. Comparison between the cases having <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread and the cases without it revealed that the macroscopicmorphology of the primary tumor {{and the depth of}} cancer invasion in the gallbladder wall were significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indic-ated that ‘superficial raised type ’ inmacroscopicmorphologywasan independent predictive factor for having <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread. <b>Superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread from themain tumor located in the neck of the gallbladder grows predominantly {{in the direction of the}} fundus. More advanced gallbladder cases were accompanied by more extensive superficial spread. Conclusions: <b>Superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> spread is frequently observed adjacent to the gallbladder cancer, especially in the superficial raised type. A negative margin should be confirmed by intraoperative frozen section histology while performing cholecystectomy.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} computer-assisted color analysis of colorectal lesions using a novel auto-fluorescence imaging (AFI) system to distinguish neoplastic lesions from non-neoplastic lesions and to predict the depth of invasion. METHODS: From January 2013 to April 2013, consecutive patients with known polyps greater than 5 mm in size who were scheduled to undergo endoscopic treatment at The Jikei University Hospital were prospectively recruited for this study. All lesions were evaluated using a novel AFI system, and color-tone sampling was performed in a region of interest determined from narrow band imaging or from chromoendoscopy findings without magnification. The green/red (G/R) ratio for each lesion on the AFI images was calculated automatically using a computer-assisted color analysis system that permits real-time color analysis during endoscopic procedures. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients with 163 lesions were enrolled in this study. There were {{significant differences in the}} G/R ratios of hyperplastic polyps (non-neoplastic lesions), adenoma/intramucosal cancer/submucosal (SM) <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer,</b> and SM deep cancer (P 0. 89 was applied to determine non-neoplastic lesions, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 83. 9 %, 82. 6 %, 53. 1 %, 95. 6 % and 82. 8 %, respectively. For neoplastic lesions, the mean G/R ratio was 0. 834 1; 0. 080 in adenoma/intramucosal cancer/SM <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> and 0. 746 1; 0. 045 in SM deep cancer. The G/R ratio of adenoma/intramucosal cancer/SM <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> was significantly higher than that of SM deep cancer (P < 0. 01). When a G/R ratio cut-off value of < 0. 77 was applied to distinguish SM deep cancers, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 80. 0 %, 84. 4 %, 29. 6 %, 98. 1 % and 84. 1 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The novel AFI system with color analysis was effective in distinguishing non-neoplastic lesions from neoplastic lesions and might allow determination of the depth of invasion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopic mucosal {{resection}} (EMR) and {{photodynamic therapy}} {{have been proposed}} as treatments for early stage cancers. EMR is limited by its focal nature whereas photodynamic therapy is dependent on precise staging. The combination of EMR and photodynamic therapy were studied {{in the treatment of}} <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> in patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: Seventeen consecutive nonsurgical patients with superficial cancers underwent EMR followed by photodynamic therapy with a porphyrin photosensitizer. Photoradiation was performed at 630 nm for a total dose of 200 J/cm of diffuser. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (15 men; mean age 69 +/- 13 years) underwent EMR. The mean diameter of mucosal resection was 1 cm. The margins were involved by cancer in 3 cases. EMR improved staging in 8 patients (47 %). Sixteen (94 %) patients remained in remission (median follow-up 13 months). Complications included minor bleeding after EMR in 1 patient (6 %), stricture in 5 (30 %), cutaneous phototoxicity in 2 (12 %), and supraventricular tachycardia in 1 patient (6 %). CONCLUSIONS: Combined EMR and photodynamic therapy appears to be an effective and safe therapy for superficial esophageal cancer within Barrett's esophagus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Because {{there is}} no {{national}} guideline for the diagnosis, therapy and follow up of (<b>superficial)</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> in the Netherlands and Belgium, the actual patient management may differ between urologists. The {{purpose of this study}} is to get insight in the current way urologists diagnose, treat and follow patients with <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> METHODS: All practising urologists in the Netherlands (n = 293) and Flemish speaking Belgium (Flanders, n = 223) received a questionnaire with regard to the current management of patients with <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> The results were compared with the guidelines provided by the European Association of Urology (EAU).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intravesical {{epirubicin}} is {{a widely}} used agent {{for the treatment of}} <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> A direct relationship between dose and activity has been reported: unfortunately the dose increase also increased the frequency and the intensity of treatment-related side effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A phase 2 trial was designed to evaluate the toxicity and the activity of a delayed (biweekly) high-dose (80 mg) epirubicin therapy of <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> Thirty patients with intermediate risk <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> (stage mTa, G 2) have been treated with transurethral resection and epirubicin intravesical therapy: the patients were given 80 mg epirubicin in 50 ml sterile saline every 2 weeks for 6 times (delayed regimen). The follow-up ranged from 3 to 26 months. Eleven of 30 (37 %) patients experienced a local adverse reaction to intravesical epirubicin requiring specific medication (grade > or = 2 according to NCI-CTC v. 2. 0, 1999). No systemic toxicity related to the treatment was observed. RESULTS: Out of the 29 evaluable patients, 22 (76 %) were free of disease after the induction course, 6 (21 %) had <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> recurrences and 1 (3 %) experienced tumor progression.

40|$|SUMMARY-In a {{morphogenetic}} {{study of}} experimental {{tumors of the}} intestine, 556 male noninbred albino rats were given weekly sc injections of 21 mg 1, 2 -dimethyl-hydrazine dihydrochloridejkg body weight and were killed at ditferent intervals (10 - 70 ratsjwk) after the beginning of treatment. Intestinal carcinomas developed in almost all rats surviving 5 months after the beginmng of the ex-periment. In addition, intestinal tumors induced in 800 rats of both sexes were examined. Tumor development began with a widening of the proliferative zone within the crypts, an indication of enterocyte differentiation dis-orders. The ensuing in situ carcinoma became <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> capable of invading the lamina propria of the mucosa.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the morphology and morphogenesis of intestinal epithelial tumors induced by treatment with 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine in over 2, 000 rats and 1, 415 polypoid lesions in the human colon and rectum was conducted. The development of experimental cancer starts with the expan-sion of the proliferative zone in intestinal crypts. The first cancer lesion to occur is carcinoma in situ which develops in the superficial layers of flat mucosa. Further evolution of carcinoma in situ with invasion within the lamina propria of the mucosa leads to <b>superficial</b> <b>cancer</b> development. Invasive cancer develops, when neoplastic structures extend into the sub-mucosal layer. Therefore, experimental intestinal adenocarcinoma appears denovo. Morphogenetic studies showed that the preinvasive stage of cancer may persist for a long time. In such cases, structural and cytologic signs of epithelial atypism and pleomorphism may be of vital importance {{for the detection of}} malignancy. Hence, when non-invasive polypoid lesions in hu-mans are checked for malignancy, emphasis should be placed on the detec-tion of the following morphologic manifestations of atypia : a considerabe decrease or complete absence of goblet cells, epithelial pseudostratification or even a multilayer structure, location of mitoses in the superficial areas of tumors and an increasing proportion of abnormal mitoses, appearance of papillary and villous structures and changes in their configuration, bizarre outlines of tumor glandules, cellular and nuclear polymorphism, appearance of cribriform structures, numerous plasma cells and karyorrhexis-affected lymphocytes in tumor stroma, etc. Invasion was detected in the dissected intestinal segments in 70 % of the cases in which the said changes were observed in biopsy. No morphologic signs of malignancy was detected in adenomatous polyps.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether microvessel density (MVD) could {{be measured in}} papillary superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the human urinary bladder in a simple, meaningful and reproducible way. Also, to {{determine whether}} angiogenesis, as measured by MVD, at presentation is related to subsequent recurrence or progression of <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> {{and its relationship to}} known angiogenic cytokines. Methods: Immunohistochemical techniques were used to measure MVD (using CD 34), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) (using both TSP Ab- 4 and TSP Ab- 7 antibodies), thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and p 53 in 5 ?m sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of primary <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> A computer image analysis system was devised to measure MVD and compared to a standard manual technique. The percentage expression of VEGF, TSP- 1, TP and p 53 was recorded. MVD and the cytokines were correlated with outcome using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: The database included 293 cases of primary <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> The computer image analysis system was able to measure MVD in <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> and correlated strongly with manual counting (r= 0. 95). In a multivariable analysis, MVD (p< 0. 0001), TSP (Ab- 7) tumour staining (p= 0. 001), decreased TSP (Ab- 4) perivascular staining (p= 0. 007), tumour stage (p< 0. 0001), multiplicity (p= 0. 01), age (p= 0. 003) and aspirin consumption (p= 0. 004), were all independent predictive factors for <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> progression.

Therefore we studied p 53 mutations in 47 bladder cancers obtained from 45 patients using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Eight out of 24 invasive tumours appeared to have a p 53 mutation, while no p 53 mutations were found in the superficial tumours. All the p 53 mutations were found in grade 3 tumours. The tumours with altered p 53 showed a higher frequency of allelic loss (FAL) than the tumours without a mutation (55. 8 % vs 21. 1 %, P < 0. 05, chi 2 test). This increase in FAL suggests a correlation between p 53 mutations and genetic instability. A significant correlation between mutated p 53 and poor survival in the whole group studied was found (P < 0. 001, log-rank test). However, within the group of muscle-invasive tumours the occurrence of p 53 mutations had no additional prognostic value.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} {{on some of the}} available biomarkers such as p 53 and its down-stream effector p 21 on superficial bladder tumor biology and their prognostic significance. The role of p 53 tumor suppressor gene is controversial in <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer,</b> possibly because analyzing one single effector of a pathway might hide the role of downstream effectors. The aggressiveness of this condition is related to proliferative activity as measured by Ki- 67. Further studies are still necessary to draw definitive conclusions about the role of these different biological markers in <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Treatment {{options for}} {{patients}} with recurrent <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> are limited, necessitating aggressive exploration of new treatment strategies that effectively prevent recurrence and progression to invasive disease. We assessed the effects of belinostat (previously PXD 101), a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, on a panel of human bladder cancer cell lines representing superficial and invasive disease, and on a transgenic mouse model of <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> Methods Growth inhibition and cell cycle distribution effect of belinostat on 5637, T 24, J 82, and RT 4 urothelial lines were assessed. Ha- ras transgenic mice with established <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> were randomized to receive either belinostat or vehicle alone, and assessed for bladder weight, hematuria, gene expression profiling, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results Belinostat had a significant linear dose-dependent growth inhibition on all cell lines (IC 50 range of 1. 0 – 10. 0 μM). The 5637 cell line, which was derived from a superficial papillary tumor, was the most sensitive to treatment. Belinostat (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, 5 days each week for 3 weeks) treated mice had less bladder weight (p WAF 1 in the belinostat-treated mice. Gene expression profile analysis revealed 56 genes significantly different in the treated group; these included the upregulation of p 21 WAF 1, induction of core histone deacetylase (HDAC), and cell communication genes. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that belinostat inhibits bladder cancer and supports the clinical evaluation of belinostat {{for the treatment of}} patients with <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the local and general side effects and obtain a better result of the treatment with intravesical instillation on the recurrent <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer,</b> we tried this method using aclacinomycin A. The subjects in this experiments were 9 cases with <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer,</b> 30 ml of 300 µg/ml of aclacinomycin. A was instilled into the bladder cavity, 2 - 3 times every week, total 8 - 16 times. The results obtained were as follows. Complete disappearance of the tumor was attained in 6 out of the 9 cases and reduction of the tumor size over 50 % in 2 out of the 9 cases. No change was observed in the remaining one case. Local side effects such as urinary frequency and pain on urination were found in 3 out of the 9 cases. The general untoward effects were not detected as judged by the examination of peripheral blood, ECG and liver-kidney function. From the results above obtained, {{it was noted that}} aclacinomycin A was effective on the recurrent <b>superficial</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> with minimum side effects when instilled intravesicaliy...|$|R
