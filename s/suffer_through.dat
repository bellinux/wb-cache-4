The Venusians played music for the audience, said Ballard, then showed the crowd a large mirror-like device that displayed images of life on Venus.

25|$|The Sixers {{started the}} 2012–13 season with high {{expectations}} {{with the help}} of Andrew Bynum and the growth of the young Sixers. However, Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, in relation to the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the Sixers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on both knees. Bynum wasn't the only Sixer to <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> injuries. On February 8, Jason Richardson also went through a season-ending knee surgery. Jrue Holiday, Thaddeus Young, Nick Young, and Royal Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes were the only Sixers to play in every game during the season. The Sixers started the season 12–9 but stumbled through a tough stretch and couldn't recover. The Sixers finished the season 34–48, missing the playoffs {{for the first time since}} Doug Collins had taken over as head coach.|$|E

500|$|The Gunningsville Bridge, which {{crosses the}} Petitcodiac River to link Moncton and Riverview, {{was built in}} 1867. It was damaged and rebuilt on four {{different}} occasions. The first was following the Saxby Gale of 1869, which forced the town to rebuild the bridge in 1872. It went under [...] "extensive repairs" [...] mid-1892, but ice build-up from the Petitcodiac continued to pose a threat for the wooden structure, leading {{to the construction of}} a new steel version from 1915 to 1919. This fourth bridge would <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> many collisions, including one with the Mayflower in September 1929, which caused the ship to capsize and drown two men. The Gunningsville Bridge would last 86 years before it would be demolished a final time, making way for a [...] four-lane bridge crossing. Covered bridges were also built over the Petitcodiac River, the final extant one being [...] "Hasty", built in 1929.|$|E
500|$|Given that Polistes exclamans nests {{are often}} {{destroyed}} or <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> {{the death of}} the queen (most often through natural circumstances), it is necessary and adaptive for there to be a specific system for the replacement of the queen. The current system in place can best “be described as gerontocracy.” [...] Furthermore, it is also closely related to the dominance system within the colony as well. In the dominance hierarchy, older individuals are higher in rank, whereas younger individuals serve in the lower ranks. These older female workers are generally more aggressive and forage more frequently. In reflection of this dominance ranking and the behavior of the female workers, it is seen that when a queen is no longer present in the colony, the next eldest worker becomes the new queen. This {{may be due to the}} genetics of the next eldest queen, as the replacement queen affects the overall relatedness of the females in the brood, thereby allowing the future brood to be more related to the adult workers rearing them.|$|E
500|$|... "Guilty" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television commentators, who praised its storylines. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a complimentary review. He {{claimed that the}} episode [...] "effectively ramped up the tension". Fowler thought that it [...] "might {{have been a bit}} too much to accept that poor Rex had to <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> yet another near-death ordeal", and that [...] "the episode itself was able to provide genuine thrills mixed with some incredible moments of tenderness". Fowler noted that Michael fully took [...] "advantage of his unique, tragic, situation by having him purposefully use one world as a source of information to help him solve a case". Stating that the episode had [...] "top-tier entertainment", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10", classifying it as [...] "great". Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic mainly enjoyed this episode. McHatton claimed that Rex's current behaviour and thoughts are [...] "understandable" [...] and [...] "heart-renching". He concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "4.7 out of 5" [...] score. Caroline Preece from Den of Geek gave praise in the episode. He thought the episode was [...] "built around a gripping premise". Preece wrote that the series is [...] "still very odd" [...] after the episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall noted many parts of the episode. Sepinwall stated that there was a [...] "notable change in feel or style" [...] from other episodes, because of different writers for the episode. He noted that [...] "the idea of the loved one getting kidnapped feels like a very big card to play this early", and that [...] "it does fit in with the theme of the show". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave less praise and enjoyment in the episode. In his [...] "B-" [...] review, he noted that the [...] "premise has been established". He stated that it is [...] "a clever device". He argued that the [...] "plotting isn't helping" [...] the episode. The Voice of TV's Mary Powers gave the episode a [...] "A-" [...] grade. She called the episode [...] "fabulous". Carl Cortez from Assignment X gave much praise in the episode. He called it a [...] "twisty/turny adventure". Cortez claimed that it [...] "feels too early and convenient" [...] for Rex to get kidnapped.|$|E

Arroyo set career highs by averaging 12.6 points and 5.0 assists per game.

2500|$|The N64 port, however, {{received}} {{criticism by}} Famitsu {{for being too}} similar to the original game.

GameSpot thought that the graphics were outdated and that apart from not having any update from the original game, some music and sound clips were lost during conversion. The PC version received a more negative review; GameSpot gave it a [...] "bad" [...] 3.6 out of 10 stating gamers would find the PlayStation port more worthwhile. Similarly to Famitsus review of the Nintendo 64 port, GameSpot complained {{about the lack of}} additions to the PC port. The PC's conversions of the cutscenes during the game were found to have a mistake which makes a character start a dialogue while another one is still talking.|$|E
2500|$|In farms using cages for egg production, {{there are}} more birds per unit area; this allows for greater {{productivity}} and lower food costs. [...] Floor space ranges upwards from 300cm2 per hen. EU standards in 2003 called for at least 550cm2 per hen. In the US, the current recommendation by the United Egg Producers is 67 to 86 in2 (430 to 560cm2) per bird. The space available to battery hens has often been described as less than {{the size of a}} piece of A4 paper. Animal welfare scientists have been critical of battery cages because they do not provide hens with sufficient space to stand, walk, flap their wings, perch, or make a nest, and it is widely considered that hens <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> boredom and frustration through being unable to perform these behaviours. [...] This can lead {{to a wide range of}} abnormal behaviours, some of which are injurious to the hens or their cagemates.|$|E

2500|$|When Martin Luther {{wrote his}} Ninety-Five Theses in 1517, Catholicism reacted {{the same way}} as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the Protestant Reformation could be [...] "crushed" [...] in Spain with [...] "a few dozen executions in the 1550s", the same {{strategy}} failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> the French Wars of Religion before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between Catholicism and [...] the new Protestant denominations was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic Pope was the Antichrist. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in Germany and Central Europe with the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and in England with the English Civil War (1641–1651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of religious toleration, freedom of religion and religious pluralism slowly gained ground in Europe. The Witch trials in Early Modern Europe, which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.|$|E

2500|$|According to Ethan Sacks New York's Daily News {{found the}} story focus [...] "more on Machiavellian {{political}} intrigue than Tolkien-esque sword and sorcery". Since Martin drew on historical sources {{to build the}} Ice and Fire world, Damien G. Walter of London's The Guardian saw a startling resemblance between Westeros and England {{in the period of}} the Wars of the Roses, where [...] "One throne unifies the land but great houses fight over who will sit upon it. With no true king the land is beset with corrupt, money-grubbing lords whose only interest is their own prestige. Two loose alliances of power pit a poor but honorable North against a rich and cunning South. And the small folk must <b>suffer</b> <b>through</b> it all, regardless of which side wins." [...] As in the Middle Ages, the characters define their alliances by their home towns or kinship, not by modern-day concepts like countries or nationalism. The king was seen as an avatar of God so that the legitimacy of kingship was very important. Martin wanted to show the possible consequences of the leaders' decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.|$|E
