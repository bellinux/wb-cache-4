Coal and Banded Hematite Jasper (BHJ) Iron ores samples were taken for the study to know the effect of <b>shock</b> <b>loading.</b> These samples were exposed to 5 electric shocks of 300 kV using an electric <b>shock</b> <b>loading</b> device. A diaphragmless shock tube was used to produce 3 and 6 compressed air shocks of Mach number 2. 12 to treat the coal and Iron ore samples. Microscopic, comminution and liberation studies were carried out to compare the effectiveness of these approaches. It was found that electric <b>shock</b> <b>loading</b> can comminute the coal samples more effectively and increases the yield of carbon by 40 % at 1. 6 gm/cc density over the untreated coal samples. Mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>loading</b> showed improved milling performance for both the materials and 12. 90 % and 8. 1 % reduction in the D- 80 of the particles was observed during grinding for treated samples of coal and iron, respectively.

40|$|Safe {{application}} of the anaerobic sequencing biofilm batch reactor (ASBBR) still depends on deeper insight into its behavior when faced with common operational problems in wastewater treatments such as tolerance to abrupt variations in influent concentration, so called <b>shock</b> <b>loads.</b> To this end the current work shows the effect of organic <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> {{on the performance of}} an ASBBR, with a useful volume of 5 L, containing 0. 5 -cm polyurethane cubes and operating at 30 degrees C with mechanical stirring of 500 rpm. In the assays 2 L of two types of synthetic wastewater were treated in 8 -h cycles. Synthetic wastewater I was based on sucrose-amide-cellulose with concentration of 500 mg COD/L and synthetic wastewater II was based on volatile acids with concentration ranging from 500 to 2000 mg COD/L. Organic <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> of 2 - 4 times the operation concentration were applied during one and two cycles. System efficiency was monitored before and after {{application of}} the perturbation. When operating with concentrations from 500 to 1000 mg COD/L and <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> of 2 - 4 times the influent concentration during one or two cycles the system was able to regain stability after one cycle and the values of organic matter, total and intermediate volatile acids, bicarbonate alkalinity and pH were similar to those prior to the perturbations. At a concentration of 2000 mg COD/L the reactor appeared to be robust, regaining removal efficiencies similar to those prior to perturbation at <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> twice the operation concentration lasting one cycle and stability was recovered after two cycles. However, for <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> twice the operation concentration during two cycles and <b>shock</b> <b>loads</b> four times the operation concentration during one or two cycles filtered sample removal efficiency decreased to levels different from those prior to perturbation, on an average of 90 - 80 %, approximately, yet the system managed to attain stability within two cycles after shock application. Therefore, this investigation envisions the potential of full scale application of this type of bioreactor which showed robustness to organic <b>shock</b> <b>loads,</b> despite discontinuous operation and the short times available for treating total wastewater volume.

50|$|Standoff {{distance}} is also intended to deter terrorists from using car bombs {{by making it}} more difficult for them to cause catastrophic damage. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, many high-risk federal buildings began enforcing standoff distances. It is based on the concept that a blast <b>shock</b> <b>load</b> is essentially a high-pressure front that moves out radially and decays very quickly - because blast falloff is thus often more exponential than linear (indeed radial - any given explosive must cover a circular-shaped area but blast power generally only increases linearly with explosive strength), any standoff distance helps increases survival chances for passersby and minimizes danger, though shrapnel mitigates this effect if present. Hydraulic roadblocks (sometimes wedge-shaped), or bollards can be raised to block approaching vehicles; these can be designed to prevent even a heavy, fast-moving truck from getting through. Jersey barriers and concrete planters have also been used to maintain separation between screened and unscreened traffic. Certain infrastructure at risk of terrorist attack, such as bridges, may not be well-suited to standoff distances since their purpose is for traffic to travel along them.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, pitches {{are often}} more complex, and multi-pitch rigging is used extensively. Long drops are broken into smaller pitches. Re-belays and {{deviations}} are used to direct the rope away from areas of sharp rock and from water. Where rope rub cannot be avoided, rope protectors are installed. Traverses are often installed to allow the rigger to reach an area where {{it is possible to}} hang the rope with no rub. Since allowing the rope to rub against the walls is prevented, lighter ropes are used, usually 8-9mm thick. This has the advantage of being lighter and therefore more economical to carry on long or deep trips. Bobbin descenders are quicker to change over at re-belays and are also lighter to carry. Deviations are short length of tape or rope pulling the main rope to one side with a carabiner which can be conveniently unclipped and replaced to allow passing. Rope-walking techniques are less effective in cases of awkward passageways and for changeovers at rebelays.Many caves have been equipped with bolt holes consisting of internally threaded metal inserts fixed into holes drilled in the rock. Subsequent visitors carry their own belay eyelets to bolt into these points. Selecting the best position for bolts needs particular care, the aim often being to achieve a 'Y' shaped rope hang between two bolts on opposite walls. This technique can help to prevent the rope from coming in contact with the rock, shares the load between the two belays, and reduces the <b>shock</b> <b>load</b> should one fail (in comparison {{with the use of a}} slack backup rope).|$|E
