50|$|Since his {{departure}} from LSU Health Sciences Center Simpkins {{has focused on}} the development of his biotechnology company, Vivacelle Bio. Vivacelle Bio was organized for the purpose of commercializing a new resuscitation fluid, developed by Dr. Simpkins, that is based on phospholipid nanoparticles. His experiments showed that this resuscitation fluid, named VBI-1, could be used safely to replace most of the circulating blood volume. His experiments, in collaboration with physicist Juan Rodriguez, also showed that this resuscitation fluid readily absorbed and released nitric oxide. Moreover, in animal experiments VBI-1 was superior to the standard, Ringer’s lactate in reversing hypovolemia after blood loss and restoring the blood pressure. VBI-1 also protected organs from reperfusion injury. Two publications resulted from this research, to date. On November 22, 2011 Simpkins was granted his first patent, US patent #8063020. This fluid is designed to promote survival after hypovolemic shock for any reason such as blood loss, massive infection, neurological injury, acute radiation injury, burns or childhood diarrhea. At this point the <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes,</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> hetastarch based colloids, albumin and hypertonic solutions have all been shown to have significant complications. In contrast, all of the components of VBI-1 are naturally occurring and/or metabolizable. To date tests have shown the safety profile of VBI-1 to be superior to all other resuscitation fluids including blood and Ringer's lactate. Since 2011 multiple US and international patents for VBI-1 and its derivatives have been granted to Dr. Simpkins.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{identified}} {{risk factors}} of surgical treatment for gastroduodenal ulcer disease in patients with liver cirrhosis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Liver cirrhosis is frequently associated with complicated peptic ulcer disease. Surgery in liver cirrhotics has a high mortality and morbidity especially when abdominal operations are performed. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients undergoing surgery for gastroduodenal ulcer disease between 1972 and 1991 were studied, retrospectively. RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients required emergency surgery for bleeding ulcer (n = 45) or perforation (n = 17). Mortality was 29 % for elective patients (n = 7), 35 % for patients with perforation and 64 % for patients with bleeding. Overall mortality of 69 patients was 54 %. Only 15 of 69 patients (22 %) had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Postoperative bleeding, septic complications, and renal failure were the most frequent postoperative complications. Bleeding and multiple organ failure were the leading causes of death in 70 % of patients. A univariate analysis determined preoperative hemoglobin < 12 g/L (p < 0. 05), systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg (p < 0. 025), prothrombin time < 60 % (p < 0. 05) {{and the presence of}} portal hypertension (p < 0. 01) as prognostic factors. No significant correlation with survival could be established for excretory liver function (serum bilirubin) and partial thromboplastin time. CONCLUSIONS: To improve treatment results it is recommended (1) to <b>substitute</b> <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> (particularly coagulation factors) early and in sufficient quantities, (2) to diligently search for and to treat septic foci and administer antibiotics in a nonrestrictive manner, and (3) to restrict the operative procedure to the treatment required for control of the ulcer complication...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{management}} of blood {{is a problem}} of specific concern for the human race. Even though there are technological developments in the field of <b>substitutes</b> for <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> the need for donor blood and its derived products will always exist. Blood is not an ordinary commodity. The supply of donor blood is fairly irregular and the demand for <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> is at least as stochastic. Matching supply and demand in an efficient manner is not straightforward. <b>Blood</b> <b>products</b> are also perishable, which complicates things even further. Shortages lead to high costs for society, since they can cause increase mortality rates. The goal of this paper is applying dynamic simulation and Taguchi method to design a robust blood supply chain system to improve the blood supply chain efficiency. The National Blood Center (NBC) in Iran has been selected as the case of study. To do the Taguchi method, four main controllable factors that are arrival rate of donors, maximum inventory level, minimum inventory level and blood delivery policy and one noise factor which is demand variable have been chosen. Based on final result, to achieve a robust blood supply chain, all main factors should be located at the high level except for factor B. This means that arrival rate of donors, maximum inventory level and blood delivery policy should be equaled to 300, 1000 and LIFO, in case, the minimum inventory level should be equaled to 70 respectively to optimize the efficiency of the blood supply chain based on the patient safety...|$|R

40|$|Summary.   In {{addition}} to the clinical management of blood supplies, the UK National Blood Service (NBS) examines short-term supply and demand to predict any potential shortages in blood supplies.

This paper describes <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> use in a United Kingdom Hospital Trust in 1999 and combines it with donor information to project the effect of demographic changes on demand and supply over the next 25 years. Overall, 2801 (4 %) inpatients received transfusions of <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The proportion of inpatients receiving <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> increased with age.

40|$|AbstractHematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) recipients are a high-risk, immunocompromised {{group of patients}} who receive frequent transfusions after transplantation. Transfusion of cytomegalovirus (CMV) -negative <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> {{has long been the}} standard of care to prevent transfusion-transmitted CMV in this patient population. Leukoreduction of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> before transfusion has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted CMV. In the era of universal leukoreduction in Canada, the need for CMV testing of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> remains unclear. We sought to identify whether there is a difference in transfusion-transmitted CMV viremia in patients receiving only leukoreduced versus CMV-negative and leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> in HSCT recipients. Patients who were CMV negative and received an allogeneic HSCT from a CMV-negative donor between October 1, 1999 and June 30, 2012 were included in the analysis. Transfusion data were collected from The Ottawa Hospital Blood Bank and Canadian Blood Services. CMV viremia was defined as PCR positivity. One hundred sixty-six patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 89 patients received an HSCT before January 2007, during the time when patients received leukoreduced and CMV-negative <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Seventy-seven patients received an HSCT after this time, receiving only leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The 2 groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, diagnosis, graft type, graft source, conditioning regimen, or ABO compatibility (P > . 05).

ResultsFifty-four patients received leukofiltered cellular <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> (transfused), whereas 17 patients received only fresh-frozen plasma (nontransfused). Among nontransfused patients, 58. 8 % (10 / 17) became sensitized during mechanical support, versus 35. 2 % of transfused patients (19 / 54, P =. 15). There was a trend toward more sensitization during the 12 weeks after device placement in nontransfused patients. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed significantly more sensitization in nontransfused patients than in transfused patients, despite equal rates of transplantation (P =. 05). A dose-response analysis revealed significant trends toward less sensitization and lower peak panel-reactive antibody level with more cellular <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> transfusions (P =. 04).
