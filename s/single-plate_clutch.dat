25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch,</b> each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|E

2500|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutches.</b> The wet clutch design is generally used for higher torque engines that can generate [...] and more (the wet multiplate clutch DCT in the Bugatti Veyron is designed to cope with [...] ), whereas the dry-clutch design is generally suitable for smaller vehicles with lower torque outputs up to [...] However, while the dry-clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet-clutch counterparts, the dry-clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, {{due to the lack}} of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing.|$|R
50|$|Both engines had a 106 mm stroke, {{meaning the}} 65 model {{measured}} 2,110 cc and the 75 model measured 2,810 cc The 75 model was predominately targeted towards export markets, given the additional £5 horse-power tax that was payable owing to its larger capacity.

5000|$|The Typ S was {{powered by}} a 4-cylinder side-valve engine of 1.57 litres, mounted ahead of the driver and {{delivering}} [...] at 2,200 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels through a <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutch</b> and a three-speed gear box controlled with centrally positioned floor-mounted gear stick.|$|R
50|$|Both series cars used an all-synchromesh 5-speed manual transmission, with an {{hydraulic}} <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutch</b> (up-sized on the 2400), and {{a limited}} slip differential.Two-litre Dinos used a transmission of Fiat's own design.

50|$|The dry <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> has a {{diameter}} of 412 mm and features torsional rubber damping. Early Kontio models were fitted with a five-speed main gearbox while the heavy-duty Jyry's came with a six speed gearbox on which the sixth gear was an overdrive. There is no synchromesh, but the gear-cog tooth ends were bevelled in order to ease shifting. An additional power output shaft, used to power additional functions such as a dumping mechanism, was available as an option.|$|E
50|$|A Speed Meteor Twenty {{version was}} {{announced}} 21 July 1932. The compression ratio was increased to 6.8 : 1, a downdraught carburettor fitted {{and an extra}} large exhaust pipe with special Pullswell silencer. Although a choice of bodywork was available this was a special sports 4-seater with air cushions (for the seats) stone guards for lamps, remote gear change control, extra large faces on the speedometer and revolution counter and Rudge-Whitworth special wire wheels. This Speed model was fitted with a <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch,</b> 4-speed gearbox with quiet third gear and a central remote control.|$|E

50|$|In the Mondial 8, QV and 3.2 models, the {{transmission}} housing {{is integral with}} the engine sump casting, albeit with its own oil supply, sitting below and slightly {{to one side of}} the main block. Drive to the gearbox is via a <b>single-plate,</b> diaphragm-spring <b>clutch</b> and a set of drop-gears located outboard of the left-hand end of the crankshaft, with output torque feeding into a friction-plate limited-slip final drive unit offset to the rear of the gearbox.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2008, another world-first [...] seven-speed DSG {{transaxle}} (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ200, parts code prefix: 0AM) became available. [...] It differs from the six-speed DSG, in that it uses two <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutches</b> (of similar diameter). This clutch pack was designed by LuK Clutch Systems, Gmbh. This seven-speed DSG is used in smaller front-wheel-drive cars with smaller-displacement engines with lower torque outputs, such as the latest Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Polo Mk5, and the new SEAT Ibiza. It has been paired to engines with up to [...] It has considerably less oil capacity than the six-speed DQ250; this new DQ200 uses just [...] of transmission fluid.|$|R
5000|$|The Maserati 350S-derived DOHC, 12-valve straight-six {{cylinder}} engine had a bore {{and stroke}} of 86 x 100 mm and displaced [...] The engine block was aluminium, with cast iron cylinder sleeves; cylinder heads were aluminium, with cast iron valve seats and hemispherical combustion chambers. It was equipped with mechanical Marelli ignition, dual ignition and dual fuel pump.It developed [...] at 5,500 rpm when fitted with three twin-choke 42 DCOE Weber carburetor, or [...] at 5,500 rpm with Lucas mechanical fuel injection.The transmission was a 4-speed ZF S4-17 gearbox, later replaced by a ZF S5-17 5-speed, and used an hydraulically actuated Borg & Beck <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> in a housing between the primary chaincase and the gearbox. Mounted {{on the end of}} the gearbox mainshaft (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber.|$|E
50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} feature of the new Leyland buses was the engine; it was a six-cylinder overhead-camshaft petrol engine of 6.8 litres displacement, developing between 90-98 bhp at up to 2,200 rpm. Other drive-line features were a <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> driving into a four-speed sliding-mesh gearbox; these were mounted as a unit with the engine. The drive-line featured subtle inclination of engine and transmission, allowing straight drive shafts into the underslung worm-wheel single-reduction rear axle - which had the differential offset to the offside to reduce gangway floor height on the lower deck. Vacuum-servo brakes on all four wheels were standard between Tiger and Titan, but the Titan had a near right-angle drop in its frame after the rearmost spring-mounting to provide a low passenger entry platform.|$|E
5000|$|In all models, the 198 cc {{overhead}} valve four-stroke engine was mounted in a pressed-steel frame.It featured both sump oil and forced-feed lubrication {{provided by a}} geared oil pump, was coupled through a <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutch</b> to a three-speed gearbox, giving {{a top speed of}} 95 km/h. It also used drum brakes, like the larger twin of the BMW range. Power output was rated at , until the introduction of the British Amal carburetor, boosting the power output to [...] The coil electrical ignition system and the generator were supplied by Bosch. [...] The engine was offset toward the right of the frame, to allow it to drive the rear wheel directly when in top gear.|$|R
2500|$|A second {{variant of}} the DSG went into series {{production}} in 2008—the DQ200. [...] This unit has seven forward ratios, but the notable difference over the original DQ250 is the change from wet to dry clutches. This variant uses two <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutches,</b> arranged in a tandem design (instead of concentrically) and therefore similar in size. The DQ200 is again for use in transverse applications, but is intended for use in smaller cars, with smaller-displacement engines that generate relatively low torque outputs. [...] When used in the latest Golf with the [...] engine, this new seven-speed DSG uses roughly 6% (5.9l/100km for the seven-speed DSG compared to 6.3l/100km with the six-speed manual gearbox) less fuel than the same engine with a manual transmission and up to 20% less than a conventional automatic transmission. [...] The original DQ250 also remains available.|$|R
50|$|The Merak's V6 engine {{descended from}} the 2.7 L Tipo C.114 {{originally}} designed by Giulio Alfieri in 1967 {{for use in the}} Citroën SM, that was bored out to 91.6 mm (piston stroke remained 75 mm) to displace 2965 cc L.It was a chain-driven double overhead camshaft, 12-valve unit featuring an unusual 90° angle between the cylinder banks. The lubrication system used a wet sump and an oil cooler.This V6 did not end its days on the Merak: it was later modified and made into the first ever production twin-turbocharged engine in the Biturbo, ending its career in the 1990s Ghibli after reaching the highest specific output of any production engine at the time.The powerplant was mounted longitudinally behind the passenger compartment, and joined through a <b>single-plate</b> dry <b>clutch</b> to a 5-speed, all syncromesh Citroën transaxle gearbox and a limited-slip differential.|$|R
5000|$|The 12/50 was {{redesigned}} for the 1926 model year. From Autumn 1925 a new stronger chassis {{was used}} for the TE, which had its engine (now built around a redesigned crankcase) enlarged again to 1645 cc, and the TF of the same year with a short stroke version of the same engine, displacing 1496 cc. A <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> replaced the previous cone type, and for these and all subsequent 12/50s the engine was bolted directly to the chassis, dispensing with the subframe of previous models. From the TE and TF models onwards four-wheel brakes were fitted as standard. The TE and was superseded for the 1927 model year by the TG. Confusingly, the short-stroke TF was replaced in the 1927 range by a car with an 'S' prefix: the SD.|$|E
5000|$|The Leyland Royal Tiger was an underfloor-engined heavyweight {{single deck}} {{bus or coach}} chassis, and sold well in the United Kingdom and {{overseas}} from launch. [...] "Overseas" [...] versions differed greatly from home market models. Upon launch in 1950 this was the fourth new marque of post-war Leyland single deck bus chassis since 1945. It used the same units as the Leyland-MCW Olympic but with a substantial steel ladder-frame chassis generally straight in elevation but with an up-sweep over the rear axle, to which operators could fit a coach-built body of their choice with the passenger floor about 3 ft above the road surface. The flexibly-mounted Leyland 0.600H horizontal engine was mounted {{in the middle of}} the chassis frame, driving back through a unit mounted <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> and four-speed gearbox with synchromesh on second, third, and top, or later only on third and top, to a spiral-bevel rear axle. Steering was unassisted Marles cam and double roller, all component assemblies (save for some special export orders) were built by Leyland and were proven, having been previously used in the Tiger PS2 and/or Olympic.|$|E
50|$|Four {{variants}} {{were coded}} and three produced, {{all had a}} 18 ft wheelbase for a nominal bodied length of 30 ft, with width of 8 ft and a height of 13 ft unladen. LR1 had a fluid coupling behind the engine {{and in front of}} the step-down gearbox, which joined to a drive shaft under the entry step, whilst on the nearside, aft of the front-entrance position, a four-speed Pneumocyclic semi-automatic transmission was fitted with drive then continued alongside the nearside frame-member to the driving head of the axle. The LR3 had a <b>single-plate</b> <b>clutch</b> and a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on third and top. Both of these had rear semi-elliptic leaf springs; whilst the LR7 was as the LR3, but with rear air suspension designed to provide a constant height (nearly two inches (5 cm) lower than the unladen height of the steel-sprung examples) regardless of loading, an equivalent model with semi-automatic transmission and air suspension was coded LR5 but none were ordered. Albion gave all its forward-control models odd model numbers: no one was proposing a bonnet-type double decker in the UK in 1961.|$|E

5000|$|The {{frame was}} {{slightly}} wider {{than that of}} the longest MR7L Claymore but the wheelbase was identical and the radiator was mounted in an inclined position above the front axle, to obviate intrusion into the passenger gangway. Wider and longer springs were fitted and the axles were of wider tack, suitable for 8 ft wide bodies. Like the MR 5 and 7 Claymore the 3.83-litre EN219 developing [...] at 2200 rpm drove through an Albion <b>single-plate</b> hydraulically assisted <b>clutch</b> and Albion four-speed constant-mesh gearbox, with synchromesh on third and top, to an Albion overhead worm rear axle, the Nimbus rear axle was heavier-duty {{than that of the}} heaviest Claymore and had larger brakes.
