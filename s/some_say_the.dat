25|$|In Athens {{there were}} three great public gymnasia: the Academy, the Lyceum and the Cynosarges, each of which was {{dedicated}} to a deity whose statue adorned the structure.

25|$|However, the aye-aye {{is often}} viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight.

The Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's aorta.|$|E
25|$|Beginners {{often make}} the mistake of not {{relaxing}} the arm during the recovery and of moving the hand too high and too far away from the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often forget to use their shoulders to let the hand enter as far forward as possible. <b>Some</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely bent down, giving thrust right from the start. At the beginning of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.|$|E

Kadeer has alleged that there were agents provocateurs among the crowds. Others claim that the protesters initiated the violence; for example, an Uyghur eyewitness cited by The New York Times said protesters began throwing rocks at the police. The government's official line was that the violence was not only initiated by the protesters, but also had been premeditated and coordinated by Uyghur separatists abroad. The local public security bureau said it found evidence that many Uyghurs had travelled from other cities to gather for the riot, and that they had begun preparing weapons two or three days before the riot.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} date claimed {{for the existence}} of the Roper steam velocipede is 1867, but <b>some</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> Michaux-Perreaux also could have been made in 1867. Motorcycling historians Charles M. Falco and David Burgess-Wise, and Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr date the Roper later, to 1868, and the Owls Head museum's example is of that year. The AMA Hall of Fame and motoring author Mick Walker put Roper's steam velocipede at 1869, in accordance with the date of the machine in the Smithsonian. Cycle Worlds Alan Girdler dates both at 1868, while Mick Walker also declares a tie, but in the year 1869. Classic Bike editor Hugo Wilson says the existence of an 1869 patent for the Michaux-Perreaux gives it [...] "the better claim to 'first'", even though the Roper was built around the same time. Though Sylvester Roper took out a number of patents for firearms, industrial machinery and other inventions, he did not obtain patents for any of his steam cycles or cars.|$|E

500|$|Go Man Go was {{inducted}} into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1990. A further honor was the naming of a stakes race after him, the Grade I Go Man Go Handicap run in September at Los Alamitos. Walt Wiggins, a racing commentator and author, said of Go Man Go: [...] "He was a brilliant speedhorse, <b>some</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> fastest ever. He was wild and reckless, a rogue at first, and often a clown who seldom saw the uniqueness of his talents or the seriousness of his commission. He had intrinsic greatness and couldn't care less." [...] Dan Essary, who was Director of Racing for the AQHA for many years, described Go Man Go's impact on the Quarter Horse breed as [...] "He was to Quarter Horse racing what Babe Ruth was to baseball, what Ben Hogan was to Golf and what Man o'War was to Thoroughbred racing. Horses may have run faster and horses have earned more money, but the fame of Go Man Go lingers." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rice Owls and Texas met in 2005for the 88thtime. Texas held a 65–21–1lead in the series, {{which began}} in 1914. For the Longhorns this series ranks fourth in number of games played, behind Texas A, Oklahoma, and Baylor. The two schools were once conference foes in the Southwest Conference and have {{maintained}} a rivalry {{despite the fact that}} Texas enjoys a sizable lead in the series. President John F. Kennedy alluded to the lopsidedness of the rivalry in his 1962 speech on America's space program: [...] "But why, <b>some</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> moon? ... And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?... We choose to go to the moon... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." [...] In addition to continuing a traditional rivalry, playing Rice in a home and away series allows for Texas to play games in Houston, Texas, an important recruiting base for UT, which has a significant Texas Exes alumni population.|$|E
