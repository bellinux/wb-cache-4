40|$|This opportune {{case study}} {{describes}} visual and stepping behaviours of an 87 year old female (P 8), both prior to, and following two falls. Before falling, {{when asked to}} walk along a path containing two <b>stepping</b> <b>guides</b> positioned before and after an obstacle, P 8 generally visually fixated the first <b>stepping</b> <b>guide</b> until after foot contact inside it. However, after falling P 8 consistently looked away from the <b>stepping</b> <b>guide</b> before completing the step into {{it in order to}} fixate the upcoming obstacle in her path. The timing of gaze redirection away from the target (in relation to foot contact inside it) correlated with absolute stepping error. No differences in eyesight, cognitive function, or balance were found between pre- and postfall recordings. However, P 8 did report large increases in fall-related anxiety and reduced balance confidence, supporting previously suggested links between anxiety/increased fear or falling and maladaptive visual/stepping behaviours. The results represent a novel insight into how psychological and related behavioural factors can change in older adults following a fall, and provide a possible partial rationalisation for why recent fallers are more likely to fall again in the following 12 months. These findings highlight novel possibilities for falls prevention and rehabilitation...|$|R
