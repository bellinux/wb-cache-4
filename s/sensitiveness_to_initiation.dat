40|$|Etological and {{physiological}} tests were realized on 48 horses. There were observed following activities: spontaneous kinetic activity, voice display; the elimination behavior (excretion and urination) and motionless standing. The horses {{were observed in}} 40 minute periods during the morning hours. The horses were classed into the following groups: EHB+ - crossing more than 220 sq. per 40 min. (high <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> stress), EHB+/- - crossing 131 - 220 sq. per 40 min. (mean <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> stress), EHB- - crossing 130 and less sq. per 40 min. (low <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> stress). After the evaluating of mineral, energetic, lipid, nitrogen, and enzymatic profile of sport horses there were not observed significant differences from the reference values...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} was to study the relationship of tuberculin skin <b>sensitiveness</b> 1 <b>to</b> antibody formation {{and their relationship to}} the tuberculous infection. The plan of the experiments was to infect rabbits with bovine tubercle bacilli, test their <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> intracutaneous injections of tuberculin, and determine the antibody contents of their blood at weekly intervals throughout the course of the disease...|$|R

Yet the man's <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> any change {{immediately}} manifested itself when he won the first large stake. His radiance returned and also his vanity.|$|R
60|$|That early {{world was}} a world of strong tides and currents. An incessant {{destruction}} of individuals must {{have been going on}} through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and sun. Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on, every tendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate desiccation. From the very earliest any tendency <b>to</b> <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and any <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> light would assist it to struggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.|$|R
6000|$|Even Mary Louise was {{surprised}} at the array of eatables. It was a veritable feast. But without comment she made the tea, the water being already boiling, and seating Ingua opposite her at the table she served the child as liberally as she dared, bearing in mind her <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> [...] "charity." ...|$|R
60|$|A tendril {{does not}} long retain its {{revolving}} power; {{and as soon}} as this is lost, it bends downwards and contracts spirally. After the revolving movement has ceased, the tip still retains for a short time its <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> contact, but this can be of little or no use to the plant.|$|R
60|$|M. Paul Emanuel owned {{an acute}} <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> the {{annoyance}} of interruption, from whatsoever cause occurring, during his lessons: {{to pass through}} the classe under such circumstances was considered by the teachers and pupils of the school, individually and collectively, to be as much as a woman's or girl's life was worth.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe ASSET project (ASsessing <b>SEnsitiveness</b> <b>to</b> Transport) has {{developed}} a GIS–based Web–tool using a map database to depict spatial indicators of transport and related pressures and maps on <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> transport activities. Among the indicators of sensitiveness used in the project there are Human health indicators: impacts due to noise, air pollution and higher concentration levels in cities and valleys. Ecosystem sensitivity indicators: Analysis of habitat sensitivity, landscape fragmentation and configuration of ecosystems. Indication of sensitive areas indicators in terms of scenic landscapes and impacts from tourism. The mapping of transport sensitive areas in Europe can allow for the identification and prioritization of critical sustainability issues geared {{to the development of}} the TEN–T network. Furthermore, volumes generated by transport models like TRANSTOOLS for actual situation and scenarios can be confronted with the sensitivity of the areas they cross...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} there a week--an idle week, spent in {{listless}} outlook for employment; a full week in my eager absorption of the strange life around me and a photographic <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> certain scenes and incidents of those days, which start out of my memory to-day as freshly as the day they impressed me.|$|R
60|$|Many, many thanks! It is only my neuralgic foot. It {{has given}} me such a sharp twist this time that I have not been able, in its extreme <b>sensitiveness,</b> <b>to</b> put any {{covering}} upon it except scalding fomentations. Having viciously bubbled and blistered it in all directions, I hope it now begins to see the folly of its ways.|$|R

5000|$|Finally, Hooke (1935: 176) called Archetypal Patterns in Poetry, [...] "a {{distinguished}} book; {{distinguished by}} acute reasoning, wide and deep learning, {{and a fine}} <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> poetic values. It is a courageous and, to a great extent, successful attempt to apply the technique of analytical psychology to the cloudy and elusive emotional patterns brought up into consciousness by the magic of great poetry.” ...|$|R
500|$|The critic Peter Latham {{remarked that}} he was {{surprised}} that Bax had never set any of Yeats's poems to music. Bax replied, [...] "What, I? I should never dare!". Latham added that Bax's <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> poetic values made him [...] "painfully aware of the violence that even the best musical setting must do to a poem". Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song-writing completely.|$|R
60|$|As {{he wandered}} he chanced to see Miss Price sitting by herself on a bench. He hesitated, for {{he did not}} at that moment want to see anyone, and her uncouth way seemed out of place amid the {{happiness}} he felt around him; but he had divined her <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> affront, and since {{she had seen him}} thought it would be polite to speak to her.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Chickerel, in deploring {{the risks}} of their present {{speculative}} mode of life, was far from imagining that signs of the foul future so much dreaded were actually apparent to Ethelberta {{at the time the}} lament was spoken. Hence the daughter's uncommon <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> prophecy. It was as if a dead-reckoner poring over his chart should predict breakers ahead to one who already beheld them.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the classical methods used to solve the Euler equations. Special attention {{is devoted to the}} iterative method based on a contraction mapping derived from these equations in Maldonado and Moreira (2003). We test the numerical robustness of this method when it is used in models with <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> initial conditions. Finally we extend the method to the case of stochastic Euler equations...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new Centralized Blind Multiuser Detector (MUD) {{based on}} the {{introduction}} of an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) matrix into {{the structure of the}} Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) is proposed. This approach palliates one of the main problems of the BSS/ICA algorithms, their <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> noise, and exploits the matrix structure of the blind centralized MMSE MUD. This novel solution is successfully applied to the multiuser synchronous CDMA channel. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of maximum Lempel-Ziv complexity strings are studied for the binary case. A comparison between MLZs and random strings is carried out. The length profile of both type of sequences show different distribution functions. The non-stationary {{character of the}} MLZs are discussed. The issue of <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> noise is also addressed. An empirical ansatz is found that fits well to the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the MLZs for all lengths up to $ 10 ^ 6 $ symbols...|$|R
60|$|All breathed freer {{when the}} wail ceased, {{relaxing}} to their former lounging positions around the fire. An impenetrable wall of blackness circled the pale space lighted by the camp-fire; and this circle contained the dark, somber {{group of men}} in the center, the dying camp-fire, and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on the outer edge. The horses scarcely moved from their tracks, and their erect, alert heads attested <b>to</b> their <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> the peculiarities of the night.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{preconditioning}} the pseudospectral Chebyshev approximation of an elliptic operator is considered. The numerical <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> {{variations of the}} coefficients of the operator are investigated for two classes of preconditioning matrices: one arising from finite differences, the other from finite elements. The preconditioned system is solved by a conjugate gradient type method, and by a Dufort-Frankel method with dynamical parameters. The methods are compared on some test problems with the Richardson method and with the minimal residual Richardson method...|$|R

Three minute pointed {{processes}} or filaments, placed triangularly, project from the upper surfaces of both; but I have seen two leaves with four filaments on each side, and another with only two. These filaments are remarkable from their extreme <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> a touch, as shown not by their own movement, but by that of the lobes. The margins of the leaf are prolonged into sharp rigid projections which I will call spikes, into each of which a bundle ...|$|R
6000|$|Such is the {{philosophy}} of Wordsworth's nature poetry. If we search now for his philosophy of human life, we shall find four more doctrines, which rest upon his basal conception that man is not apart from nature, but is the very [...] "life of her life." [...] (1) In childhood man is sensitive as a wind harp to all natural influences; he is an epitome of the gladness and beauty of the world. Wordsworth explains this gladness and this <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> nature by the doctrine that the child comes straight from the Creator of nature: ...|$|R
60|$|He spoke quietly, almost sadly. The terrible {{conviction}} {{of the supernatural}} origin of the dream, from which {{he had tried to}} escape, had possessed itself of him again. All his interest in the argument was at an end; all his <b>sensitiveness</b> <b>to</b> its irritating influences was gone. In the case of any other man, Mr. Hawbury would have been mollified by such a concession as his adversary had now made to him; but he disliked Midwinter too cordially to leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of an opinion of his own.|$|R

But he could as easily have changed a clear sky by looking at it in surprise, as affect her.|$|R
