5|$|Pokémon Channel was {{developed}} by Nintendo subsidiary Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. It was created both {{to serve as a}} spiritual successor to Hey You, Pikachu!—a similar digital pet-type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader peripheral device. The game included three e-Reader-compatible cards, but not the e-Reader device itself. When <b>scanned,</b> <b>the</b> cards upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique.|$|E
5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took the elevator to the top floor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. Living up to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E

5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can {{be carried}} out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with special limitations. The Fog of War environmental effect is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when <b>scanned,</b> <b>the</b> character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> BMW's license plate on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E

40|$|A new general {{algorithm}} for computing distance transforms {{of digital}} images is presented. The algorithm {{consists of two}} phases. Both phases consist of two scans, a forward and a backward <b>scan.</b> <b>The</b> first phase <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> image column-wise, while <b>the</b> second phase <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> image row-wise. Since the computation per row (column) is independent of the computation of other rows (columns), the algorithm can be easily parallelized on shared memory computers. The algorithm {{can be used for}} the computation of the exact Euclidean, Manhattan (L 1 norm), and chessboard distance (L ∞ norm) transforms. ...|$|R

5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being <b>scanned.</b> <b>The</b> standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with ground based detection of satellites.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train coming to rest in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E

25|$|A 17-year-old Finn {{was accused}} of {{attempted}} computer break-in by a major Finnish bank. On April 9, 2003, {{he was convicted of}} the charge by the Supreme Court of Finland and ordered to pay US$12,000 for the expense of the forensic analysis made by the bank.

25|$|What {{remained}} now was {{the development}} of a suitable system for delaying the signal on demand, thereby allowing the direction of the beam to be <b>scanned.</b> <b>The</b> key problem was to change the speed of the signal on demand so the phase could be adjusted. After several concepts, the team finally settled on a wave-guide consisting of two parallel plates with overlapping barriers on the vertical sides (the front and back of the wave-guide). By mechanically varying the spacing between the two plates, the speed of propagation along the waveguide changed, and steering was achieved.|$|E

50|$|Consider, for example, {{antivirus}} software installed on a Microsoft Windows machine. The solution has two pieces: a service, which monitors and scans every file {{when it is}} opened, and a manual scanner, which <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> file system when a user requests it. Under normal conditions <b>the</b> service should <b>scan</b> <b>the</b> system occasionally. However, if a user requests a manual <b>scan,</b> <b>the</b> service must stop temporarily to let the manual scanner work, otherwise every file would be <b>scanned</b> twice: by <b>the</b> manual scanner and by the service. To solve this problem the vendor chooses to implement an event based synchronization mechanism, where the service keeps a named event opened and checks it whenever a file is opened. If the event is unset <b>the</b> file is <b>scanned,</b> otherwise it is ignored. The manual scanner, then, to operate, opens the named event, sets it before <b>scanning</b> (disabling <b>the</b> service), <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> file system and resets the event back when finished. This design is prone to a squatting attack because a malicious program can set the named event and disable the service completely.|$|R
50|$|The Tech Herald, which tested Norton Internet Security 2009, found Insight {{affected}} {{system performance}} while whitelisting files.

25|$|The French fleet soon appeared, but Ribault faltered. Had he landed, {{success was}} possible; a way was open for retreat by {{land and water}} to his fort on the St. Johns. However, he chose to stand off. Menéndez, a more practiced seaman, {{saw that he had}} an advantage; he had <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> sky for weather signs, and knew that a norther was coming. The French fleet would be swept before it and perhaps be wrecked, or {{escaping}} that, be driven so far that days would elapse before Ribault could make an attack.|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{are noted}} for their large brain size {{relative}} to body size, {{compared to other}} animal groups. Recent {{findings suggest that the}} first brain area to expand was that involved in smell. Scientists <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> skulls of early mammal species dating back to 190–200 million years ago and compared the brain case shapes to earlier pre-mammal species; they found that the brain area involved in the sense of smell was the first to enlarge. This change may have allowed these early mammals to hunt insects at night when dinosaurs were not active.|$|E
25|$|He was {{concerned}} because Mallory and Irvine {{seemed to be}} five hours behind their schedule. After this sighting, Odell continued on to Camp VI where he found the tent in chaotic disorder. At 2p.m. an intense snow squall began. Odell {{went out in the}} squall hoping to signal the two climbers who he believed would by now be descending. He whistled and shouted, hoping to lead them back to the tent, but gave up because of the intense cold. Odell holed up in C-VI until the squall ended at 4pm. He then <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> mountain for Mallory and Irvine but saw no one.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{to obtain}} an accurate representation of the far-field emissions starting from a finite planar <b>scan</b> of <b>the</b> magnetic near-field is proposed. The algorithm introduces so-called auxiliary sources that compensate for the finite size of <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> area. While previous works typically introduce equivalent sources to represent the fields inside <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area, <b>the</b> auxiliary sources introduced in this paper approximate the fields outside of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area. <b>The</b> auxiliary sources are located within the pcb under <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area at <b>the</b> locations where <b>the</b> <b>scanned</b> field strengths are above a pre-chosen threshold. Their complex values are chosen such that they accurately represent the fields {{at the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> area. Several numerical examples show that the application of these auxiliary sources considerably improves the accuracy of the obtained far-field. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Brody died, as did five {{passengers}} {{aboard the}} train. The lead car caught fire and was eventually destroyed. Damage {{was estimated at}} $3.7million. Passengers who escaped or were evacuated and were not injured were taken to a nearby climbing gym called The Cliffs, where {{they were able to}} stay warm until buses arrived. Nine passengers were taken to Westchester Medical Center, with one of them in very serious condition. A police helicopter with thermal imaging equipment <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> nearby Kensico Cemetery in search of survivors who might have wandered away from the scene and collapsed into the snow, but found none. There were a total of six deaths and fifteen injuries.|$|E
25|$|As Abosso {{settled in}} the water, she {{temporarily}} righted herself, her crew got her emergency generator working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo {{from one of her}} stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the débris area, and <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 liferafts afloat and occupied.

25|$|Waitrose {{offers a}} {{self-service}} system known as 'Quick Check'. Customers must register {{as a member}} of myWaitrose, and then insert their myWaitrose card. They are then automatically issued with a hand-held PDA with built-in barcode scanner, allowing them to scan and pack items as they are taken from the shelf. Loose items from the fresh produce and bakery departments can be weighed at self-service scales, producing a barcode label which can then be <b>scanned.</b> <b>The</b> customer then pays for their shopping at a dedicated self-service checkout by scanning a terminating barcode and recalling the transaction by swiping their registered card. A Partner is summoned when necessary in order to authorise the customer's age for age-restricted items and to help scan any problematic items. The customer can then pay as they would normally.|$|E
