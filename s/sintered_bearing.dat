40|$|<b>Sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are widely}} used as machine {{elements}} due to their low costs in combination with a stable tribological performance. Given the current and future challenge of global conservation of energy and reliability of mechanically systems, the increase of energy efficiency of <b>sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> would have strong effect due to the tremendous number of mechanical devices. The approach of this investigation {{is to develop a}} complete system consisting of a lubricant, which is adapted for an optimized sliding bearing. Friction tests with a rotating ball-on- 3 -plates tribometer (µ~ 0. 005) and an application oriented component test (µ~ 0. 01) show that extremely low friction values can be realized using a liquid-crystalline lubricant in contrast to standard oils...|$|R

50|$|Like {{his successors}} after him, the company founder Ludwig Schunk {{endeavored}} {{to expand and}} shore up his company through diversification into related fields of technology. To that end, he in 1923 acquired a carbon brush holder factory and integrated it into his operations in Heuchelheim. In 1932 the production of <b>sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> was started. The carbon orientation had already previously been expanded with products for mechanical applications. The increasingly difficult economic environment could not prevent Ludwig Schunk's life work from advancing. As the Reichsmark lost ever more of its value and the concomitant heavy inflation increased as well, Schunk successfully sought new sales markets abroad from which stable currency flowed in. By boosting his export business he succeeded in avoiding losses of real assets for his company.|$|R
5000|$|Self-lubricating plain {{bearings}} have a lubricant {{contained within}} the bearing walls. There are many forms of self-lubricating bearings. The first, and most common, are <b>sintered</b> metal <b>bearings,</b> which have porous walls. The porous walls draw oil in via capillary action and release the oil when pressure or heat is applied. An example of a <b>sintered</b> metal <b>bearing</b> in action {{can be seen in}} self-lubricating chains, which require no additional lubrication during operation. Another form is a solid one-piece metal bushing with a [...] groove channel on the inner diameter that is filled with graphite. A similar bearing replaces the figure eight groove with holes plugged with graphite. This lubricates the bearing inside and out. The last form is a plastic bearing, which has the lubricant molded into the bearing. The lubricant is released as the bearing is run in.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new microgeared-motor {{assembled}} by Ni-based metallic glasses (MGs) bearing was constructed. The durability of the microgeared-motor improved about 4 {{times longer than}} that of the microgeared-motor {{assembled by}} the <b>sintered</b> alloy <b>bearing.</b> As compared with that of the <b>sintered</b> alloy <b>bearing,</b> higher hardness of Ni-based MG encourages excellent wear resistance of bearing. In order to clarify the relation between hardness and wear resistance of MG bearings, we conducted wear tests for the conventional sintered alloy, Zr-, Ni-, and Fe-based MG bearings. As a result, {{it was found that the}} worn loss in volume were 2. 7 %, 1. 8 %, 0. 2 %, and 0. 0 % for the sintered alloy, Zr-based MG, Ni-based MG and Fe-based MG, respectively. This result suggests that the wear resistance of bearings is mainly dominated by hardness. The wear mechanism of MG bearing will be also discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{incredible}} growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo {{set up a}} joint venture with INA Wälzlager Schaeffler called NTN Wälzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA Wälzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of pillow block bearings. One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type constant-velocity universal joints. They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated constant-velocity joints in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil-impregnated <b>sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada.|$|R

In 1932 sinter metal production was started with <b>sintering</b> <b>bearings.</b> After the death of Ludwig Schunk in 1947, the estate of the founder, who had not had any children, passed to the [...] "Providential Fund" [...] of Schunk+Ebe oHG. In 1948 and 1949 a construction program was set up to expand the operation from 500 to 1200 employees. There followed in 1956 the incorporation of Schunk & Ebe S.A. in Brussels, the first foreign subsidiary. At present, Schunk is represented in Europe with 46 operating companies. In 1957 Schunk Electro Carbón S.A. de C.V. was incorporated in Mexico, becoming the first company on the American continent.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years the iron base <b>sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> {{production}} was considerable increased {{at the expense of}} the copper based ones, due to the low cost and availability of the iron powders as well as the higher strength. The mechanical properties of a part are strongly related to the composition of the materials. For tribological applications, the properties of the surface are related to the different metallic and intermetallic phases formed in the material. The friction nature of the bearing type couple having the bearing bush made from sintered material is a function of pores size, applied load, velocity, temperature, the quality and quantity of the stored oil and can appear as hydrodynamic, mixed and limit friction. The tribological features of the selected iron-copper based materials have been studied using an experimental device for wear testing of the sliding bearings. The friction coefficient and wear resistance have been analyzed in dry friction conditions. The influence of the applied load and p x v values on the friction coefficient was studied. Also, the dependence of the functioning time until the failure of the bearing (seizing) with the friction coefficient for the applied forces was analyzed...|$|R
50|$|As with {{standard}} roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, outer plates, pins, bushes, and rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal bushes. Sintered-metal self-lubricating bearings {{are based on}} powder-metallurgy technology. They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances.Specifically, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, then compacted to form the bushing. The initial compaction {{to a large degree}} dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.The bushings are then sintered.Sintered materials have inherent porosity and the presence of pores have both beneficial and detrimental role on the part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility. However, the presence of pores acts also contribute to the reduction in noise and vibration also serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. <b>Sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> and gears are also used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface. The rate of oil supply automatically increases with temperature and, therefore, with increasing speeds of rotation, to achieve optimum working conditions.|$|R

50|$|While {{some of the}} {{earliest}} self-lubricating bearings were developed by Chrysler {{the earliest}} self-lubricating chains were bushed chains, which consisted of pins, plates, and sintered bushes. The loss in strength of the bush required it to be made extra thick. This made the outer diameter so large that it did not allow enough room for a roller. These bushed chains suffer from the drawback of lower allowable load and tensile strength compared to regular roller chain, and the outer diameter of the bushes do not rotate when engaging a sprocket and may suffer faster wear and damage. While various chain manufacturers offered self-lubricating bushed chain designs based on sintered-bush technology since the 1950s, the world's first self-lubricating roller chain was developed and launched by a Japanese chain manufacturer in 1988. After they made further improvements to the oil impregnation and sintering technologies, they received a patent for their lube-free roller chain, as evidenced by Patent #JP20070237969. In the new design, advancements in powder metal bush technology allowed engineers to design a bush that had a smaller diameter yet was stronger, which allowed room for rollers. These rollers improved performance by allowing the chain to articulate more smoothly into sprockets and protect the sintered bushes. Because of these advancements, the self-lubrication style chains achieved strength on par with regular roller chain, with the added benefit of being lube-free. Powdered metal <b>sintered</b> <b>bearings</b> (in the case of roller chain, the bushes) are self-lubricating because their porosity is impregnated with lubricants during the manufacturing process. In use, frictional heat causes the lubricant to expand and flow out of the pores, forming a film between mating parts. Low coefficients of friction, minimal maintenance and trouble-free service life, low cost, and simple installation are the chief advantages of powdered metal bearings.|$|R

Tests were conducted under dry and starved lubrication sliding conditions in air at room temperature. Although porous structure acts as crack initiation sites thus limiting the wear resistance of sintered iron in dry sliding conditions under high contact stresses, {{it is believed}} to be beneficial in lubricated sliding conditions as it absorbs a large amount of lubricant. Wear tests without lubrication show that these pores are completely filled by abrasive particles in the initial stages of the test and no longer maintain their oil absorption capability. Initial results show that oxidation of frictional surfaces by flash temperature in dry conditions reduces weight loss volume by decreasing the coefficient of friction...|$|R

5000|$|Sealed {{ball joints}} {{do not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most ball joints had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed ball joints to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all ball joints on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed ball joints to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate <b>sintered</b> metal <b>bearings</b> which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R
