Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, [...] "So {{as you can}} tell, I'm very outgoing {{and a little bit}} shy, but I've decided that this song is just too short. It's such a beautiful Christmas song but it's only one verse, so I added an extra one." [...] "You and I" [...] is devoid of the musical arrangements from the version in Born This Way, and features instrumentation from a piano and a trumpet, which is played halfway through the song. From time to time, Gaga shouts the word [...] "America" [...] while singing the song. Her acoustic version of [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] begins with a monologue, explaining her dedication of the song to her grandfather: [...] "It's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and I wrote this song about him, <b>so</b> <b>here</b> it is. So Grandma, if you're watching at home, this one's for you." [...] Following the first chorus, Gaga stops playing her piano and tells a story about Italian cookies. A recurring theme for the songs is Gaga stopping midway through singing to engage in conversation with the listeners.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... <b>So</b> <b>here</b> I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E
500|$|Cantor's {{first ten}} papers were on number theory, his thesis topic. At the {{suggestion}} of Eduard Heine, the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to analysis. Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Rudolf Lipschitz, Bernhard Riemann, and Heine himself: {{the uniqueness of the}} representation of a function by trigonometric series. Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices n in the nth derived set S'n of a set S of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with S as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had S1 as its set of zeros, where S1 is the set of limit points of S. If S'k+1 is the set of limit points of S'k, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are S'k+1. Because the sets S'k were closed, they contained their Limit points, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets S, S1, S2, S3,... formed a limit set, which we would now call S'ω, and then he noticed that Sω would also have to have a set of limit points Sω+1, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and <b>so</b> <b>here</b> was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ω, ω+1, ω+2, ...|$|E

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} last season and I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. There comes a time when you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out <b>so</b> <b>here</b> we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E
