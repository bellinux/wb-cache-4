5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42England's highest opening {{partnership}} of the seriesbefore the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips {{and was out}} for 13. Soon after, Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the cordon and England were 2/52. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may have hit a bump ball into the ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen made steady progress on a <b>seaming</b> pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 20 series lead.|$|E
25|$|The {{process for}} both hemming and <b>seaming</b> are the same, {{except that the}} tonnage {{requirement}} is greater for <b>seaming.</b> The process starts by bending the edge to an acute angle. A flattening die is then used to flatten the hem.|$|E
25|$|Hemming and <b>seaming</b> are two similar {{metalworking}} {{processes in}} which a sheet metal edge is rolled over onto itself. Hemming is the {{process in which the}} edge is rolled flush to itself, while a seam joins the edges of two materials.|$|E
50|$|There are {{at least}} six coal <b>seams</b> in the {{vicinity}} of the Carbondale Mine fire. The major <b>seams</b> in the area include the Grassy <b>seam,</b> the New County <b>seam,</b> the Clark <b>seam,</b> the Dunmore <b>Seam</b> #1, the Dunmore <b>Seam</b> #2, and the Dunmore <b>Seam</b> #3.|$|R
50|$|By {{this time}} the shafts at Wheldale had six insets: Warren House <b>seam</b> at 183m, Haigh Moor <b>seam</b> at 258m, Flockton Thick <b>seam</b> at 346m, Middleton Little <b>seam</b> at 400m, Silkstone <b>seam</b> at 436m and Beeston <b>seam</b> at 516m.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal lockstitch, construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching. <b>Seam</b> types include the plain <b>seam,</b> zigzag <b>seam,</b> flat fell <b>seam,</b> French <b>seam,</b> and many others.|$|R
25|$|Australian fast-medium bowler Glenn McGrath {{has used}} his <b>seaming</b> ability to great effect in his career. The ball 'seams' {{at its best}} {{at the start of}} a team's innings, when the ball is new. A pitch which has cracks in it may assist a seam bowler as well.|$|E
25|$|Installation {{techniques}} such as prefabrication, in-situ machine forming, mechanized <b>seaming,</b> and the long-strip system help to reduce the installation costs of copper roofing. By lowering installation costs, these techniques permit designers to specify copper into a wider array of building types, not just large prestigious projects as had been common in the past.|$|E
25|$|The {{overcast}} sky and <b>seaming</b> pitch made {{the selection of}} England's nearly-man Neil Mallender for his debut look inspired. England's all-seam attack rattled through the Pakistani batting, with only Salim Malik putting up any resistance, though he ended up stranded on 82 despite useful support from Mushtaq Ahmed that spared the tourists' blushes (they added 64 for the ninth wicket).|$|E
50|$|In 1901 mining recommenced in the Victoria Tunnel <b>seam</b> {{which was}} located above the Borehole <b>seam.</b> Both the Borehole & Victoria Tunnel <b>seams</b> were then worked until 1906 when working of the Borehole <b>seam</b> ceased. The Borehole <b>seam</b> {{workings}} were abandoned in 1912 and the fan at the Flaggy Creek shaft was stopped as this shaft only served the Borehole <b>seam</b> workings.|$|R
40|$|Many {{previous}} {{studies showed that}} <b>seam</b> appearance as well as performance depends on the interrelationship of fabrics, threads, and the stitch/seam selection and lastly on the sewing conditions, which include the needle size, needle thread tension, stitch density, and the appropriate operation and maintenance of the sewing machine. Present investigation elucidates the effect of blend composition, sewing thread size, and sewing needle parameters on garment <b>seam</b> characteristics (i. e., <b>seam</b> strength, <b>seam</b> strength efficiency, <b>seam</b> puckering, <b>seam</b> stiffness, and drape coefficient). The <b>seam</b> quality characterization is studied through the L 9 orthogonal design methodology. In good quality apparels, compatibility of the <b>seams</b> with the functional requirement {{is very important for}} serviceability and life of the apparel. Reversibility as well as repairing of <b>seams</b> in the apparel is very limited in the condition of <b>seam</b> failure. <b>Seam</b> strength efficiency is higher for the uniform fiber matrix in the structure of fabrics. The polyester dominated suiting fabrics give minimum <b>seam</b> stiffness because polyester component has low flexural rigidity. The cotton dominated suiting fabrics have less <b>seam</b> puckering due to increase in fabric stiffness...|$|R
50|$|The FDA {{continues}} by {{detailing the}} requirements of double <b>seam</b> destructive testing:"The double <b>seam</b> teardown examination is a destructive test. Tools {{that are used to}} perform this test include a <b>seam</b> micrometer, countersink gauge can opener and nippers. Optional equipment for <b>seam</b> teardown examinations include a <b>seam</b> saw, <b>seam</b> projector and <b>seam</b> scope. Although it is not imperative the investigator carry this equipment to each LACF inspection, {{it is very important that}} they know how to operate this equipment and read measurements from the micrometer, <b>seam</b> projector or <b>seam</b> scope. It is also important that the investigator know how to determine the tightness or wrinkle rating of the cover hook. Knowledge of the procedures used to perform double <b>seam</b> teardown examination are essential to evaluating the firm's knowledge and ability to do this examination. Attachment 14 explains the procedure for using a <b>seam</b> projector for examining a cross section of the <b>seam.</b> Attachment 15 explains the can <b>seam</b> micrometer and procedure for use, and Attachment 16 explains the use of a seamscope for the same exam.|$|R
25|$|At Old Trafford, Somerset won the toss {{and elected}} to field on a <b>seaming</b> pitch after a delayed start. Mal Loye {{was the only}} Lancastrian to score a half-century, as Somerset {{made the most of}} the conditions. Iain Sutcliffe, Stuart Law and Mark Chilton all worked {{themselves}} into the 30s, but failed to progress. Lancashire finished the first day on 235 for 7.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{relatively}} short career of 25 Tests, Rogers retired having gained admiration for his watchful, consistent batting {{at the top of}} the order; in particular, during the two Ashes series he played in England, he was one of Australia's most consistent batsmen in the <b>seaming</b> and swinging conditions. For all but the first few Tests of his international career, he formed a successful opening partnership with David Warner, generally playing an anchoring role to Warner's more aggressive style; in only 41 innings together, the pair shared nine century partnerships.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 2013 and at age 35, Rogers {{was named}} in the 16-man Australian Test squad for the 2013 Ashes tour in England, {{more than five years}} after his {{previous}} Test. He opened the batting throughout the series, partnering initially with Shane Watson and later with David Warner, and made 367 runs at 40.77 for the series to be Australia's third-highest scorer. Rogers scored his maiden Test century in the first innings of the fourth Test, in difficult <b>seaming</b> conditions at the Riverside International Cricket Ground, Durham.|$|E
50|$|A plain <b>seam</b> is {{the most}} common type of machine-sewn <b>seam.</b> It joins two pieces of fabric {{together}} face-to-face by sewing through both pieces, leaving a <b>seam</b> allowance with raw edges inside the work. The <b>seam</b> allowance usually requires some sort of <b>seam</b> finish to prevent raveling.|$|R
50|$|When {{making an}} outward-curved <b>seam,</b> the {{material}} will have reduced bulk and lie flat if notches are {{cut into the}} <b>seam</b> allowance. Alternatively, when making an inward-curved <b>seam,</b> clips are cut into the <b>seam</b> allowance to help the <b>seam</b> lie flat with reduced bulk in the fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Coal <b>seam</b> gas {{composition}} - {{for a given}} coal <b>seam</b> gas content (in m3 per tonne), the <b>seam</b> {{will be much more}} susceptible to outbursts if the coal <b>seam</b> gas is predominantly carbon dioxide, as opposed to the case where the coal <b>seam</b> gas is predominantly methane.|$|R
25|$|<b>Seaming</b> technique. This is a {{vertical}} or horizontal classical cladding construction used in copper roof and fa√ßade designs. Available in sheets and strips, the cladding is fixed with clips. Since water tightness {{may not be}} a concern on vertical surfaces, angle standing seams are often sufficient. Double lock standing seams are often not necessary. Links to photographs of horozontal and vertical standing and flat lock seams at the University of Debrecen's Copper Gateway in Hungary and of pre-oxidized copper clad seamed facades at the Hotel Crowne Plaza Milano, in Milan, Italy, are available.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} Fifth Victory Test at Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and batted first. They {{collapsed}} to 4/66 under overcast conditions on a green pitch when Miller {{came to the}} crease. Against a swinging and <b>seaming</b> ball, Miller struck 14 from the first over that he faced {{and went on to}} finish 77 not out in a display that featured strong cutting and driving. However, he did not get much support from the lower order, with none of the last five batsmen passing single figures, including two run outs, and Australia could manage only 173 in 59 overs. Pollard took 4/78.|$|E
25|$|Counter-intuitively, {{the best}} {{approach}} for a fast bowler is not to bowl constantly at the wicket as such predictability allows the batsman to simply defend his or her wicket and pick off the occasional bad ball. A far more effective approach is to introduce variation of line and length, leaving the batsman unsure as to whether to attack, defend or leave. The majority of balls in a well-bowled spell will usually be swinging or <b>seaming</b> balls that pass at waist height, just outside the off stump and {{move away from the}} batsman because this is the area where it is most difficult for the batsman to choose the most appropriate response. Common variations and their tactical application are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{is joined}} in indoor environments by butt welding, soldering, rivets, nails, screws, bolting, {{standing}} <b>seams,</b> lap <b>seams</b> (with and without fasteners), flat <b>seams,</b> bolted flanges, splines, flush laps, and batten <b>seams.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{clothing}} construction, <b>seams</b> {{are classified}} by their type (plain, lapped, abutted, or French <b>seams)</b> and {{position in the}} finished garment (center back <b>seam,</b> inseam, side <b>seam).</b> <b>Seams</b> are finished {{with a variety of}} techniques to prevent raveling of raw fabric edges and to neaten the inside of garments.|$|R
25|$|Other famous <b>seams</b> {{include the}} Parkgate <b>seam</b> that {{produced}} mainly gas coal, the Silkstone <b>seam</b> which produced coal suitable for many purposes and the Swallow Wood <b>seam</b> that produced household and gas coal.|$|R
25|$|They {{were first}} {{developed}} by WACA curator John Maley {{for use in}} the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. Drop-in pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment. Along with other revolutions during the series including the white ball, floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, drop-in pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly <b>seaming</b> and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although there would still be something in the pitch for the bowlers.|$|E
25|$|Pujara {{was named}} in the 16-man squad for the 2014 tour of England. With a best of 55 {{and a total of}} 222 runs in five Tests, he had a disappointing series. Despite getting good starts, he failed to convert them into big scores, {{struggling}} with his back foot movement and playing with a straighter bat, while also facing difficulty against the <b>seaming</b> ball. He was {{not a part of the}} squad for the ODI series that followed and upon receiving permission from the BCCI, signed for Derbyshire to play in their last three games of the season. After a poor first game, he finished the stint scoring 212 runs, that included an unbeaten 90 in the win over Surrey and an unbeaten century against Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|In {{informal}} games, {{either a}} rubber ball or tennis ball {{is used as}} an alternative. The rubber ball is not suitable for the variety of surfaces made use of in informal games; it is too bouncy on cement and concrete and barely bounces at all on grass or soil. An unmodified tennis ball is light, but it is incapable of gaining sufficient speed. By covering a tennis ball with electrical tape, the ball's weight and traction are increased, which in turn leads to greater bounce and speed. A tape ball {{can also be used}} to mimic a <b>seaming</b> cricket ball by adding an extra layer of tape around the circumference like a seam, the sides can be roughened to mimic conventional swing of a cricket ball. The tape ball is thus a sound compromise between safety and sincerity to the sport.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>seam</b> {{allowances}} are pinned or basted, {{they are}} often pressed flat with an iron before sewing the final <b>seam.</b> Pressing the <b>seam</b> allowances {{makes it easier to}} sew a consistent finished <b>seam.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other famous <b>seams</b> {{include the}} Parkgate <b>seam</b> that {{produced}} mainly gas coal, the Silkstone <b>seam</b> which produced coal suitable for many purposes and the Swallow Wood <b>seam</b> that produced household and gas coal.|$|R
50|$|In a French <b>seam,</b> the {{raw edges}} of the fabric are fully {{enclosed}} for a neat finish. The <b>seam</b> is first sewn with wrong sides together, then the <b>seam</b> allowances are trimmed and pressed. A second <b>seam</b> is sewn with right sides together, enclosing the raw {{edges of the}} original <b>seam.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Australian {{summer was}} {{followed}} by a tour of South Africa. Waugh made 26 in the opening Test, which Australia won by an innings. In the Second Test at Port Elizabeth, Australia were skittled in the first innings for 108 and were forced to chase 270 for victory on a <b>seaming</b> wicket. Waugh came to the crease with Australia at 2/30 on the third afternoon. After a hard-fought afternoon, Australia reached the close of play at 3/154 with Waugh on 54. The next morning he continued to his century, before he was bowled for 116, leaving Australia at 6/258. Australia lost two more qickets, but stumbled to victory with two wickets in hand. The five and half hour innings is often regarded as his finest Test performance. Waugh ended the series with 209 runs at 41.80.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match against}} Tasmania was very {{different}} as the bowlers were asked to restrain themselves on a green <b>seaming</b> pitch as neither side wanted injuries. Sadiq Mohammad opened for Tasmania after they were put into bat by Denness, {{but they were all}} out for 164, with Arnold, Old and Underwood taking three wickets apiece. The left-handed batsman Jim Wilkinson was injured immediately after he came in at 22/1 and returned at 79/5, but the innings relied on Barry Beard's 49. The MCC were 109/3 {{at the end of the}} first day and to everyone's surprise Mike Denness made 157 not out, adding 213 with Brian Luckhurst (74). John Edrich retired hurt on 35, when the MCC were 321/4, but Denness declared soon afterwards on 341/4. Tasmania collapsed again in the second innings, with Wilkinson top-scoring with 30 and the MCC won by an innings.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this time}} there was no collapse. Two no-balls from Harmison followed, Andrew Symonds and Damien Martyn defended well, waiting for Harmison and Flintoff to be taken off and saved for the last overs. They were ‚Äì and Australia were let off the hook. Symonds and Martyn paired up for 142 runs, taking runs off every bowler ‚Äì even Flintoff and Harmison ‚Äì and batted {{together}} for nearly 25 overs, with a partnership run-rate of nearly 6. The first four overs only yielded 13 runs, but when Harmison was taken off England lost the sting. Symonds was finally run out by the skipper Trescothick for 73, a hopeless attempt at taking a single, and Flintoff dug out Michael Hussey for 5 two overs later. Australia, however, made a highly competitive 266 for 5, and in the <b>seaming</b> conditions one would expect it to be enough.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of <b>seams</b> in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. <b>seams</b> stitched with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. <b>seams</b> stitched with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. <b>seams</b> stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. <b>seams</b> stitched with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced <b>seams</b> with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. <b>Seams</b> constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation than those <b>seamed</b> with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible <b>seams</b> than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced <b>seams</b> with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most <b>seams</b> stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation than comparable <b>seams</b> stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. <b>Seams</b> parallel to the courses were related to greater <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation than <b>seams</b> parallel to the wales...|$|R
50|$|The first {{operation}} <b>seam</b> {{is critical}} to avoid problems like wrinkles (tightness issues) and leaks. The shape of the <b>seam</b> {{is determined by the}} shape of the first operation roll, the second operation roll, their relative positions and distances, lifter height, lifter pressure. Any damage or problems to the seamer or seamer tools can cause severe problems to the double <b>seam</b> like <b>seam</b> bumps, wrinkles, sharp <b>seams,</b> and open <b>seams.</b>|$|R
30|$|Integrated coal {{production}} and gas extraction is a scientific model for resource developments by integrating coal mining with gas extraction and utilization. Instead {{of the traditional}} ‚Äútop to bottom‚Äù coal mining sequence in multiple <b>seams,</b> the first mining <b>seam</b> (it is also {{often referred to as}} a protective <b>seam)</b> is so selected in the integrated technology that its mining can result in the deformation, de-stressing, enhanced permeability, and easy gas drainage of its overlying and underlying coal <b>seams.</b> In the case {{that there is only one}} <b>seam</b> or no protective <b>seam</b> is available, a roadway needs to be special excavation in the roof of the <b>seam</b> and a large number of cross-measure boreholes need to be drilled from the roadway into the <b>seam</b> for gas drainage to ensure that the <b>seam</b> is extracted in the condition of low <b>seam</b> gas content.|$|R
