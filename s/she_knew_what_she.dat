5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
500|$|Mark Moses from The Phoenix said [...] "the lack of lyrical {{substance}} is so glaring that Prince's lame 'Manic Monday' {{seems like a}} thematic highlight". Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that [...] "the song should put he Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that [...] "Manic Monday" [...] was [...] "infectious" [...] and, along with [...] "If <b>She</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>What</b> <b>She</b> Wants", both were [...] "refreshingly melodic". Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "The first single 'Manic Monday' represents slumming songwriter Prince's attempt mostly successful save for the inevitable getting down interlude to concoct a modern day Mamas and the Papas hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Laura A. Bischoff of the Dayton Daily News {{commented that}} the book was the [...] "ultimate insider's guide to The Simpsons." [...] However, several critics {{commented that the}} book was {{straightforward}} and presented few interesting stories. Susan Shapiro of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Although the paradoxes of being 'a celebrity nobody knows' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook." [...] Rosellen Brewer of the Library Journal commented that [...] "Cartwright's own life notwithstanding, there is nothing really new or exciting here. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to do and}} was able to do it; end of story." [...] Lee Bacchus of The Province wrote that [...] "This little book by the voice of Bart Simpson reads as if it were written by a 10-year-old boy. Not that that's all bad. Cartwright, who voices Bart along with Ralph Wiggum and a few others on The Simpsons, gives a very unchallenging tour behind the scenes of the phenomenally successful series. It's kind of fun to discover how the show is put together and how an adult woman snagged one of the coolest jobs in the world [...] If only it wasn't all so relentlessly perky." ...|$|E

2500|$|A public {{memorial}} service, {{attended by}} about 1,500 people, {{was held at}} Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium on April 9, 1998. A private, grave-side service had been held earlier with a crypt entombment at Nashville's Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery. Her death solicited commentary {{such as that of}} songwriter Bill Mack, quoted in the Dallas Morning News that she was a [...] "class act" [...] and [...] "irreplaceable" [...] and that [...] "She never knew a flat note." [...] Lee Ann Womack was quoted also; she said of Wynette, whose songs often evoked strength and controlled passion, [...] "You knew <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was singing about. You can put her records on and listen and learn so much." [...] Wynette was survived by her husband George Richey, four daughters and eight grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) {{death row}} for women, then {{transferred}} to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. [...] "I killed those men," [...] she wrote, [...] "robbed them as cold as ice. And I'd do it again, too. There's no chance in keeping me alive or anything, because I'd kill again. I have hate crawling through my system...I am so sick of hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I've been evaluated so many times. I'm competent, sane, and I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again." [...] While her attorneys argued {{that she was not}} mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Olivia {{has been described}} as [...] "an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel back over time." [...] She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to do for a career [...] "pretty much since [...] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.|$|E

6000|$|... "Queer! By George, I'll {{back her}} for the queerest bit of {{horseflesh}} going any way about these diggings. I thought she was mad at first, but I believe <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> about." ...|$|R
