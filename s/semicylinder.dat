These included {{a method for}} stacking several short resonant cavities to improve thrust, and a design with a cavity that was a <b>semicylinder</b> instead of a frustum. That December, Chen announced that CAST was conducting tests on a resonant cavity thruster in orbit, without specifying what design was used.|$|E
50|$|The castle {{was called}} Shahbulag ("Shah's spring") honoring the nearby spring. The complex which {{included}} mosques, houses, baths and a market {{was built in}} 1751-52. During the construction, limestone and dimension stone were used. Only the castle itself and the mosque on its northwestern end survived. The castle has a rectangular architectural design and its external walls are reinforced with circular and <b>semicylinder</b> towers. The walls and towers contain embrasures and merlons typical for defense structures. The castle walls are 7 m high, and the towers are 8.5 m high. The entrance to the castle {{is in the middle}} section of the eastern wall. During the reign of the khan, it was protected by two story tower like premises. The top floor was intended for the khan with a stone staircase leading to it from the castle yard. The castle was built from half-hewn whole stones.|$|E

The edges of the slit are modelled as <b>semicylinders.</b> We have considered that {{the thickness of the}} slit is sufficiently small compared to the width, so that the influence of multiple reflections between the edges may be neglected. The material in which the slit is made, as well as the polarization and angle of the incident beam, are considered. Notorious differences are obtained when compared to the classical diffraction from flat slits...|$|R

The analysis {{is based upon}} an incremental finite element procedure that simultaneously determines the stresses in the contact region between the meshing teeth. The teeth themselves are modeled by two dimensional plain strain elements. Friction effects are included, with the friction forces assumed to obey Coulomb's law. The analysis assumes that the displacements are small and that the tooth materials are linearly elastic. The analysis procedure is validated by comparing its results with those for the classical two contacting <b>semicylinders</b> obtained from the Hertz method. Agreement is excellent...|$|R
40|$|First, {{this paper}} {{presents}} a new flume for measuring flow discharge in sloping channels, originally proposed by Samani and Magallanez, {{for use in a}} horizontal channel. The flume is obtained inserting two <b>semicylinders</b> in a rectangular cross section. Then, using dimensional analysis and the self-similarity theory, the stage-discharge relationship of the flume is theoretically deduced. For determining the two coefficients of the power stage-discharge equation some experimental runs are carried out using flumes characterized by different values of the contraction ratio (ranging from 0. 17 to 0. 81) and of the flume slope (ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 5 %). Finally, for a given range of the contraction ratio, the relationships for estimating the two coefficients of the stage-discharge equation are obtained...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{oscillation}} of a floating <b>semicylinder</b> is presented with focus on rotation about its longitudinal axis. In the first part, I derive the equation for calculating the ship's oscillation period and highlight {{the problem of}} the influence of the surrounding fluid in calculating the moment of inertia. Furthermore, without considering the surrounding fluid, I theoretically analyze the ways for which I think are the candidates for the approximation of oscillating <b>semicylinder</b> on the water surface. For each way, I write the term for the oscillation energy and for the period of oscillation and plot graphs of position-time dependence for the center of gravity and axis of rotation. With a reflection on the operation of forces on a floating <b>semicylinder,</b> I develop a simple analytical model in which I describe one {{of the effects of the}} surrounding fluid on a floating <b>semicylinder</b> during oscillation. In the practical part, I describe the experiments in which I examine the theoretical assumptions about kinematics and the oscillatory time for a particular mode of oscillation. The measured values match the theoretical ones. Data, obtained from the experiment in which the <b>semicylinder</b> floats on the water, are used to check the correctness of the analytical model by calculating the added mass of the water which affects the oscillation. Computer tracking method is used for analysis of the position of the centre of gravity of a floating <b>semicylinder</b> during oscillation. Using the data obtained, the analytical model is upgraded and the equation for the assumption of oscillation energy is derived. On the basis of a comparison between the modeling modes of motion and the measured motion of a floating <b>semicylinder,</b> I conclude that the best model is the one in which the center of gravity of the <b>semicylinder</b> fluctuates only in the horizontal direction. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{studying}} the diffraction of shock waves around various two-dimensional obstacles we {{have observed that}} flow separation {{and the formation of}} vortices contributes in an important way to transient loading of the obstacle. The cases of a cylinder and <b>semicylinder</b> are especially interesting because the breakaway point is not clearly defined as it is for objects having sharp corners. Accordingly a number of experiments {{have been made in the}} shock tube to observe the influence of Reynolds number and Mach number on the transient flow patterns about a cylinder and about a <b>semicylinder</b> mounted on a smooth plane. Some differences might be anticipated since the plane would impose a symmetry on the flow and produce a viscous boundary layer for which there is no counterpart with the cylinder. In the course of these experiments it was noted that a condition of steady subsonic flow about both the cylinder and <b>semicylinder</b> was approached. Thus a comparison with von Karrnan's theoretical calculation of the drag on a cylinder, from certain characteristics of its wake or "vortex street", was undertaken...|$|E

In the experiments, we used p-polarized radiation and spectrometers KSDI- 82 equipped with ATR unit LOMO NPVO- 1 as well as Bruker IFS 88 equipped with Perkin Elmer ATR unit. CsI <b>semicylinder</b> served as ATR element in both cases. ATR spectra were recorded with several angles of the incidence of the radiation {{in the range of}} 40 – 60 °. The polystyrene spacers were used to make an air gap between the investigated sample and the <b>semicylinder,</b> it was varied from 6 to 8  μ.|$|E

The burial vault’s plan is similar to Barda mausoleum. The overground part of Garabaghlar mausoleum is very interesting for its architectural structure. A trunk of the mausoleum standing on a stone pedestal is originated from connection of 12 <b>semicylinders.</b> The mausoleum is distinguished from other mausoleums of Azerbaijan for architectural structure of its trunk. There is a boom with calligraphically written inscription {{on the top of the}} trunk as in Barda mausoleum. This inscription on Garabaghlar mausoleum was written with letters of white color and its background was made of blue frieze.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{pressure}} amplitudes and phases {{were measured}} in model scale {{on the surface}} of a rigid <b>semicylinder</b> mounted in an acoustically treated wind tunnel near a prop-fan (an advanced turboprop with many swept blades) model. Operating conditions during the test simulated those of a prop-fan at 0. 8 Mach number cruise. Acoustic pressure amplitude and phase contours were defined on the <b>semicylinder</b> surface. Measurements obtained without the semi-cylinder in place were used to establish the magnitude of pressure doubling for an aircraft fuselage located near a prop-fan. Pressure doubling effects were found to be 6 dB at 90 deg incidence decreasing to no effect at grazing incidence. Comparisons of measurements with predictions made using a recently developed prop-fan noise prediction theory which includes linear and non-linear source terms showed good agreement in phase and in peak noise amplitude. Predictions of noise amplitude and phase contours, including pressure doubling effects derived from test, are included for a full scale prop-fan installation...|$|E

In order to achieve the lossless propagation of the hybrid mode with the mode area of 0. 0058 (lambda(2) / 4) at 1. 55 mu m, the material gain of 200 nm x 300 nm InGaAsP nanowire should reach 1223 cm(- 1). </span...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{constants}} of dry {{films of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (sodium salt of calf thymus DNA) have been determined in the 2 - 82. eV region of photon energy. The extinction coefficient k {{was obtained by}} transmission measurements on thin films on metal mesh screens. The refractive index n in the nonabsorbing region 2 - 4 eV was obtained from critical-angle measurements on films deposited on a sapphire <b>semicylinder.</b> To determine the value of n above 4 eV, a Kramers-Kronig analysis was performed using the measured values of k. From these optical constants the complex dielectric function E and the energy-loss function for charged particles -Im(l/E) were derived. The results exhibit, {{in addition to the}} well-established absorptions around 4. 7 and 6. 5 eV, a strong absorption at 13. 8 eV and a prominent peak in the energy-loss function at 21. 6 eV which exhibits a large degree of collective behavior...|$|E

40|$|Hypersonic wake flows {{behind the}} Aeroassist Flight Experiment (AFE) {{geometry}} are analyzed using two Navier-Stokes flow solvers. Many of the AFE wake features observed in ballistic-range shadowgraphs are simulated using a simple, two-dimensional <b>semicylinder</b> geometry at moderate angles of attack. At free-stream conditions corresponding to a Hypersonic Free Flight Facility (HFFF) AFE experiment, the three-dimensional base flow for the AFE geometry is computed using an ideal-gas, Navier-Stokes solver. The computed results agree reasonably {{well with the}} shadowgraphs taken at the HFFF. An ideal-gas and a nonequilibrium Navier-Stokes solver have been coupled and applied to the complete flow around the AFE vehicle at the free-stream conditions corresponding to a nomial trajectory point. Limitations of the coupled ideal-gas and nonequilibrium solution are discussed. The nonequilibrium base flow solution is analyzed for the wake radiation and the radiation profiles along various lines of sight are compared. Finally, the wake unsteadiness is predicted using experimental correlations and the numerical solutions.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt Experimente, in welchen Gallium (Pr= 0. 02) in Folge innerer Waermequellen aufgeschmolzen wird. Die Experimente sind zweidimensionaler Natur und werden an einem Galliumhalbzylinder, der axial mit Gleichstrom ohmsch beheizt wird, durchgefuehrt. Die Halbzylinderoberflaeche wird mit Hilfe einer Spruehwasserkuehlung naeherungsweise auf konstanter Temperatur gehalten, die Bodenplatte ist adiabat. Durch Variation der Stromstaerke und der Spruehwassertemperatur werden zum einen die dimensionslose Schmelztemperatur #THETA#_m, welche die Groesse der fluessigen Kavitaet bestimmt, und zum anderen die Rayleigh-Zahl Ra, welche die Intensitaet der einsetzenden Konvektion charakterisiert, variiert. Die dimensionslosen Parameter #THETA#_m und Ra sind im Bereich 0. 09 #<=##THETA#_m#<=# 0. 23 und 0. 84 #<=#Ra#<=# 261. 4 variiert. Die Experimente werden nach Einschalten der inneren Beheizung {{transient}} bis zum Erreichen eines stationaeren Gleichgewichtszustands durchgefuehrt. Transient wird das Temperaturfeld mit Hilfe von Thermoelementen und die Hoehe der fluessigen Kavitaet in der Mitte mit Hilfe der Ultraschallmesstechnik erfasst. Das Krustenprofil im stationaeren Zustand wird nach Ablassen des fluessigen Galliums mit Hilfe der Triangulation vermessen. Die durchgefuehrten Experimente dienen der Verifikation des Codes COSMO 2000, welcher ebene, transiente Aufschmelzprozesse berechnen kann. Die Experimente werden mit den entsprechenden Simulationen verglichen. (orig.) The following presentation describes {{experiments in}} which Gallium (Pr= 0. 02) melts due to internal heating. The experiments are of two-dimensional nature and {{are carried out}} on a Gallium-semicylinder, which is heated ohmic axial with direct current. The <b>semicylinder</b> surface is held approximately at constant temperature by spray water cooling. The bottom of the <b>semicylinder</b> is adiabatic. The non-dimensional melting temperature #THETA#_m, which determines {{the size of the}} liquid cavity, and the Rayleigh-number Ra, which characterizes the intensity of the starting convection, can be changed by variation of the amperage and the temperature of the spray water cooling. The non-dimensional parameters #THETA#_m and Ra are varied in the range of 0. 09 #<=##THETA#_m#<=# 0. 23 and 0. 84 #<=#Ra#<=# 261. 4. The experiments are commenced after turning on the internal heating. They are stopped, when steady state is reached. Transient information of temperature in the measurement layer is measured by thermocouples. The height of the liquid cavity {{in the middle of the}} Gallium-semicylinder is measured by an ultrasonic pulse-echo instrument. The steady state profile of the crust is measured by triangulation after draining the liquid Gallium. The completed experiments verify the numerical code COSMO 2000, which can calculate plane (2 D), transient melting problems. The experiments are compared with equivalent numerical simulations.
