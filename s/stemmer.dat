He {{was the son of}} a Hauptmann (captain) of Infanterie-Regiment 47 (47th Infantry Regiment), Hans Wilcke, who died of {{pneumonia}} when Wilcke was just four weeks of age. His mother, Hertha von Schuckmann, married again on 14 June 1919. In 1931, Wilcke was arrested for attending a then-illegal demonstration of the Nazi Party. Although his loyalty to the Nazi cause is emphasized multiple times in his personal military files, according to biographers Prien and <b>Stemmer,</b> he was a firm opponent of the National Socialist regime; later in his career, for a time after taking command of III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing), he had the Swastikas on his unit's aircraft painted over. He volunteered for military service in the Reichswehr after receiving his Abitur (diploma). He joined Artillerie-Regiment 6 (6th Artillery Regiment) in Minden as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet) on 1 April 1934. His legal guardian and stepfather, Friedrich von Scotti, also served in this regiment.|$|E

25|$|At {{least in}} regards to the One, Michael Erler concludes from a {{statement}} in the Republic that Plato held it was only intuitively knowable. In contrast, Peter <b>Stemmer,</b> Kurt von Fritz, Jürgen Villers, and others oppose any independent role for non-verbal intuition. Jens Halfwassen believes that knowledge of the realm of the Forms rests centrally upon direct intuition, which he understands as unmediated comprehension by some non-sensory, 'inner perception' (Ger., Anschauung). He also, however, holds that Plato's highest principle transcended knowledge and was thus inaccessible to such intuition. For Plato, the One would therefore make knowledge possible and give it the power of knowing things, but would itself remain unknowable and ineffable.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stemmers</b> {{attempt to}} reduce a word to its stem or root form and are used widely in {{information}} retrieval tasks to increase the recall rate. Most popular <b>stemmers</b> encode {{a large number of}} language specific rules built over a length of time. Such <b>stemmers</b> with comprehensive rules are available only for a few languages. In the absence of extensive linguistic resources for certain languages, statistical language processing tools have been successfully used to improve the performance of IR systems. In this paper, we describe a clustering-based approach to discover equivalence classes of root words and their morphological variants. A set of string distance measures are defined, and the lexicon for a given text collection is clustered using the distance measures to identify these equivalence classes. The proposed approach is compared with Porter’s and Lovin’s <b>stemmers</b> on the AP and WSJ sub-collections of the TIPSTER data set using 200 queries. Its performance is comparable to that of Porter’s and Lovin’s 1 <b>stemmers,</b> both in terms of average precision and the total number of relevant documents retrieved. The proposed stemming algorithm also provides consistent improvements in retrieval performance for French and Bengali, which is currently resource-poor. ...|$|R

In this paper we present a languageindependent probabilistic model which can automatically generate <b>stemmers</b> for several different languages. The variety of word forms makes the match between the end user’s words and the document words impossible even if they refer to the same concept - this mismatch degrades retrieval performance. <b>Stemmers</b> can improve the retrieval effectiveness, but the design and the implementation of <b>stemmers</b> requires a laborious amount of effort.

40|$|Hummingbird {{participated in}} the {{monolingual}} information retrieval tasks of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2003 : for natural language queries in 9 European languages (German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Russian and English) find all the relevant documents (with high precision) in the CLEF 2003 document sets. For each language, SearchServer scored higher than the median average precision on more topics than it scored lower. In a comparison of experimental SearchServer lexical <b>stemmers</b> with Porter’s algorithmic <b>stemmers,</b> the biggest differences were for the languages in which compound words are frequent (German, Dutch, Finnish and Swedish). SearchServer scored significantly higher in average precision for German and Finnish, apparently from its ability to split compound words and find terms when they are parts of compounds in these languages. Most of the differences for the other languages appeared to be from SearchServer’s lexical <b>stemmers</b> performing inflectional stemming while the algorithmic <b>stemmers</b> often additionally performed derivational stemming; these differences did not pass a significance test. ...|$|R
