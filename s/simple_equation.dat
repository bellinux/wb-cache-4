25|$|Tunnels on steep {{gradients}} {{can present}} problems for air-breathing locomotives, such as steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. Poor ventilation in long or narrow tunnels can starve the locomotive of power. The solution {{is analogous to}} compensation for curvature and requires the gradient in the tunnel and for some distance on either side to be greatly reduced compared to the ruling grade. Unfortunately, the necessary compensation for gradient is not a <b>simple</b> <b>equation,</b> but is rather a trial and error process. Since one cannot build several tunnels {{to find out which}} one is best, it is useful to study existing tunnels with steep gradients.|$|E

[...] She realizes that when she adds the numbers of letters in the victims' names with the numbers in their birthdates, a pattern arises. [...] While explaining the case to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who rejects the idea that numerology is relevant or that the world can be broken down into one <b>simple</b> <b>equation,</b> Scully discovers another possible clue—marks on each of the victim's cheeks that looks like three small circles, likely imprinted by the killer's ring while he beat the victims. [...] On consulting a numerologist, who happens to have an office in the same building as the killer's apartment, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her as she is on the phone with Reyes.|$|E

These solutions are constructed {{on the basis of}} solutions of more <b>simple</b> <b>equations</b> called <b>simplest</b> <b>equations.</b> In this paper we study the role of the <b>simplest</b> <b>equation</b> for the application of the modified method of <b>simplest</b> <b>equation.</b> We follow the idea that each function constructed as polynomial of a solution of a <b>simplest</b> <b>equation</b> is a solution of a class of nonlinear PDEs. We discuss three <b>simplest</b> equations: the <b>equations</b> of Bernoulli and Riccati and the elliptic equation. The applied algorithm is as follows. First a polynomial function is constructed {{on the basis of a}} <b>simplest</b> <b>equation.</b> Then we find nonlinear ODEs that have the constructed function as a particular solution. Finally we obtain nonlinear PDEs that by means of the traveling-wave ansatz can be reduced to the above ODEs. By means of this algorithm we make a first step towards identification of the above-mentioned classes of nonlinear PDEs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|As a semi-solid, {{mayonnaise}} has {{an extremely}} high viscosity {{and because of}} this, its flow properties have been studied extensively. Shear stress is an important term when discussing liquids and solids at any viscosity and {{is defined as the}} force per unit area that is required to drag one layer of substance past another layer. Rheology is the study of science that deals with the flow and deformation of matter and is an umbrella for a few of mayonnaise's properties. One of which includes yield stress which can be defined as a minimum shear stress required to initiate flow. So, with all of these terms now defined, one can look at the specific properties that mayonnaise possesses. Mayonnaise has a high shear stress with a typical yield stress around 100 Pascals). For reference, ketchup has a yield stress of about 15 Pascals. With such a high yield stress, mayonnaise is able to resist low forces and even return to its original conformation.
