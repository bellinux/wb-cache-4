5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans {{the road in front}} of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and <b>sprinkles</b> sandalwood water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E
5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of dirt and <b>sprinkles</b> it into his father's grave.|$|E
5|$|Serendipity 3 was a 1950s style diner, {{featuring}} burgers, {{fries and}} ice cream delicacies. Portions were extremely large. The ice cream parlor themed restaurant, which was {{a branch of the}} New York City Serendipity 3 establishment, opened in 2009. In addition to seating in the dining area and counter seating, there was a patio with views of the Strip and the Caesars Palace fountains. Besides its giant hamburger, the restaurant was known for its Triple Decker Grilled Cheese sandwich and a The Hangover omelet made with bacon, cheese, French fries, and mushrooms. Ice cream sundaes featured a choice of toppings including butterscotch sauce, chocolate sauce, hot fudge, marshmallow sauce, Oreo kisses, peanut butter sauce, rainbow <b>sprinkles,</b> raspberry sauce, etc. Other options included Fried Twinkies, brownies, and the Golden Opulence sundae, an indulgent $1,000 US sundae, which holds the Guinness World Record for the Most Expensive Ice Cream Sundae in the World. It closed on January 2, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and <b>sprinkles</b> him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of sprinkler misting (<b>sprinkling</b> water applied from 1 · 0 to 1 · 5 mm) on field micro-climate, canopy temperature and crop yield under hot-dry windy conditions in the North China Plain. Results indicated that canopy temperature in the <b>sprinkled</b> field depressed quickly after <b>sprinkling</b> stopped and was closely related to air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. Within 50 - 60 min after <b>sprinkling</b> ceased, the canopy temperature in the <b>sprinkled</b> field approximately equalled that in the non-sprinkled field. Water surface evaporation measured using a standard 20 cm diameter pan placed above {{the top of the}} canopy was about 0 · 8 mm/day lower in the <b>sprinkled</b> field than in the non-sprinkled field. The yield of winter wheat observed in the <b>sprinkled</b> field was higher than in the non-sprinkled field by about 291 kg/ha. In conclusion, sprinkler misting (<b>sprinkling</b> about 1 · 0 - 1 · 5 mm water amount for each event) is a useful method to timely improve field micro-climate and regulate canopy temperature under hot-dry windy conditions. © 2006 IAgrE...|$|R

She has remarked that, when travelling, she always takes cookery classes to immerse herself in the local culture.

In 2013 she filmed a cooking segment for Vogues website, demonstrating how to make a brie pastry. In 2014 she launched Preserve, a digital magazine and e-commerce website with hand-made one-of-a-kind items all selected by Lively; on October 9, 2015, Lively closed the site, stating that it had been launched before it was ready, and that she plans to rebuild and relaunch it properly.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate strategies designed to reduce heat stress of cattle. In the first experiment, cattle were <b>sprinkled</b> for 20 min every 1. 5 h between 1000 hours and 1750 hours (WET) versus not <b>sprinkled</b> (DRY). In a second experiment, treatments consisted of: (1) control, no water application; (2) water applied to the pen surfaces between 1000 hours and 1200 hours (AM); and (3) water applied to pen surfaces between 1400 hours and 1600 hours (PM). In both experiments, <b>sprinkling</b> lowered (P< 0. 05) mid-afternoon temperatures. In the first experiment, relative humidity (RH) of WET versus DRY pens differed (P< 0. 05) and averaged 72. 4 and 68. 9 %, respectively. The average temperature-humidity index (THI) in WET pens was 0. 5 units lower (P< 0. 05), than the THI in DRY pens. In the second experiment, RH in <b>sprinkled</b> pens was also greater (P< 0. 05) than RH in control (CON) pens However, THI differed (P< 0. 05) among treatments, being 81. 5, 80. 9, and 80. 3, respectively for CON, AM, and PM. Pens with sprinklers had {{a larger percentage of}} steers in areas where <b>sprinkling</b> took place, even on days when <b>sprinkling</b> had not occurred. Based on differences in percentage of cattle panting in <b>sprinkled</b> and non-sprinkled treatments, <b>sprinkling</b> was found to {{have a positive effect on}} cattle feeding area microclimate and to reduce the susceptibility of cattle to hyperthermia. However, cattle acclimatization to being <b>sprinkled</b> can result in slight hyperthermia even during cooler days when <b>sprinkling</b> would normally not be utilized...|$|R
