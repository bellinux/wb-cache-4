50|$|Since {{there is}} no {{downstream}} turbine, a ramjet combustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel:air ratios, which implies a combustor exit stagnation temperature {{of the order of}} 2400 K for kerosene. Normally, the combustor must be capable of operating over a wide range of throttle settings, for a range of flight speeds/altitudes. Usually, a sheltered pilot region enables combustion to continue when the vehicle intake undergoes high yaw/pitch during turns. Other flame stabilization techniques make use of flame holders, which vary in design from combustor cans to <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plates,</b> to shelter the flame and improve fuel mixing. Overfuelling the combustor can cause the normal shock within a supersonic intake system to be pushed forward beyond the intake lip, resulting in a substantial drop in engine airflow and net thrust.|$|R
50|$|A danger with off-roading is {{damage to}} the vehicle from hitting rocks or other hard {{surfaces}} on very uneven terrain. A typical solution would be to install skid plates (sometimes also called bash plates), which are thick metal plates protecting vulnerable parts (such as the transfer/gear box or engine oil sump). Some manufacturers install skid plates as standard equipment on some of their vehicles. For many others this additional protection is available as an after-market accessory. Skid <b>plates</b> may be <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plates,</b> but {{they may also be}} formed (by stamping or by welding multiple pieces) to protect shaped items like differentials. Fuel tank skid plates are a common factory option. In addition to skid plates, many off-roaders install differential covers that will not bend or break if they are smashed on rocks or other large objects. Since the axles on an off-road vehicle typically are the lowest hanging part of the vehicle making them susceptible to damage.|$|R

[...] Dock plates are generally made out of aluminium whilst dock boards are generally made out of steel. Aluminium dock plates are thus more suitable for lighter loads, such as handcarts and dollies, whereas steel dock boards {{are more suitable for}} heavier motorized equipment such as fork lift trucks and electric pallet trucks. Another difference between dock plates and dock boards, in addition to their load-bearing capabilities, is their construction. Dock <b>plates</b> are <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plates,</b> whereas dock boards have curbs, bolted or welded {{to the edge of the}} board. Run-off is prevented by a simple painted yellow strip along the edge of a dock plate, whereas it is the curbs (also generally painted yellow) that prevent run-off on dock boards; these curbs are also where the higher weight capacities of dock boards come from. Run-off is thus a significant risk on dock plates, since the yellow strip is not a particularly effective mechanism for preventing it.|$|R

However, manufacturing cost, slit tape quality, lack of knowledge and experience of the in-situ consolidation fiber placement process are major barriers preventing aircraft manufacturer from implementing this unique processing technique. This dissertation aims to gain knowledge and experience of in-situ consolidation fiber placement by identifying and resolving four technical issues associated with the manufacturing of thermoplastic composite tailbooms. The first study demonstrates that the percentage of gap/lap and the angular deviation of fiber orientation can be controlled by dividing a single tool surface to multiple and equal sections. The second study shows that the interlaminar defects have minimal effects on the mechanical properties of autoclave molded thermoplastic composite laminates. The third study predicates a set of optimum processing parameters for manufacturing tailboom demonstration articles using automated fiber placement. The last study suggests that the in-situ consolidation fiber placement process needs to be improved to lower the micro-size void content and minimize the process induced warpage. ...|$|R

There were eleven bogies either side, each carrying two 10-inch wheels. Only nine of the bogies normally took the vehicle weight, the front coming into play when the vehicle nosed into the ground or against an obstacle, the rear acting in part as a track tensioner. Due to the number of wheels, the tank could survive losing several without much in the way of adverse effects as well as traversing steeper terrain obstacles. As the tracks ran around the panniers, escape hatches in the side could be incorporated into the design. These were retained throughout the revisions of the Churchill and were of particular use when the Churchill was adopted as the AVRE.|$|R

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{identified}} a promising energy resource in Sri Lanka. Therefore, {{it is important}} to use proper technologies for efficient energy capturing in order to minimize cost of energy. Small scale wind turbines are usually installed in constricted places (particularly in urban areas) where wind flow is turbulent and difficult to predict. Savonious type vertical axis wind turbines are important due to several reasons such as good response to turbulent winds, high initial torque, low cost, low noise, less maintenance. In this study, a modified <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> type Savonius wind rotor was proposed to cost effectively harness wind energy in constricted places. Generally, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) are less efficient than horizontal axis wind turbines, one reason behind this issue is wind force difference between the 2 sides of the axis is small and due to this reason torque is small and power generation capacity is less. A prototype of the proposed VAWT was fabricated and the performance was determined by acquiring experimental data. Artificial wind blow which was generated by a huge fan was used to measure rotational speed and torque characteristics at varying wind speeds. Data were collected with 1 -second sampling time and a data acquisition system was developed under this study. In the proposed design one side of the turbine blades are facing the wind direction in order to capture maximum force while other side is edging the blades to have minimum opposite torque. With this concept it is expected to maximize the torque of the axis and generate more power. A sort of a passive pitch mechanism is therefore utilized in order to save energy and simplify the system. Turbine blades are <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plates</b> and it eliminates usage of complex aero foils.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Thermally Driven Cooling system {{has received more}} attention recently due to its ability to utilize low grade heat from engine, incinerator or <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> solar collector which are considered as renewable energy sources. ClimateWell AB located in Stockholm has been developing this cooling system based on its patented chemical heat pump technology. The heat pump with its tube shape is put under the absorber as in <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> solar collector making it possible be directly attached on the roof without any additional solar collector. A high performance heat exchanger is needed by its reactor to absorb the energy efficiently during the desorption process {{as well as to}} recover heat during the absorption process. Current heat exchanger design has direct contact with the tube’s surface, yet air gaps between the tube and heat exchanger result in alower amount of heat transferred and non-uniform heat distribution across this surface. Moreover, a special treatment which cannot be done by machinery has to be performed in attaching the tube with this heat exchanger. It becomes a problem during mass production since a lot of man power is needed. A new heat exchanger design was proposed to overcome those limitations. This design has annulus which is filled with thermal fluid inside. This fluid will make perfect contact to the heat pump tube’s surface and eliminate the air gap. Furthermore, the need of man power in its production can be minimized. Even though perfect contact can be achieved, the fluid in this new design will increase thermal resistance in the radial direction. Therefore, an investigation has to be conducted to evaluate the performance of this new heat exchanger design based on heat transfer coefficient under steady state condition. The performance investigation also included the influence of various thermal fluids which will be used for this new heat exchanger. The work performed by doing simulation in COMSOL continued with validation of the result with experiment in laboratory. New heat exchanger design efficiency was only 50 % while the current one was 82 % during the desorption process. In this process, the fluid’s thermal conductivity was the most influencing fluid property. During absorption process, two heat recovery methods are used. First is by flowing the fluid inside the annulus and second is by using additional heat recovery pipe that is attached outside the heat exchanger surface. The first method gave the highest UA value around 34 W/K while the second one gave almost the same value as the current design which is around 11 W/K. In the first method, the thermal fluid’s viscosity strongly influenced its UA value while the second method is greatly influenced by fluid’s heat conductivity...|$|E

A two-dimensional geologic model fitted to the residual data agrees well with the <b>simple</b> <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> approximation used to obtain quantitative estimates of glacial drift thickness. Estimates of drift thickness from the gravity data also agree well with bedrock depths obtained from well logs. The most productive drift aquifers are restricted to the major bedrock valleys. Gravity data were coupled with seismic refraction and well data to produce a bedrock elevation map, from which it is possible to predict the extent and distribution of the major drift aquifers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{performance}} evaluation is conducted between a normal <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collector (Solar Air Heater) and a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collector incorporated with Tin material. The normal <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collector consists of a sheet metal placed within the casing and the Tin incorporated <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collector consists of Tin material which is stationed {{in the form of}} tins along with the sheet metal within the casing The temperature and velocity of air was measured by using a Thermocouple and Thermo- anemometer respectively. The performance evaluation is done on the basis of efficiencies produced by the two <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> collectors for natural convection and forced convection...|$|R
40|$|Key words: <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> solar collector; serpentine; thermal {{performance}} Abstract: Due {{to the conventional}} <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> solar collector has low efficient, {{it is necessary to}} make some improvements in the structure of conventional flat solar collector. This research improved the structure of conventional flat solar collector and conducted {{thermal performance}} testing for the improved structure which is serpentine heat pipe <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> solar collector. The test results indicate that serpentine heat pipe <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> solar collector has higher efficient than conventional solar collector. Thus, serpentine has better economic and environmental benefit than conventional solar collector...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluttering}} {{characteristics of}} an articulated <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> was investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel. An articulated <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> oscillates {{itself in a}} mean flow, and it has steady oscillating mode. Laser light displacement sensor was necessary to acquire the displacements of an articulated <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> because it had large amplitude in its fluttering motion. The image processing by using a digital video camera was therefore used to clarify the fluttering motion of the articulated <b>flat</b> <b>plate.</b> It {{was found that the}} fluttering frequency is extremely periodic, and the amplitude is constant. Flow visualization around an articulated <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> was also conducted. From the results of visualization, {{it was found that the}} separated flow region behind the plate is disappeared...|$|R
