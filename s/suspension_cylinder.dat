50|$|Nitrogen {{is used as}} {{the trapped}} gas to be compressed, since it is {{unlikely}} to cause corrosion. A nitrogen reservoir with variable volume yields a spring with non-linear force-deflection characteristics. In this way the resulting system does not possess any eigenfrequencies and associated dynamic instabilities, which need to be suppressed through extensive damping in conventional suspension systems. The actuation of the nitrogen spring reservoir is performed through an incompressible hydraulic fluid inside a <b>suspension</b> <b>cylinder.</b> By adjusting the filled fluid volume within the cylinder, a leveling functionality is implemented. The nitrogen gas within the suspension sphere is separated from the hydraulic oil through a rubber membrane.|$|E
50|$|Pressure {{flows from}} the {{hydraulic}} circuit to the suspension cylinders, pressurizing the bottom part of the spheres and suspension cylinders. Suspension works {{by means of a}} piston forcing LHM into the sphere, compacting the nitrogen in {{the upper part of the}} sphere; damping is provided by a two-way 'leaf valve' in the opening of the sphere. LHM has to squeeze back and forth through this valve which causes resistance and controls the suspension movements. It is the simplest damper and one of the most efficient. Ride height correction (self levelling) is achieved by height corrector valves connected to the anti-roll bar, front and rear. When the car is too low, the height corrector valve opens to allow more fluid into the <b>suspension</b> <b>cylinder</b> (e.g., the car is loaded). When the car is too high (e.g. after unloading) fluid is returned to the system reservoir via low-pressure return lines. Height correctors act with some delay in order not to correct regular suspension movements. The rear brakes are powered from the rear suspension circuit. Because the pressure there is proportional to the load, so is the braking power.|$|E
50|$|A {{telescopic}} fork uses fork tubes which contain the suspension components (coil springs and damper) internally. This {{is the most}} common form of fork commercially available. It may or may not include gaiters for protection against abrasive elements on the <b>suspension</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The main advantages of the {{telescopic fork}} are that (i) it is simple in design and relatively cheap to manufacture and assemble; (ii) it is lighter than older designs using external components and linkage systems; and (iii) it has a clean and simple appearance that bikers find attractive.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two <b>suspension</b> <b>cylinders</b> mounted horizontally on {{each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|R

The model was derived from bobbin equipped with pendulum <b>suspension</b> for forming <b>cylinder</b> shaped packages. In the derivation method it was considered that the model corresponds {{the conditions under which}} the contact points peripheral speeds of the package and driving drum in all the cross sections are less than the speeds of the same points belonging to the driving drum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Generally {{compressed}} air is produced using {{different types of}} air compressors which consumes lot of electric energy and is noisy. In this paper an innovative idea is put forth for production of {{compressed air}} using movement of vehicle suspension which normal is wasted. The conversion of the force energy into the compressed air is {{carried out by the}} mechanism which consists of the vehicle <b>suspension</b> system hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> Non-return valve air compressor and air receiver. We are collecting air in the cylinder and store this energy into the tank by simply driving the vehicle. This method is non-conventional as no fuel input is required and is least polluting...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} article is to analyse the {{performances}} of a modern vehicle equipped with a novel suspension system linking front, rear, right and left cylinders via a semi-active hydraulic circuit, developed by the Tenneco Automotive company. In addition to improving the vehicle's vertical performances (in terms of comfort), both the stiff roll motion of the carbody and the soft wrap motion of the rear/front wheel-axle units can be obtained and tuned via eight electrovalves. The proposed system avoids the use of classical anti-roll bars, which would be incompatible with the wrap performance. A major problem of the project is to produce a realistic and efficient 3 D multibody dynamic model of an Audi A 6 coupled, at the equational level, with an hydraulic model of the <b>suspension</b> including <b>cylinders,</b> accumulators, valve characteristics, oil compressibility and pipe dynamics. As regards the hydraulic submodel, a particular {{attention is paid to}} assemble resistive components properly without resorting to the use of artificial volumes, as proposed by some software dealing with the dynamics of hydraulic systems. According to Tenneco Automotive requirements, this model must be produced in a Matlab/Simulink form, in particular for control purposes. Thanks to the symbolic approach underlying our multibody program; a unified hybrid model can be obtained as a unique plant dynamic block to be real-time integrated in the Simulink environment on a standard computer. Simulation results highlight the advantages of this new suspension system, in particular regarding the behaviour of the car which can remain stiff in roll for curve negotiation, while maintaining a soft wrap behaviour on uneven surfaces...|$|R
5000|$|Rutgers entered {{its first}} carbon fiber {{monocoque}} in the 1994 {{competition at the}} Pontiac Silverdome. The front half of the car was constructed of pre-preg carbon fiber with a Nomex honeycomb core. 3 sandwich panel aluminum bulkheads were used to mount the front <b>suspension</b> and master <b>cylinders.</b> The rear half of the car was constructed of 4130 steel tubing. One {{of the most dramatic}} features of the car was the use of very long lower A-Arms. They were so long, that there was only about 1 inch of space between the left and right mounts on the chassis. The composite construction made use of very simple molds made primarily from sheetmetal and wood. There were no compound curves to any of the molds for the monocoque. Shifting was performed by steering wheel push buttons via pneumatics (an FSAE first). The brakes used 200mm OD cast iron vented rotors. The engine was a naturally aspirated Kawasaki Ninja 600R, making 73 RWHp.Result Highlights:Presentation - 7th Place,Design - 13th Place,Acceleration - 13th Place,Skid Pad - 5th Place,Autocross - 3rd Place,Endurance - 7th Place (22 Cones and 3 spin outs),Economy - 6th,Overall - 9thThis car earned the [...] "Best Prototype Fabrication Award" ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system, each wheel is connected, {{not to a}} spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional <b>suspensions.</b> The hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) ...|$|R
