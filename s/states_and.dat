40|$|Measures of the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local {{government}} capital stock and investment are necessary inputs into several areas of economic analysis, including {{the measurement of}} national wealth and its growth. We estimate net investment <b>and</b> depreciation of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> {{local government}} nonresidential capital. In aggregate, we estimate a net <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local nonresidential capital stock of $ 1. 8 trillion in 1985, 17 % larger than that estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Net <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local government investment has exceeded the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local deficit annually for the last forty-five years. While the fraction of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local purchase {{of goods and services}} devoted to net investment has fallen, it has exceeded federal government net capital formation except during defense buildups and has averaged more than 40 % of private fixed nonresidential net investment since 1951.
