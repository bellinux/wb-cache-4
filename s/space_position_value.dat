40|$|Robots {{have been}} more and more widely used in the {{factories}} nowadays. Arc welding {{is a very important}} application for industrial robots. However, how to eliminate the deviation caused by the inconsistent workpieces for robotic arc welding is always plagued operators. For solving this problem, researchers have developed different kinds of seam tracking sensors, such as touch sensor and arc sensor. Now, vision, as a widely developed sensor, is applied to be the seam tracking sensor. In this thesis, a vision-based seam tracking system is developed. The tracking sensor includes a camera and a structured laser. Rigid body motion and solid geometry are the base of tracking theory. For tracker alignment, eye-in-hand method based on relative movement of end-effector connected to a robot is proposed. It determines first the rotation then the translation. In addition, a simply method of calibrating the structured laser plan is given out. In Cartesian <b>space,</b> the <b>position</b> <b>values</b> of each feature point on the weld seam can be obtained though combining the parameters of camera and laser plane. Except the tracking algorithm, some image processing methods, such as mean-value, thinning and Hough transform, are used to improve the image quality and tracking accuracy. Finally, a series of experiments based on Motoman MA 1400 arc welding robot are setup to verify the whole algorithm and the reliability of the tracking system. The tracking accuracy we get finally is up to ± 0. 5 mm...|$|R
40|$|The Mayser value (Myerson (1977)), the <b>position</b> <b>value</b> (Meessen (1988)) and {{the average}} tree {{solution}} (Herings et al.) are three most important allocation rules for (graph or hypergraph) communication situations. In 2005, an axiomatic characterization of the <b>position</b> <b>value</b> for arbitrary (graph) communication situations was given by Slikker (2005). However, an axiomatic characterization of the <b>position</b> <b>value</b> for arbitrary hypergraph communication situations {{has not yet been}} found and remains an open problem. In our manuscript, we first give two non-axiomatic characterizations of the <b>position</b> <b>value</b> for hypergraph communication situations by introducing the uniform hyperlink game and the $k$-augment uniform hyperlink game.

Moreover, the associated inclusion [...] exclusion decomposability property depends on what we have called the graph allocation rule.

Is it possible, though, to describe a particle as possessing just a sharp <b>position</b> <b>value</b> (or just a sharp momentum value) ? Some, such as Paul Teller, have thought that the answer to this question is No [...] that the status of individual continuous quantities is very different in quantum mechanics than in classical mechanics. On the contrary, I shall show that the same subtle issues arise with respect to continuous quantities in classical and quantum mechanics; and that it is, after all, possible to describe a particle as possessing a sharp <b>position</b> <b>value</b> without altering the standard formalism of quantum mechanics...|$|R

40|$|Centrality is a sociological notion, {{which is}} not clearly defined, but that, at its core, {{measures}} the extent in which actors in a social network are connected to other actors. In this work, it is assummed that a social network is given by a graph (N,G) that shows the possible (direct) communications between actors (nodes) in the social network. A (zero-normalized) coalitional game (N,v) is considered to reflect the interests that motivate the interactions among individuals (players) in the social network.

40|$|Target {{tracking}} {{is one of}} {{the applications}} of Mobile Sensor Networks. Mobility management is the important parameter that affects the performance and lifetime of the Mobile sensor networks. So we need to manage the mobility in a controlled manner. Existing methods attempt to achieve these requirements for controlled mobility single target tracking only. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Target Tracking method using Ant Colony Optimization to satisfy these requirements. In this proposed method, targets current <b>position</b> <b>values</b> are estimated at every time step. Then, predicting the next <b>position</b> <b>value</b> of each target by using the previous time-step estimated values. Interval Analysis is used for estimation and prediction of <b>position</b> <b>values.</b> Then the proposed method consists of moving the mobile node in an optimal way to cover Multi-Target.
