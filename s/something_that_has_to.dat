Human ability is not to produce honey, but to think, to produce ideas. In this way the deathlike character of thinking becomes lifelike again. For honey is undoubtedly a living substance. Human thinking can be lively too. But {{it can also be}} intellectualized to a deadly degree, and remain dead, and express its deadliness in, say, the political or pedagogic fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{necessity}} participles {{are used}} to describe <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be done: Įsidėmėtinos rašybos atvejis – A spelling case one has to pay special attention to. Abejotina, ar mums pavyks – It is to be doubted if we succeed. Mostly limited to official styles, but certain participles are actively used in colloquial speech as well, some of them being considered more adjectives than verbs: Jis suimtas už pasibaisėtiną elgesį su gyvūnais – He was arrested for an appalling behaviour with animals. (Pasibaisėtinas = one {{that has to be}} detested).|$|E
2500|$|According to The Buffalo News Wallenda {{was seen}} picking up {{cigarette}} butts and other trash long after {{most of the}} media had left. [...] He grabbed a shovel and helped fill in the hole left by apparatus. [...] "It's just <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be done," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not scared of working." [...] "We take great pride in being a zero-impact operation", he said prior to the event. [...] A parks official said the area was clean and back to normal by 3p.m. {{the day after the}} walk. [...] Wallenda reiterated that he hopes to develop a lasting presence in Niagara Falls. [...] "There will always be a piece of my heart in Niagara Falls," [...] he remarked. [...] "I do see a future here and hope to have a show in this area and hope to spend more time here." [...] He did, however, rule out a repeat performance saying, [...] "No. That's not really my thing. I've done it. It's done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, {{through its}} characters, VA-11 HALL-A {{challenges}} traditional viewpoints on affection, relationships, and friendships in video games, writes Ana Valens of Den of Geek. As such, the game's cast [...] "is open, honest, and affectionate towards one another", {{out of necessity}} in getting by and surviving in a dystopian world. Ortiz and Damas attempted to infuse political allegories and social commentary into the characters and their stories without overburdening or taking focus away from the main plotline. They noted that, in most video games, [...] "it feels like affection is something that must be earned from scratch or something that must be justified in some way", {{as well as being}} [...] "painfully underrated and deemed unnecessary in some cases". To avoid the player feeling this way in VA-11 HALL-A, Sukeban Games made the friendships between Jill and the other characters [...] " [...] come to be", instead of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be earned.|$|E
2500|$|Structuration {{theory is}} {{centrally}} concerned with order as [...] "the transcending {{of time and}} space in human social relationships". Institutionalized action and routinization are foundational in the establishment of social order and the reproduction of social systems. Routine persists in society, even during social and political revolutions, where daily life is greatly deformed, [...] "as Bettelheim demonstrates so well, routines, including those of an obnoxious sort, are re-established." [...] Routine interactions become institutionalized features of social systems via tradition, custom and/or habit, but this is no easy societal task and it [...] "is a major error to suppose that these phenomena need no explanation. On the contrary, as Goffman (together with ethnomethodology) has helped to demonstrate, the routinized character of most social activity is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be 'worked at' continually by those who sustain it in their day-to-day conduct." [...] Therefore, routinized social practices do not stem from coincidence, [...] "but the skilled accomplishments of knowledgeable agents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Jackson {{unveiled}} an edgier image, flaunting hennaed {{red hair}} and tattoos on her neck, wrist, foot, back, and lower thigh; also acquiring nipple, septum, and labia piercings. The transition was considered to risk alienation, though she was commended as [...] "a master at surprising and shocking her public". Jackson used {{a variation of the}} Akan Sankofa symbol throughout its artwork and imagery; representing the motif [...] "You cannot move into the future until you learn from your past". She tattooed the symbol onto her wrist, saying, [...] " [...] appeared on my album The Velvet Rope and it's very important to me. [...] It's about going into your past and dealing with it so that you can move forward". Jackson's tattoo artist later stated, [...] "I {{have a lot of people}} who fly in from all over the world to get <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with Janet’s sacred tattoos... She's an inspiration to a lot of people, and when they see something on Janet that helps her be strong, they want that strength as well".|$|E

6000|$|Then {{he turned}} to his confederates, as Thomas called them, and began to ask them {{questions}} which need not be set out in detail. Was it an animal that the Little Flower had lost? No, it was not an animal, the Spirits told him that it was not. Was it an article of dress? No, they did not think it was an article of dress, yet the Spirits seemed <b>to</b> suggest <b>that</b> it <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with dress. Was it a shoe? Was it scissors? Was it a comb? Was it a needle? No, but it was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with needles. What <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with needles? Thread. Was it thread? No, but <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with thread. Was it a silver shield which pushed the needle that drew the thread? ...|$|R
2500|$|Chakraverti's {{greatest}} {{influence has}} been on her daughter Deepta, who was chosen as her successor to helm the task of promoting about Wicca. Chakraverti commented: [...] "There are certain aspects of Wicca that you can't teach; {{they have to be}} absorbed. Something that I am not consciously passing on, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be taken from me. I felt Deepta had the potential and I would have never forced her had she not been so keen. This is not necessarily through a mother-daughter bonding, it can be guru-shishya (mentor-protégé), or any form of relationship where there is a guiding force." [...] Deepta, was trained by Chakraverti in meditation, physical exercises, studying old religions, and other Wiccan regimen. Chakraverti has also brought forth similarities between Old Wiccan findings and the discoveries of modern physics and parapsychology. According to Sudipto Shome of The Hindu, [...] "You could be called a dayan and burnt alive, or you could be called an enchantress and enlighten an audience on the art of Wicca. Ipsita is the latter, and she has used her social and economic padding to make others listen to her." ...|$|E

"Then I {{must look}} out for a stupid, ignorant woman, for {{that seems to be}} the kind I like," [...] {{answered}} Gavin, of whom I may confess here <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be told sooner or later. It is this: he never realised that Babbie was a great deal cleverer than himself. Forgive him, you who read, if you have any tolerance for the creature, man.|$|E

50|$|Keith Barker, a Métis {{playwright and}} actor, read the play Pig Girl as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be {{performed}} despite the violence portrayed.

He ends by stating he believes in the play.|$|R
5000|$|The Corporals {{gained a}} small but {{fiercely}} loyal following, but lack of venues, airplay and their raw aggressive music meant they were either anonymous to or completely ignored by the mainstream. Despite this Phillips never questioned whether {{he was doing the}} right thing or not, as he himself said, [...] "It was just <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be done, someone <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sing about what was happening in South Africa".|$|R
6000|$|He {{thought for}} a moment, and went on: [...] "Love is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be taken care of. One has to be so careful.... It's a {{beautiful}} plant, but a tender one.... I didn't know. I've a dread of love dropping its petals, becoming mean and ugly. How can I tell you all I feel? I love you beyond measure. And I'm afraid.... I'm anxious, joyfully anxious, like a man when he has found a treasure." ...|$|E

I {{think that he}} is mad; sorrow and something else which I do not understand have turned his brain; <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with the Heavens. I think also that we shall recover him living, if only for a little while, though of this I cannot be sure since it is not given to me to read the future, but only the past, and sometimes the things that happen in the present though they be far away." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{one knows}} that real {{literature}} is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with leisure and cultivated people and books and shaded lamps and {{all that sort of}} thing. But Hallery wants to drag in not only cathedrals and sanctuaries, but sky-signs and hoardings.... He wants literature to embrace whatever is in or whatever changes the mind of the race, except purely personal particulars. And I think Boon was going to make Hallery claim this, just in order to show up against these tremendous significances the pettiness of the contemporary literary life, the poverty and levity of criticism, the mean business side of modern book-making and book-selling....|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} the advance of ISIS and the {{response}} of the US military, Vatican Radio asked Archbishop Lingua, about the US airstrikes, “This is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be done, otherwise Islamic State could not be stopped,” the archbishop said. “But, we should wonder why we have arrived at this point: was it not a lack of intelligence?

Meyer is a Christian, but atheists, and theists who believe God never intervenes in the natural world, will be instructed by his careful presentation of this fiendishly difficult problem." ...|$|R

However, by 1884 things must have been corrected, for as well as raising the inmates' pensions, the trustees were able to pay two outpensions annually until 1899. Similar fluctuations in finances occurred {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. At the outbreak of the Second World War the inmates were evacuated, but by 1940 were requesting permission <b>to</b> return, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> await the provision of air raid shelters.|$|R
50|$|Verschaffel et al. {{explain that}} “adaptive {{expertise}} {{is not something}} that can be trained or taught but rather <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be promoted or cultivated.” They further these thoughts by suggesting that future research should be conducted {{over a long period of}} time in order to analyze the results of developing adaptive expertise.|$|E
