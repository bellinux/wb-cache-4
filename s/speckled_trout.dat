25|$|Despite actions taken, {{the region}} {{has been slow to}} recover. During the moratorium, there was a {{decrease}} in employment in the oil industry along the Florida Coast and a net increase in employment in Louisiana, which also received more concern from the oil industry. Coastal areas were impacted economically more than inland areas. The Louisiana fishing industry was shown to still be damaged by the spill years after it had occurred. Oyster numbers in particular have dropped significantly in the region. Other at risk species used as sustenance include <b>speckled</b> <b>trout,</b> crabs, and mullet. Due to proximity to the spill site, Louisiana bore the brunt of clean up efforts. BP decided on the oil dissolving chemical Corexit which was shown by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be neither the most or least toxic option. Criticisms of the use of the chemical included health impacts on humans, such as headaches, vomiting, and reproductive problems.|$|E
500|$|Lavaca Bay hosts a {{wide range}} of finfish {{including}} Black drum, Flounder, Redfish, Sheepshead and <b>Speckled</b> <b>trout,</b> however it suffers from mercury pollution. An Alcoa plant in Point Comfort dumped an estimated [...] of mercury into the bay per day in the 1960s, affecting [...] A mercury superfund was established at the site, and the processing of oysters and blue crab in certain locations was prohibited. A study revealed that the bay's detritus is more than ten times as contaminated as nearby Keller Bay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brook trout}} (Salvelinus fontinalis) is {{a species of}} {{freshwater}} fish in the salmon family Salmonidae. It is native to Eastern North America in the United States and Canada, but has been introduced elsewhere in North America and to other continents. In parts of its range, it {{is also known as}} the [...] eastern brook trout, <b>speckled</b> <b>trout,</b> brook charr, squaretail, or mud trout, among others. A potamodromous population in Lake Superior is known as coaster trout or, simply, as coasters. The brook trout is the state fish of nine U.S. states: Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the Provincial Fish of Nova Scotia in Canada.|$|E

60|$|It chanced on {{that very}} evening that Sir Nigel Loring, having supped before sunset, as was his custom, and having himself seen that Pommers and Cadsand, his two war-horses, with the {{thirteen}} hacks, the five jennets, my lady's three palfreys, and the great dapple-gray roussin, had all their needs supplied, had taken his dogs for an evening breather. Sixty or seventy of them, large and small, smooth and shaggy--deer-hound, boar-hound, blood-hound, wolf-hound, mastiff, alaun, talbot, lurcher, terrier, spaniel--snapping, yelling and whining, with score of lolling tongues and waving tails, came surging down the narrow lane which leads from the Twynham kennels to the bank of Avon. Two russet-clad varlets, with loud halloo and cracking whips, walked thigh-deep amid the swarm, guiding, controlling, and urging. Behind came Sir Nigel himself, with Lady Loring upon his arm, the pair walking slowly and sedately, as befitted both their age and their condition, while they watched with a smile in their eyes the scrambling crowd in front of them. They paused, however, at the bridge, and, leaning their elbows upon the stonework, they stood looking down at their own faces in the glassy stream, and at the swift flash of <b>speckled</b> <b>trout</b> against the tawny gravel.|$|E
6000|$|So {{singularly}} clear was the water, {{that where}} it was only twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat seemed floating in the air! Yes, {{where it was}} even eighty feet deep. Every little pebble was distinct, every <b>speckled</b> <b>trout,</b> every hand's-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite boulder, {{as large as a}} village church, would start out of the bottom apparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently it threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar and avert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the boulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been exactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface. Down through the transparency of these great depths, the water was not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All objects seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but of every minute detail, which they would not have had when seen simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and airy did all spaces seem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions [...] "balloon-voyages." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pinfish - inhabit mostly {{subtropical}} shallow {{coastal waters}} of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States and Mexico. It is a small fish, growing only to about 4.5 in. Pinfish rarely school, but can be found near each other, especially along structure which supports barnacles and mollusks. They eat shrimp, fish eggs, insect larvae, polychaete worms and amphipods, and plant matter. Pinfish are not generally sought as sport or food in the United States due to their small size and numerous small bones. They are used as live bait by anglers targeting red drum, <b>speckled</b> sea <b>trout</b> and flounder. They may be caught on small hooks along piers and jetties, but often are considered a nuisance bait stealer.|$|R
50|$|Central and {{northern}} Alberta {{and the region}} farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, geese, swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or {{near one of the}} hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. Eagles, hawks, owls and crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other temperate regions, is home to mosquitoes, flies, wasps, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, <b>speckled,</b> brown <b>trout,</b> and sturgeon. Bull trout, native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies {{in the southern part of}} the province. Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Chateaugay Lake {{has always}} drawn those {{interested}} in fishing and hunting; the region abounded in <b>speckled</b> and rainbow <b>trout</b> as well as deer and bear. Among those who came to hunt or fish and built cottages on the lakes were Geraldine Farrar, the singer, as well as Jack Clifford and Evelyn Nesbitt Thaw. Seth Thomas of clock fame built a beautiful cottage with a high tower containing a huge three-sided clock, which could be seen for miles around.|$|R
60|$|Martin {{walked away}} dissatisfied. In his opinion, {{there had never}} been a day more {{suitable}} for angling; this was a day which would be free from interruptions, either from two young fellows who knew nothing about real game-fishing, or from Matlack, who always called him away to do something when he was most interested in his piscatorial pedagogics. This was a day when he could stand by that lovely girl, give her the rod, show her how to raise it, wave it, and throw it, and sometimes even touch her hand as he took it from her or gave it back, watching her all the time with an admiration and delight which no <b>speckled</b> <b>trout</b> or gamy black bass had ever yet aroused in him, and all this without fear that a gentleman out on the lake might possibly be observing them with the idea that he was more interested in his work than the ordinary guide might be supposed to be. But luck was against him, and Martin, who did not in the least consider himself an ordinary guide, walked up and down in moody reflection, or grimly threw himself upon the ground, gazing upward at the sky--not half so blue as he was--but never walking or resting so far away that he could not hear the first cry from her should snake, bear, dragon-fly, or danger of any kind approach her.|$|E
6000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{district of}} South Devon, the greenest, most luxuriant in its vegetation, {{and perhaps the}} hottest in England, is that bit of country between the Exe and the Axe which is watered by the Clyst, the Otter, and the Sid. In any {{one of a dozen}} villages found beside these pretty little rivers a man might spend a month, a year, a lifetime, very agreeably, ceasing not to congratulate himself on the good fortune which first led him into such a garden. Yet after a week or two in this luxurious land I began to be dissatisfied with my surroundings. It was June; the weather was exceptionally dry and sultry. Vague thoughts, or [...] "visitings" [...] of mountains and moors and coasts would intrude to make the confinement of deep lanes seem increasingly irksome. Each day I wandered miles in some new direction, never knowing whither the devious path would lead me, never inquiring of any person, nor consulting map or guide, since {{to do that is to}} deprive oneself of the pleasure of discovery; always with a secret wish to find some exit as it were--some place beyond the everlasting wall of high hedges and green trees, where there would be a wide horizon and wind blowing unobstructed over leagues of open country to bring me back the sense of lost liberty. I found only fresh woods and pastures new that were like the old; other lanes leading to other farm-houses, each in its familiar pretty setting of orchard and garden; and, finally, other ancient villages, each with its ivy-grown grey church tower looking down on a green graveyard and scattered cottages, mostly mud-built and thatched with straw. Finding no outlook on any side I went back to the streams, oftenest to the Otter, where, lying by the hour on the bank, I watched the <b>speckled</b> <b>trout</b> below me and the dark-plumaged dipper with shining white breast standing solitary and curtseying on a stone in the middle of the current. Sometimes a kingfisher would flash by, and occasionally I came upon a lonely grey heron; but no mammal bigger than a watervole appeared, although I waited and watched for the much bigger beast that gives the river its name. Still it was good to know that he was there, and had his den somewhere in the steep rocky bank under the rough tangle of ivy and bramble and roots of overhanging trees. One was shot by a farmer during my stay, but my desire was for the living, not a dead otter. Consequently, when the otter-hunt came with blaze of scarlet coats and blowing of brass horns and noise of barking hounds and shouts of excited people, it had no sooner got half a mile above Ottery St. Mary, where I had joined the straggling procession, than, falling behind, the hunting fury died out of me and I was relieved to hear that no quarry had been found. The frightened moorhen stole back to her spotty eggs, the dipper returned to his dipping and curtseying to his own image in the stream, and I to my idle dreaming and watching.|$|E

50|$|The {{river is}} also home to bald eagles which make their home on old dead trees along the St. Mary's River, because of the food that await in the water below. If you are lucky, you may get to see one perched on an old tree as you drive along the St. Mary's River. Other common birds to see along the river are Osprey, Great-horned owls, and a wide range of hawks. Another {{resident}} of the St. Mary's River is the wood turtle, which is a protected species. Surveys have been done along the St. Mary's River to learn the wood turtle population, their diet, habitat, and breeding grounds. A common species of fish to see in the river and its many estuaries is the <b>Speckled</b> Brook <b>Trout,</b> which as makes its home in sheltered waters and underneath logs that have fallen in the brooks. The brook trout is also a food source for many of the birds along the St. Mary's River.|$|R
60|$|But it is {{the dolphin}} that is the king of deep-sea fishes. Never is his colour twice quite the same. Swimming in the sea, an {{ethereal}} creature of palest azure, he displays in that one guise a miracle of colour. But it is nothing compared with the displays {{of which he is}} capable. At one time he will appear green--pale green, deep green, phosphorescent green; at another time blue--deep blue, electric blue, all the spectrum of blue. Catch him on a hook, and he turns to gold, yellow gold, all gold. Haul him on deck, and he excels the spectrum, passing through inconceivable shades of blues, greens, and yellows, and then, suddenly, turning a ghostly white, in the midst of which are bright blue spots, and you suddenly discover that he is <b>speckled</b> like a <b>trout.</b> Then back from white he goes, through all the range of colours, finally turning to a mother-of-pearl.|$|R
