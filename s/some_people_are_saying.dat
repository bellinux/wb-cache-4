50|$|There {{are many}} ethical and social {{implications}} {{when dealing with}} agricultural drones.

This is a very important aspect as it allows for minimum pesticides to be used in order to attempt {{to reduce the amount of}} pesticides released into the environment.

On the other hand, however, a negative side of this is the unauthorized access drones receive when flying under 400 feet. Unauthorized access to flying freely is allowed if it is under 400 feet. When this is the case, and drones can have microphones and camera attached, it tends to leave a grey area of what is ethically okay to monitor.

Critics noted stylistic similarities on the album to Queen, Wings and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Rose cited influence of Dave Grohl's drumming on Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] in recording the title track of the album. The song was inspired by the movie Kundun about the Dalai Lama. The lyrics [...] "Blame it on the Falun Gong, They've seen the end and you can't hold on now" [...] from the song caused the album to be banned in China. The industrial-flavored [...] "Shackler's Revenge" [...] was written in reaction to [...] "the insanity of senseless school shootings and also the media trying desperately to make more out of one shooter's preference for the Guns song Brownstone to no avail", according to Rose.
