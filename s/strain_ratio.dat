40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the performance of strain elastography in an elasticity phantom and to assess which factors influenced visual scoring, strain histograms and <b>strain</b> <b>ratios.</b> Furthermore this study aimed to evaluate the effect of observer experience on visual scorings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two operators examined 20 targets of various stiffness and size (16. 7 to 2. 5 mm) in an elasticity phantom at a depth of 3. 5 cm with a 5 - 18 MHz transducer. Two pre-settings were used yielding 80 scans. Eight evaluators, four experienced, four inexperienced, performed visual scorings. Cut-offs for semi-quantitative methods were established for prediction of target stiffness. Data was pooled in two categories allowing calculations of sensitivity and specificity. Statistical tests chi-square test and linear regression as relevant. RESULTS: <b>Strain</b> <b>ratios</b> and <b>strain</b> histograms were superior to visual scorings of both experienced and inexperienced observers (p =  0. 025, strain histograms vs. experienced observers, p< 0. 001, strain histograms vs. inexperienced observers, p =  0. 044 <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> vs. experienced observers and p =  0. 002 <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> vs. inexperienced observers). No significant difference in predicting target stiffness between <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> and <b>strain</b> histograms (p =  0. 83) nor between experienced and inexperienced observers (p =  0. 054) was shown when using four categories. When pooling data in two groups (80 kPa/ 45 kPa vs. 14 / 8 kPa) the difference between the observers became significant (p< 0. 001). Target size had a significant influence on <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> measurements (p =  0. 017) and on visual scorings (p< 0. 001) but not on the strain histograms(p =  0. 358). Observer experience had significant effect on visual scorings(p =  0. 003). CONCLUSION: <b>Strain</b> <b>ratios</b> and <b>strain</b> histograms are superior to visual scoring in assessing target stiffness in a phantom. Target size had a significant impact on <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> and visual scoring, but not on strain histograms. Experience influenced visual scorings but the difference between experienced and inexperienced observers was only significant when looking at two classes of target stiffness...|$|R

The CFFT {{acts as a}} formwork for new columns and a barrier to corrosion accelerating agents. It significantly increases both the strength capacity (Strength enhancement ratio) and the ductility (<b>Strain</b> enhancement <b>ratio)</b> of reinforced concrete columns. In this study, based on predefined selection criteria, experimental investigation results of 134 circular CFFT columns under axial compression have been compiled and analysed from 599 CFFT specimens available in the literature. It has been observed that actual confinement ratio (expressed {{as a function of}} material properties of fibres, diameter of CFFT and compressive strength of concrete) has significant influence on the strength and ductility of circular CFFT columns. Design oriented models have been proposed to compute the strength and <b>strain</b> enhancement <b>ratios</b> of circular CFFT columns.

Methods: A total of 90 patients with thyroid cancer who accepted surgical treatment in our hospital between March 2015 and September 2016 were selected as the observation group, and 50 patients who received surgery in our hospital during the same period and were with clear pathological diagnosis of thyroid adenoma were selected as the control group. According to the median of ultrasonic elastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio,</b> the observing group were further divided into high elastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> group and low elastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> group (n= 45).

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{capabilities}} of Associated Flow Rule (AFR) and non-AFR based finite element models for sheet metal forming simulations is investigated. In case of non-AFR, Hill’s quadratic function used as plastic potential function, makes use of plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> to determine the direction of effective plastic strain rate. In addition, the yield function uses direction dependent yield stress data. Therefore more accurate predictions are expected {{in terms of both}} yield stress and <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> at different orientations. We implemented {{a modified version of the}} non-associative flow rule originally developed by Stoughton [1] into the commercial finite element code ABAQUS by means of a user material subroutine UMAT. The main algorithm developed includes combined effects of isotropic and kinematic hardening [2]. This paper assumes proportional loading cases and therefore only isotropic hardening effect is considered. In our model the incremental change of plastic strain rate tensor is not equal to the incremental change of the compliance factor. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing stresses and <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> obtained from finite element simulations with experimentally determined values for deep drawing steel DC 06.

40|$|ASTM {{standards}} {{are widely used}} to determine the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> r to characterize the normal anisotropy and the planar anisotropy of sheet metal. The values determined by mechanical testing are quoted at a strain of 15 %. These are used for comparing two techniques of measuring the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> or the anisotropy of two materials. The present work reports the variation in the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of prestrained material. The r values of biaxially prestrained steel sheet have been investigated using the ASTM as well as the magnetostrictive methods of measurement. An error analysis on the mechanical measurements has been performed to examine the agreement between the different definitions of the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> (r(r), r(int), r(t), and r(mxi)) and the accuracy (based on coefficient of variation), in view of the need to measure the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> at low strain levels. Various means to ensure accuracy in measurement are described. Plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of sheet deformed to different biaxial prestrains has also been characterized using the magnetostrictive method (Modul r test). It is found that the difference between the r values determined using the ASTM and the Modul r methods changes with strain and strain path. The nominal difference between the two methods was found to be comparatively consistent over strain paths ranging from plane strain to equibiaxial tension. The Modul r values for prestrains along these strain paths investigated were found to be relatively consistent and hence usable. For prestrain along the strain path beta = - 0. 45 (negative minor strain regime), the nominal difference was considerable. In view of the above, it is not appropriate to measure rapidly the r value of the material in the negative minor strain regime, in particular using magnetostrictive means, and to correct it using the "systematic error" between the two techniques. This restricts the usability of the Modul r test in measuring the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of deformed sheet metal, particularly after a prestrain in the negative minor strain region...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} ultrasound elastography as an additional technique in differentiating US indeterminate thyroid nodules in order to decrease the number of tissue biopsies. Methods: We evaluated 30 patients with 36 indeterminate thyroid nodules based on US, criteria, by US elastography, using both the elastography score and <b>strain</b> <b>ratio.</b> Baseband US data were downloaded for off-line analysis. Elastographic maps (color coding) and thyroid stiffness index (<b>strain</b> <b>ratio)</b> were calculated for all nodules, with histopathological results being the standard reference. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve {{analysis was used to}} determine the optimal cutoff <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> for separating benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Results: Malignant nodules had a higher degree of color and <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to benign nodules, with a statistically significant difference (p <  0. 05). Nodules with an elastography score of 2 were benign, while those with an elastography score of 4 and 5 were mostly malignant. Malignancy could not be excluded using ultrasound elastography criteria only, in nodules with a score of 3. The sensitivity and specificity of the US-elastography strain color coding for thyroid cancer diagnosis were 91 % and 72 % respectively. Using ROC analysis, the optimal cutoff <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> for separating benign and malignant thyroid nodules was found to be 1. 6 with a calculated 89 % sensitivity and 70 % specificity. The overall accuracy of strain color was slightly better than <b>strain</b> <b>ratio,</b> 91 % compared to 86 % respectively. Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography is an easy, non-invasive and rapid technique that can be routinely used in thyroid US scans to select cases for FNAC, and decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies, and consequently decrease the hazards and costs. However, future advances in image acquisition and reconstruction algorithms are required to improve the image quality and clinical usefulness of this technique...|$|E

Indirect evaluation of histologic damage can be performed with the help of palpation during operation. Hard texture of testes tissue is likely related with histological damage. Real-time elastography is an emerging technology of ultrasonic imaging of soft tissue strain and elasticity, it aims at providing information regarding the mechanical properties of tissues, such as their hardness or stiffness. This study aim was to investigate the changes in strain and elasticity of testes tissue by using elastography technique. Materials and methods: A total of 32 patients, who had undescended testes were included in this study. Only two patients had bilateral undescended testes, other patients had unilateral. The age of the patients were recorded according to the time of ultrasonographic (USG) examination. The undescended testes was displayed in the elastographic box with the neighbouring subcutaneous fat tissues. The <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> were measured as the ratios of the elasticities of the subcutaneous fat tissue to the elasticities of the undescended testes.

40|$|Background: Pathophysiological processes, such as malignancy, {{can lead}} to the {{formation}} of stiffer tissue in lung cancers. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a novel technique for measuring tissue stiffness during EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). The current study was conducted to investigate the diagnostic value of EBUS elastography for mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastasis in lung cancers. Methods: From January 2014 to January 2015, 40 patients suspected of lung cancer were enrolled, and a total of 68 lymph nodes were evaluated by EBUS-TBNA. EBUS-guided elastography of lymph nodes was performed prior to EBUS-TBNA. Standard EBUS characteristics were also described. Pathological determination of malignant or benign lymph nodes was used as the gold standard for this study. If EBUS-TBNA did not result in a formal pathological diagnosis of malignancy, patients were referred for a surgical procedure. Comparisons of elastography and standard EBUS characteristics were made between benign and malignant lymph nodes. Results: Elastography grading scores and strain ratios showed significant differences between benign and malignant lymph nodes (P = 0. 000). The elastography <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> was more sensitive and specific for determining malignant lymph nodes than elastography grading score or standard EBUS criteria. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the elastography <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> showed an area under the curve of 0. 933. The best cut-off point of the <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> for differentiating malignant from benign lymph nodes was 32. 07. The elastography <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> had a sensitivity of 88. 1 %, the specificity of 80. 8 %, positive predictive value of 88. 1 %, and negative predictive value of 80. 8 % for distinguishing malignant from benign nodes. The overall accuracy of elastography <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> was 85. 3 %. The <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of malignant and benign lymph nodes positively correlated with the elastography grading score (r = 0. 561, P = 0. 000). Conclusions: EBUS elastography can be effectively used to predict mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases in lung cancer.

Methods: We examined 84 thyroid nodules in 62 patients with ultrasound elastography. Elastography score was assigned based on a four-point scale according to the classification proposed by Itoh et al. with a score of 1 (low stiffness over the entire nodule) to a score of 4 (high stiffness over the entire nodule). Thyroid <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> (normal tissue to lesion <b>strain</b> <b>ratio)</b> was calculated. Histopathological results were the standard reference.

Results: Fifty-four of the 84 nodules had scores of 1 and 2, and 50 of these nodules were diagnosed histopathologically as benign. Thirty of the 84 nodules had a score of 3 and 4, and 21 of these nodules were diagnosed histopathologically as malignant. The scores of 1 and 2 with Itoh criteria were significantly seen in benign nodules, whereas, scores of 3 and 4 were significantly seen in malignant nodules (p <  0. 05) with sensitivity 84 %, specificity 84. 7 %, PPV 70 %, NPV 92. 6 % and accuracy 84. 5 %. The mean SR for the benign nodules and malignant ones was significantly different (2. 92  ±  0. 96 vs. 4. 53  ±  0. 82, p <  0. 001).

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have highlighted}} {{the shortcomings of}} traditional thinking about faults and fault patterns. The slip model of faulting, developed by Ze'ev Reches, suggests that four sets of faults, arranged in orthorhombic symmetry about the principal strain axes, can accommodate general, three-dimensional strain. Classic conjugate faults are simply a special case of plane strain. Careful analysis of orthorhombic fault patterns and the tenets of the slip model {{has led to the}} development of a practical method for decoding the strain significance of fault systems developed in three-dimensional strain fields. The methods are implicit in a model here called the odd-axis model. This new model calls special attention to the odd axis: the one principal strain with sign opposite the other two, assuming a constant volume deformation. Odd-axis medel equations relate fault set geometry to principal <b>strain</b> magnitudes or <b>ratios,</b> the internal friction angle, φ, and the ratio of average fault slip to average spacing between faults of the same set, R. For systems where R < 0. 1, the three principal <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> are given by tan²α, -sin²α, and -COS²α, where α is the strike of the fault set(s) measured in the plane perpendicular to the odd axis. The model also predicts slip vector orientations as functions of principal <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> and orientations. The kinematic implications of the odd-axis model are compatible with those of the slip model. In this first quantitative field test, both fault models are applied to the Chimney Rock array, a system of orthorhombic faults in the northern San Rafael Swell of central Utah. The odd-axis model uses fault plane and slip vector data from Chimney Rock to predict principal <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> (ε(y) /ε(x), ε(y) /ε(z), and ε(x) /ε(z)) of. 20, -. 16, and -. 84. These compare extremely well with the observed values, based on fault separation measurements, of. 17, -. 15, and -. 85. The value of ε(y) /ε(z) predicted by the slip model, -. 16, matches exactly the value predicted by the odd-axis model and nearly matches the observed value, which is -. 15. The success of the field test at Chimney Rock, and the conceptual agreement of both models, suggest that the new theory can accurately relate orthorhombic fault geometries and three-dimensional strain fields.

A purpose built biaxial loading mechanism was constructed to enable deformation {{across a wide}} range of <b>strain</b> <b>ratios.</b> Three nominal deformation conditions were compared: (1) uniaxial loading, ∊TD/∊RD=-ν, (2) biaxial deformation where ∊TD/∊RD= 0. 4, and (3) approximately balanced biaxial deformation, with ∊TD/∊RD= 1. 5. This novel setup allowed the full Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings to be acquired during arbitrary selected strain-paths, permitting lattice strains and reflection intensities to be measured across an unrivalled grain orientation range for such deformation conditions. This experiment reveals that the accumulation of lattice strain during deformation, as a function of azimuthal angle, is highly sensitive to strain path. For the ∊TD/∊RD= 1. 5 strain path, whilst lattice strain accumulates most rapidly in the ∊TD direction during early stages of plastic deformation, the lattice strain is shown to distribute almost perfectly isotropically for the observed orientations when plastic strain is high. This was found to be in contrast to strain paths where ∊TD/∊RD≪ 1. 5, demonstrating that lattice strain magnitudes remain highest in the direction parallel to the tensile axis with the highest applied load. Furthermore, the technique provides the capability to observe the evolution of texture fibres via changes in reflection intensity during different applied <b>strain</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study aims to {{evaluate}} the clinical value of ultrasound elastography (USE) in providing information {{on the nature of}} the thyroid nodules. This was performed using the elastography score and <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> in differentiating thyroid benign and malignant nodules and the histopathological examination was used as the diagnostic standard of reference. MethodsWe examined 84 thyroid nodules in 62 patients with ultrasound elastography. Elastography score was assigned based on a four-point scale according to the classification proposed by Itoh et al. with a score of 1 (low stiffness over the entire nodule) to a score of 4 (high stiffness over the entire nodule). Thyroid <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> (normal tissue to lesion <b>strain</b> <b>ratio)</b> was calculated. Histopathological results were the standard reference. The area under the curve (AUC) and the best cut-off point were both obtained using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both techniques were calculated. ResultsFifty-four of the 84 nodules had scores of 1 and 2, and 50 of these nodules were diagnosed histopathologically as benign. Thirty of the 84 nodules had a score of 3 and 4, and 21 of these nodules were diagnosed histopathologically as malignant. The scores of 1 and 2 with Itoh criteria were significantly seen in benign nodules, whereas, scores of 3 and 4 were significantly seen in malignant nodules (p< 0. 05) with sensitivity 84 %, specificity 84. 7 %, PPV 70 %, NPV 92. 6 % and accuracy 84. 5 %. The mean SR for the benign nodules and malignant ones was significantly different (2. 92 ± 0. 96 vs. 4. 53 ± 0. 82, p< 0. 001). With ROC analysis, the best cut-off <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> point was 3. 5 for differentiating benign and malignant nodules with area under the curve (AUC) = 0. 87 (0. 8 – 0. 95). The sensitivity of the <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> was 88 %, while the specificity was 86. 4 %, PPV= 73. 3 %, NPV= 94. 4 % and accuracy= 86. 9 %. ConclusionsBoth the elastographic score and <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> are higher in malignant nodules than those in benign ones. Ultrasound elastography can provide quantitative information on thyroid nodule helping in differentiating benign and malignant ones...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study {{the correlation between the}} normal testicular tissue elasticity as detected by real time sonoelastography with the age. Materials and methods: The study was conducted upon 63 adult healthy volunteers. Each volunteer was subjected to real time sonoelastography measuring the <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of testicular tissues and their elasticity scores. Result: Strain ratios of the examined testes ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 38, with a mean strain of 0. 33 and a standard deviation of 0. 03. Elasticity score of the examined testes included ES 1 in 62 testes (49 %), ES 2 in 58 testes (46 %) and ES 3 in 6 testes (5 %). No ES 4 or ES 5 was elicited in this group. High negative correlation is found between the age and both the testicular volume and the <b>strain</b> <b>ratio,</b> while there is no correlation between age and the elasticity score of testes. Conclusion: Normal testicular tissues as studies by sonoelastography show strong correlation between the age and the testicular volume as well as the <b>strain</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|Crystallization is {{studied for}} poly(isoprene- 1, 4 -cis) from Hevea brasiliensis (natural rubber [NR]) and from taraxacum kok-saghyz, mainly by {{collecting}} wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns after processing and stretching. Although rubber samples before stretching are generally fully amorphous, crystallization can be induced in NR samples by processing {{at room temperature}} under moderate pressure. This phenomenon is possibly associated with nucleation by saturated fatty acid components. For rubber samples being fully amorphous in the undeformed state, strain-induced crystallization occurs only at high <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> (α > 4), leading to high degrees of crystalline phase orientation (fc > 0. 9 for α = 5). Rubber samples presenting some crystallinity already in the unstretched state, on the contrary, reach much lower degrees of axial orientation, even for high <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> (fc < 0. 7 for α = 5). These differences in crystallinity and in crystalline phase orientations produce large differences in stress–strain behavior of the rubber. By room temperature processing, the considered NR samples can also develop an unreported disordered crystalline modification, with low intensity of 120 and 121 reflections. This disordered crystalline modification, which is also maintained after axial stretching procedures, can rationalized by a structural disorder along the b axis, possibly associated with statistical sequences of A+TA− or A−T A+ conformations for poly(isoprene- 1, 4 -cis) chains.
