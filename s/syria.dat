Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first outbreak in <b>Syria</b> since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies report more than 90 cases of polio in <b>Syria,</b> with fears of contagion in rebel areas from lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E

5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of his life in the modern state of <b>Syria</b> where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between <b>Syria</b> and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and <b>Syria</b> were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and <b>Syria</b> would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} <b>Syria.</b> Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. <b>Syria</b> has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, <b>Syria</b> stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{verbally}} {{dismissed the}} French order expelling {{him and his}} family from <b>Syria,</b> Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure from <b>Syria</b> marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in <b>Syria.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman <b>Syria.</b> Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into <b>Syria,</b> towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the waterless Syrian desert, to the surprise of the Byzantines, he appeared in northern <b>Syria.</b> Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Hananu and Alawite revolts, the French {{authorities}} discovered pacifying northern <b>Syria</b> was a more difficult task than pacification of the Damascus region. Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt, some political leaders in Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern <b>Syria</b> and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland, but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in <b>Syria,</b> following agreements with France, caused a deterioration in Syrian-Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern <b>Syria</b> feeling betrayed. Disillusionment with Mustafa Kemal's policies regarding <b>Syria</b> made Turkey's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo's Arab nationalists. In the few years after the revolt, Aleppo's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule. This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the battle, the Abbasid forces were forced to {{withdraw}} from <b>Syria,</b> and Tulunid control over the province was reaffirmed.

5|$|As president, Quwatli {{continued}} {{to press for}} Syrian independence from France. In a bid to garner American and British support for his government, he declared war against the Axis Powers, aligning <b>Syria</b> with the Allies. Growing countrywide unrest in response to French Mandatory rule led to French military assaults against Damascus and other Syrian cities in May 1945. More French troops were scheduled to land in <b>Syria</b> to aid the authorities, but at Quwatli's request for intervention, British troops invaded <b>Syria</b> from Transjordan, entering Damascus on 1 June. The French military campaign came to an immediate halt as a consequence; the UK and the US had viewed the French military action in <b>Syria</b> as a potential catalyst for further unrest throughout the Middle East and a detriment to British and American lines of communication in the region.|$|E

Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to <b>Syria</b> after the French issued amnesty for political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought to topple the French authorities in <b>Syria</b> and align the country with the ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz.
