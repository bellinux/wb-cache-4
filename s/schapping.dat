40|$|The {{transcriptional}} regulator HAP 4, {{induced by}} respiratory substrates, {{is involved in}} the balance between fermentation and respiration in S. cerevisiae. We identified putative orthologues of the Hap 4 protein in all ascomycetes, based only on a conserved sixteen amino acid-long motif. In addition to this motif, some of these proteins contain a DNA-binding motif of the bZIP type, while being nonetheless globally highly divergent. The genome of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha contains two HAP 4 -like genes encoding the protein HpHap 4 -A which, like <b>ScHap</b> 4, is devoid of a bZIP motif, and HpHap 4 -B which contains it. This species has been chosen for a detailed examination of their respective properties. Based mostly on global gene expression studies performed in the S. cerevisiae HAP 4 disruption mutant (ScDhap 4), we show here that HpHap 4 -A is functionally equivalent to <b>ScHap</b> 4, whereas HpHap 4 -B is not.

500|$|It {{may have}} been {{possible}} for the husband of an epikleros to allow the posthumous adoption of {{the son of an}} epikleros as the son of the epikleros' [...] father. This would prevent the inheritance of the newly adopted son of any property from his natural father, but it had the advantage of preserving the adoptee's oikos, commonly translated as [...] "household" [...] but incorporating ideas of kinship and property also. Although the preservation of the paternal oikos is usually felt to be the reason behind the whole practice of the epiklerate, the historian David <b>Schaps</b> argues that in fact, this was not really the point of the practice. Instead, he argues, that it was the practice of adoption that allowed the preservation of an oikos. <b>Schaps</b> feels that the reason the epiklerate evolved was to ensure that orphaned daughters were married. Other historians, including Sarah Pomeroy, feel that the children of an epikleros were considered to transmit the paternal grandfather's oikos. The historian Cynthia Patterson agrees, arguing that adoption may have seemed unnecessary, especially if the epikleros and her husband gave their son the name of the maternal grandfather. She argues that too much {{attention has been paid to}} the patrilineal aspects of the oikos, and that there was probably less emphasis on this in actual Athenian practice and more on keeping a household together as a productive unit.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{construct}} non-negative gradings on a basic Brauer tree algebra AΓ corresponding to an arbitrary Brauer tree Γ of type (m,e). We {{do this by}} transferring gradings via derived equivalence from a basic Brauer tree algebra AS, whose tree is a star with the exceptional vertex in the middle, to AΓ. The grading on AS comes from the tight grading given by the radical filtration. To transfer gradings via derived equivalence we use tilting complexes constructed by taking Green’s walk around Γ (cf. <b>Schaps</b> and Zakay-Illouz (2001)  [17]). By computing endomorphism rings of these tilting complexes we get graded algebras. We also compute OutK(AΓ), the group of outer automorphisms that fix the isomorphism classes of simple AΓ-modules, where Γ is an arbitrary Brauer tree, and we prove that there is unique grading on AΓ up to graded Morita equivalence and rescaling...|$|R

40|$|Background / Context: The social {{dynamics}} {{of elementary school}} classrooms are complex, encompassing patterns of affiliation (friendships, cliques), status (acceptance, rejection, popularity) and social behavior (bullying, victimization, helping). Social dynamics {{have important implications for}} FKLOGUHQ¶Vsocial and academic adjustment. For example, in classrooms with relatively wide disparities in status, peer norms are more supportive of aggression (Ahn, Garandeau, & Rodkin, 2010); whereas children who perceive their classroom to be a caring community of students are more motivated in school (Battistich, Solomon, Kim, Watson, & <b>Schaps,</b> 1995). Teachers may {{play an important role in}} these classroom {{social dynamics}}, as well as the overall social-affective climate of the classroom (Gest & Rodkin, 2011; Hamm, Farmer, Dadisman, Gravelle, & Murray, 2011). A growing focus on the role of classroom relationships in FKLOGUHQ¶V social and academic outcomes has led researchers to examine how teachers might foster positive classroom social dynamics (Hamm et al., 2011). Because many strategies to manipulate classroom social dynamics involve subtle actions that may go unnoticed by students, they are often described as the WHDFKHU¶VLQYLVLEOHKDQG´&DLUQV 	 &DLUQV 1994) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{transcriptional}} regulator HAP 4, whose {{expression is}} induced on respiratory substrates, {{has been shown}} to be involved in the balance between fermentation and respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have previously identified a HAP 4 orthologue in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, called HpHAP 4 -A, which, despite its very limited sequence conservation (a 16 amino acid N-terminal motif), is fully functional in S. cerevisiae. Based on the same N-terminal motif, a second gene has now been identified in the same organism. It was shown to contain an additional cis-binding motif of the bZip type. We report on the cloning, heterologous expression and analysis in S. cerevisiae of this novel <b>ScHAP</b> 4 orthologue. From these experiments we could conclude that, as with HpHAP 4 -A, the novel orthologue, designated HpHAP 4 -B, could functionally replace the S. cerevisiae gene but to a lesser extent. The relationship between the presence of the additional cis-binding motif and the weaker potential as a HAP 4 functional homologue is discussed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that many factors may impede teachers 2 ̆ 7 {{ability to develop}} caring relationships with students such as the school environment (<b>Schaps,</b> 2009), lack of cultural understanding (Thompson, 1998), the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and attitudes about care (Goldstein, 2002), and personal experience of being cared for (Noddings, 1984). Yet, little research exists on how schools can address these and other potential limiting factors {{in order to help}} teachers cultivate caring relationships with students. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how one school in India, which claims to emphasize the importance of the teacher-student relationship, develops and supports teachers 2 ̆ 7 capacities to create caring relationships with students. The hope was that the outcomes might provide insight for policy-makers, school administrators, and teachers about what is needed to best support teachers in their relationships with students. The research site for this study was a pre-Kindergarten through 12 th grade private school in India. The choice of India as a cultural context stemmed from the historical precedence of the importance of the teacher-student relationship. A mixed-methods descriptive case study served as the design for this study. Qualitative methods included interviews of teachers, administrators, and students, classroom and event observations, and document analysis. Quantitative methods included surveys of teachers and students. The qualitative data were analyzed using Noddings 2 ̆ 7 (1984) four methods for teaching care (modeling, dialogue, practice, and confirmation) with other themes added as needed. Descriptive statistics and factor analyses of both surveys were used to triangulate and expand upon the qualitative data. Findings indicated that schools can support teachers 2 ̆ 7 capacity to care for students through a strong commitment to the teacher-student relationship, deliberate fostering of relationships between students, teachers, and parents, and through the modeling by and direct receipt of care from administrators. Other factors that may help teachers to care for students include cultural respect for the teaching profession and acknowledgement of care from both students and parents.
