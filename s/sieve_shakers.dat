Therefore, periodic {{particle size}} evaluation is a neces-sary component of a feed manufacturing quality assurance pro-gram. The purpose of this bulletin is to de-scribe the equipment, procedure, costs, and interpretation of particle size analysis. Equipment The equipment required for particle size analysis includes a scale, <b>shaker,</b> <b>sieves,</b> sieve cleaners, and brushes. A scale that is accurate to ± 0. 1 grams is required (ASAE, 1993). There are two types of scales avail-able: electronic and triple-beam balance. A triple-beam balance costs approximately $ 600 less than an electronic top-loading balance. The recommended <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker</b> is a Tyler RoTap (Mentor, OH). The RoTap mechanically reproduces the circular motion that occurs during hand sieving, {{while at the same time}} tapping the sieve stack to help the particles fall through the mesh screens.

30|$|The {{drying process}} {{parameters}} {{considered for the}} study were drying temperature and drying time. Preliminary tests were allowed to fix the limits of these factors. The seed kernel cotyledons were laid on a tray and dried using fixed temperatures and times according to the central composite design (CCD), in a tropical oven dryer [15]. The air velocity in the drying chamber was constant (0.55  ms− 1), and the relative humidity of the chamber was 75 [*]±[*] 3 % (Hanna Instruments HI 8564 Thermo hygrometer, Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, USA).

40|$|A {{physical}} separation method (i. e. sieving) was investigated to determine {{particle size distribution}} in non-radioactive sludge slurry simulants {{with the goal of}} implementation into the SRNL (Savannah River National Laboratory) shielded cells for use with radioactive sludge slurries. The investigation included obtaining the necessary experimental equipment, developing accessory equipment for use with the <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker</b> (to be able to sieve simulant slurries with aqueous solutions), sieving three different simulant slurries through a number of sieves and determining the particle size distribution gravimetrically, and developing a sufficient cleaning protocol of the sieves for re-use. The experimental protocol involved successive sieving of a NIST standard (to check the particle size retention of the sieves) and three non-radioactive slurry simulants (Batch 3 Tank 40 Test 3, Tank 40 Drum 3 and CETL Sludge Batch 2, which had been previously characterized by Microtrac analysis) through smaller and smaller sieves (150 microns x 5 microns) via use of the wet sieving system or by hand. For each of the three slurries, duplicate experiments were carried out using filtered supernate and DI water (to check the accuracy of the method versus Microtrac data) to sieve the slurry. Particle size determinations using the wet sieving system with DI water agree well with Microtrac data on a volume basis and in some cases the sieving data may be more accurate particularly if the material sieved had large particles. A correction factor had to be applied to data obtained from experiments done with supernate due to the dissolved solids which dried upon the sieves in the drying stage of the experiments. Upon subtraction of the correction factors, the experimental results were very similar to those obtained with DI water. It should be noted that approximately 250 mL of each of three simulant slurries was necessary to have enough filtered supernate available to carry out the experiments. The experimental results for the slurries are below with Microtrac data. The design of the experimental equipment was sufficient initially, but some pieces of the equipment began failing over time due to the caustic nature of the supernate and the vibrations from the <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker.</b> It is therefore recommended that upgrades to the experimental equipment be done before implementation into the SRNL shielded cells. Theses upgrades include using manipulator friendly connections, changing brass parts for stainless steel parts, using Teflon rather than polycarbonate, and possibly a change of pumps used to re-circulate the sieving fluid...|$|R

This study involved the determination of mean particle size of flour from two different classes of wheat, hard red winter (HRW) and soft white (SW), at sieving times of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 min. Particle size measured by sieve analysis was compared with size as measured using laser diffraction. It was found that sieving time and wheat class {{had a significant effect}} on the measured final particle size. Increase in sieving time reduced the calculated average particle size of the flour. The mean particle size for HRW and SW flour was 110. 98 µm and 570. 29 µm, respectively, at 14 min of sieving. The mean particle size as measured by laser diffraction was 45. 6 µm and 44. 5 µm for HRW and SW flour, respectively. A flow agent helped the flour particles overcome the interparticle cohesive force during sieving and resulted in a smaller particle size with better size distribution. However, due to the higher cohesiveness of SW flour, flow agent at 0. 5 % of the sample mass had no effect on the measured mean particle size.

However, narrow granule size distributions are difficult to achieve. This study aims to elucidate the effect of process parameters such as liquid feed rate and screw configuration on the granule attributes through granule characterization. The methods used are sieve analysis (for size distribution), liquid distribution (determining the dye concentration in the granules) and density and porosity (percentage gas volume in the granule) analyses. A <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker</b> is used to divide granules into different size ranges {{in order to have}} the size distribution data. Liquid distribution analysis can be achieved by taking samples through sonication, centrifugation and measuring the absorbance of supernatant (clear solution after centrifuging) via a UV spectrophotometer. The concentration profile can be calculated utilizing the proper calibration curve. To obtain granule porosity, first absolute density is measured using a helium pycnometer, and then the samples are analyzed in the envelope density analyzer, which calculates percent porosity. The primary results indicate liquid is not distributed uniformly throughout all size ranges and the size distribution plots are bimodal, indicating poor mixing and inefficient and non-uniform breakage. Increasing the liquid feed rate decreases the amount of fines in the granule. Increasing the residence time in the twin screw does not change the granule size distribution but does significantly decrease the granule porosity. These results will help understanding the physics inside the twin screw granulator and facilitate the modeling work...|$|R

Industrial Flour (IF), Pre treatment and post treatment Palm Kernel Meal (PKM) and Palm Kernel Cake (PKC) are chosen for this research as filler for the comparison in wood adhesive production. Melamine Urea Formaldehyde (MUF) resin is selected as the resin for wood adhesive production because of less costly and high water resistant compared to Melamine Formaldehyde (MF) and Urea Formaldehyde (UF) resins (Dunky, 2003). This is because the cost of MUF resins depends on the ratio of melamine and urea. The objective is to compare the types of filler use for wood adhesive production in term of working properties and its quality.

40|$|Heavy {{metals in}} {{wastewater}} exhibit a global concern of environment {{due to its}} toxicity characteristics to many organisms. Adsorption {{can be used for}} high separation efficiency of heavy metals in waste water. This method widely used in this industry using different type of adsorbent. The use of low-cost adsorbents has been investigated as a replacement for current costly methods of removing heavy metals from solution. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential of rock melon shell waste as alternative adsorbent to adsorb Cd (II), Ni (II) and Cu (II) ions on aqueous solution. In this research, rock melon shell is used to replace the highly cost adsorbent used in the waste water industry The rock melon shell will be dried, ground and separate by their size through <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker.</b> Then, the rock melon shell powder was activated in the furnace at temperature range 400 ˚C - 650 ˚C. The prepared adsorbent and adsorbate were used for testing the removal effect of the heavy metals by manipulating the parameters of solution pH, contact time and adsorbent dosage. The results were analyzed by using the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). The optimal process conditions were used for kinetic and adsorption equilibrium. The percentage removal of Cd (II), Ni (II) and Cu (II) had been measured and modeled. The percent adsorption of Cd (II), Ni (II) and Cu (II) increased with increased in pH, contact time and adsorbent dosage. However, it tends to achieve equilibrium state once the active sites of the adsorbent are fully occupied. The condition where it gave the highest percentage removal is at 120 minutes contact time, at pH= 8 and adsorbent dosage of 0. 3 g which is exceed 99 %. Adsorption of Cd (II), Ni (II) and Cu (II) ions from aqueous solution approved the second-order kinetic yielding good R 2 values of 1. 00 and k values of 0. 0781 to 0. 177...|$|R
40|$|Many liquids, {{including}} water {{have been}} used as lubricants since the Roman era to minimize the friction, heat, and wear between mechanical parts in contact with each other. Today, lubricating oil, or lube oil, is the most commonly used lubricant because of its wide range of possible applications. Recently, pollution and environmental health aspects have become increasingly important as public issues. The increased environmental awareness is a primary driving force for the new technological developments. Nowadays, the increasing application of biobased lubricants could significantly reduce environmental pollution and contribute to the replacement of petroleum base oils. Vegetable oils are recognized as rapidly biodegradable and are thus promising candidates for use as base fluids in formulation of environment friendly lubricants. Future lubricants also have to be more environmentally adapted, have a higher level of performance, and lower total life cycle cost (LCC) than presently used lubricants. Thus, this research aims to produce a standard lubricant from Moringa oleifera seeds oil which is more environmentally friendly and has higher level of performance based on ASTM standard. All the Moringa oleifera seeds have been dried at 70 °C before the samples were grinded and sieved for 250 μm in size by using grinder and <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker.</b> The Moringa oleifera seeds oil then was extracted by using 200 mL n- hexane in soxhlet extractor with 10 g of Moringa oleifera seeds. The sample was put into the rotary evaporator to remove the n-hexane and get the pure Moringa oleifera oil. The basic filtration was done to remove all the small particles in the oil. Then, some tests were conducted to measure the parameters and the correlation of the properties to the ASTM standards as light machine lubricant. From the experiments, the Moringa oleifera oil kinematic viscosity was 43. 813 mm 2 /s at 40 °C and 8. 974 mm 2 /s at 100 °C, density was 0. 915 g/cm 3, cloud point was 12 °C, pour point was 8 °C, and has viscosity index of 192. Therefore, it should be considered as lubricant for gear according to ASTM Standar...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{we observed}} important {{differences in the}} feed preferences of pigs resulting from changes in only 1 dietary ingredient. The present experiment was conducted to study {{the relationship between the}} feed preference values of feeds reported previously and their particle size and texture characteristics. The effect of individual feed ingredients was studied when added to a common basal diet. In addition to the basal diet, which included rice, a soybean meal product containing 56 % CP, sunflower oil, and wheat bran, a total of 126 diets were studied. Of these, 63 were prepared by replacing the rice in the basal diet with another cereal, 29 by replacing the soybean product with different protein sources, 19 by replacing the sunflower oil with different lipid sources, and 6 by replacing the wheat bran with different fiber sources. Cereals were studied at inclusion rates of 150, 300, and 600 g·kg - 1; protein sources were studied at 50, 100, and 200 g·kg - 1; lipids were studied at 15, 30, and 100 g·kg- 1; and fiber sources were studied at 65 and 130 g·kg- 1. The particle size profile of all the diets was determined by using a 9 -screen <b>sieve</b> <b>shaker.</b> The geometric mean particle size, particle size uniformity, number of particles per gram, surface area (cm 2 ·g- 1), and percentage of fine (passing through a 250 -μm sieve) and coarse particles (remaining in a 2, 000 -|μm sieve) were calculated. The texture properties (hardness, fragility, chewing work, and adhesiveness) of the feeds were also determined by using a texture analyzer. The Pearson correlation coefficients of these variables with feed preference were as follows: geometric mean particle size (r = 0. 07; P = 0. 45), particle size uniformity (r = 0. 16; P = 0. 07), number of particles per gram (r = - 0. 05; P = 0. 61), surface area (r = - 0. 07; P= 0. 46), percentage of coarse particles (r = 0. 04; P = 0. 65), percentage of fine particles (r = - 0. 12; P = 0. 19), hardness (r = - 0. 21; P = 0. 02), fragility (r = - 0. 20; P = 0. 03), chewing work (r = - 0. 33; P < 0. 001), and adhesiveness (r = 0. 02; P = 0. 78). It was concluded that the texture properties of the feed could explain in part the feed preferences observed in pigs, whereas particle size characteristics had less impact...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{organization of}} plant organs and tissues determine the intake potential through {{the ease of}} forage particle breakdown, {{the nature of the}} particles produced as well as the rate of passage from the rumen. The cell wall content of forages influences the amount of energy required for chewing, and accounts for a considerable proportion of the total energy requirement. In the past, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) has been used as the only feed characteristic to predict the filling effects of forages, but there is substantial evidence that NDF alone is inadequate to make these predictions. Forage fragility is defined as the relative rate at which the particle size of forages are reduced during processes such as chewing or milling, and forage fragility might be related to lignin concentration and digestibility, as well as to anatomical differences among plant species. The physical characteristics of feedstuffs are not measured regularly, and these physical characteristics in relation to their nutritional properties should be taken into account for more precise feed formulation. Through the measurement of grinding energy, the possibility exists to predict forage fragility as related to the chemical composition of forages, which could lead to improved predictions of animal chewing activity and energy usage during the process of chewing. In order to investigate the possibility of developing a model for the prediction of forage fragility, twenty eight different forage samples were collected from 11 different locations. Samples included legumes, C 3 - and C 4 - grasses. Dried samples were analysed for various chemical components, as well as 24 -hour in vitro NDF digestibility (ivNDFd) and rate of NDF degradation (NDFkd). Dried samples were pre-cut with a knife mill, fitted with a 2 cm screen, after which particle size distribution for each sample was determined using a Retsch <b>Sieve</b> <b>shaker.</b> Ten g duplicate samples were milled with a laboratory hammer mill and an ultra-centrifugal mill, both fitted with a 1 mm screen, for the measurement of grinding energy. During the grinding process, energy usage of the specific mill was measured using a data logger with corresponding computer software and energy transducer. Energy measurements were reported as J/g sample on dry matter (DM) basis. The 2 cm samples were milled with the knife mill again, fitted with a 1 mm screen, after which particle size distribution was determined again to analyse change in particle distribution for each forage sample. The results of this study indicated that dry matter, nitrogen, ivNDFd, NDFkd and initial particle size (IPS) can all be associated with increased forage fragility, as there was a decrease in energy usage during grinding with an increase in any of the aforementioned components. The acid detergent fibre (ADF), NDF, total phenols (TP), non-tannic phenols (NTP), as well as the % change in particle size can all be associated with decreased forage fragility, as there was an increase in energy usage during grinding with an increase in any one of these components. It would be expected that acid detergent lignin (ADL) is also associated with decreased forage fragility; however, this can only be assumed as the results for the effect of lignin on forage fragility are inconclusive in this study. Literature on energy requirement for milling operations of forages is inadequate. Grinding energy is related to the stem mechanical properties (such as maximum cutting force and stem shear strength), and physical properties (such as stem diameter, DM density and moisture content). The use of grinding energy has the potential be a practical and useful measure to predict forage fragility, however, the relative contribution of factors such as original particle size, shape, surface area, morphology and many other factors toward the fragility of forages is difficult to predict. More research is needed on the prediction of forage fragility before it can be incorporated as a meaningful input into nutritional models such as NRC, CNCPS and AMTS.
