The report describes ideas for implementing {{control of the}} directional cylindrical antenna. It describes problematic issues and gives solutions to them. The report describes a tested prototype solution. It describes that changes made on the ECCM unit and the PRO unit are all made in software. It describes a possible design solution of a new <b>unit</b> to <b>control</b> the antenna <b>switch.</b> This unit is called the antenna <b>switch</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and is supplied and controlled from the Radio relay unit. The system is designed to function in the master station in Point to multipoint communication.

In this paper, we deal with topology control of the transmission network as a congestion management resource and evaluate the impacts of topology control on the European electricity network. To do this, we co-optimize unit commitment and transmission switching over 24 hours and we use a decomposition scheme to tackle the resulting large-scale problem. Our analysis is conducted on different scenarios of load and renewable power generation. We find that topology control results in significant cost savings within Europe {{which tend to be}} inversely related to net load. The robustness of our results is supported by an extensive sensitivity analysis.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} a test {{procedure}} to diagnose and visualize errors in linearity of digitizing tablets. Errors of linearity are caused by the distortion of the x- and y-co-ordinates of the digitizing tablet. This results in a given object apparently having different dimensions when recorded on different locations of the digitizing surface. The test is performed by systematic recording of n equally spaced points from a calibrated test foil. Algorithms were developed to calculate the difference matrices DXji and DYji between expected and observed values of the co-ordinates. Three-dimensional mapping of the non-linearity of the x- and y-co-ordinates was performed by the UNIRAS-geopak®, a 3 -D surface representative system. The tested digitizers showed varying degrees of scaling errors, fields of non-linearity, and random noise. Most digitizers allow for correction of scaling by setting of <b>switches</b> in the <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> A method is suggested for correction of non-linearities by use of the DXji and DYji matrices in the digitizing programme...|$|R
40|$|A net-changing {{device for}} use with the Lowestoft {{multipurpose}} sampler is described. The unit consists of four nets mounted on stainless steel rods which are spring loaded and slide between stainless steel runners. The nets are held by metal "fingers " when not fishing, and by operating an electric motor they can be released instantaneously to the fishing posi-tion. Water enters the net through a standard nose cone via a trumpet-insert of fibreglass. The amount of water filtered is registered by an electric flowmeter mounted in the nose cone, and the depth at which the sample is taken is recorded by a pressure transducer. Nets can be selected by depressing a <b>switch</b> on the <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> and the flow, depth and number of the net fishing register on meters mounted in the same unit.

30|$|General {{methods for}} all Fire and Fire Surrogate study sites were {{developed}} for each site. The design included 12 experimental <b>units,</b> including three <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> three burn units, three fire surrogate units (thinning, mowing, etc.), and three units where {{fire and the}} surrogate treatment both occurred. Units were specified as roughly 10 ha to accommodate breeding bird surveys. At Mission Creek, 12 of a possible 30 potential units were randomly chosen as experimental units, on which one of four treatments was to be applied with three replications: a control, a low thinning (the “fire surrogate” treatment), a burn, and a thin/burn treatment. Treatments were randomly assigned but one burn unit was <b>switched</b> with a <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> due to the logistics of fire control. Thinning was completed in Spring 2003, and burning was scheduled for Spring 2004. However, due to a warm late winter in 2004, spring greenup on units occurred earlier than usual and the wildfire season commenced earlier than usual as well. Only 4 of the 6 burn treatments (2 burn and 2 thin/burn) were accomplished, so the design for the first post-treatment measurement period is unbalanced: 4 control, 4 thin, 2 burn, and 2 thin/burn. Statistical analyses use this unbalanced design (in contrast to the originally planned balanced design with three replications per treatment). The 2 units left unburned were burned in Spring 2006 to rebalance the design for longer-term study, but results are expressed here on the design in place up to 2004.|$|R

40|$|This work proposes three <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> {{strategies}} for aggregated heating, ventilation, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings to track the automatic generation control (AGC) signal in smart grid. The existing control strategies include the direct load control strategy and the setpoint regulation strategy. The direct load control strategy cannot track the AGC signal when the state of charge (SOC) of the aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) exceeds their regulation capacity, while the setpoint regulation strategy provides flexible regulation capacity, but causes larger tracking errors. To improve the tracking performance, we took {{the advantages of the}} two control modes and developed three <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies. The <b>control</b> strategies <b>switch</b> between the direct load control mode and the setpoint regulation mode according to different switching indices.
