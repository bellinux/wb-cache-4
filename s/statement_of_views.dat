6000|$|Certain of {{the poems}} in [...] "Lustra" [...] have {{offended}} admirers of the verse of the [...] "Personae" [...] period. When a poet alters or develops, many of his admirers are sure to drop off. Any poet, {{if he is to}} survive as a writer beyond his twenty-fifth year, must alter; he must seek new literary influences; he will have different emotions to express. This is disconcerting to that public which likes a poet to spin his whole work out of the feelings of his youth; which likes to be able to open a new volume of his poems with the assurance {{that they will be able}} to approach it exactly as they approached the preceding. They do not like that constant readjustment which the following of Mr. Pound's work demands. Thus has [...] "Lustra" [...] been a disappointment to some; though it manifests no falling off in technique, and no impoverishment of feeling. Some {{of the poems}} (including several of the [...] "Contemporanea") are a more direct <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> than Pound's verse had ever given before. Of these poems, M. Jean de Bosschère writes: ...|$|E
60|$|Altiora wasn't at this dinner. When {{she came}} matters were apt to become confusedly strenuous. There {{was always a}} slight and ineffectual {{struggle}} at the end {{on the part of}} Margaret to anticipate Altiora's overpowering tendency to a rally and the establishment of some entirely unjustifiable conclusion by a COUP-DE-MAIN. When, however, Altiora was absent, the quieter influence of the Cramptons prevailed; temperance and information for its own sake prevailed excessively over dinner and the play of thought.... Good Lord! what bores the Cramptons were! I wonder I endured them as I did. They had all of them the trick of lying in wait conversationally; they had no sense of the self-exposures, the gallant experiments in statement that are necessary for good conversation. They would watch one talking with an expression exactly like peeping through bushes. Then they would, as it were, dash out, dissent succinctly, contradict some secondary fact, and back to cover. They gave one twilight nerves. Their wives were easier but still difficult at a stretch; they talked a good deal about children and servants, but with an air caught from Altiora of making observations upon sociological types. Lewis gossiped about the House in an entirely finite manner. He never raised a discussion; nobody ever raised a discussion. He would ask what we thought of Evesham's question that afternoon, and Edward would say it was good, and Mrs. Willie, who had been behind the grille, would think it was very good, and then Willie, parting the branches, would say rather conclusively that he didn't think it was very much good, and I would deny hearing the question in order to evade a profitless <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> in that vacuum, and then we would cast about in our minds for some other topic of equal interest....|$|E

5000|$|In the Latin creed {{put forth}} {{at this meeting}} there was {{inserted}} a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> drawn up by Potamius of Lisbon and Hosius of Cordoba, which, {{under the name of}} the Sirmian Manifesto, as it afterwards came to be known, threw the Church into disorder. In this statement the assembled prelates, while declaring their confession in [...] "One God, the Father Almighty, and in His only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, generated from Him before the ages," [...] recommended the disuse of the terms ousia (essence or substance), homoousion (identical in essence, or substance), and homoiousion (similar in essence, or substance), [...] "by which the minds of many are perturbed"; and they held that there [...] "ought to be no mention of any of them at all, nor any exposition of them in the Church, and for this reason and for this consideration that there is nothing written about them in divine Scripture and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding" [...] (Athan., De Syn., xxviii; Soz., ii, xxx; Hil., De Syn., xi). In spite of the scriptural disclaimer against the employment of inscrutable terms, nearly all parties perceived that the Manifesto was a subtly Anomoean document.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the debate on the}} influence of incentives on the occurrence of the so-called preference reversal phenomenon. Firstly, the participants' views on the issue and the main shifts in the debate are identified. Secondly, the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> and the shifts in the debate are analyzed within the framework of 'escape moves (Kitcher 1993). In this analysis the focus is on attempts to resolve particular inconsistencies in the statements and on the ability of proposed solutions to induce a community decision to alter more or less permanently a portion of its established practices. The analysis brings to light the negotiation process in which the significance and meaning of the contested issue is not settled by adopting certain rules in a mechanical way but is worked out by context-dependent interpretations of the community of specialists. experimental economics, Duhemian situation, incentives, negotiations, preference reversals, scope of economics,...|$|R

(7) Ursule Mirouët embodies {{important}} philosophical <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> Balzac’s <b>view</b> <b>of</b> life, {{in particular}} {{his belief in}} Mesmer’s theory of animal magnetism. Through Dr Minoret’s experience of the occult, his séance with the mysterious hypnotist and the elderly female medium, he becomes a Christian believer: here in La Comédie humaine the finite is seen as being embedded within the infinite; animal magnetism underpins a belief in God. Balzac views Dr Minoret’s rejection of religious indifference as the necessary accompaniment of his rejection of his earlier denial of animal magnetism.|$|R

50|$|During the 19th century, and, in particular, during Liverpool's time in office, Catholic {{emancipation}} was {{a source}} of great conflict. In 1805, in his first important <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> his <b>views</b> on the subject, Liverpool had argued that the special relationship of the monarch with the Church of England, and the refusal of Roman Catholics to take the oath of supremacy, justified their exclusion from political power. Throughout his career, he remained opposed to the idea of Catholic emancipation, though did see marginal concessions as important to the stability of the nation.|$|R

He lived in Redesdale House in Kilmacud, just outside Dublin, where he could garden. He was concerned to reform the Church of Ireland and the Irish Poor Laws.
