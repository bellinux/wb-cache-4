5000|$|PVA {{usually has}} an {{underlying}} cause, attributed to existing skin diseases and disorders {{associated with a}} cutaneous lymphoma or inflammation. Mycosis fungoides is the common lymphoma believed to cause PVA, {{although it may be}} considered a precursor when the lymphoma is [...] (hidden) and undiagnosed. Large plaque parapsoriasis is another common causes of PVA. Less common causes include autoimmune-related connective tissue diseases such as lupus, dermatomyositis and scleroderma. Dermatoses and those that are genetically inspired, called genodermatoses, may also be an underlying cause of PVA. Among them, xeroderma pigmentosum and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (poikiloderma congenita) are thought to be the most prominent. Ingestion of <b>substances</b> <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic,</b> such as arsphenamine, has also been suggested as a least common cause. PVA can also be idiopathic (of unknown cause), as seen in a small number of cases.|$|R

5000|$|Two main {{theories}} on {{the cause of}} wallpaper poisoning events have been proposed: dust particles caused by pigment and paper flaking, and toxic gas production.Tiny particles of the pigment can flake off and become airborne, and then are absorbed by the lungs. Alternatively, toxic gas can be released from compounds <b>containing</b> <b>arsenic</b> following certain chemical processes, such as heating, or metabolism by an organism. When the wallpaper becomes damp and moldy, the pigment may be metabolised, causing the release of poisonous arsine gas (...) [...] Fungi genera such as Scopulariopsis or Paecilomyces release arsine gas, when they are growing on a <b>substance</b> <b>containing</b> arsenic.The Italian physician Bartolomeo Gosio published in 1893 his results on [...] "Gosio gas", that was subsequently shown to contain trimethylarsine. Under wet conditions, the mold Scopulariopsis brevicaulis produced significant amounts of methyl arsines via methylation of arsenic-containing inorganic pigments, especially Paris green and Scheele's Green.|$|R
