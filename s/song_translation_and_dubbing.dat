40|$|In {{this chapter}} I discuss the {{theoretical}} {{issues and the}} aesthetic consequences of dubbing, both in general – when the <b>translation</b> is faithful <b>and</b> the <b>dubbing</b> {{is a good one}} – and in peculiarly bad cases – when either the translation or the dubbing, or both, are inaccurate. Dubbing is widely used in European countries such as Germany, France, the ex-Soviet countries and Italy. Being a film scholar with a specialization in Hollywood cinema, I am used to watching Hollywood films in their original versions. Being a native Italian speaker, I cannot help but noticing the differences between the original films and the Italian dubbed versions. Inaccurate <b>translations</b> <b>and</b> bad <b>dubbing</b> can severely harm the film's original meaning on the one hand, and lead to aesthetics changes on the other– e. g., an actor's persona or a character's characterization can be modified if dubbed with a voice that is radically different from the original. The case of Marilyn Monroe is exemplary: the Italian dubbing was designed to make her sound definitely more stupid than in the original version – by changing her dialogue, and by choosing a more “goose-like” voice timbre and tone...|$|R
