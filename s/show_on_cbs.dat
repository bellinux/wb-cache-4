The same pattern seems not to apply to a conventional suicide method, unless it was used by a celebrity. 1) to examine media effects on both new and non-new suicide methods during 1998 and 2005 in Hong Kong (HK), when a new method by burning charcoal (CB suicide) was spreading in the region. 2) to examine how CB competed with non-CB methods in terms of media coverage and "recruiting" suicidal persons in the socio-economic context. A self- and mutual- exciting process model was fitted to the data, adjusting for divorce rate, unemployment rate, and property price index. Breaking the whole period into onset, peak, and post-peak stages, the model was fitted again to examine the differences. Comparable copycat effects were found <b>on</b> both <b>CB</b> and non-CB suicide news. The only cross-method media effects were found in the onset stage when non-CB suicide news <b>showed</b> suppressing effect <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> suicides. CB suicides reported a significant self-excitation effect. A higher divorce rate and lower property price index were associated with significantly more suicides incidences and more suicide news. The emerging of CB suicide method did not substitute media coverage of non-CB suicide in HK. Media effects in this case were not limited to new suicide method or celebrity suicide.

40|$|Genomic {{selection}} {{is applied to}} dairy cattle breeding to improve the genetic progress of purebred (PB) animals, whereas in pigs and poultry the target is a crossbred (CB) animal for which a different strategy appears to be needed. The source of information used to estimate the breeding values, i. e., using phenotypes of CB or PB animals, may affect the accuracy of prediction. The objective of our study {{was to assess the}} direct genomic value (DGV) accuracy of CB and PB pigs using different sources of phenotypic information. Data used were from 3 populations: 2, 078 Dutch Landrace-based, 2, 301 Large White-based, and 497 crossbreds from an F 1 cross between the 2 lines. Two female reproduction traits were analyzed: gestation length (GLE) and total number of piglets born (TNB). Phenotypes used in the analyses originated from offspring of genotyped individuals. Phenotypes collected <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> and PB animals were analyzed as separate traits using a single-trait model. Breeding values were estimated separately for each trait in a pedigree BLUP analysis and subsequently deregressed. Deregressed EBV for each trait originating from different sources (CB or PB offspring) were used to study the accuracy of genomic prediction. Accuracy of prediction was computed as the correlation between DGV and the DEBV of the validation population. Accuracy of prediction within PB populations ranged from 0. 43 to 0. 62 across GLE and TNB. Accuracies to predict genetic merit of CB animals with one PB population in the training set ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 28, with the exception of using the CB offspring phenotype of the Dutch Landrace that resulted in an accuracy estimate around 0 for both traits. Accuracies to predict genetic merit of CB animals with both parental PB populations in the training set ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 30. We conclude that prediction within population and trait had good predictive ability regardless of the trait being the PB or CB performance, whereas using PB population(s) to predict genetic merit of CB animals had zero to moderate predictive ability. We observed that the DGV accuracy of CB animals when training on PB data was {{greater than or equal to}} training <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> data. However, when results are corrected for the different levels of reliabilities in the PB and CB training data, we <b>showed</b> that training <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> data does outperform PB data for the prediction of CB genetic merit, indicating that more CB animals should be phenotyped to increase the reliability and, consequently, accuracy of DGV for CB genetic merit...|$|R

Shapes of the diagrams indicate that amino acids polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distances. Clear preference {{of most of the}} amino acids towards certain secondary structure type classifies amino acids into four groups: alpha-helix admirers, strand admirers, turn and bend admirers and the others. Group four consists of His and Cis, the amino acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure. Amino acids from a group have similar physicochemical properties, and the same structural characteristics. The results suggest that amino acid preference for secondary structure type is based on the structural characteristics at Cb and Cg atoms of amino acid. alpha-helix admirers do not have polar heteroatoms <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> and Cg atoms, nor branching or aromatic group <b>on</b> <b>Cb</b> atom.
