As the highest administrative <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity, in Qin and Western Han times it was used in parallel with tong, the highest legal <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity. The unit for capacity dan takes its origin in the regulation stating that 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” and one weight unit dan of a cereal plant just harvested had equal values. This is why 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” could be called 1 dan “standard husked grain. ” The small dan and the large dan were <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> and vessels specific to the measurement of grain {{in the context of the}} rationing system used in the northern border area.

The aim of this project was to bring closer to students and teachers the teaching contents of <b>measuring</b> <b>units.</b> I wished to give new views and understandings {{of the contents of}} the measurements as well as using <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> at school and everyday life. In addition, I wished to improve and refresh the students knowledge of converting {{units of measurement}} through the teaching approach and didactic games. There were three main stages of the project: initially I tested students existing knowledge of <b>measuring</b> <b>units.</b> Based on these results I designed the study approach using didactic games to encourage students understanding of units of measurement and refresh their knowledge. In the third part the students were given the second test of their knowledge, which was used to evaluate their progress. There was 23 students 4 th graders' from primary school Škofljica included in this study. Analysis of the test results and study approaches showed that students have most problems with converting <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> for mass and time and least problems with converting units of money. Following this study the majority of students progressed in their knowledge of <b>measuring</b> <b>units.</b> The largest improvements were shown at tasks dealing with converting <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> for mass and time, but they also improved their knowledge of <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> of volume and money...|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of using}} N-1 {{separate}} meters, the meters {{are combined into}} a single housing for commercial purposes such as measuring energy delivered to homes and businesses. Each pairing of a current <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> plus a potential <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> is then termed a stator or element. Thus, for example, a meter for a four wire service will include three elements. Blondel's Theorem simplifies {{the work of an}} electrical utility worker by specifying that an N wire service will be correctly measured by a N-1 element meter. Unfortunately, confusion arises for such workers due to the existence of meters that don't contain tidy pairings of single potential <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> with single current <b>measuring</b> <b>units.</b> For example, a meter was previously used for four wire services containing two potential coils and three current coils and called a 2.5 element meter.|$|R
