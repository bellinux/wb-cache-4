Forest road network also contributes to water conservation and biodiversity. Experience shows that when a road is constructed along the contour line, the road <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> bank becomes lower than the original level regardless of the road standard. This happens because the filled bank is soft so that shrinkage occurs caused by repeated log transportation and by rainwater erosion affecting lower surfaces. Periodical maintenance is important. On the other hand, the maintenance of all-season forest roads for heavy truck transport is expensive as can be seen in Slovenia. In conditions of public free and unlimited access to forests, the standard of forest road maintenance is higher. If we consider that unlimited access to forests means higher personal standard and higher quality of modern life, then the higher cost of wood extraction is not the most important condition of multi-purpose and natural forest management...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of fillers at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> cellulosic paper {{is an interesting}} and industrially-commercialized but not very well-known concept, in which the filler particles are essentially added to the voids of the fibrous matrixes. This so-called “surface filling” {{can be achieved by}} the use of fillers together with a polymer solution via film press or size press, an approach that is distinct from both wet-end filling and conventional coating of paper. As an easily practicable process, surface filling has some advantages over direct wet-end addition of fillers, such as minimizing the adverse effects of filler addition on paper strength. Efficient surface filling is somewhat dependent on the specific characteristics of both fillers and fibrous matrixes. Surface filling may provide interesting possibilities for the papermaking discipline; for example, it would open the door to maximizing the cost-effectiveness of paper mills, and efficiently adding new functionalities to cellulosic paper.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{topographic}} irregularities influence the surface ground motions, typically with a n enhancement {{of the response}} close to convex topographic features, such as ridges and slope crests. Several studies have in vestigat ed the ground motion at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>filled</b> valleys and empty canyons, focus ing mainly on the geometry and the soil characteristics rather than the input excitation.

The response of canyons has been previously examined; but mainly focusing on simple wa velet input. This paper considers a fully weathered canyon (i. e., without any in - fill material) aiming to investigate the influence of the input excitation on the surface ground motion through a parametric time - domain finite element (FE) study. A two - dimen sional plane - strain model of an idealised canyon is considered for vertically propagating SV waves, using both wavelets and recorded earthquakes as input excitation. The model consists of two step - like slopes with slope height (H), in a homogeneous linear elastic soil layer overlying rigid bedrock.

50|$|Surge Irrigation is {{a variant}} of furrow {{irrigation}} where the water supply is pulsed on and off in planned time periods (e.g. on for 1 hour off for 1½ hour). The wetting and drying cycles reduce infiltration rates resulting in faster advance rates and higher uniformities than continuous flow.
