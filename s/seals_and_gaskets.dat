50|$|One {{noteworthy}} {{advantage of}} this moderator type is that temperatures of approximately 370 °C can be obtained at low system pressure - {{in the range of}} 240 kPa (2.4 bar). Low system pressure reduces <b>sealing</b> <b>and</b> <b>gasket</b> problems <b>and</b> allows the use of thin walls on pressure vessels and piping, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. Also, at low operating pressure the reactor contains less potential energy. This means that a ruptured pipe cannot cause extensive damage (i.e. pipe whip) or cause the release of appreciable quantities of radioactivity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} get rid of health hazard of {{asbestos}} fiber, a new kind of non-asbestos fiber reinforce composite by beater-addition process, which is used for <b>sealing</b> <b>and</b> <b>gasket,</b> has been developed to replace traditional asbestos gasket materials. The mechanical properties of the new composite were tested, and the performance between it and asbestos sheet paper were contrasted. Results show that the density, cross direction tensile strength, machine direction tensile strength and ignition loss at temperature of 300 °C of the new composite are 1. 19 g/cm 3, 2. 62 MPa, 3. 15 MPa and 15. 61 % respectively, while the performances of asbestos paper produced under the same condition are 1. 26 g/cm 3, 2. 87 MPa, 3. 24 MPa and 12. 03 % respectively. Excellent performance, low cost and simple manufacture process of the new composite make it is possible to substitute traditional asbestos paper and apply widely...|$|R
40|$|The Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) Unit (MCU) {{plans to}} use several new {{materials}} of construction not previously used with CSSX solvent. SRNL researchers tested seven materials proposed for service in <b>seal</b> <b>and</b> <b>gasket</b> applications. None of the materials leached detectable amounts of components into the CSSX solvent during 96 hour tests. All are judged acceptable for use based on their effect on the solvent. However, some of the materials adsorbed solvent or changed dimensions during contact with solvent. Consultation with component and material vendors with regard to performance impact and in-use testing of the materials is recommended. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a material selected for use in contactor bearing seals, did not gain weight or change dimensions on contact with CSSX solvent. Analysis of the solvent contacted with this material showed no impurities and the standard dispersion test gave acceptable phase separation results. The material contains a leachable hydrocarbon substance, detectable on exposed surfaces, that did not adversely contaminate the solvent {{within the limits of}} the testing. We recommend contacting the vendor to determine the source and purpose of this component, or, alternatively, pursue the infrared analysis of the PEEK in an effort to better define potential impacts...|$|R

50|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{through the early}} 20th, blow-by gases from {{internal}} combustion were allowed {{to find their own}} way out to the atmosphere past <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> <b>gaskets.</b> It was considered normal for oil to be found both inside and outside an engine, and for oil to drip to the ground in small but constant amounts. The latter had also been true for steam engines and steam locomotives in the decades before. Even bearing and valve designs generally made little to no provision for keeping oil or waste gases contained. Sealed bearings and valve covers were for special applications only. Gaskets and shaft seals were meant to limit loss of oil, but they were usually not expected to entirely prevent it. On internal combustion engines, the hydrocarbon-rich blow-by gases would diffuse through the oil in the <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> <b>gaskets</b> into the atmosphere. Engines with high amounts of blow-by (e.g., worn out ones, or ones not well built to begin with) would leak profusely via those routes.|$|E

50|$|Plasticizers make it {{possible}} to achieve improved compound processing characteristics, while also providing flexibility in the end-use product. Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, processibility, permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, gluterates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> <b>gaskets,</b> belts, wire and cable, and print rolls. Low to high polarity esters provide utility {{in a wide range of}} elastomers including nitrile, polychloroprene, EPDM, chlorinated polyethylene, and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as solubility parameter, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Compatibility and performance attributes are key factors in developing a rubber formulation for a particular application.|$|E

50|$|Woven ceramic fabrics {{allow for}} the {{opportunity}} to create new, imaginative solutions for previously impossible problems. These fabrics are utilized for thermal, mechanical and electrical applications for a variety of reasons. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are most importantly used in three main fields: aerospace, electronic, and industrial. In aerospace, the fabrics are used in space shuttles for the exit cone, door seals, micrometeorite shield, gaskets, booster access doors, shuttle tiles, and in the Whipple shield. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are utilized in aerospace because they have low thermal conductivity and can be fabricated into high temperature thermal insulators. In the electronic industry, the fabrics are used primarily for insulation <b>and</b> <b>seals,</b> because of its low porosity. Ceramic fabric's industrial uses include furnace linings, furnace zone dividers, door <b>seals,</b> tube <b>seals,</b> <b>gaskets,</b> <b>and</b> expansion joints. In addition to being an effective thermal insulator, these fabrics do not shrink or elongate with high temperature changes, making them useful for industrial uses that involve high temperatures.|$|R

40|$|International audienceLevels of furan {{in various}} foods were {{measured}} {{before and after}} heating under heating and laboratory conditions. The effect of contact with can coatings, <b>sealing</b> <b>gaskets</b> <b>and</b> the epoxidised oils used in gasket manufacture on furan formation was studied. The objective was to identify factors affecting furan formation. Furan present in heat-processed food samples persisted during cooking. Furan was shown to form in foods on heating, although it did not accumulate to a significant degree on heating in an open vessel. There were no interactions between foods and cans, can coatings or gaskets that had a significant influence on furan formation. Furan accumulated particularly in heat-processed canned and jarred foods because they are sealed containers that receive a considerable thermal load. Heating epoxidised oils used in sealing gaskets formed furan. At the levels used in gaskets, however, epoxidised oils should not affect the formation of furan in foods...|$|R

40|$|A new {{structure}} of separator plate assembly (SPA), {{which consisted of}} a separator plate, flow field plates, perforated plates, frame plates <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> <b>gaskets.</b> was developed for a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) in this study. In this structure, the separator plate, flow field plates and perforated plates were hard-contacted (directly contacted each other); meanwhile the frame plates and the separator plates were bound with the inorganic <b>seal</b> <b>gaskets.</b> SPA <b>and</b> electrodes could be combined {{together to form a}} unit of electrode-SPA. The {{new structure}} SPA promoted the smooth volatilizing and complete burning of the organic compounds in the matrix. It was effective and reliable to press the stack with a suitable stacking pressure. It was facile and simple to assemble a stack by using electrode-SPA. With the electrode-SPAs, two NICK stacks were assembled in co-flow and counter-flow, respectively. The performance of Stack B in counter-flow was higher than that of Stack A in co-flow at the same current density. The more uniform temperature distribution and current density distribution in Stack B were responsible for its higher performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
