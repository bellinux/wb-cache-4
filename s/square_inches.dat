25|$|The Fortissimo emerged {{two years}} prior to the filing of the {{influential}} and lucrative patent for racquets sized 95-135 <b>square</b> <b>inches</b> by Prince Sporting Goods (now Prince Sports and commonly called Prince). This resulted in the disqualification of the patent by the German patent authority. The Prince patent was upheld elsewhere and the company became the only highly successful seller of oversize racquets in their early history. The first was the very flexible aluminum Prince Classic of 1976. Tad Weed introduced the first super-oversize in 1975, to start a line that continues to be sold today.|$|E

25|$|Gauss died in Göttingen, (then Kingdom of Hanover and now Lower Saxony) on 23 February 1855 and is interred in the Albani Cemetery there. Two {{individuals}} gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law Heinrich Ewald and Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, who was Gauss's {{close friend}} and biographer. His brain was preserved and was studied by Rudolf Wagner who found its mass to be 1,492grams (slightly above average) and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters (340.362 <b>square</b> <b>inches).</b> Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century were suggested as the explanation of his genius.|$|E
25|$|Oversize {{and larger}} racquets are {{generally}} used by older recreational players, {{as a way}} to reduce the impact of aging on their tennis competitiveness. The largest legal racquets, which are known as super-oversize frames, have proven extremely rare in professional competition, with only Monica Seles being a top 10 or higher ranked player who used one (a 125 square inch Yonex) during her career at any time. Andre Agassi achieved considerable success with an oversize racquet, a fact that was often noted due to his rivalry with Pete Sampras, a player who used a much smaller midsize frame. Oversize racquets are generally considered to offer more power but less control, a trend that exists from the smallest racquet size ("standard") to the largest legal size, which is 135 <b>square</b> <b>inches.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> {{absolute}} (psia) {{is used to}} make {{it clear}} that the pressure is relative to a vacuum rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is around 14.7 psi, this will be added to any pressure reading made in air at sea level. The converse is pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gauge or pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gauge (psig), indicating that the pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure. For example, a bicycle tire pumped up to 65 psi above local atmospheric pressure (say, 14.7 psia locally), will have a pressure of 65 + 14.7 = 79.7 psia or 65 psig. When gauge pressure is referenced to something other than ambient atmospheric pressure, then the units would be pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> differential (psid).|$|R
50|$|Therefore, 1 {{atmosphere}} is approximately 14.7 pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch.</b>|$|R

Since the 1998 Wimbledon Junior Championships Federer played with a Pro Staff 6.0 85 racquet. He {{switched}} to a bigger custom-built 90 tennis racquet since 2003, which is characterised by its smaller hitting area of 90 <b>square</b> <b>inches,</b> heavy strung weight of 364grams, and thin beam of 17.5 millimetres. His grip size was 4 3/8inches (sometimes referred to as L3). [...] Federer strung his racquets at 21.5kg mains/20kg crosses pre-stretched 20 percent, using Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough 16L gauge (polyester) for his cross strings. When asked about string tensions, Federer stated [...] "this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play. So you can see– it depends on several factors {{and not just the}} surface; the feeling I have is most important." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, tire provider Goodyear created new tires, branded [...] "Wrangler", based on a previous dirt tire that the company made. To give the trucks more grip, the tires were widened by one inch to eleven. The bias-ply tires (instead of radial tires) also had treads to remove dirt quicker, in a block pattern, along with being softer. The left-side tires were staggered three inches shorter to 85.5 inches than the right tires (88.5) to assist in handling. Meanwhile, the trucks had mesh shields and hood deflector screens attached to prevent debris from the dirt from entering the radiators and damaging the vehicles. The trucks also had the front spoilers and splitters removed, the grille closed, and the rear spoilers raised and enlarged by 40 <b>square</b> <b>inches</b> to generate more downforce. The trucks' windshields remained, meaning the track crew had to keep the track dry, to prevent mud from making them unable to be cleared. On the hoods, bug deflectors, which were 8 by 12 inches, were installed to prevent stones from hitting the windshield. Teams added under panels to the trucks' chassis to prevent dirt from increasing the trucks' weight.|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{configuration}} of the grain is small, irregularly shaped, generally equidimensional to slightly elongated with irregular edges and does not vary significantly among the different grades (in 1992). [...] The edges of the calcite grains are deeply crenulated (irregularly and minutely notched and scalloped). Grain sizes range primarily from 0.1mm (0.00393in) to 0.6mm (0.0236in), as determined by scanning electron microscope images.

2500|$|Once {{absorbed into}} blood through the skin, it reacts with blood calcium and may cause cardiac arrest. Burns with areas larger than 160cm2 (25 <b>square</b> <b>inches)</b> have the {{potential}} to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels. [...] In the body, hydrofluoric acid reacts with the ubiquitous biologically important ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride is proposed as the etiology for both precipitous fall in serum calcium and the severe pain associated with tissue toxicity. In some cases, exposures can lead to hypocalcemia. Thus, hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with calcium gluconate, a source of Ca2+ that sequesters the fluoride ions. HF chemical burns can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. However, because it is absorbed, medical treatment is necessary; rinsing off is not enough. Intra-arterial infusions of calcium chloride have also shown great effectiveness in treating burns.|$|E
40|$|Static {{tests were}} made on the {{compatibility}} of liquid fluorine with several nonmetallic materials at - 3200 F and at pressures of 0 and 1500 pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gage. The results are compared with those from previous work with gaseous fluorine at the same pressures, but at atmospheric temperature. In general, although environmental effects were not always consistent, reactivity was least with the low-temperature, low-pressure liquid fluorine. Reactivity was greatest with the warm, high-pressure gaseous fluorine. None of the liquids and greases tested {{was found to be}} entirely suitable for use in fluorine systems. Polytrifluorochloroethylene and N- 43, the formula for which is (C 4 F 9) 3 N, did not react with liquid fluorine at atmospheric pressure or 1500 pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gage under static conditions, but they did react when injected into liquid fluorine at 1500 pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gage; they also reacted with gaseous fluorine at 1500 pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gage. While water did not react with liquid fluorine at 1500 pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gage, it is known to react violently with fluorine under other conditions.

40|$|Nitella flexilis {{cells are}} not stimulated to "shock stoppage" of {{cyclosis}} by suddenly evacuating {{the air over}} the water or on sudden readmission of air, or on suddenly striking a piston in the water-filled chamber {{in which they are}} kept with a ball whose energy is 7. 6 joules, provided the Nitella cell is not moved by currents {{against the side of the}} chamber. Sudden increases in hydrostatic pressure from zero to 1000 lbs. or 0 to 5000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> or 5000 to 9000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> usually do not stimulate to "shock stoppage" of cyclosis, but some cells are stimulated. Sudden decreases of pressure are more likely to stimulate, again with variation depending on the cell. In the absence of stimulation, the cyclosis velocity at 23 °C. slows as the pressure is increased in steps of 1000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch.</b> In some cells a regular slowing is observed, in others there is little slowing until 4000 to 6000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch,</b> when a rapid slowing appears, with only 50 per cent to 30 per cent of the original velocity at 9000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch.</b> The cyclosis does not completely stop at 10000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch.</b> The pressure effect is reversible unless the cells have been kept too long at the high pressure. At low temperatures (10 °C.) and at temperatures near and above (32 °– 38 °C.) the optimum temperature for maximum cyclosis (35 – 36 °C.) pressures of 3000 to 6000 lbs. per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> cause only further slowing of cyclosis, with no reversal of the temperature effect, such as has been observed in pressure-temperature studies on the luminescence of luminous bacteria.
