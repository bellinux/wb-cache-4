50|$|The {{mean of the}} methedrone {{concentrations}} {{in the blood of}} the two deceased was 1.3 μg/g blood. One of these victims had a very high concentration of Methedrone in the blood, approximately 4.8 μg/g blood. The mean of the concentrations found in the blood of the deceased victims was 8.0 μg/g blood. None of the non-lethal doses or lethal doses is known, suggesting that the <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> between a lethal and non-lethal dose of methedrone is probably very small, thus making use of this drug dangerous because poisonings, and simultaneously death, are accidental.|$|E
50|$|In pharmacology, {{efficacy}} (Emax) is a {{term used}} to describe the maximum response achievable from a drug. There is little information available on Methedrone and its efficacy. According to users, the doses of Methedrone vary from 50 to 500 mg with a duration of effects range from 45 minutes to two hours. There are two cases known of fatal intoxications with Methedrone. In the first case, the postmortem femoral blood sample of the patient contained a concentration of 8.4 µg/g Methedrone, the patient died after 16 hours (but other compounds such as diazepam were also detected in his blood). In the second case the concentration of Methedrone in the postmortem femoral blood sample was 9.6 µg/g and methedrone was the only toxic compound detected. Recent studies to these fatal cases suggest that the Methedrone alone was responsible for these deaths and that the concentrations in the femoral blood represent the fatal levels of methedrone. Also, these studies show that there is little window range between a fatal dose and a non-fatal dose, this means that the <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> is small. A fatal dose is more than 8 µg/g whereas the dose among the living cases which were studied varied from 0.1 to 4.8 µg/g blood. Knowing this, it is concluded that the dose of efficacy of Methedrone is around 8 µg/g blood, leading to death.|$|E

40|$|Lane-change crashes are {{not only}} {{responsible}} for an important portion of vehicular fatalities, but also for crash-caused traffic delays, often resulting in congestion. The type of discretionary lane change {{was the focus of}} this research, in which a <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> prediction model was constructed for potential application in the development of lane-change support systems. Data for analysis and model fitting were collected from a fixed-based bus driving simulator. The experimental scene designed for the driving simulator consisted of a straight section of two-lane freeway mainline with daylight and vehicular flows traveling at different speed levels on the road. Ten professional coach drivers were recruited to perform lane-change experiments. Results of two-way ANOVA revealed a significant lane-change direction × vehicle speed on the target lane interaction, and further analyses demonstrated that there was a simple effect for vehicle speed on the target lane in the left-to-right group of the type of lane-change direction factor. A <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> forecasting model with the time gap between lead and lag vehicle on the target lane as the forecasted variable was constructed, and tests of true out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the prediction model showed promising results for its potential application in the development of lane-change support systems...|$|E
40|$|Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels {{have been}} in {{operation}} for four decades and there are now well over 250 vessels in existence, but their gas equivalent floating liquid natural gas plants kwon as FLNGs are still very new. Consequently designs and arrangement of top-side process units are still evolving and their safety {{has yet to be}} fully and objectively evaluated. This paper explores the probability of occurrence of accidents leading to vapour cloud explosion at one of the topside liquefaction modules of an FLNG. The worst possible scenario with the maximum tolerable probability is identified and the impact of the corresponding vapour cloud explosion is estimated. The strength of the structures supporting the neighbouring modules was examined using finite element analysis to determine if the accident has a potential of escalating to neighbouring modules. It is found that the current levels of <b>safety</b> <b>gaps</b> between the liquefaction modules may be insufficient for the structural arrangement in place. It is thought that a new structural design using circular pipes as the structural elements instead of the I-beams may enhance the integrity of the top-side supporting structures against the impact of potential vapour cloud explosion. The effectiveness of the new structure is demonstrated by comparing it to the conventional supporting structure using I-beam members. This also implies that, by using pipe elements, the <b>safety</b> <b>gaps</b> can be reduced, thus making it possible to optimise the topside arrangement more easily...|$|R

40|$|A {{difference}} between Powered Two Wheelers (PTW) drivers’ behavior and other drivers’ behavior in urban arterials is {{the frequency of}} overtaking. The present paper focuses on PTW overtaking and models the specific behavior using concepts of Game Theory. Both the PTW driver and the lead vehicle’s driver are assumed rational decision-makers that develop strategies, trying to maximize their payoffs. These strategies may be cooperative or not {{with respect to the}} distances and <b>safety</b> <b>gaps</b> and other behavioral aspects. The payoff function is formulated based on a novel latent statistically determined driving indicator, which quantifies both the driving risk and comfort. The proposed model is evaluated using trajectory data from video recordings on an urban arterial. Results show that both drivers have maximized gains by following a cooperative strategy. Findings also reveal that the successful overtaking rate is higher, when the PTW driver is non-cooperative, whereas lower overtaking rates occur, when the driver of the lead vehicle is non-cooperative. Finally, the concepts of Dominant Strategies, bounded rationality and the construction of the optimum payoff function are further discussed...|$|R
30|$|Folkhälsan [25] {{showed that}} the <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> between large and small cars has {{decreased}} in terms of risk for fatality or permanent disability in crashes. Since 1980, the fatality rate has improved by 35  % for small cars and by 25  % for large cars. In addition, the difference in injury risk by vehicle weight in single-vehicle crashes is even smaller. Consequently, the difference between large and small cars has substantially diminished from the 1980 s. Also, Chen and Ren [10] showed that fuel-efficient vehicles can be as safe as, if not safer than, less fuel-efficient counterparts in accidents involving single-car crashes and side-impact collisions.|$|E

40|$|Environmental, demographical and {{psychological}} factors have a demonstrated impact on risky crossing behaviour. In this work {{we focus on}} the potential influence of social factors on the considered phenomenon (i. e. group crossing decision). We present the results of a video-recorded observation about the crossing behaviour of singles and dyads at non-signalized intersections. Results showed that crossing behaviour is characterized by three distinct phases: (i) approaching, (ii) appraising (decision making) and (iii) crossing. Dyads walk slower than single pedestrians in all phases. The crossing behaviour of dyads is characterized by the emergence of a leader who takes the decision to cross first, followed by the companion. However, there is no difference between the accepted <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> of singles and dyads. Understanding factors influencing the crossing decision of social groups represents an important result supporting the development of agent-based simulations of pedestrian-vehicle interactions.

50|$|Additional {{advantages}} {{could include}} higher speed limits; smoother rides; and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for <b>safety</b> <b>gaps</b> and higher speeds. Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity {{according to the}} U.S. Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. According {{to a study by}} researchers at Columbia University, autonomous cars could increase capacity by 273% (~8,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 445% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h with a following gap of about 6 m of each other. Currently, at highway speeds drivers keep between 40 to 50 m away from the car in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the {{kinematic}} features of motorcycles with those of passenger cars in urban traffic. The hypothesis that motorcycles' capability to swerve in urban traffic contributes to their seemingly assertive behaviour is examined. Data for this study were collected in afternoon peak hours at Central London using video recorders. Detailed information on the trajectories of 2109 vehicles (including 477 motorcycles and 1293 passenger cars) was extracted from the video images and the observable kinematic features were analysed. In addition, a model describing the longitudinal following behaviour of motorcycles was employed to analyse the impacts of motorcycles' swerving behaviour. The model was calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) numerical methods. The observable kinematic features show that in comparison to passenger cars, motorcycles have shorter <b>safety</b> <b>gaps,</b> higher speeds and severer acceleration and deceleration rates reflecting their generally much higher power to weight ratios and usage of available braking power. However, the data also support the hypothesis that motorcyclists maintain a considerable safety margin as they have the ability to avoid a collision by swerving away...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we compare}} two methods of {{estimating}} relevance for the emergency electronic brake light application. One uses an analytically derived formula {{based on the}} minimal <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> required to avoid a collision. The other method uses a machine learning approach. The application works by disseminating reports about vehicles that are performing emergency deceleration in effort to warn drivers {{about the need to}} perform emergency braking. Vehicles which receive such reports have to decide whether the information contained in the report is relevant to the driver, and warn the driver if that is the case. Common ways to determine relevance are based on the lane or direction information, but using only these attributes can still lead to many false warnings, which can desensitize the driver. Desensitized drivers may ignore warnings or turn off the system completely, thus eliminating any safety benefits of the application. We show that the machine learning method, in comparison to the analytically derived formula, is able to significantly reduce the number of false warnings by learning from the actions drivers take after receiving a report. The methods were compared using simulated experiments with a range of traffic and communication parameters. Keywords- machine learning, vehicle safet...|$|E
40|$|Network devices, meeting {{increasing}} workload demand, are not efficiently Power-Workload Proportionate {{and consume}} {{a considerable amount}} of power even when the workload (utilisation) is low. This work proposes a novel Slowing Mechanism (SM) that provides Power Workload Proportionality for a wired network equipment to reduce power consumption. The Slowing will be achieved by adjusting the Operational Rate (OPR) of components according to traffic load. To meet applications’ (VoIP, Data and Video) performance requirements, a <b>Safety</b> <b>Gap</b> (SG) is proposed in the Slowing Mechanism. Many parameters need to be carefully set for performance requirements within Slowing Mechanism. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation dynamically set to respond to the variable incoming traffic pattern determines these parameters. Thus, this work is a GA and the Slowing Mechanism integration to provide an insight into how GA optimisation can be employed in a network environment, and to optimise parameters in real-time. The results demonstrate that {{a considerable amount of}} saving is achievable. With the default hardware configuration, the SM optimises the parameters and offers a saving of over 60 % for typical stable traffic, with acceptable packet delay and no packet loss. This saving is reduced to 17 % saving for a bursty traffic pattern with acceptable performance degradation...|$|E

We hypothesized that the email communication skills of rheumatology fellows {{can be measured in}} an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) setting using a novel email content analysis instrument which has 18 items. During an OSCE, we asked 50 rheumatology fellows to respond to a simulated patient email. The content of the responses was assessed using our instrument. The majority of rheumatology fellows wrote appropriate responses scoring a mean (±SD) of 10. 6 (± 2. 6) points (maximum score 18), with high inter-rater reliability (0. 86).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis sought to analyze why the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE) disregards practices that {{conform to the}} scientific understanding of human fatigue and to identify the effective human-error mitigation practices of two other high-consequence fields that {{may be useful to}} the HSE. Using the constant comparative method, the command center work environments of the HSE, nuclear power, and air traffic control were analyzed with regard to fatigue-mitigation practices and policies. Despite remarkable similarities in their public safety function and human-technology interface, the resulting grounded theory highlights key differences. In contrast to nuclear power and air traffic control, the HSE has yet to record a serious fatigue incident to serve as a catalyst for change, and unlike those two industries' strong safety cultures, the HSE command centers continue to operate in a deeply rooted bravery culture that prevents the focus on fatigue issues. This thesis brings attention to a clear <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> and makes practical recommendations that would facilitate the HSE's intentional movement toward a safety culture through the implementation of comprehensive fitness-for-duty programs, multilevel fatigue mitigation training, and the gathering and continual review of human-error data in its command-center work environments.

40|$|In {{this study}} a safety {{assessment}} technique is described, {{in which the}} contributions {{of a number of}} technical and organisational aspects of safety can be compared and quantified. Results can be used for input in recommendations regarding investment decisions, and for development of safety performance indicators that could be used by management alongside other (more traditional) business performance indicators. The technique revolves around the identification of incident scenarios in a LOPA type approach. In LOPA (Layer of Protection Analysis) severity and likelihood of these scenarios are assessed in a semi-quantitative way. Scenarios can be related to the (chemical) process, or the integrity of installations and components. Safety studies addressing non-technical, organisational aspects are bundled in a Safety Quality Factor, which is used to adjust scenario frequencies. A safety rating can be calculated from the frequency of occurrence of the scenarios. A comparison of the safety rating with the target values set for the scenario may yield a <b>safety</b> <b>gap.</b> Safety measures can then be identified and their ef-fect on the safety rating can be assessed. If financial implications of these measures are also calculated the cost-effectiveness can be determined. This may help deciding which measures should be taken.

40|$|Health loss in {{the road}} {{transport}} system {{is one of the}} leading global public health problems with approximately 1. 3 million people killed annually. In order to have a systematical approach to improved road safety, it has become common practice to form road safety management policies that include target setting and evaluation. The overall aim of this thesis was to facilitate road safety management by developing a new method to guide stakeholders with decisions on the most effective interventions to improve road safety, or in the design of safety innovations. In this thesis, a new method to identify the potential of combined road safety interventions was developed and validated. Crashes were studied from a system’s approach perspective, and the integrated safety chain was used to derive a residual of crashes from a baseline based on assumptions regarding the progress of Safety Performance Indicators over the period studied. The characteristics of the residual fatal crashes in 2020 were then described and analyzed to identify future <b>safety</b> <b>gaps.</b> A validation of the method was conducted by taking into account actual interventions implemented between 2000 and 2010 and by reducing the fatalities in 2000 to a residual of crashes in 2010 and then comparing this to the true outcome of 2010. It was concluded that the method was found to give an overall valid explanation for the reduction of fatalities from 2000 to 2010. The main advantage of this method compared to previous methods is the ability to describe the characteristics of future crashes, and what measures would be effective in reducing them. Single vehicle and head-on crashes were estimated to be reduced most significantly from 2000 to 2010, largely as a result of the installation of median barriers and the fitment of Electronic Stability Control. In two studies, effect estimates of pedestrian friendly car fronts and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) fitted on Heavy Goods Vehicles in head-on crashes were derived and these estimates can be applied in the method in future. It was also concluded that positive system effects can emerge between road and vehicle safety technologies. Speed management can enhance the performance of pedestrian protection which will be important for increasing safety for vulnerable road users. In addition, it was found that the overall effectiveness of AEB would increase if the proportion of loss-of-control scenarios is minimalized and that AEB could be very helpful for increasing the compatibility between passenger cars and Heavy Goods Vehicles. This thesis presents a new approach to evaluating future effects of integrated road and vehicle safety technologies. It can be summarized as; 1 – Highlight future potentials and <b>safety</b> <b>gaps,</b> 2 – Define and refine technological innovations and 3 – Guiding integrated interventions. It is recommended that the evolution of the transport system is taken into account when estimating the benefits of future technologies. Road and vehicle safety interventions should be designed in collaboration with stakeholders and combined in the best possible way in order to create positive system effects. There is also a need for accurate effect estimates as they form essential tools in the road safety management process...|$|R

40|$|Nigg, JoanneThe {{purposes}} of this thesis are twofold; to gain insight {{through the lens of}} framing as to how the framing of a spill influences policy change and discern how competing frames affect policy. The second is to offer new recommendations to help bridge the <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> the industry currently experiences, exposed by these three spills. For this study, three oil spills were chosen due to the considerable policy changes they invoked, the media attention they garnered, and their size; the Union Oil’s Platform A blowout in Santa Barbara, California of 1969, the wreck of the Exxon Valdez of 1989, and the Deepwater Horizon blowout of 2010. To address these questions, multiple data sources were used to gain an understanding on how key stakeholders framed oil spills and analyze the resulting policy. A conte nt analysis was performed for all three spills on scholarly articles, media articles, after action reports, court records, policy, and policy recommendations. This study also draws on in-depth interviews with key informants that were intimately involved in {{at least one of the}} three spills. The study findings suggest that framing does significantly affect the policy that results. In Union Oil's Platform A, the framing was overwhelmingly suggesting that the spill was an environmental and ecological tragedy wh ich could not happen again. The Exxon Valdez is essentially the story of three competing frameworks, eventually giving way to a regulatory framing of the event. The Deepwater Horizon also experienced three competing frames; there was a framing of the event as a slow-onset environmental catastrophe, which coincided with the framing that focused on the economic losses, and eventually the framing of the spill as failure in the regulatory structure. The implications of competing frameworks on policy in these sp ills are also discussed. University of Delaware, Department of Disaster Science and ManagementM. S...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of railway level crossing accidents in New Zealand {{is a high}} profile issue that has warranted close scrutiny over the last 10 years. However, the incident rate has not decreased. This research examined the possibility that visual illusions and perceptual errors contribute to an underestimation of a train‟s arrival time by motorists. The first experiment was designed to analyze whether the Size-Arrival Effect, a theory that states that large-far objects are judged to arrive earlier than small-nearer objects, was applicable to trains. Participants were shown a computer simulation of a moving vehicle (train, motorcar or motorcycle) and asked to indicate when the point was reached where they would no longer cross {{in front of the}} approaching vehicle. Approach speeds were systematically varied (60 km/h, 70 km/h, 80 km/h, 100 km/h and 120 km/h). Results found that participants adopted the greatest <b>safety</b> <b>gap</b> distance to cross for the train. However, there was no adjustment for velocity when adopting safety gaps for the train and the motorcycle with observers using the same gap distance, regardless of the approach speed. The second experiment sought to examine the Leibowitz hypothesis (Leibowitz, 1985), which proposes an illusory bias; a large object seems to be moving more slowly than a small object travelling at the same speed. Experiment 2 measured participants' ability to make a direct comparison between the speed of an approaching motorcar and a train. Participants were asked to judge which of the vehicles appeared faster, with the distance from the observer varied (far, middle or near). Participants significantly underestimated the speed of the train as compared to the car, in both the 'middle' and 'near' conditions, with the magnitude of underestimation greatest in the 'middle' condition. The overall findings offered support for both theories, which indicates that a combination of distance and speed perceptual errors may at least partly contribute to the high rates of level crossing collisions...|$|E

Component and system design literature provide an engineering backbone of safety systems however, biological attributes such as mutation, growth, and multiplication create <b>safety</b> <b>gaps,</b> where biological engineering practices are needed. These principles are organized into categories of design and testing, and testing and demonstration to gain greater insight on where gaps in the literature might lie. Retrospective cases of traditional engineering and current cases of biotechnologies provide external validation and further illustrate which practices address which design, testing and demonstration needs. While most of the traditional engineering cases addressed safety through design and testing, when they were faced with questions of safety, they presented specific efforts to gain public confidence. The pro-biotics case was different in that the safety concerns came from the scientific community since history is being used as the convincing demonstration of safety. The three synthetic biology research projects cross the divide between traditional engineering and biotechnologies, but theses efforts are firmly in the area of design and testing. These efforts begin to show the tradeoff between implementing safety and faster technical results. Strategies for further research are explored. by Neelima Yeddanapudi. Thesis (S.

40|$|Oscillatory flow {{patterns}} {{have been observed}} in many different driven many-particle systems. The conventional assumption is {{that the reason for}} emergent oscillations in opposing flows is an increased efficiency (throughput). In this contribution, however, we will study intersecting pedestrian and vehicle flows as an example for inefficient emergent oscillations. In the coupled vehicle-pedestrian delay problem, oscillating pedestrian and vehicle flows form when pedestrians cross the street with a small time gap to approaching cars, while both pedestrians and vehicles benefit, when they keep some overcritical time gap. That is, when the <b>safety</b> time <b>gap</b> of pedestrians is increased, the average delay time of pedestrians decreases and the vehicle flow goes up. This may be interpreted as a slower-is-faster effect. The underlying mechanism of this effect is explained in detail. Comment: For related publications see [URL]...|$|R
