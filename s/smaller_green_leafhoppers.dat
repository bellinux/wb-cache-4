The research objective was to determine the effect of weed eradication on the development of <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> population and the incidence of tungro disease. The study was conducted in an experimental field of Tungro Disease Research Station, Lanrang Village, Sidenreng Rappang District, South Sulawesi at rainy season and dry season 2014.

A {{study was conducted in}} farmer 2 ̆ 7 s fields in two planting patterns in 1997 and 1998 to elucidate population dynamics of <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper,</b> vector of tungro disease and factors affecting their dynamics. A susceptible rice variety to <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> was planted three times in one season with monthly interval between planting time. The rice was planted following farmer usual practices except no insecticide was applied. The population of <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> and their natural enemies was surveyed by sweeping net. The egg predator and parasitoid were observed by dissecting the rice stems and incubating the discovered eggs. Life table of the first generation was constructed. The key-factor analysis was conducted to identify the key-mortality factor by regression methods. Numerical response of natural enemies was also analyzed to know the relationship of key-mortality to predator. Population density of <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> increased mainly during early stage of rice growth in the rice-rice-rice planting pattern, but in the rice-rice-fallow/secondary crop planting patterns showed almost no population increase at all. The nymph mortality including adult disappearance before maturation was the key mortality for the population in both planting patterns. However, there were different in population process between population in different planting patterns. In contrast to the rice-rice-secondary crop, there were no numerical response between nymphal mortality and predator density in the rice-rice-rice planting pattern. In the rice-rice-rice planting pattern adults dispersal played important role. Therefore to control tungro, reducing feeding and inoculation ability of <b>green</b> <b>leafhopper</b> was considered important.

Furthermore, nothing is known about the genetic relationships among them. In this study, we collected six populations from Mainland China, four populations from Japan and one population from Taiwan, and examined the genetic distances in the COI and 16 sRNA regions of mtDNA among them. The results showed that the genetic distances based on single gene or the combined sequences among eleven leafhopper populations were 0. 3 - 1. 2 %, which were all less than the species boundary of 2 %. Moreover, there were at least two haplotypes shared by two distinct populations from different regions. The phylogenetic analysis based on single gene or combined sets also supported that tea <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> from Mainland China, Taiwan and Japan were closely related to each other, and there were at least two specimens from different regions clustered ahead of those from the same region.
