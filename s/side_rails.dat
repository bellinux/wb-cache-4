25|$|Interventionalists {{require a}} {{floating}} tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, {{but based on}} their interventional experience in angiography {{may be used to}} having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table.|$|E
500|$|P90 TR:The P90 TR (Triple Rail) model, {{also known}} as the [...] "flat-top," [...] was {{introduced}} in late 1999. It features a receiver-mounted triple MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail interface system, or [...] "Triple Rail," [...] for mounting accessories. There is one full-length accessory rail integrated into the top of the receiver, and two rail stumps are included {{on the sides of the}} receiver. The top rail will accept various optical sights with no tools or additional mounting hardware required, and the <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> serve to mount secondary accessories, such as tactical lights or laser aiming devices.|$|E

[...] Towards the end of the original production run of The Addams Family some machines had been produced with golden features to celebrate the machine's sales record.

2500|$|Like {{the rest}} of Chevrolet's 1958 full size car line up, the Bel Air {{featured}} Chevrolet's new [...] "Safety-Girder" [...] cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine. [...] These [...] "x-frames" [...] were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. This design was later criticized as providing less protection {{in the event of}} a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.|$|E

When detached, they {{can be used as a}} pair by a single player, attached to a grip that emulates a gamepad form factor, or used as separate controllers by two individual players. A single Switch console can support up to eight Joy-Con connections. Straps can be attached to the sides of Joy-Con when they are detached.|$|E

2500|$|All GM {{passenger}} vehicles received a major redesign in 1965 dominated by flowing [...] "Coke bottle" [...] lines and fastback roof profiles on its coupe models, and the 6 window-body style was eliminated. For 1965, Buick also changed its marketing strategy and offering the Electra 225 in two trim levels, base and Custom. Along {{with the new}} body came a new chassis with a full perimeter frame including <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> that replaced the previous [...] "X" [...] frame used since 1961. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1964 including the standard 325-horsepower 401 V8, and {{two versions of the}} larger 425 V8 that were rated at [...] with a four-barrel carburetor or [...] with two four barrels. The three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission was standard equipment. [...] A new body style introduced for 1965 was the thin-pillar 4-door sedan, which featured frameless window glass with a thin, chrome fixed [...] "B" [...] pillar.|$|E
2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{after this}} all the Boers, except those who were keeping guard, filed into the place and began to clamber on to the buck-waggon, seating {{themselves}} with much rough joking in a double row upon the broad <b>side</b> <b>rails.</b> Next appeared Hans Coetzee, his head bound up in a bloody handkerchief. He was pale and shaky, but Bessie {{could see that he}} was but little the worse for his wound. Then came Frank Muller himself, looking white and very terrible, and as he came the men stopped their jokes and talking. Indeed it was curious to observe how strong was his ascendancy over them. As a rule, the weak part of Boer organisation is that it is practically impossible to persuade one Boer to pay deference to or obey another; but this was certainly not the case where Frank Muller was concerned.|$|E
