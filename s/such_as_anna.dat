Mahler also introduced the practice of dimming the lighting in the theatre during performances, which was initially not appreciated by the audience.

25|$|These basic {{political}} views and principles {{formed the basis}} of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista in 1914, who called themselves Fascisti (Fascists). At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists. Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even democratic socialists who opposed the war <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Anna</b> Kuliscioff said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.|$|E
500|$|Trimmer {{took her}} {{reviewing}} very seriously and her over 400 reviews constitute {{a set of}} distinct values. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children’s books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was always Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on Biblical inerrancy illustrates her fundamentalism. She criticized books that included scenes of death, characters who were insane, and representations of sexuality, as well as books that might frighten children. She typically praised books that encouraged intellectual instruction, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Anna</b> Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79).|$|E

500|$|In his {{analysis}} of her reviews, Grenby comes to the conclusion [...] "Trimmer was ... not nearly so vitriolic in her reviewing as her reputation suggests.... fewer than 50 [...] were chiefly negative, and of these only 18 were thoroughly excoriating. These were easily outweighed by the positive notices, although most of her reviews were mixed or– more surprisingly given her reputation for always impassioned appraisal– ambivalent." [...] She objected primarily to texts that altered the Bible, such as William Godwin's Bible Stories (1802), and secondarily to books that promoted ideas she associated with the French Revolution. She also criticized the inclusion of scenes of death, characters who were insane, and representations of sexuality, as well as books that might frighten children. She typically praises books that encourage intellectual instruction, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Anna</b> Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79).|$|E
500|$|Original Stories {{encourages}} {{its readers}} to develop what {{were at the}} time coming to be labelled middle-class values: industry, self-discipline, economy, and charity. As Andrew O’Malley points out {{in his analysis of}} 18th-century children’s books, [...] "middle-class writers wanted children to associate happiness with morality and social utility instead" [...] of [...] "the trappings of wealth and status". The end of the 18th century saw the development of what is now referred to as the [...] "middle-class ethos", and [...] "children’s literature became one of the crucial mechanisms for disseminating and consolidating middle-class ideology" [...] throughout British and American society. Works by children’s writers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Anna</b> Laetitia Barbauld, Ellenor Fenn, Sarah Trimmer, and Dorothy Kilner all embrace this ethos, although they differ radically in their opinions on other political issues, such as the French Revolution.|$|E
500|$|Crawford's father {{abandoned}} the family {{a few months}} before her birth, reappearing later in 1930 in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working as a construction laborer. Following LeSueur's departure from the family home, Crawford's mother married Henry J. Cassin. The marriage is listed in the census as Crawford's mother's first marriage. Crawford lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in Lawton, Oklahoma. There, Cassin, a minor impresario, ran the Ramsey Opera House; he managed to book diverse and noted performers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Anna</b> Pavlova and Eva Tanguay. At that time, Crawford was reportedly unaware that Cassin, whom she called [...] "daddy", was not her biological father until her brother Hal told her the truth. Cassin began sexually abusing Crawford when she was eleven; the abuse continued until she went away to Catholic school. Crawford preferred the nickname [...] "Billie" [...] as a child and enjoyed watching vaudeville acts perform on the stage of her stepfather's theatre. Because the family's instability negatively affected Crawford's childhood, her schooling never formally progressed beyond elementary school.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{with the}} Analytical Reviews third issue, Mary Wollstonecraft became the key editor for dramas, romances, and novels. Scholars {{have speculated that}} her reviews are signed by the letters [...] "M", [...] "W", or [...] "T", {{corresponding}} roughly to her initials, {{in large part because}} they have identified her writing style in these pieces. Her reviews, which number over 200, are generally characterized by their concern for women's issues. Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers concludes that Wollstonecraft [...] "is not only a pioneer feminist, but also a pioneer feminist critic, whose analysis of the mesh between gender and genre inaugurates the feminist critical project". Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews, criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising, for example, the [...] "wise and resilient" [...] Mrs Stafford of Charlotte Smith's autobiographical novel Emmeline (1788). In highlighting this character, she [...] "singles out... the knowledgeable mother figure who has felt and thought deeply", one who resembles the women she described in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) as having [...] "power... over themselves". She derides the [...] "derivative, prescriptive, imitative, and affected" [...] and celebrates the [...] "natural, innovative, [...] imaginative". Evincing a particular regard for the works of Thomas Holcroft, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Anna</b> St. Ives (1792), Wollstonecraft celebrated their championing of innate nobility and virtue over aristocratic titles. Romanticist Anne Chandler argues that Wollstonecraft's reviews demonstrate [...] "an earlier Augustan politics of knowledge, variously outlined by Dryden, Pope, and, to a lesser extent, Swift" [...] which [...] "may be seen in her insistence on a continuum between aesthetic integrity and civic virtue; her belief in a metaphysical dialogue between human wit and divine Nature; and her perception of belletristic criticism as the proper tribunal for a new onslaught of scholarly and scientific research". While writing her last novel, [...] (1798), Wollstonecraft took advantage of her position with Johnson and reviewed almost nothing but novels, exposing herself to the wide variety of novelistic forms.|$|E
