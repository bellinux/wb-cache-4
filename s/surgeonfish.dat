5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal <b>surgeonfish.</b> These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal <b>surgeonfish.</b> Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. <b>surgeonfish,</b> queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including mullet, groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, <b>surgeonfish,</b> and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of mullet against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E

25|$|Damselfish are a {{group of}} species that feed on {{zooplankton}} and algae, and are an important reef forage fish for larger predators. They are small, typically five centimetres (two inches) long. Many species are aggressive towards other fishes which also graze on algae, such as <b>surgeonfish.</b> <b>Surgeonfish</b> sometimes use schooling as a countermeasure to defensive attacks by solitary damselfish.|$|E
25|$|The same hideouts in a reef may be {{regularly}} {{inhabited by}} different species {{at different times}} of day.

Spawning {{occurred}} in or {{adjacent to the}} channel draining the fringing reef at specific times of day: dawn (A. lineatus), daytime (T quinquevittatum, T hardwickii), or dusk (A. guttatus, A. triostegus); and spawning time tracked seasonal changes in day length.

25|$|Large {{schools of}} forage fish, such as <b>surgeonfish</b> and cardinalfish, {{move around the}} reef feeding on tiny zooplankton. The forage fish are, in turn, eaten by larger fish, such as the bigeye trevally. Fish receive many {{benefits}} from schooling behaviour, including defence against predators through better predator detection, since each fish is on the lookout. Schooling fish have developed remarkable displays of precise choreography which confuse and evade predators. For this they have evolved special pressure sensors along their sides, called lateral lines, that let them feel each other's movements and stay synchronized.|$|E
25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and <b>surgeonfish.</b> There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of ecological processes on coral reefs was examined based on Eocene fossil fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy and extant species from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Using ecologically relevant morphological metrics, we investigated the {{evolution of}} herbivory in <b>surgeonfishes</b> (Acanthuridae) and rabbitfishes (Siganidae). Eocene and Recent <b>surgeonfishes</b> showed remarkable similarities, with grazers, browsers and even specialized, long-snouted forms having Eocene analogues. These long-snouted Eocene species were probably pair-forming, crevice-feeding forms like their Recent counterparts. Although Eocene <b>surgeonfishes</b> likely {{played a critical role}} as herbivores during the origins of modern coral reefs, they lacked the novel morphologies seen in modern Acanthurus and Siganus (including eyes positioned high above their low-set mouths). Today, these forms dominate coral reefs in both abundance and species richness and are associated with feeding on shallow, exposed algal turfs. The radiation of these new forms, and their expansion into new habitats in the Oligocene-Miocene, reflects the second phase in the development of fish herbivory on coral reefs that is closely associated with the exploitation of highly productive short algal turfs...|$|R
25|$|Herbivores feed on plants. The four largest {{groups of}} coral reef fishes that feed on plants are the parrotfishes, damselfishes, rabbitfishes, and <b>surgeonfishes.</b> All feed {{primarily}} on microscopic and macroscopic algae growing {{on or near}} coral reefs.|$|R

50|$|<b>Surgeonfishes</b> {{sometimes}} feed as solitary individuals, {{but they}} also often travel and feed in schools.

Due in part to the extensive distributions of most species and the life history traits exhibited in these two families, only three (1. 7 %) of the species are listed at an elevated risk of global extinction. The majority of the parrotfishes and <b>surgeonfishes</b> (86 %) are listed as Least Concern, 10 % are listed as Data Deficient and 1 % are listed as Near Threatened. The risk of localized extinction, however, is higher in some areas, particularly in the Coral Triangle region. The relatively low proportion of species globally listed in threatened Categories is highly encouraging, and some conservation successes are attributed to concentrated conservation efforts. However, with the growing realization of man's profound impact on the planet, conservation actions such as improved marine reserve networks, more stringent fishing regulations, and continued monitoring of the population status at the species and community levels are imperative for the prevention of species loss in these groups of important and iconic coral reef fishes...|$|R
