5|$|Cushing patrolled off the Irish coast, {{meeting and}} escorting convoys of {{merchant}} ships and troop transports to British ports and the French coast. German submarines {{were active in}} the area and Cushing conducted antisubmarine patrols and performed rescue work on the ships that were victims of U-boats. On 4 June, she picked up 13 men adrift in a <b>small</b> <b>boat,</b> survivors of Italian brig Luisa.|$|E
5|$|In November 1791, a French convoy sailed from Mahé on {{the short}} journey to Mangalore. The convoy {{included}} two merchant vessels and the frigate Résolue, a 36-gun warship under Captain Callamand. Passing northwards, the convoy soon passed Tellicherry and Cornwallis sent Strachan with Phoenix and Perseverance to stop and inspect the French ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies. As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them, Strachan did the same to Résolue, hailing the French captain and placing an officer in a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> to board the frigate. The French captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality, and responded by opening fire: British sources suggest that his initial target was the <b>small</b> <b>boat,</b> although Phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged.|$|E
5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second <b>small</b> <b>boat.</b> That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E

30|$|In [5], {{temporal}} {{characteristics of}} sea clutter {{and that of}} a range of <b>small</b> <b>boats</b> are analysed using a comprehensive set of recorded datasets. This is done in an attempt to understand the dynamics and associated reflexivity of <b>small</b> <b>boats.</b> An empirical sea model is then derived. It then allows the development of advanced detection and tracking algorithms, which will help improve the performance of surveillance and marine navigation radar against <b>small</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> drifts {{farther south}} on a current of {{increasingly}} warm water, {{which has become}} milky white in color. After several days they encounter a rain of ashes and then observe a huge cataract of fog or mist, which splits open to accommodate their entrance upon approach. The native dies as a huge shrouded white figure appears before them.|$|E
5|$|The storm, which {{ultimately}} made landfall near the Virginia–North Carolina border, produced high winds {{along the coast}} from New Jersey through North Carolina. A <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> sank {{off the coast of}} New Jersey, killing three of its occupants. Overall damage was estimated around $150,000 (1967USD), although the storm overall was considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E

5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a rubber dinghy. The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> for Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Born to an upper-class family, David {{rebelled against}} social {{norms of the}} day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they were nearly trapped by the German {{invasion}} in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but the marriage was not long-lived.|$|E
5|$|Exercises were {{conducted}} using live ammunition and explosives to make training as realistic as possible. Physical fitness was a prerequisite, with cross country runs and boxing matches to improve fitness. Speed and endurance marches {{were conducted}} {{up and down}} the nearby mountain ranges and over assault courses that included a zip-line over Loch Arkaig, all while carrying arms and full equipment. Training continued by day and night with river crossings, mountain climbing, weapons training, unarmed combat, map reading, and <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> operations on the syllabus.|$|E

5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea. He modified the <b>small</b> <b>boat,</b> James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|Notable German burials include Musketier Oskar Niemeyer {{from the}} 84th Infantry Regiment {{was the first}} {{recipient}} of the Iron Cross during the war. Having come to a crossing of the Mons–Condé canal with a closed swing bridge he swam across the canal, returned across the canal with a requisitioned <b>small</b> <b>boat,</b> paddled back across the canal with a team and then opened the bridge allowing the Germans troops to cross in greater numbers. He was killed shortly after opening the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{training}} programs included greater {{cooperation between the}} Army's combat arms {{and with the other}} services. A Combined Training Centre, also known as HMAS Assault, opened on 1 September 1942 at Nelson Bay, adjacent to Port Stephens, New South Wales, as a central establishment for the training staffs, beach parties and <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> crews. In July 1942, a Combined Training School was established at Bribie Island, Queensland, and nearby Toorbul Point for Army units. During 1943 and 1944, combined training with the RAAF and RAN was also carried out at Trinity Beach, near Cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in the South West Pacific as the Allies advanced.|$|E

5|$|The botik (<b>small</b> <b>boat)</b> was constructed, {{either in}} England or by Danes in Russia using an English design, in the 1640s, and {{was then called}} the St. Nicholas. The boat {{originally}} belonged to Peter the Great's grandfather; an earlier theory held that the boat {{was a gift from}} Queen Elizabeth to Ivan the Terrible in the 1580s. It is the last remnant of the fleet of wooden boats maintained by Peter's father, Alexis; the rest rotted from neglect or were destroyed during the rebellion of Stenka Razin.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer size}} and {{complexity}} of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, more tangible closed systems. For example, he likens human existence on Earth— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources— to life at sea on a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.|$|E
5|$|With no aid {{possible}} from the shore, night fell on 14January {{with most of the}} crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one of these small craft survived the passage.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few months}} of the {{founding}} of the Swan River Colony in June 1829 by free-settlers, there was a need for a prison to incarcerate criminals. There was little infrastructure for the settlers, let alone criminals, so the shipwrecked Marquis of Angelsea, just off the coast from South Beach, was used as a makeshift prison. This arrangement was quite arduous for the sheriff, who spent much of his time rowing a <b>small</b> <b>boat,</b> either to transfer prisoners or bring over their meals. It was not until September 1830 that work started on a new prison at the west end of High Street: the twelve-sided Round House on Arthur Head.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 on {{the morning}} of 18 December, a <b>small</b> <b>boat</b> sailed from Anse la Barque with a message {{offering}} the British a temporary truce. Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled {{at the entrance to the}} bay. Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. His plan was simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the flûtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs bringing up the rear. The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships.|$|E
