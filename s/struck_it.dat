5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was <b>struck,</b> <b>it</b> did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Dangić {{ordered his}} forces to not resist German and NDH troops during the anti-Partisan {{offensive}} known as Operation Southeast Croatia. Afterwards, {{he was invited}} to Belgrade to negotiate the terms of proposed Chetnik collaboration with the Germans with Milan Nedić and General der Artillerie (lieutenant general) Paul Bader. Although a deal was <b>struck,</b> <b>it</b> was vetoed by the Wehrmacht Commander in Southeast Europe, General der Pioniere (lieutenant general) Walter Kuntze, who remained suspicious of Dangić. Despite this, Dangić's Chetniks collaborated with German forces in eastern Bosnia {{over a period of several}} months beginning in December 1941. In April, Dangić was arrested when he travelled to Serbia despite promising to operate only within the territory of Bosnia, and was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland. In 1943, he escaped from the camp and the following year participated in the Warsaw Uprising. In 1945, he was captured by the Red Army and was extradited to Yugoslavia, where he stood accused of committing war crimes. In 1947, he was tried, convicted, sentenced to death and executed by Yugoslavia's new Communist authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Seven {{participated in}} {{perhaps the most famous}} Stanley Cup {{challenge}} of all, that of Dawson City of the Yukon Territory in 1905. Organized by Joe Boyle, a Toronto-born prospector, who had <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> rich in the Yukon gold rush of 1898, The Dawson City Nuggets had Lorne Hanna, who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a 1904 challenge and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, who had played for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, who had played for Queen's College against the Montreal Victorias in an 1895 challenge. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted in the summer of 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa, as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} {{began with a}} speedy Cardiff attack. Corinthian countered, {{resulting}} in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from a few feet out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, who fired it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to be about to score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, US 213 was realigned {{to cross}} the Choptank River at Cambridge on the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge that opened in 1935. The route {{replaced}} MD 344 between Vienna and Mount Holly, ran concurrent with MD 16 between Mount Holly and Cambridge, and turned north across the river to continue to Easton. The former routing of US 213 between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. Also, US 213 was relocated to a new alignment to the north between West Ocean City and Ocean City. In 1939, the road between US 40 and the northern terminus of US 213 in Elkton and the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill was designated MD 280. The portion of MD 280 between Fair Hill and the Pennsylvania border was built as a state highway by 1933. On July 28, 1942, the vertical lift bridge carrying US 213 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, built in 1927, was destroyed when the tanker Franz Klasen <b>struck</b> <b>it.</b> The destroyed bridge {{was replaced by the}} current Chesapeake City Bridge, which opened in 1949. The approaches to the original bridge are now designated as MD 537 and a western extension of MD 285. A portion of US 213 south of Easton was moved to a straight alignment by 1946; the former routing became MD 565. By 1946, work was underway for a bypass to the east of Easton along with a straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills. US 213 was moved to this new alignment in 1948, with the former alignment on Washington Street in Easton becoming an extended MD 333 {{in the southern part of}} the city and an extended MD 33 in the northern part the city, while MD 662 was designated on the original alignment between Easton and Wye Mills.|$|E

25|$|Recruits are to {{be taught}} the art of {{throwing}} stones both with the hand and sling. The inhabitants of the Balearic Islands {{are said to have}} been the inventors of slings, and to have managed them with surprising dexterity, owing to the manner of bringing up their children. The children were not allowed to have their food by their mothers till they had first <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> with their sling. Soldiers, notwithstanding their defensive armour, are often more annoyed by the round stones from the sling than by all the arrows of the enemy. Stones kill without mangling the body, and the contusion is mortal without loss of blood. It is universally known the ancients employed slingers in all their engagements. There is the greater reason for instructing all troops, without exception, in this exercise, as the sling cannot be reckoned any encumbrance, and often is of the greatest service, especially when they are obliged to engage in stony places, to defend a mountain or an eminence, or to repulse an enemy at the attack of a castle or city.|$|E
25|$|The Barranca Arroyo {{is a small}} canyon {{structure}} {{about an}} hour and a half from the municipal seat. The water flows year round with several areas where it pools, but the water is cold. The area is surrounded by large mountains with abundant vegetation. There is camping, hiking and picnicking. The Peña de la Viuda is a natural monolith which falls directly into an arroyo. The area has abundant vegetation, and activities such as skiing, camping and hiking. La Escondida is an area in mountainous forest with a permanent fresh water spring. It permits camping and hiking. El Cidral is an area with cedar trees surrounding a clearing for camping and hiking. The Peña de la Glora waterfall is surrounded by thick vegetation. The lowest part has a natural spring and the upper part has a deep, unexplored cave. The Cueva de los Riscos (Cave of the Crags) is named after the crags which appear in various of its chambers. The entrance begins with a rocky descent then levels out to an area with sand. The center has a hillock with looks like a monolith rock. This can be climbed to observe the various crags with contain ice. One of these in the shape of a pulpit and another is called the “bell tower” because if it is <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> sounds like a bell.|$|E

25|$|Asterion, king of Crete, {{adopted the}} three sons of Zeus and Europa, Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus. According to the Odyssey {{he spoke with}} Zeus every nine years or for nine years. He got his laws {{straight}} from Zeus himself. When Minos' son Androgeos had won the Panathenaic Games the king, Aegeus, sent him to Marathon to fight a bull, resulting {{in the death of}} Androgeos. Outraged, Minos went to Athens to avenge his son, and on the way he camped at Megara where Nisos lived. Learning that Nisos' strength came from his hair, Minos gained the love of Scylla and her aid in cutting off her father's hair so that he could conquer the city. After his triumph, he punished Scylla for her treachery against her father by tying her to a boat and dragging her until she drowned. On arriving in Attica, he asked Zeus to punish the city, and the god <b>struck</b> <b>it</b> with plague and hunger. An oracle told the Athenians to meet any of Minos' demands if they wanted to escape the punishment. Minos then asked Athens to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every nine years to be sacrificed to the Minotaur, the offspring from the zoophilic encounter of Minos' wife Pasiphaë with a certain bull that the king refused to sacrifice to Poseidon, which he had placed within a labyrinth he commanded his architect Daedalus to build. The Minotaur was defeated by the hero Theseus with the help of Minos' daughter Ariadne.|$|E
