40|$|The {{problems}} addressed are: (1) {{comparison of}} prevalences of Salmonella spp. in different herd {{types in the}} Danish pig population after implementation of the Danish Salmonella Control Program (DSCP), and (2) to make {{a reference to a}} study from 1993 / 1994 (pre-implementation) with a discussion of possible biases when diagnostic methods differ slightly. The objectives were to present the prevalences of Salmonella spp., Salmonella Typhimurium, and multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 in Danish pig herds in 1998. Further, to discuss how herd prevalences may be compared to a previous study. A bacteriological study in 1998 comprised: (a) a random sample of <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> producing herds (N= 1962); (b) a random sample of farrow-to-grower (sow) herds (N= 305); and (c) all breeding and multiplying (genetic) herds (N= 366). A previous bacteriological study on Salmonella presence in 1993 / 1994 served {{as a model for the}} present study. The results of the study were that multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 was detected in one herd producing slaughter pigs. The herd apparent prevalences (HAPs) of Salmonella spp. were 11. 7, 16. 7 and 11. 4 % in genetic, sow, and <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> herds, respectively. The conclusion of the study was that prevalence of multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 was low in the examined <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> herds.

The main aim of the risk assessment was to assess the effectiveness of interventions implemented on-farm and at the abattoir in reducing human cases of pig meat borne salmonellosis, and how the effects of these interventions may vary across EU Member States. Two case study Member States have been chosen to assess the effect of the interventions investigated. Reducing both breeding herd and <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> prevalence were effective in achieving reductions in the number of expected human illnesses in both case study Member States. However, there is scarce evidence to suggest which specific on-farm interventions could achieve consistent reductions in either breeding herd or <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> prevalence. Hypothetical reductions in feed contamination rates were important in reducing <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> prevalence for the case study Member State where prevalence of infection was already low, but not for the high-prevalence case study.

Simply knowing that these time series have long term dependence could have strong significance when forecasting prices. The presence of long memory is crucial information in making business decisions and creating portfolios. Long memory {{can be measured}} by calculating the so-called Hurst exponent. In our article, we studied and described three different methods (Rescaled range, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average). Data consist of four time series (piglet, young pig, sow, <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig)</b> between 1991 and 2011. Before conducting the econometric analysis, all the series were seasonally adjusted using the TRAMO/SEATS method. Data preparation was followed by differencing the time series and testing their normality and stationarity. In the next step, we divided the analysed period into four parts and determined the Hurst exponent for each sub-period, using all three methods. In summary, results showed that <b>slaughter</b> <b>pig</b> prices are random; pig and piglet prices developed similarly and have long memory, while sow price changes definitely have short memory.
