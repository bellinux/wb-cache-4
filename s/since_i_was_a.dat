25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, {{and the person}} in the world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|Phillip Leslie Wilcher {{was born}} on 16 March 1958 to Naomi Joy Thompson (8 April 1929 – 21 June 2005) and Leslie James Wilcher (born 16 January 1923), a World War II veteran. Wilcher grew up in Camperdown. As of 2004, he resided in Concord and owns no cell phone, watch, computer, or car: [...] "My entire life <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy was writing music and that has overshadowed everything. [...] I would be happy living in an {{oversized}} cardboard box with a piano and a blank sheet of manuscript paper".|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an {{exhibition}} in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid. I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E

500|$|Sevigny {{has only}} had {{long-term}} relationships with men, though in 2006 she stated to the New York Post Gossip column: [...] "I've questioned issues {{of gender and}} sexuality <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> teenager, and I did some experimenting." [...] In a later interview, she stated that she [...] "wouldn't call herself bisexual," [...] and that she could never see herself {{in a relationship with}} a woman. Nonetheless, she has been popular with the gay community throughout her career. Following her on and off relationship with Harmony Korine, which ended in the late 1990s, Sevigny dated British musician Jarvis Cocker, and later Matt McAuley, a member of the noise-rock band A.R.E. Weapons. Sevigny and McAuley ended their eight-year relationship in early 2008.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|Garbage drummer and co-producer Butch Vig {{said that}} when the group contributed to film soundtracks, [...] "one of our fantasies would be to do the Bond theme or do the new Bond song." [...] Manson called herself {{a fan of the}} series, [...] "an {{institution}} I admire and has always captured my imagination <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child", and the films had a [...] "sensibility quite similar to how we approach making music". The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because [...] "you know it's going down in movie history", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, [...] "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!" [...] The singer considered Garbage's music and the series' concepts [...] "something that you can enjoy on the surface, but underneath there are lots of conflicting themes you can get into." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|After the sprint race, Coletti {{spoke of}} his {{childhood}} dream of hearing the Monegasque national anthem while standing {{on the top step}} of the Monaco podium, [...] "It feels great I mean I’ve seen all the drivers winning here <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid. I’m really, really happy especially that with this win I’ve consolidated my lead in the standings." [...] He said for the season's next race at Silverstone his team need to improve his car in qualifying trim and then aim to secure victory in the feature race. Quaife-Hobbs said it felt [...] "amazing" [...] to clinch his first career podium, [...] "Today, it’s a great reward for the team and how hard they’ve worked. We are a new team. Now every new team have had a podium." [...] Quaife-Hobbs believed if he had defended from Coletti on the third lap both drivers would not have entered the Novelle Chicane and affirmed that he elected to follow Coletti with the view for a attack later in the race. Third-place finisher Evans revealed on the formation lap he struggled to get the optimum rear tyre temperature especially {{since the start of the}} race was the best time to gain track position and was aware that finishing on the podium would probably not be realistic. Nevertheless he was happy to have again finished on the Monaco podium after altering his car.|$|E
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E
