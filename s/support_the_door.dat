The band was signed to Elektra by Paul Rothchild, who produced their self-titled album in Los Angeles, with additional songwriting by Greg Copeland and released in April 1968.

2500|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} the DMC-12 is its gull-wing <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> common problem of <b>supporting</b> <b>the</b> weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other {{manufacturers}} with lightweight <b>doors</b> in <b>the</b> Mercedes-Benz 300SL and a hydraulic pump in the Bricklin SV-1, although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DMC-12 features heavy doors supported by cryogenically preset torsion bars and gas-charged struts. These torsion bars were developed by Grumman Aerospace (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, PA) to withstand <b>the</b> stresses of <b>supporting</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> A popular misconception of <b>the</b> DMC-12's gull-wing <b>doors</b> is that they require far more side clearance to open relative to ordinary side-hinge doors, such as when parked in a parking lot. In fact, the opposite is true: the DMC-12 requires far less clearance than side-hinge doors, and this can be physically demonstrated. This misconception of side clearance may stem from a misunderstood location of the hinge point of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> by persons unfamiliar with DMC-12s. These doors, when opening, only require [...] clearance outside {{the line of the}} car, making opening and closing <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> in crowded spaces relatively easy. Much like <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> fitted to <b>the</b> Lamborghini Countach, <b>the</b> DMC-12 <b>doors</b> featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within <b>the</b> short <b>door</b> panels.

50|$|The Church of Our Lady of Spilice {{was named}} after smaller semi-caves {{that were on the}} site where it was built. Construction began on the land donated by Frano de Pelegrinis at the very {{beginning}} of the 16th century. According to archive documentation, it can be seen that in 1521 it was still not finished and that the builders had increased their dimensions during the construction. There are various styles visible in this appearance: gothic, renaissance and baroque. Its oldest part, the central one, was built in the first half of the 16th century and brings the characteristics of transient gothic and renaissance style. <b>The</b> main <b>door</b> has fluted dooryambs on which are two semi-capitals <b>supporting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> transom. Above <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is a semicircular lunette, that is simply and well-defined and adomed with pinions. Even the rounded window of the façade is of the Renaissance period whilst an attenuate distaff with three bells is the highest in Dalmatia. The church's naves are entered through two baroque doors over which are double-winged pediments and above them rounded windows. The church's interior is divided by broad semicircular arches on masonry pillars into three naves. With this the unity of the space was achieved illuminated by the long narrow windows of Romanic and gothic exterior, of which some were transferred from the old walls which dated back to the 16th century. The posterior part of the church was also enlarged with a baroque shrine, the chapel of St. Vicko and a sacristy. From the altar polyptych created by the famous Venice painter, Girolamo de Santacroce.|$|R
5000|$|The Chrysler CCV {{featured}} an injection-molded {{plastic body}} with a fabric roof and an air-cooled 2-cylinder engine driving the front wheels.

The car's simplicity would have ensured longevity and reliability in harsh conditions, and made it easy for owners to do their own maintenance and repair work. Despite its lightweight construction, the CCV performed well in front and rear crash tests, although its lack of structural <b>support</b> in <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and side pillars would have prevented sales in first world markets.|$|R

50|$|Two {{identical}} historical markers {{commemorating the}} hospital were erected in 2013. One {{is in front}} of the former hospital building. The other, at an entrance to the campus, is on the SW corner of the intersection of Palmer Avenue and South Adams Street. The marker (note that the transcriptions of its text in the references just given are not completely accurate) reads as follows:THE FLORIDA A&M UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL (1911-1971)The first healthcare facility built in Florida for African-Americans sic was the Florida A&M College (FAMC) Hospital, known as the Florida A&M University (FAMU) Hospital after 1953. The school's original two-story, 19-bed wooden sanitarium was built in 1911 (since demolished), and provided medical care to patients of all races living in Leon and surrounding counties. It was supervised by Jennie Virginia Hilyer, RN, a graduate of Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., later renamed Howard University Hospital. In 1926, Leonard H.B. Foote, MD, a graduate of Howard University Medical School, became hospital administrator. Foote established FAMC's School of Nursing in 1936, the first baccalaureate nursing program in Florida. He led a 10-year campaign to construct a new modern brick hospital, which opened in 1950. As a major medical center, the hospital provided clinical training for students and opportunities for research. After the withdrawal of federal and state <b>support,</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> hospital closed on December 11, 1971. Today, the hospital's legacy continues through Florida A&M Uhiversity's School of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, and School of Allied Health Sciences.|$|R

5000|$|Closed {{vehicles}} {{without a}} B-pillar are widely called hardtops {{and have been}} available in two or four-door body styles, in sedans, coupes and wagons.

40|$|Bow {{doors are}} one of the most {{vulnerable}} parts on a RoRo vessel. At the same time, they are necessary for the profitability of today's RoRo vessels. The minimum design rules for bow-door systems, stated in the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) UR S 8, constitute the basis for the class rules. In this work, the Rules of IACS UR S 8 have been assessed regarding the structural integrity for bow <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> 'clam door' type. The work is based on previous damage, compared to the design rules, so as to find weaknesses in the rules. Damage was mapped and weak points in the rules as well as in the design and construction stages were identified. For the problem areas found, part analyses were performed. Fractures and cracks dominate as being the cause of damage to bow-door systems. In most of these cases, cracks in welds are involved. Fatigue appears to be a major cause for the development of fractures and cracks. Assuming <b>the</b> bow <b>door</b> as being a rigid body and distributing the forces equally on each support, as prescribed by IACS UR S 8, appears to be an approach that leads to inadequate results. The deformation of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> causes <b>the</b> loads on <b>the</b> <b>supports</b> to differ significantly and the real pressure distribution subjects <b>the</b> lower <b>supports</b> to much higher loads then the upper ones. It is common with gaps between <b>the</b> <b>supports</b> in <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding ones in the hull. These gaps considerably affect the load distribution on <b>the</b> <b>supports...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{historic}} terminology, a sedan {{will have}} a frame around <b>the</b> <b>door</b> windows, while <b>the</b> hardtop has frameless door glass. A true hardtop design also has no center or [...] "B" [...] pillar for roof <b>support</b> behind <b>the</b> front <b>doors).</b> This pillarless body style offers greater visibility. However, it requires extra underbody strengthening for structural rigidity. The hardtop design can be considered separately (i.e., a vehicle can be simply called a four-door hardtop), {{or it can be}} called a hardtop sedan. During the 1960s and 1970s, hardtop sedans were often sold as sport sedans by several American manufacturers and they were among the top selling body styles. During the 1980s, automakers in the U.S. focused on removing weight and increasing strength, and their new four-door sedans with B-pillars were called pillared hardtops or pillared sedans. The sport sedan term has since been appropriated for other uses. In Japan the hardtop design was used for several luxury-type sedans during the 1990s.|$|R
