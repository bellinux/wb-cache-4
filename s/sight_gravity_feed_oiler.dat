50|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> is the {{simplest}} and cheapest form of hopper available. <b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> hoppers consist of a large container and a feed tube molded into the bottom. Paintballs roll down the sloped sides, through the tube and into the marker. These hoppers have a maximum rate of 11.6 balls per second. <b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> hoppers are very cheap, since they are made of only a shell and a lid, but can become jammed easily as paintballs accumulate above the tube. Rocking the marker (and hopper) occasionally can prevent the paintballs from jamming in the hopper.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> is one {{fuel supply}} way for {{aeroplane}} and the simulation {{of it is}} very important. The traditional method to calculate the <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> is to assume that only one tank in fuel system supplies the needed fuel to the engine, and then calculated for the single branch. Actually, all fuel tanks compete for supplying fuel and the key problem for <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> calculation is to simulate the multiple-branch and transient process. The present paper gives the mathematical model for fuel flow pipe, pump, check valve and the simulation model for fuel tank at first, and then presented a new calculation model for <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> fuel of aeroplane fuel system based on the flow network theory and time difference method. The model takes into consideration all fuel tanks and can solve the multiple-branch and transient process of <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b> Finally, the thesis gives a numerical example for {{a certain type of}} aircraft, achieved the variations of fuel level and flow mass per second of each fuel tanks, the variations of the fuel pressure at the engine inlet, and predicted the maximum time that the aeroplane could fly safely under <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b> The numerical example indicts that the method proposed here is intrinsically superior to the traditional methods and is closer to understanding the real seriousness of the fuel supply situation. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the variability in spark assisted chemical engraving (SACE) <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling in glass. SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory. One problem SACE faces is it has issues with reproducibility. This is why the variability of the process is studied here. The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling. This goal is accomplished through three steps. First, the process is modeled to provide an efficient way to quantify variability. Two new stochastic models are presented that relate the depth evolution of SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling to the voltage. Statistical tests are used to validate the models. Second, experimental studies of the variability of the depth evolution are discussed. The effect on the variability of having poorly regulated bulk electrolyte temperature and level is studied. Finally, experimental results from two feedback controllers that are capable of reducing the variability in SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling are discussed. The results from these controllers are compared with the predictions of one of the models developed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> {{fuel systems}} are not immune to vapor lock. Much of the {{foregoing}} applies equally to a <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> system; if vapor forms in the fuel line, its lower density reduces the pressure developed {{by the weight of}} the fuel. This pressure is what normally moves fuel from the tank to the carburetor, so fuel supply will be disrupted until the vapor is removed, either by the remaining fuel pressure forcing it into the float bowl and out the vent or by allowing the vapor to cool and re-condense.|$|R

50|$|Agitating hoppers use a propeller, {{spinning}} {{inside the}} container, to agitate the paintballs.

[...] <b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> instruments require less air pressure for suction as the gravity pulls the paint into the mixing chamber. [...] Typically instruments with the finest mist atomization and detail requirements use this method since less air pressure allows for finer control paint flow and less overspray. [...] Side- and bottom-feed instruments allow the artist {{to see over the}} top, with the former sometimes offering left-handed and right-handed options to suit the artist. [...] A bottom feed airbrush typically holds a larger capacity of paint than the other types, and is often preferable for larger scale work such as automotive applications and tee-shirt design.|$|R

There were other features dedicated to the long-range function; there were two parallel oil filter circuits, allowing one filter to be removed and cleaned while the other remained in operation. The aircraft was even equipped with a pneumatic bed for a reserve pilot.
