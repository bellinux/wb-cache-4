25|$|The Ethernet {{physical}} layer {{has evolved over}} its existence starting in 1980 and encompasses multiple physical media interfaces and several orders of magnitude of speed. The speed ranges from 1Mbit/s to 100Gbit/s, while the physical medium can range from bulky coaxial cable to twisted pair and optical fiber. In general, network protocol stack <b>software</b> <b>will</b> work similarly on all {{physical layer}}s.|$|E
25|$|Since {{patching}} the kernel {{is technically}} permitted in 32-bit (x86) editions of Windows, several antivirus software developers use kernel patching to implement antivirus and other security services. This kind of antivirus <b>software</b> <b>will</b> not work on computers running x64 editions of Windows. Because of this, Kernel Patch Protection {{has been criticized}} for forcing antivirus makers to redesign their software without using kernel patching techniques.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{because of}} {{the design of the}} Windows kernel, Kernel Patch Protection cannot {{completely}} prevent kernel patching.

Nevertheless, Kernel Patching can still prevent problems of system stability, reliability, and performance caused by legitimate software patching the kernel in unsupported ways.|$|E

Although one {{goal of the}} laptop {{is that all of}} its software be open source, the source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source. While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these options is yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless chip set and owner of the current meshing protocol <b>software,</b> <b>will</b> make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC <b>software</b> <b>will</b> brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{entities}} {{may contain}} and {{be controlled by}} assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's transformation matrix. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form {{is based on the}} creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics <b>software</b> <b>will</b> change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up).|$|E
25|$|It is now common {{place for}} retail stores (mostly jewellery, {{silverware}} or award stores) {{to have a}} small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator {{and the ability to}} do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the <b>software</b> <b>will</b> translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.|$|E

25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The <b>software</b> <b>will</b> then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E

There is an integrated Android tablet embedded within each Link, {{which can be used}} to access city maps, directions, and services, as well as make video calls; they were formerly also available to allow patrons to use the internet, but these browsers have now been disabled due to abuse (see below). Each Link includes two free USB charging stations for smartphones as well as a phone that allows free calls to all 50 states and to Washington, D.C.. The Links allow people to make either phone calls (using the keypad and the headphone jack to the keypad's left), or video calls (using the tablet). Vonage provides this free domestic phone call service as well as the ability to make international calls using calling cards. [...] The Links feature a red 9-1-1 call button between the tablet and the headphone jack. The Links {{can also be used to}} call 3-1-1, and , they can be used for other simple tasks such as registering to vote. In April 2017, the Links were equipped with another app, Aunt Bertha, which could be utilized to find social services such as food pantries, financial aid, and emergency shelter.The Wi-Fi technology comes from Ruckus Wireless and is enabled by Qualcomm's Vive 802.11ac Wave 2 4x4 chipsets. The Links' operating system runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor and the Adreno 320 graphics processing unit. The Links' hardware and software can handle future upgrades. The <b>software</b> <b>will</b> be updated until at least 2022, but Qualcomm has promised to maintain the Links for the rest of their service lives.|$|E
