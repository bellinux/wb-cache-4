5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her.

Upon questioning, Collins explained that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E

Coming in upon {{the fall of}} Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal {{was part of a}} sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar.

It was not until deciding a 1987 case, for example, that Spain's Supreme Court held that a rape victim need not prove that she had fought to defend herself in order to verify the truth of her allegation.

One of his coven members found a watch on Morgan that he had given to Maeve as a present. As soon as Morgan had told him that she was Maeve's daughter it was unbearable for him to think that Maeve and Angus had borne a child. He performs tath meanma on Morgan and discovers that she is in fact his daughter. During the tath meanma, he witnessed Morgan's birth and her mother saying [...] "You have your father's eyes." [...] when in fact, Maeve's lover, Angus, had blue eyes and Morgan has brown, like Ciaran. In that moment Hunter comes in to save Morgan and Ciaran disappears with Hunter. The other coven members continued with the ritual. Hunter comes in again saved her with the help of Ciaran. The next time Morgan saw Ciaran was in Widows Vale they both shape-shifted into wolves. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> a watch sigil on him to track him.

2500|$|Voltaire {{was sent}} to the Bastille in May 1717 after {{suggesting}} in presence of a police informer that the Duchess of Berry was expecting a child conceived by her own father. During his imprisonment, Voltaire completed his play Oedipus which premièred on 18 November 1718 at the Comédie-Française. The Régent was present at the première and congratulated Voltaire for his success. Berry's clandestine pregnancies were often attributed to her alleged incestuous relationships with the Regent. These malicious rumors had made Voltaire's play controversial long before it was performed. Ironically, the Duchess of Berry was also present at the première. She entered [...] the theater in royal style escorted by the ladies of her court and her personal guard. The young princess was rumored to be expecting again and her condition, which she could not fully conceal, inspired the satirists' malicious comments that spectators would not only see Oedipus (the Regent) and Jocaste (Berry) but also detect the presence of Eteocles! The appearance at the premiere of the infamous Duchess, visibly enceinte, thus contributed to the public success of the play. On 11 February 1719, the Duchess of Berry attended another performance of Oedipus played for her nephew Louis XV at the Louvre. Wearing a splendidly embroidered robe à la Française, the princess sat next to the infant king. As with her previous pregnancies, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> on enormous weight during gestation and her loose fitting gown failed to hide her advanced condition. The room was very crowded and hot. Madame de Berry felt unwell and fainted when some allusion made in the play to Jocasta's incestuous pregnancy was loudly applauded by the public. She thus paid the price for her open flouting of public morality and outraging the public sense of decency by displaying her illegitimate pregnancy. The incident instantly awakened the jubilation of scandalmongers who expected Berry/Jocasta to go into labor and give birth to Eteocles {{in the middle of the}} performance. But a window was opened and the Duchess recovered from her swoon, thus frustrating the public taste for oedipian scandals.|$|E
