5|$|In 1562 the First War of Religion {{started in}} France, and Elizabeth was under {{pressure}} from her Protestant councillors to help the Huguenots. These were in possession of Le Havre, which was besieged by the Catholic Duke of Guise, and offered it to the English in return for military helplater, they promised, they would exchange it for Calais, which England had lost to France only in 1558. Elizabeth agreed to send 6,000 men to garrison Le Havre. Ambrose Dudley was chosen to lead the expedition in place of Robert Dudley, whom Elizabeth would not let go despite his <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> to do so.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native. It focuses on the reasons {{and the results of}} Eustacia Vye's <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> in life. The writer feels {{challenged}} to analyze the reasons why Eustacia finally has two <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> in her life and also the results of Eustacia's <b>strong</b> <b>desires.</b> In order to achieve the goal of the thesis, the writer uses the theories of literature, namely characterization and setting. Besides, she also uses psychological concepts of depression, frustration, and suicide. The writer uses these psychological concepts because Eustacia undergoes depression, frustration, and finally she commits suicide. The writer finds out that there are two reasons why Eustacia finally has two <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> in her life. The first reason is because she has t o move from Budmouth to Egdon. The different setting between Egdon and Budmouth causes her to have two strong desires: to live in the glamorous life and 'to be loved to madness'. The second reason is because she loses her parents' love and affection. The writer also finds out that Eustacia's <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> cause some results to appear. Her <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> cause her to live in illusions. They also cause her to use all means to reach her desires. In this case, she uses Wildeve and Clym. She finally gets married with Clym because she thinks that through him, she can reach her <b>strong</b> <b>desires.</b> In fact, Clym cannot fulfill her desires. This causes her to be disappointed of her marriage. Her disappointment of her marriage finally leads her to have a love affair with her former lover, Wildeve. At last, her <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> cause her to commit suicide. She commits suicide because she sees no hope anymore to reach her <b>strong</b> <b>desires.</b> Her <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> have led her to her downfall. As a conclusion, how Eustacia's desires lead her to her downfall shows that it is dangerous to have <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> in life without being able to accept the failures that may appear...|$|R

5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E

Several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; Rampal and Kapoor followed special diets to lose weight, and Verma learnt capoeira. Khan and Verma performed their own stunts, and Kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance.|$|E
5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3â€“2 vote on April13.|$|E

6000|$|Second, Thy {{fears that}} Christ will not receive thee may be also a {{consequent}} of thy earnest and <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> after thy salvation by him. For this I observe, that <b>strong</b> <b>desires</b> to have, are attended with strong fears of missing. What man most sets his heart upon, {{and what his}} desires are most after, he ofttimes most fears he shall not obtain. So the man, the ruler of the synagogue, had a great desire that his daughter should live; and that desire was attended with fear, that she should not.

5|$|The Dutch {{were very}} keen {{to resume the}} lucrative trade with Japan which had been choked off {{in the wake of}} the dispute between Nuyts and Hamada at the behest of the Japanese {{authorities}} in Edo. All their overtures to the Japanese court failed, until they decided to extradite Pieter Nuyts to Japan for the shogun to punish him as he saw fit. This was an unprecedented step, and was representative of both the extreme official displeasure with Nuyts in the Dutch hierarchy and the <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> to recommence Japanese trade. It also demonstrates the relative weakness of the Dutch when confronted by powerful East Asian states such as Japan, and recent historiography has suggested that the Dutch relied on the mercy of these states to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|After {{military}} service, Jarrell {{moved to}} Chicago where his sister Nellie attended Northwestern University. It was in Chicago where Jarrell {{would have his}} first museum experiences. Growing in up Georgia, African Americans {{were not allowed to}} visit museums until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore these early museum visits made a major impression on him. A year later he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago for advertising art and graphic design, where he attended night classes. His days were spent working at the International Paint company where he mixed paint. He also took classes at the Ray Vogue School for Commercial Arts. He began attending the Art Institute full-time in 1954. Jarrell eventually lost interest in commercial art and focused on classes about painting and drawing, gaining inspiration from instructor Laura McKinnon and her ideas about spatial relationship theory. In 1958, he graduated with his original major(s), retaining a <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> to pursue the life of a fine artist. At this time he also met artist Jeff Donaldson, who became a friend who influenced his career. In 1959, the year of his first marriage, he became an advertising photographer, taking photos of type and lettering styles. The couple would divorce shortly after the marriage.|$|E
5|$|The war had {{its origins}} in the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. The ancient Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by Tutsi kings, began {{implementing}} increasingly anti-Hutu policies in the 19th century, a trend continued by European colonial authorities from 1895. Both Germany and Belgium ruled through the kings and favoured the Tutsi. The Hutu population revolted in 1959, {{with the support of}} Belgium, which had effected a sudden reversal of allegiance. Hutu activists burned Tutsi homes, killed those who fought back, and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The revolution forced more than 100,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. These refugees lived in exile for several decades, agitating for a return to Rwanda, but were not capable of mounting a serious attack. Some refugees, including future RPF leaders Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, fought in the Ugandan Bush War with Yoweri Museveni, becoming senior army officers in 1986 under Museveni's presidency. Relations between the refugees and the Ugandans soured in the late 1980s with Rwigyema and Kagame demoted, but Hutu president Habyarimana refused to allow the return of refugees. This created a <b>strong</b> <b>desire</b> among refugees to return by force, so Rwigyema and Kagame used their military expertise to turn the RPF into a battle-ready army.|$|E
