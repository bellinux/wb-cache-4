40|$|Dietary R-{{sulforaphane}} is {{a highly}} potent inducer of the Keap 1 /Nrf 2 /ARE pathway. Furthermore, sulforaphane is currently being used in clinical trials to assess its effects against different tumour processes. This study reports an efficient preparation of enantiopure R-sulforaphane based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of its natural precursor glucoraphanin. As an alternative to broccoli seeds, we have exploited Tuscan black <b>kale</b> <b>seeds</b> as a suitable source for gram-scale production of glucoraphanin. The defatted seed meal contained 5. 1 % (w/w) of glucoraphanin that was first isolated through an anion exchange chromatographic process, and then purified by gel filtration. The availability of glucoraphanin (purity ≈ 95 %, weight basis) has allowed us to develop a novel simple hydrolytic process involving myrosinase (EC 3. 2. 1. 147) in a biphasic system to directly produce R-sulforaphane. In a typical experiment, 1. 09 g of enantiopure R-sulforaphane was obtained from 150 g of defatted Tuscan black <b>kale</b> <b>seed</b> meal...|$|R

40|$|Clubroot is a {{very serious}} disease of cabbage and closely related crops. The most {{susceptible}} crops include cabbage, Chinese cabbage, Brussels sprouts and some cultivars of turnip. Other related crops that may also be attacked include kohlrabi, kale, cauliflower, collards, broccoli, rutabaga, <b>sea</b> <b>kale,</b> all turnips, and radishes. Weeds in the mustard family may be infected and result in enhanced disease problems on the susceptible crops. The symptoms first noticed will be a decline of the plant including yellowing of leaves, and a tendency to wilt during hot days. Examination of the roots will reveal swollen, club-shaped roots instead of the normal fine network of roots (Fig. 1). In severe cases most roots will be affected (Fig. 2). The swollen roots will begin to decay and eventually disintegrate. Symptoms and Signs Figure 2 : Close-up of the club shaped roots. Clubroot is caused by the fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae. The important features of its life history include its longevity in soil, means of spread, and its reaction to soil pH. After the disease has occurred, the fungus can survive from seven to ten years without any susceptible plant ever being grown there.

ISBN: 978 - 88 - 902152 - 6 - 1 Introduction. Kales {{represent}} leafy {{forms and}} primitive types of Brassica oleracea L. They are traditional crops of several European areas (Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Turkey), rooted in local farming and food systems, and {{employed in the}} preparation of traditional dishes. Owing to similar aspects in their utilisation, kales appear a proper subject for a cross-country comparison. Furthermore, kales have gained increased attention due to their high content of healthy phytochemicals such as carotenoids, glucosinolates (GLS) and phenolics. The present investigation is aimed to compare different kale populations, either from local sources or cultivated in a common environment, for their bioactive amounts. Materials and methods. 25 kale samples were sampled from Italian, Portuguese, and Turkish local crops or markets. For the experimental trial, 15 <b>kale</b> <b>seed</b> samples were obtained from local seed companies or farmers, and planted in nursery. The plants were transplanted in a field located in Cesena (Italy). After freeze-drying, bioactives were extracted by proper solvent systems, quantified by HPLC, and identified by HPLC-mass spectrometry or standard compounds. Results. Total phenolics, GLS, carotenoids (lutein and beta-carotene), and chlorophylls were in the range 8310 - 38110, 755 - 8580, 135 - 2354, and 1740 - 16924 mg kg- 1 d. m., respectively. Growing environment did not consistently influence phenolic content. Both local and experimental Portuguese samples showed higher phenolic levels in comparison to those determined in Italian and Turkish kales. A high variability was noticed within local populations. Even in case of GLS, a remarkable variability was assessed in local populations and higher amounts of these bioactives were determined in Portuguese kales in comparison to Italian and Turkish samples. Aliphatic GLS accounted for 60 and 40 % of total GLS in experimental and local Portuguese kales, respectively, whereas indolic GLS were mainly quantified in Italian and Turkish populations. Local samples showed a total GLS amount about twice higher in comparison to experimental populations having the same geographical origin. On the contrary, pigments were significantly more abundant in experimental samples in comparison to local kales, owing to the higher soil fertility level. Conclusions. The first cross-country comparison of local kale types has been carried out as regards phytochemical amounts. Geographical origin and growing environment appeared as significant factors in determining bioactive levels in leafy kales and then nutritional and sensorial attributes of plants. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement n. º 227118...|$|R
40|$|Variables for the {{accelerated}} ageing (AA) test, methods for reducing fungal contamination during the AA test, using the conductivity test as a vigour test, {{the effect of}} seed size on seed vigour {{and the relationship between}} laboratory test results and field perfonnance in selected Brassica spp were investigated. In the first experiment, three seed lots of turnip rape hybrid (B. rapa x campestris), turnip (B. campestris) and forage rape (B. napus); and seven seed lots of Asian rape (B. napus), six seed lots of Asian kale (B. oleraceae var. alboglabra L.) and five seed lots of choisum (B. rapa var. pekinensis) with germinations above 90 % were aged at two different temperatures (41 and 42 °C ± 0. 3 °C) and three ageing times (24, 48 and 72 ± 15 minutes). The second experiment was divided into three sections. In the first, the same seed lots and species were aged at one temperature (41 °C) and time (72 h), but either 40 ml of saturated salts; KCl (83 %RH), NaCl (76 %RH), NaBr (55 %RH); or distilled water (96 %RH) were used as the ageing solutions. In the second, one turnip rape hyprid seed lot was aged at three temperatures (41, 42 and 45 °C) and two times (72 and 96 h), again using the three saturated salts and distilled water as ageing solutions. In the third, three turnip rape hybrid seed lots and three Asian <b>kale</b> <b>seed</b> lots were surface sterilised (1 % sodium hypochlorite) prior to ageing at one temperature (41 °C) and time (72 h). In the third experiment, the same species and seed lots used in experiment one at their original seed moisture content (SMC) were tested for conductivity after soaking in deionised water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. They were then re-tested after the SMC had been adjusted to 8. 5 %. In the fourth experiment, three seed lots of forage rape and three seed lots of Asian kale were graded into three seed size categories; large (retained on a 2. 0 mm screen), medium (retained on a 1. 7 mm screen) and small (passed through a 1. 7 mm screen). Graded seeds were then tested for standard germination, AA (41 °C/ 48 h) and conductivity (measured at 16 and 24 h). In the final experiment, the relationships between laboratory tests for the six species (each consisting of three seed lots), field emergence from three sowings, and cold room emergence were evaluated. Both time and temperature influenced post-AA germination. Increasing the ageing period from 48 to 72 hours at 41 °C, and 24 to 48 hours at 42 °C resulted in decreased mean germination percentage for all species but not always clear separation of seed lots. While there were sometimes few differences between ageing at 41 °C and 42 °C, the former is preferred because it is already the temperature used for other species. For Asian rape, choisum and turnip, the previously recommended testing conditions of 41 °C/ 72 h provided good seed lot separation, but for Asian kale and turnip rape hybrid, AA testing at 41 °C/ 48 h provided better results. Seed moisture content after ageing ranged from 29 - 37 % depending on species. Fungal growth on seeds during the ageing period appeared to reduce post-ageing germination in some seed lots. Substituting saturated salts for distilled water did not stress seed lots in the AA test, due to the lowered RH%, the exception being seed lots 1210 and 1296. For forage and Asian species, seed lot germination mostly remained above 90 % when aged for 72 h at lowered RH%. Increasing the ageing duration from 72 to 96 hours resulted in some decreases in post-AA germination but no clear separation of seed lots. Surface sterilising the seeds prior to the AA test resulted in a lower incidence of contaminant fungi which was associated with a lower percentage of abnormal seedlings. The conductivity test was mostly able to identify vigour differences among forage and Asian vegetable brassica seed lots. Differences in conductivity readings were observed among seed lots in all species. Increasing the period of imbibition resulted in increased conductivity from most seed lots but radicle emergence occurred after 16 - 20 h of imbibition. Variation was observed in the time to reach 95 % maximum of the imbibition curve for most species. Conductivity readings at 16 h would avoid possible influences of radicle emergence on results. Adjusting the SMC to 8. 5 % resulted in reduced variation in conductivity among replicates of seed lots, due to a reduction in imbibition damage. Seed size had a significant effect on both post-AA germination and conductivity results. In forage rape, large size seeds had higher post-AA germination cf. medium cf. small size <b>seeds.</b> In Asian <b>kale,</b> large size <b>seeds</b> had higher post-AA germination compared with small size seeds. For both forage rape and Asian <b>kale,</b> large size <b>seeds</b> had lower conductivity readings cf. small size seeds. The correlation analyses demonstrated significant relationships between AA testing and field emergence parameters (percentage emergence, emergence index and emergence rate). Significant relationships were also observed between conductivity testing and these field emergence parameters. Based on the correlation analysis, AA testing at 41 °C/ 48 hand/or 42 °C/ 48 h could be recommended to be used as an AA test for turnip and Asian rape; and 41 °C/ 48 hand/or 41 °C/ 72 h for Asian kale and choisum. Based on the correlation analysis, conductivity testing at 16 h can be used to predict the field emergence potential of forage and Asian vegetable seed lots. Vigour tests were consistently able to provide better indicators of field perfonnance than the standard germination test, although these relationships did vary with the different field sowings...|$|R

Urinary enterolignans and tissue biomarkers were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry, respectively. After supplementation, we observed significant correlations between intakes of plant lignan and urinary concentrations of total enterolignans (?= 0. 677, P<. 0001), enterolactone (?= 0. 676, P<. 0001), and enterodiol (?= 0. 628, P<. 0001). Importantly, we observed that total urinary enterolignans and enterolactone were significantly and inversely correlated with Ki 67 in the tumor tissue (?=? 0. 217, P=. 011, and ?=? 0. 230, P=. 007, respectively), and a near-significant inverse association was observed for enterodiol (?=? 0. 159, P=. 064). An inverse association was observed between enterolactone and VEGF (?=? 0. 143, P=. 141), although this did not reach statistical significance. We did not observe an association between enterolignans and NF?B. In conclusion, flaxseed-derived enterolignans may hinder cancer cell proliferation via VEGF-associated pathways...|$|R
