50|$|Officially {{presented}} on 17 June 2009, the Digital Tango Archive is TangoVia's exhaustive and almost archaeological effort to recover lost materials {{relating to the}} history of tango recordings. Unique in the world - the Digital Tango Archive already houses over 700 original arrangements for the tango orchestra (orquesta típica) and more than 600 for bandoneon solos. Through the digitalisation of high quality recordings, high resolution digital scanning of photographs, scores, musical arrangements and the correct transcription of video archives, a <b>security</b> <b>copy</b> is being created of the enormous amount of existing material. Its classification according to multiple criteria enables this material, once reserved to a few scholars, to be offered to everyone for free consultation. In Argentina there are at least one hundred thousand tango recordings made between 1902 and 1995 (end of the analogical era). However, less than 20% of this material is available on CD. There are already three thousand recordings that appear in catalogues, and thousands of hours of radio and TV programmes, which no longer exist in any format and have been lost forever.|$|E

Manhattan's East Side has undergone nearly continuous urban changes over the past sixty years. Kips Bay, a very small district or neighborhood in New York's midtown, went from older tenements and lofts to a higher-rise complex of apartments and, along 1 st Avenue, to Medical Row dominated by New York University and Bellevue Hospital. Virtually standing unchanged, except right on 29 th Street, are the neighborhood religious centers and the author's grade school - P. S. 116. The author lived in the 300 block on 29 th from 1934 to 1937, revisiting the neighborhood now and then. He later moved west. When he returned to the city for a year, he attended Seward Park High School in lower Manhattan. Having left Kips Bay so young - age 9 - he did not retain any friends. As a retired professor of geography, his neighborhood reconstruction and personal memoir have relied on new encounters, the Internet, and, at times, sheer luck.

40|$|White grubs became {{increasingly}} difficult pests in Nepal {{for the last}} few years. Their infestation has been reported throughout the country and magnitude of the problem has been widespread over the past years. In majority of the farming situation, control of these pests are largely abandoning {{because of the lack of}} control over their damages. In general, the management strategy depends primarily on the use of highly poisonous poor graded chemical pesticides. The use of bio-control agents in general and fungal based mycoinsecticides in particular are lacking in the country. The former practices have further aggravated the pest problem resulting in wider reluctances for the cultivation of major cereals as well as cash crops in upland farming. With a view to address these issues, an alternative control measures based on fungal antagonist with the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in Nepal was sought since 2003 with the initiation and financial support of Helvetas/ Intercooperation through the coordination of Sustainable Soil Management Programme (SSMP-Nepal). The research was prompted by the serendipitous findings of M. anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana in Nepal from infected white grubs and soils during an exploratory study at Institute of Agriculture and Animal Sciences (IAAS), Rampur. Insect pathogenic fungi, M. anisopliae (green muscardine fungus) and B. bassiana (white muscardine fungus) were identified by a Swiss scientist, Dr Siegfried Keller for the first time in Nepal. With the hope of gearing up of the further works, research plans were drafted, collaborating organizations were identified, and financial supports were solicited and permitted. The research was intensively supported and monitored at various capacities by Dr Siegfried Keller, Senior Scientist, Agroscope FAL Reckenholz, Zurich, Prof. Dr Peter Nagel, University of Basel, Dr Dirk Ahrens, Germany and Dr Philip Kessler, Switzerland through their visits and electronic contacts. This thesis examines the effect of the indigenous insect pathogenic fungus M. anisopliae against white grubs in Nepal through a series of laboratory and field experiments. Each of the stages in the development and optimization of a mass production technique for the field assessment is discussed. Two kinds of initiatives such as exploratory initiatives and exploitation initiatives were undertaken during the study. Both groups of initiatives are interlinked and mutually contributing to each other. The former initiative includes the search of the indigenous insect pathogenic fungi from the soils and insects mainly from white grub prone areas of Nepal. The activities placed under the exploitation initiatives include development of the technology of production and application of insect pathogenic fungi as a means of white grubs control in particular and pest insects in general. In order to conduct the laboratory work, the Insect Pathology Laboratory with a modest level of facilities has been established within the premises of the Entomology Department of IAAS, Rampur of Tribhuvan University (TU). Several dozens of isolates of the insect pathogenic fungi M. anisopliae and more than half a dozen of B. bassiana were recovered from natural soil and diseased insects using a selective medium and the Galleria bait method (GBM). They have been maintained at IAAS, Rampur and as a <b>security</b> <b>copy</b> at FAL Agroscope Reckenholz, Zurich. Isolation, maintenance, mass production and efficacy tests with virulent strains of M. anisopliae were conducted. Identification of the damaging species of white grubs was one of the pre requisite for the development of effective control measures. Dynamics of the common beetle species were carried out through light traps and field sampling. They were later identified based on morphological grounds. A three-tired screening strategy: exploration of insect pathogenic fungi in the farmers’ field, pathogenicity assessment under laboratory conditions and its exploitation in farmer’s field in Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Tanahun and Parbat Districts of Nepal has been initiated. Exploratory study revealed that M. anisopliae is widely distributed in the Nepalese soils and in insects, however, with low density of B. bassiana. Selective medium has proved to be suitable medium for fungus growth and maintenance. Host passages are needed for retaining the virulence. Disease prevalence of M. anisopliae in grub cadaver was between 0 and 2...|$|E

5000|$|One often-overlooked {{application}} for dot-matrix printers {{is in the}} field of IT <b>security.</b> <b>Copies</b> of various system and server activity logs are typically stored on the local filesystem, where a remote attacker - having achieved their primary goals - can then alter or delete the contents of the logs, in an attempt to [...] "cover their tracks" [...] or otherwise thwart the efforts of system administrators and security experts. However, if the log entries are simultaneously output to a printer, line-by-line, a local hard-copy record of system activity is created - and this cannot be remotely altered or otherwise manipulated. Dot-matrix printers are ideal for this task, as they can sequentially print each log entry, one entry at a time, as they are added to the log. The usual dot-matrix printer support for continuous stationery also prevents incriminating pages from being surreptitiously removed or altered without evidence of tampering.|$|R
40|$|Today digital {{transaction}} watermarking {{is a widely}} accepted mechanism in multimedia <b>security.</b> <b>Copies</b> of one work are distributed with individual watermarks. One major threat on transaction watermarking are collusion attacks. Multiple individualized copies of the work are mixed to produce a counterfeited or undetectable watermark. As a countermeasure so-called collusion secure fingerprint codes have been introduced. These are mathematical codes resistant against collusion attacks, even allowing to identify the attackers involved. The important challenge is to provide fingerprints which are highly reliable and, at the same time, sufficiently compact to be embedded as a watermark according to the payload limit. Approaches that generate probabilistic codewords provide theoretical results for t he average fingerprint. Though, in practice, false alarms only occur at by chance disadvantageously generated fingerprints. This work shows how a correlated generation process can manage these disadvantageously generated fingerprints so as to bound the number of false alarms. This allows us to generate shorter fingerprints while keeping the same security level...|$|R

This model is based on a method which starts with files to finally get a description of the life cycle. This method was applied to a well-documented work: the Hans Tutschku's recent piece Distance Liquide. A model was built on the description of this work. It was validated with other acousmatic works. Then, it can be considered as a generic acousmatic model. It currently uses the CIDOC-CRM ontology...|$|R

40|$|A network flow {{watermarking}} scheme {{attempts to}} manipulate the statistical properties of a flow of packets to insert a “mark ” {{making it easier to}} detect the flow after passing through one or more relay hosts. Because an attacker that is willing to tolerate delay can (nearly) always eliminate such marks, recent schemes have concentrated on making the marks “invisible ” so that a passive attacker cannot detect the presence of the mark. In this work, we argue that from a system’s perspective, security against passive detection is insufficient for successful traffic analysis. We introduce a stronger, but feasible attack model (a known/chosen flow attacker) and a second security goal (<b>security</b> against <b>copy</b> attacks) and argue that security against both of these attacks is required for successful traffic analysis. We also demonstrate successful attacks against two recent watermarking schemes, RAINBOW and SWIRL, and show how considering these stronger attacks can aid in the design of passive detection attacks against each as well. ...|$|R
