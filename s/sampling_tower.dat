40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes {{measured}} using the eddy-covariance method capture the {{spatial and temporal}} heterogeneity of N 2 O emissions. Most closed-path trace-gas analyzers for eddy-covariance measurements have large-volume, multi-pass absorption cells that necessitate high flow rates for ample frequency response, thus requiring high-power sample pumps. Other sampling system components, including rain caps, filters, dryers, and tubing can also degrade system frequency response. This field trial tested {{the performance of a}} closed-path eddy-covariance system for N 2 O flux measurements with improvements to use less power while maintaining the frequency response. The new system consists of a thermoelectrically cooled tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer configured to measure both N 2 O and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The system features a relatively small, single- pass sample cell (200  ml) that provides good frequency response with a lower-powered pump (~  250  W). A new filterless intake removes particulates from the sample air stream with no additional mixing volume that could degrade frequency response. A single-tube dryer removes water vapor from the sample to avoid the need for density or spectroscopic corrections, while maintaining frequency response. This eddy-covariance system was collocated with a previous tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer model to compare N 2 O and CO 2 flux measurements for two full growing seasons (May 2015 to October 2016) in a fertilized cornfield in Southern Ontario, Canada. Both spectrometers were placed outdoors {{at the base of the}} <b>sampling</b> <b>tower</b> demonstrating ruggedness for a range of environmental conditions (minimum to maximum daily temperature range: − 26. 1 to 31. 6  °C). The new system rarely required maintenance. An in situ frequency response test demonstrated that the cutoff frequency of the new system was better than the old system (3. 5  Hz compared to 2. 30  Hz), and similar to that of a closed-path CO 2 eddy- covariance system (4. 05  Hz) using shorter tubing and no dryer that was also collocated at the site. Values of the N 2 O fluxes were similar between the two spectrometer systems (slope = 1. 01, r 2  =  0. 96); CO 2 fluxes as measured by the short-tubed eddy-covariance system and the two spectrometer systems correlated well (slope =  1. 03, r 2  =  0. 998). The new lower-powered tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer configuration with the filterless intake and single-tube dryer showed promise for deployment in remote areas...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 As every {{manufacturer}} of carbon-fiber composite structures knows, {{one of the}} most nettlesome aspects of the production process is that machining, drilling and sanding of carbon fiber composites produces fine dust. These composite materials typically consist of epoxy matrix material reinforced with carbon, graphite, glass, and/or para-aramid fibers. Matrix materials are usually epoxy, polyester, phenolic, fluorocarbon, polyether-sulfone, and silicon. The most commonly used are epoxies and polyesters, which are less expensive than epoxies. It can build up on and short out computers, control panels and servomotors. In the air, it can be inhaled and threaten human health. Further, the accumulation of any dust in a manufacturing facility can be problematic from the regulatory perspective. In fact, dust has been blamed for several explosions in manufacturing facilities, leading the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Admin. (OSHA) and many local governments to more closely monitor and regulate dust accumulation in all manufacturing environments. An increase in human exposure to potentially toxic airborne fibers has accompanied the increased use of composite materials. The dust emitted during the machining of composite materials is potentially damaging to the human lung. Several studies have attempted to characterize the damage to the lung caused by airborne particles from composites, while other studies have characterized the size and concentration of the dust emitted. Some {{studies have shown that the}} chip formation process affects the size distribution of the particles emitted during the machining of composites. Health hazard evaluation of composite matrix material is usually conducted by examining the individual materials that are in the resin system and using sound scientific judgment. The main objective of this research is to quantify the amount of dust generated during machining (predominantly milling) of composites and to calculate what percentage of this dust is harmful to the workers in such composite dust laden environments. This criteria is based on PM (Particulate matter) aerosol standards defined by OSHA in regard to safety and well-being. In addition this research will also highlight the effect of stacking sequence of laminates on the concentration of dust generated and the characterization of these particle sizes. This research also further aims to develop optimized cutting conditions that will help in reducing the amount of dust that would be generated by using an experimental study. During this study different tests were carried out to characterize the different effects that are observed during the machining of Uni-Directional and random fiber composites. The machining dust results showed a very good correlation between the different real time measuring instruments and validated the design of the iso-kinetic <b>sampling</b> <b>tower.</b> Mean aerodynamic diameters of particles found during the machining of Uni-Directional composites was 0. 19 um and that of random fiber composites was found to be 0. 28 um. Tests to find out the optimal cutting conditions for the lowest amount of dust generated was found to be that of using a low cutting speed, high feed and lower depth of cuts. These conditions however might not aid the best surface finish. Hence a compromise or a trade-off is required...|$|E

Airborne deposits at three elevations on <b>sampling</b> <b>towers</b> and on the ground at several distances from the sprayer were investigated with the three spray treatments in an open field without crops. Tests were conducted with an air blast sprayer equipped with conventional hollow cone nozzles (HC), low drift nozzles (AI), and conventional hollow cone nozzles with a drift retardant (HCDR) in an open field without crops. To compare field test results, wind tunnel experiments were conducted to assess spray deposits on the floor beyond 0. 4 m downwind distance from the nozzles and airborne deposits at 2. 1 m downwind from the spray discharge point with the three spray techniques.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of water, carbon, and energy between grasslands {{and the atmosphere}} is an important biogeochemical pathway affecting ecosystem productivity and sustainability.

Samples of breath were collected from mice both individually and in {{groups as well as}} from rats. The animals were awake and restrained in a breath <b>sample</b> <b>tower</b> for a majority of the studies. One study was also conducted using awake unrestrained rats in a glass bulb that was designed for breath sample collection by the Rowland Blake lab. In addition to the breath samples, feces samples were obtained from mice infected with salmonella enterica and incubated in bioreactors from which the headspace was collected for analysis. Samples were collected in evacuated stainless steel canisters. Blank samples were also collected to determine concentrations in the air used during sampling. All samples, excluding the feces samples, were analyzed for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide concentrations using gas chromatography. Several samples were also analyzed for various volatile organic compounds using the Rowland Blake non-methane hydrocarbon gas chromatography system. The results of the gas chromatography measurements were analyzed to determine if differences existed between infected and uninfected samples throughout each study. This was accomplished statistically, as well as visually using plots. 	The results of the Borrelia and endotoxin studies revealed {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of CO/CO 2 in the breath of the infected mice and rats, with a dose response being observed for the endotoxin study. Upon treatment, the ratio of CO/CO 2 returned to normal within several hours of antibiotic administration.

From PERMANOVA, pairwise differences were indicated between 1 -year-old needles and fallen needles (P[*]=[*] 0.0128) and between 2 -year-old needles and fallen needles (P[*]=[*] 0.0022), with marginal evidence of an assemblage difference between 3 -year-old needles and fallen needles (P[*]=[*] 0.0584). Using CAP was an alternative method of testing whether or not the multivariate means are different for the four different age classes. Results were unequivocal in indicating a significant difference between age classes (P[*]=[*] 0.0181 (trace test) or 0.006 (test based on the first squared canonical correlation)), with eight out of the 11 fallen needle samples being correctly classified, i.e. placed in the correct needle class by the cross-validation procedure of CAP.

The ability to grow within and/or lyse amoebae was demonstrated, for what {{is believed to be the}} first time, for several species; moreover, 20 of the isolates (61 %), including Streptococcus pneumoniae, have been described as human pathogens. However, Legionella spp. were not isolated. Four isolates are likely to be the members of new or uncharacterized genera or species, and their capability to be human pathogens needs to be determined. This preliminary work demonstrates that soils and sands in the vicinity of humans are reservoirs of human pathogenic ARB...|$|R

The eddy covariance (EC) technique directly measures this mass and energy exchange. However, questions remain regarding the accuracy of EC-derived H[subscript] 2 O and CO[subscript] 2 fluxes in landscapes with irregular topography and variable vegetation. These concerns stem from the "energy balance (EB) closure problem" (i. e., measured energy in does not equal measured energy out). My main objectives were to examine EB closure at two topographical positions within an annually burned tallgrass prairie watershed and to {{examine the effect of}} landscape position and woody encroachment on carbon and water exchanges. In tallgrass prairie, 14 km south of Manhattan, KS, USA, EC towers were deployed at three sites in 2007 and 2008. One upland and lowland tower were within an annually burned watershed dominated by C[subscript] 4 grasses. Another lowland tower was deployed in a separate quadrennial-burned watershed where significant woody vegetation occupied the <b>tower's</b> <b>sampling</b> area. All <b>towers</b> measured EB components (net radiation, R[subscript]n; soil heat flux, G; sensible heat flux, H; and latent heat flux, [lambda]E). In the annually burned watershed, landscape position had little effect on G, H, and R[subscript]n with differences [less than] 2 % between sites. However lowland [lambda]E was 8 % higher, owing to larger plant biomass/leaf area and greater soil moisture. Energy balance closure (i. e., [[lambda]E + H] / [R[subscript]n - G]) was 0. 87 and 0. 90 at the upland and lowland sites, respectively. A nearby large-aperture scintillometer provided good validation of EC-derived H in 2007. Data suggested that underestimates of [lambda]E may have accounted for the closure problem; sample calculations showed that increasing [lambda]E by 17 % would have resulted in near prefect closure. Data from this study suggests that EB closure does not strongly correlate with topographical position; however these data raise questions regarding accuracy of the [lambda]E term. Mass exchange analysis shows that the prairie carbon cycle is highly dependent on burning. The lowland and upland annually burned sites saw carbon gains of 281 to 444 g C m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 yr[superscript]-[superscript] 1 before burning with the shrub lowland showing the least (e. g. 159 and 172 g C m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 yr[superscript]-[superscript] 1). After the prescribed burn, the upland and lowland sites remained slight carbon sinks (68 to 191 g C m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 yr[superscript]-[superscript] 1), whereas the unburned shrub site was a carbon sink in 2007 (159 g C m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 yr[superscript]-[superscript] 1, because no carbon loss was incurred via burning) and a large carbon source in 2008 when it was burned the following year (336 g C m[superscript]-[superscript] 2 yr[superscript]-[superscript] 1 loss). Evapotranspiration (ET) was highest at the shrub lowland where greater soil moisture and abundance of deep-rooted C[subscript] 3 shrub vegetation allowed greater uptake and loss of water...|$|R
40|$|Four {{upscaling}} {{methods for}} estimating daytime actual evapotranspiration (ET) from single time-of-day snapshots, as commonly retrieved using remote sensing, were compared. These methods assume self-preservation of the ratio between ET and a given reference variable over the daytime hours. The {{analysis was performed}} using eddy covariance data collected at 12 AmeriFlux <b>towers,</b> <b>sampling</b> a fairly wide range in climatic and land cover conditions. The choice of energy budget closure method significantly impacted performance using different scaling methodologies. Therefore, a statistical evaluation approach was adopted to better account for the inherent uncertainty in ET fluxes using eddy covariance technique. Overall, this approach suggested that at-surface solar radiation was the most robust reference variable amongst those tested, due to high accuracy of upscaled fluxes and absence of systematic biases. Top-of-atmosphere irradiance was also tested and proved to be reliable under near clear-sky conditions, but tended to overestimate the observed daytime ET during cloudy days. Use of reference ET as a scaling flux yielded higher bias than the solar radiation method, although resulting errors showed similar lack of seasonal dependence. Finally, the commonly used evaporative fraction method yielded satisfactory results only in summer months, July and August, and tended to underestimate the observations in the fall/winter seasons from November to January at the flux sites studied. In general, the proposed methodology clearly showed the added value of an intercomparison of different upscaling methods under scenarios that account for the uncertainty in eddy covariance flux measurements due to closure errors...|$|R
40|$|The Yukon-Tanana terrane (YTT) is a {{composite}} arc built on the rifted margin of western North America. The YTT {{is present in the}} southeastern part of the St. Cyr area in south-central Yukon, but in the northwest section the structural and lithologic relationships are poorly known. This study describes the structural geometry of the northwest section of the St. Cyr area, west of the Canol Road. The lithological, geochemical, and geochronological characteristics of the Tower Peak unit are investigated in an effort to determine its origin and terrane affinity. In the study area, the Tower Peak unit sits tectonically above a low-grade mafic-ultramafic unit. In turn, this mafic-ultramafic unit is thrust over phyllite and marble creating {{a composite}} klippe. Detrital zircons from the marble indicate a maximum depositional age of 368 Ma. This result is consistent with the footwall being part of the Devonian to Mississippian Finlayson assemblage, the oldest arc of the composite YTT. The Tower Peak unit is a massive but fractured, sub-greenschist facies metabasalt. Whole-rock and trace element geochemistry of four <b>Tower</b> Peak <b>samples</b> suggest an oceanic or island arc setting for deposition of the Tower Peak unit. Zircons separated from three <b>samples</b> of the <b>Tower</b> Peak unit give a range of U-Pb ion probe ages. Three distinct age populations exist: 600 - 2582 Ma, 433 - 303 Ma, and 140 - 190 Ma. The preferred interpretation is that the Tower Peak unit is Mesozoic in age and may derive from Stikinia or Quesnellia...|$|R
40|$|The {{case study}} is the {{pentagonal}} tower from Serravalle Castle fortification, located near to the river Temo (west-cost of Sardinia), above the medieval Bosa village (XII-XIV cent.). The castle belongs to the medieval Giudicato di Torres (X cent.) and then to Malaspina from Lunigiana (XII cent.), Turrritani, Arborea, Aragonese, until to the Catalans (from Alghero) that led it to decline (XVI cent.). The aim of this proposal is to analyze from mineralogical-petrographic point of view the mortars used {{in the construction of}} the <b>tower.</b> <b>Samples</b> were taken between the volcanic ashlars at different heights with respect to the ground level, to assess any compositional variations during the construction of the building. Through microscopic analysis, the compositional aspects concerning the nature and petro-mineralogical features of the raw materials used for the aggregate were defined. By image analysis (on meso-microscopic photographs) the vol. % of binder/aggregate ratios and their grain-size characteristics were determined and compared with the wt% data obtained from disaggregation method of mortars and acid attack of carbonate binder, in order to understand if the mixing ratios used by constructors have respected the production standards of those historic period. By X-ray diffraction (XRD) and termogravimetric/differential analysis (TGA-DSC) of enriched-binder samples, the presence of C-S-H phases and the hydraulic degree of mortars have been studied, to understand the possible use of pozzolanic material. Finally, to define the physical-mechanical properties of mortars were also determined: porosity, real and bulk density, PLT punching-index, theoretical values of compression and traction strengths...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} modular {{planning}} framework for manipulation tasks that combines high-level representation and causality-based reasoning with low-level geometric reasoning and motion planning. This framework features bilateral interaction between task and motion planning, and embeds geometric reasoning in causal reasoning. The causal reasoner guides the motion planner by finding an optimal task-plan; {{if there is}} no feasible kinematic solution for that task-plan then the motion planner guides the causal reasoner by modifying the planning problem with new temporal constraints. The geometric reasoner guides the causal reasoner to find feasible kinematic solutions by means of external predicates/functions. We show the applicability of this method on two <b>sample</b> problems: extended <b>towers</b> of Hanoi and multiple robot manipulation inside a maze. We focus on two main problems in this planning framework: i) a systemic analysis of various levels of integration between high-level representation and causality-based reasoning with low-level geometric reasoning and motion planning and ii) generalization of the planning framework to continuous domains. For the former, we consider various levels of integration in the two domains mentioned above, to check which level of integration achieves better performance. For the latter, we abstract configurations at the representation level by continuous regions instead of discrete positions, and introduce an incremental sampling-based method coupled to a goal region-based probabilistic path planner for extracting specific goal configurations required for generating valid plans for execution. This way, we tightly integrate high-level reasoning and region-based motion planning and provide a general framework for addressing a wide spectrum of manipulation problems...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous CoMnAl {{mixed metal}} oxide {{catalysts}} with various Co/Mn atomic ratios {{have been obtained}} by calcination at 450 degrees C of layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors prepared by the NH 4 OH co-precipitation-hydrothermal method without distinct MnCO 3 peaks. The catalysts exhibited high efficiency for total oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized using several analytical techniques. Among them, CoMn 2 AlO shows the optimal activity and the temperature required to achieve a benzene conversion of 90 % (T- 90) was about 238 degrees C, with a reaction rate and activity energy (E-a) of 0. 24 mmol g(cat) (- 1) h(- 1) and 65. 77 kJ mol(- 1) respectively. This temperature was 47 degrees C lower than that on the Co 3 AlO <b>sample</b> with a <b>tower</b> reaction rate of 0. 19 mmol g(cat) (- 1) h(- 1) and a higher E-a 130. 31 kJ mol(- 1) at a high space velocity (SV = 60 000 mL g(- 1) h(- 1)). The effects of calcination temperature on the textural properties and catalytic activity of the CoMn 2 AlO catalyst were further investigated. The as-prepared CoMn 2 AlO- 550 sample displayed superior catalytic activity, with T- 90 at 208 degrees C, compared CoMn 2 AlO- 450. The formation of a solid solution with high surface area, rich oxygen vacancies, high Mn 4 +/Mn 3 + and Co 3 +/Co 2 + ratios and low-temperature reducibility made a great contribution to the significant improvement of the catalytic activity...|$|R
