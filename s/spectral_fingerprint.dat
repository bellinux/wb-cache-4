40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the relationship of}} band-limited electrophysiological mass activity to behavior on the one hand, and to the BOLD fMRI signal on the other. Electrophysiological mass activity generally reflects several different components of neuronal activity, which are generated by distinct neural mechanisms and expressed in different frequency ranges. The relative strengths of these components thus determine a so-called specific <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprint</b> of a perceptual or cognitive process. A striking discrepancy between the <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprint</b> of stimulus-driven responses in sensory cortices and the fingerprints of intrinsic processes (such as top-down attention or switches between perceptual states) within the same cortical areas is highlighted.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the latest {{greenhouse}} warming experiment performed with the coupled general circulation model ECHAM 4 /OPYC it is shown that not only the climate mean but also the statistics of higher order statistical moments respond significantly to greenhouse warming. In particular the El Ni no-southern oscillation (ENSO) cycle obtains more energy and a tendency towards stronger cold events can be observed, relative to an overall warming trend. It is suggested that this information can be used in order to refine climate change detection via the optimal fingerprinting strategy. An optimal <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprint</b> is developed on {{the basis of}} linear perturbation theory of wavelet variances. In order to elucidate the potential of higher order statistical moments in the climate change detection context, the optimal <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprint</b> technique is applied to the ECHAM 4 /OPYC greenhouse warming simulation. The results provide a rough estimate of the timescale over which anthropogenic changes in the ENSO statistics can be detected against the background noise. The results reveal in particular that recent observed changes of ENSO variability are consistent with the null hypothesis of natural climate variability. Furthermore, an information theoretical approach is adopted to investigate possible influences of global warming on ENSO predictability. (orig.) 27 refs.

40|$|Food contact {{plastics}} {{are known}} to be a potential source of chemical contaminants in food. In order to ensure that the use of these plastics is safe, a thorough knowledge of their composition appears to be a crucial step, especially after the alarming emergence of non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), in addition to intentionally added ones (IAS). Both IAS and NIAS may be transferred to food, leading to high exposure to certain chemicals which might cause health risks for humans. Inspired by untargeted approaches, extracting useful information from analytical fingerprints is becoming a key step in recent advancements in analytical chemistry. In addition, the fast analysis approach is very attractive for performing a large number of analyses in a short time, which we applied for the characterization of food contact plastics. This data mining is normally done by multivariate data analysis techniques in order to highlight hidden information from complex data matrices. In the present work, flow injection analysis coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (FIA/ESI-MS) was used in order to acquire compositional information about high and low density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) samples intended for food contact. Soxhlet extracts of PE samples (pellets, containers and films) were analyzed. Subsequently, positive and negative mass <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprints</b> were organized in data matrices and treated using a relatively recent chemometric technique called “independent components analysis (ICA) ”. In a first step, mass <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprints</b> were acquired using a Surveyor HPLC system coupled to a LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. ICA applied on mass <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprints</b> of PE extracts highlighted group discrimination related to different m/z values which were putatively assigned to IAS but also to NIAS. In order to confirm the putative annotations of discriminating m/z values extracted by the different ICs, a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used with a mass resolving power of 60 000 FWHM (Full width at half maximum) at m/z 400. This mass spectrometer is characterized by a high mass resolving power and accurate mass measurements giving access to the elemental composition of the discriminating ions, allowing thus to validate their identifications. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first FIA untargeted methodology for a compositional evaluation of food contact plastics. The proposed approach benefits from the ability to perform fast analyses at high rate and high reproducibility. The combination between mass <b>spectral</b> <b>fingerprints</b> and ICA helps to overcome the complexity of such data giving the possibility to inspect, compare and control large number of plastic samples...|$|R

Twelve red wines with different vintages, cultivars and ageing methods from Changli and Shacheng were sampled. Nine fractions of each wine were collected with a reversed-phase C 18 column, {{and then they}} were lyophilized. The residue of each fraction was resolved with synthetic wine of the same volume with the fraction sample. The transmittance spectra of wines and their fractions were recorded from 190 to 1100 nm. And the spectral data were visualized to show their visual differences directly. Mono-phenols in wine and fractions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD at wavelengths in the range where located the obvious differences of the spectral fingerprints. The results showed that the spectral differences of wine samples lied in the range of 190 to 600 nm. There were obvious differences in visual maps among wines with different vintages, mainly around 520 nm. The visualization differences among wines with distinct geographical origins lay in the F 8 maps, and the differences from the aging methods almost cover the whole wavelength range visualized. However, wines from different grape cultivars had the similar visual characteristics. HPLC-DAD identified the possible mono-phenol groups for the spectral differences at 280, 313, 365 and 520 nm.

Many studies have described methods of how to measure the efficiency of FRET. However, few have addressed the question of how fluorescence from unpaired donors and acceptors can be determined in addition to that from FRET-pairs and how the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of such estimates depends on the presence of the partner species.
