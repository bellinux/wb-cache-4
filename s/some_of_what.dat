The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound.

5|$|On December 21, 1953, Oppenheimer {{was told}} by Lewis Strauss that his {{security}} file had been subject to two recent re-evaluations because of new screening criteria, and because a former government official had drawn attention to Oppenheimer's record. Strauss said that his clearance had been suspended, pending resolution {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Given only a day to decide, and after consulting with his lawyers, Oppenheimer chose not to resign, and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, general manager of the AEC. Pending resolution of the charges, Oppenheimer's security clearance was suspended. Oppenheimer told Strauss that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was in Nichols' letter was correct, some incorrect.|$|E
5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> were Blue Line trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E

25|$|Accepting {{only the}} axiom schema of {{specification}} {{was the beginning}} of axiomatic set theory. Most of the other Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (but not the axiom of extensionality or the axiom of regularity) then became necessary to make up for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was lost by changing the axiom schema of comprehension to the axiom schema of specification – each of these axioms states that a certain set exists, and defines that set by giving a predicate for its members to satisfy, i.e. it is a special case of the axiom schema of comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Resins: Valued since antiquity, resins {{have been}} widely used in incense and perfumery. Highly {{fragrant}} and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include labdanum, frankincense/olibanum, myrrh, balsam of Peru, benzoin. Pine and fir resins are a particularly valued source of terpenes used in the organic synthesis of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is called amber and copal in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil conifers.|$|E

25|$|Ehrlich became {{well known}} for his {{controversial}} 1968 book The Population Bomb, which asserted that the world's human population would soon increase {{to the point where}} mass starvation ensued. Among the solutions he suggested in that book was population control, to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail. Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions; for example, Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an irrepressible doomster. However, Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster. Ehrlich has acknowledged that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he predicted has not occurred, but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct, and that overpopulation is a major problem.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Gerbic {{organized}} a sting on well-known psychic Chip Coffey which she code-named Operation Bumblebee. She and two associates created false identities and false dead relatives complete with backstories and pictures (of real, still living people) and attended a Coffey event in San Jose, CA. Mingling with attendees {{before the show}} started, the three talked {{as much as they}} could about their supposedly dead relatives, hoping that some of Coffey's assistants might overhear. During the show, Coffey did indeed do readings on each of the three, claiming to be in contact with each of the supposedly dead relatives, confidently relating details about completely made up people, including <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Gerbic and her associates had talked about before the show.|$|E
25|$|Broad was {{headmaster}} of Nelson College for 11 years. In 1927 {{he visited}} the United Kingdom with his wife, and saw how secondary schools were organised there. When he returned to Nelson, he put into practice <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he had observed, particularly the house system, which still continues. The latter years of Broad's tenure were dominated by {{the effects of the}} damaging 1929 Murchison earthquake. Three new boarding houses were planned: the new Rutherford and Barnicoat Houses were completed in 1931, and Fell House was temporarily located in nearby Fairfield House. Broad gained extra responsibilities in 1932 as the daytime operations of the Nelson Technical School were merged into Nelson College. He retired as headmaster at the end of 1933, having been at the school for all but five years since 1884.|$|E

25|$|Within one year, {{these three}} hamster {{siblings}} were {{the origin of}} a colony of 150 hamsters. Adler was the first recipient of hamsters from this colony. Adler and another scientist published the first research using Syrian hamsters in 1931. Adler {{was known for his}} generosity and modesty and often did not make a record of his work, so <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened next is uncertain. Recognizing the usefulness of the hamster and the fragile nature of the single colony, he began to distribute hamsters to other laboratories. In 1931 he did wildlife smuggling of hamsters into England and presented some to E. Hindle at the London Zoological Society. Aharoni made no mention of further hamster expeditions in his memoir, but the Museum für Naturkunde has three female hamster specimens in their collection attributed to him and noted as having been caught 27 and 29 April 1930.|$|E
25|$|The next Mercian king, Penda, ruled {{from about}} 626 or 633 until 655. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known about}} Penda comes from the hostile account of Bede, who disliked him – both as an enemy to Bede's own Northumbria and as a pagan. However, Bede admits that Penda freely allowed Christian missionaries from Lindisfarne into Mercia, and did not {{restrain}} them from preaching. In 633 Penda and his ally Cadwallon of Gwynedd defeated and killed Edwin, who had become not only ruler of the newly unified Northumbria, but bretwalda, or high king, over the southern kingdoms. When another Northumbrian king, Oswald, arose and again claimed overlordship of the south, he also suffered defeat and death {{at the hands of}} Penda and his allies – in 642 at the Battle of Maserfield. In 655, after a period of confusion in Northumbria, Penda brought 30 sub-kings to fight the new Northumbrian king Oswiu at the Battle of Winwaed, in which Penda in turn lost the battle and his life.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{also clear}} from the law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus {{it was very hard to}} provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E

500|$|This was {{the last}} straw; on advice from Bacon, who had long been jealous of Coke, JamesI {{suspended}} Coke from the Privy Council, forbade him from going on circuit and, on 14 November, dismissed him from his post as Chief Justice of the King's Bench. This was greeted by deep resentment in the country, which saw the King's actions as tampering with justice. Coke himself reacted by sinking into a deep depression. JamesI then ordered Coke to spend his time [...] "expunging and retracting such novelties and errors and offensive conceits as are dispersed in his Reports". Bacon, now in royal favour, became Lord Chancellor on 3 March 1617 {{and set up a}} commission to purge the Reports, also using his authority to expand the powers of the High Commission. With James unable to declare Coke incompetent, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Humphry William Woolrych describes as [...] "colorable excuses" [...] were produced to justify Coke's dismissal; he was accused of concealing £12,000, uttering [...] "high words of contempt" [...] as a judge, and declaring himself Chief Justice of England.|$|E
500|$|Flack notes a {{distinction}} between the [...] "strong sense" [...] of Nonviolent Communication as a virtue that is possible with care and attention, and the [...] "weak sense," [...] a mimicry of this born of ego and haste. The strong sense offers a language to examine one's thinking and actions, support understanding, bring one's best to the community, and honor one's emotions. In the weak sense, one may take the language as rules and use these to score debating points, label others for political gain, or insist that others express themselves in this way. Though concerned that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Rosenberg says could lead to the weak sense, Flack sees evidence confirming that Rosenberg understands the strong sense in practice. Rosenberg's work with workshop attendees demonstrates [...] "the real thing." [...] Yet Flack warns that [...] "the temptation of the weak sense will not be absent." [...] As an antidote, Flack advises, [...] "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others," [...] (also known as the robustness principle) and guard against the [...] "metamorphosis of nonviolent communication into subtle violence done in its name." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{her husband}} {{was aware of the}} books she was writing, he showed no {{interest}} in the subject. He was interested enough in the money she made from them, however, but had forbidden her to use her married surname, not wishing to see it on a book cover with art of questionable taste. She took the name [...] "Bannon" [...] from a list of his customers and liked it because it contained her own name in it. She continued to experience difficulty in her marriage, however, and in realizing that [...] "not all lesbians were nice people", she took these frustrations out on her characters. [...] "I couldn't stand <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening to me–but Beebo could take it. Beebo really, in a way, had my nervous breakdown for me...I think I was overwhelmed with grief and anger that I was not able to express," [...] she recalled later. Women in the Shadows was also published in 1959 and proved very unpopular with Bannon's readers. The book examined interracial relationships, self-loathing in matters of sexuality and race, alcoholism, jealousy, violence, and as Laura marries Jack in an atypical arrangement in the 1950s, also explored the intricate details {{of what it was like}} to pass as heterosexual in an attempt to live some semblance of what was considered a normal life at the time.|$|E
