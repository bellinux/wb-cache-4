The dosimetry for the HR-WPT system designed to operate at 13. 56 MHz frequency, {{which one of the}} ISM band frequency band, is conducted in the various distances between the human model and the system, and in the condition of alignment and misalignment between transmitting and receiving circuits. The <b>specific</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>rates</b> in the human body are computed by the two-step approach; in the first step, the field generated by the HR-WPT system is calculated and in the second step the <b>specific</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>rates</b> are computed with the scattered field finite-difference time-domain method regarding the fields obtained in the first step as the incident fields. The safety compliance for non-uniform field exposure from the HR-WPT system is discussed with the international safety guidelines. Furthermore, the coupling factor concept is employed to relax the maximum allowable transmitting power. Coupling factors derived from the dosimetry results are presented. In this calculation, the external magnetic field from the HR-WPT system can be relaxed by approximately four times using coupling factor in the worst exposure scenario...|$|R

50|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>rate</b> (SAR) is {{a measure}} of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the human body when exposed to a radio {{frequency}} (RF) electromagnetic field; although, it can also refer to absorption of other forms of energy by tissue, including ultrasound.

40|$|Magnetization {{transfer}} imaging {{advanced to}} an indispensible tool for investigating white matter changes. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging methods allow {{the determination of}} the bound pool fraction (BPF), which is thought to be directly linked to myelin integrity. Long acquisition times and high <b>specific</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>rates</b> are still inhibiting broad in vivo utilization of currently available BPF mapping techniques. Herewith, a stimulated echoes amplitude modulation-based, single-shot echo planar imaging technique for BPF and T 1 quantification is presented at 3 T. It allows whole brain mapping in 10 – 15 min and is low in <b>specific</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>rates.</b> The method was validated with different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) phantoms. Intra- and inter-subject variability was assessed in vivo. Phantom measurements verified linearity between bovine serum albumin concentrations and measured BPF, which was independent of T 1 variations. T 1 values in the phantoms correlated well with values provided by standard T 1 mapping methods. Intrasubject variability was minimal and mean regional BPFs of 10 volunteers (e. g., left frontal white matter = 0. 135 ± 0. 003, right frontal white matter = 0. 129 ± 0. 006) were in line with previously published data. Assessment of interhemispheric BPF differences revealed significantly higher BPF for the left brain hemisphere. To sum up, these results suggest the proposed method useful for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of white matter changes in the human brain.

50|$|Bound protons are {{associated}} with proteins and as {{they have a very}} short T2 decay they do not normally contribute to image contrast. However, because these protons have a broad resonance peak they can be excited by a radiofrequency pulse that has no effect on free protons. Their excitation increases image contrast by transfer of saturated spins from the bound pool into the free pool, thereby reducing the signal of free water. This homonuclear magnetization transfer provides an indirect measurement of macromolecular content in tissue. Implementation of homonuclear magnetization transfer involves choosing suitable frequency offsets and pulse shapes to saturate the bound spins sufficiently strongly, within the safety limits of <b>specific</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>rate</b> for MRI.|$|E

The latest international standard for WBAN is the IEEE 802.15.6 standard which aims to provide an international standard for low power, short range, and extremely reliable wireless communication within the surrounding area of the human body, supporting a vast range of data rates for different applications. Short-range, wireless communications in the vicinity of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans) are specified in this standard. It uses existing industrial scientific medical (ISM) bands as well as frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory authorities.
