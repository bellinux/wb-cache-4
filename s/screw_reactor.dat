40|$|Char, {{the major}} {{co-product}} of mild coal gasification, represents about 70 {{percent of the}} total product yield. The only viable use for the char is in the production of formed coke. Early work to develop formed coke used char from a pilot plant sized mild gasification unit (MGU), which was based on commercial units of the COALITE plant in England. Formed coke was made at a bench-scale production level using MGU chars from different coals. An evolutionary formed coke development process over a two-year period resulted in formed coke production at bench-scale levels that met metallurgical industries` specifications. In an ASTM D 5341 reactivity test by a certified lab, the coke tested CRI 30. 4 and CSR 67. 0 which is excellent. The standard is CRI 55. In 1991, a continuous 1000 pounds per hour coal feed mild coal gasification pilot plant (CMGU) was completed. The gasification unit is a heated unique screw conveyor designed to continuously process plastic coal, vent volatiles generated by pyrolysis of coal, and convert the plastic coal to free flowing char. The <b>screw</b> <b>reactor</b> auxiliary components are basic solids materials handling equipment. The <b>screw</b> <b>reactor</b> will convert coal to char and volatile co-products at a rate greater than 1000 pounds per hour of coal feed. Formed coke from CMGU char is comparable to that from the MGU char. In pilot-plant test runs, up to 20 tons of foundry coke were produced. Three formed coke tests at commercial foundries were successful. In all of the cupola tests, the iron temperature and composition data indicated that the formed coke performed satisfactorily. No negative change in the way the cupola performed was noticed. The last 20 -ton test was 100 percent CTC/DOE coke. With conventional coke in this cupola charging rates were 10 charges per hour. The formed coke charges were 11 to 12 charges per hour. This equates to a higher melt rate. A 10 percent increase in cupola production would be a major advantage. 13 figs., 13 tabs...|$|E

40|$|Brewers {{spent grain}} (BSG) {{is a widely}} {{available}} feedstock representing approximately 85 % of the total by-products generated in the brewing industry. This is currently either disposed of to landfill or used as cattle feed due to its high protein content. BSG has received little or no attention as a potential energy resource, but increasing disposal costs and environmental constraints are now prompting the consideration of this. One possibility for the utilisation of BSG for energy is via intermediate pyrolysis to produce gases, vapours and chars. Intermediate pyrolysis is characterised by indirect heating {{in the absence of}} oxygen for short solids residence times of a few minutes, at temperatures of 350 - 450 °C. In the present work BSG has been characterised by chemical, proximate, ultimate and thermo-gravimetric analysis. Intermediate pyrolysis of BSG at 450 °C was carried out using a twin coaxial <b>screw</b> <b>reactor</b> known as Pyroformer to give yields of char 29 %, 51 % of bio-oil and 19 % of permanent gases. The bio-oil liquid was found to separate in to an aqueous phase and organic phase. The organic phase contained viscous compounds that could age over time leading to solid tars that can present problems in CHP application. The quality of the pyrolysis vapour products before quenching can be upgraded to achieve much improved suitability as a fuel by downstream catalytic reforming. A Bench Scale batch pyrolysis reactor has then been used to pyrolyse small samples of BSG under a range of conditions of heating rate and temperature simulating the Pyroformer. A small catalytic reformer has been added downstream of the reactor in which the pyrolysis vapours can be further cracked and reformed. A commercial reforming nickel catalyst was used at 500, 750 and 850 °C at a space velocity about 10, 000 L/h with and without the addition of steam. Results are presented for the properties of BSG, and the products of the pyrolysis process both with and without catalytic post-processing. Results indicate that catalytic reforming produced a significant increase in permanent gases mainly (H 2 and CO) with H 2 content exceeding 50 vol% at higher reforming temperatures. Bio-oil yield decreased significantly as reforming temperature increased with char remaining the same as pyrolysis condition remained unchanged. The process shows an increase in heating value for the product gas ranging between 10. 8 - 25. 2 MJ/m as reforming temperature increased...|$|E
40|$|To {{solve the}} problem caused by energy {{shortage}} and environmental pollution, the exploitation and utilization of biomass energy has been paid more attention during these years. Biomass can be converted into gaseous, liquid and solid fuels and other chemical products by pyrolysis technology. Biomass is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which have apparently different pyrolysis characteristics. In view of the different of pyrolysis characteristics of the major components of biomass, {{it is possible to}} obtain desired target products from selecting pyrolysis of the major components of biomass. Production of the high quality bio-oil from degradation of residual solids provides a good technical route to utilize of biomass high efficiently. The present work focused on investigating the low temperature pyrolysis characteristics of biomass and major components of biomass. The project was funded by National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (2007 AA 05 Z 456). Firstly the low temperature pyrolysis characteristics of major components of biomass were investigated by TGA and Py-GC/MS. The experimental results showed that thermal stability of major components of biomass was in descending order of cellulose>lignin>hemicellulose, and the major components of biomass had different contribution to the volatiles from the pyrolysis process. The degradation of hemicellulose generated acetic acid, 1 -hydroxy-propanone and 1 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone. The high yield of levoglucosan and anhydro-cellobise was from the pyrolysis of cellulose. Guaiacol was associated with the degradation of the lignin. Direct pyrolysis experiment was carried on eucalyptus, corn cob and fir by Py-GC/MS to investigate the influence of temperature and chemical components on the product of biomass low temperature pyrolysis. Increasing the heating termperature decreased the relative contents of furan products from pyrolysis of corn cob and eucalyptus, terpene products from pyrolysis of fir, acid products from pyrolysis of all, and increased that of phenol products from pyrolysis of eucalyptus and fir increases. However, the pyrolysis products distribution among different temperature range were investigated by step-pyrolysis experiments of Py-GC/MS. There were relatively less components in the pyrolysis products when eucalyptus, corn cob and fir were pyrolized under low temperature condition as 25 - 350 ℃, the main products of eucalyptus were 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 -hydroxy- 2 h-pyran- 2 -one, whereas 2, 3 -dihydro-benzofuran and 4 -hydroxy- 3 - methylacetophenone of corn cob, cedrol and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -methoxycinnamaldehyde of fir. There were more yield and species of eucalyptus pyrolysis products generated in the temperature range of 450 - 500 ℃, in which step the pyrolysis products were found in form of ketones and aromatics. Similar to eucalyptus, the yield and species are much when corn cob and fir pyrolyzed under the temperature of 400 - 450 ℃ and 400 - 500 ℃ respectively. The dominate pyrolysis product of corn cob were ketones when the temperature range is 400 - 450 ℃, and that of fir were ketones and aromatics when temperature range is 400 - 500 ℃. The low temperature pyrolysis experiments of fir and straw were carried out in a <b>screw</b> <b>reactor.</b> The experimental results showed the weight loss of biomass occurred at 240 - 320 ℃ due to the hemicellulose of biomass pyrolysis. Pyrolysis liquid products of low temperature pyrolysis had a high content of water, and the main products were methanol, acetic acid and 1 -hydroxy -propanone. The main gas products were CO and CO 2, and a few of H 2 and CH 4. Different pyrolysis products were produced from different chemical compositions of biomass, due to their different pyrolysis temperature ranges. It is possible to obtain various desired target products at different temperature ranges from pyrolysis of the main corresponding chemical compositions of biomass.

40|$|Significant {{volumes of}} biomass waste are {{generated}} each {{year as a}} result of agricultural practices in India. Despite the negative environmental impacts, in-situ incineration of crop residues is common practice for disposal of this waste. Transportation of raw biomass accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} cost of biomass conversion processes due to its low energy density and high bulk volume. The use of raw biomass also reduces the overall efficiency of thermochemical conversion processes due to high moisture content, over-oxidation of the fuel resulting from high oxygen content, and the relatively high oxygen to carbon ratio. There has been much recent interest in improving the properties of biomass prior to gasification and pyrolysis through densification, drying, and mild thermochemical treatments. One approach is a process known as torrefaction, which is a mild pyrolysis process that is shown to produce an energy-dense fuel with improved transport, storage, and feedstock characteristics. Particularly in the Indian context, there is a need for the development of a small-scale system which can densify and upgrade the properties of agricultural residues after harvest. This thesis presents the design and preliminary testing of a lab-scale moving-bed torrefaction reactor.

Waste biomass and refuse derived fuel (RDF), and their single components were investigated for pyrolysis to produce a hydrogen rich syngas with a bench scale fixed bed reactor. The samples were pyrolysed at different temperatures, heating rates and particle sizes to recover syngas, oil and char products. The waste biomass was investigated for steam pyrolysisgasification in a continuous <b>screw</b> kiln <b>reactor</b> to produce hydrogen. The samples were gasified at different temperatures, steam/biomass ratios, and in the presence of nickel catalysts. The effects of nickel loading on the catalyst, the catalyst/waste biomass ratio, the effects of different metal additives and the effect of in-situ CO 2 capture were also investigated for hydrogen production and resistance to catalyst deactivation by coking. A commercial scale pyrolysis reactor was studied for the pyrolysis of real world wastes. FTIR and GC/MS analysis of the oils from the pyrolysis of waste biomass, RDF and their single components indicated that the oil product from high heating rate pyrolysis contained mostly aromatics and alkenes, while that from slow heating rate contained mostly oxygenates, alkanes and alkenes. Gaseous products from the waste biomass, RDF and their single components contained mostly CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4 and C 2 – C 4 gases. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature and heating rate both resulted in an increase in gas and hydrogen production while reducing the oil and solid char yields.

40|$|Renewable plant biomass is {{considered}} {{as an alternative}} raw material {{for the production of}} fuels and chemicals instead of decreasing fossil resources. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated lignocellulosic material to produce high sugar concentrations is one important step in a bio-refinery process, and can be operated under moderate conditions without by-products. However, the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis is hindered by lignocellulose recalcitrance. Therefore, pretreatments of the biomass are applied to increase the accessibility of the biomass to the enzymes. However, the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates is significantly hampered by a strong slowdown of the reaction after its start. The initial rate and final biomass conversion strongly depend on the type of cellulose, ranging from commercial celluloses towards various pretreated lignocelluloses. In addition, the solvent in the enzymatic hydrolysis, either the remaining pretreatment solvent or the recycled solvent of the fermentation product, will affect the cellulase activity and stability. The objective of this work was to investigate the interaction of the solvents and mechanical pretreatment with enzymatic lignocellulose hydrolysis in depth. Mechanical pretreatment, i. e. in this work by a screw press, disrupts beech wood and wheat straw into smaller fibers. Combined with alkaline soaking, a synergetic enhancement of enzymatic hydrolysis was observed. Delignification by the chemical pretreatment played a major role, whereas enzymatic hydrolysis was nearly not affected using only the mechanical screw press. Alkaline assisted <b>screw</b> <b>reactor</b> pretreatment under moderate conditions enhanced sugar recovery by 96 % and 126 % for glucose and xylose, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide pretreatment after alkaline soaked screw press further enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis. Various solvent pretreatments were investigated to evaluate the solvent effects onto enzymatic hydrolysis. Organosolv pretreatment with ethanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol and 2 -MTHF could all delignify and increase the cellulose content, and thus enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis. All sugar yields were over 80 % under 10 % solid loading by Celluclast 1. 5 L. The ionic liquid (IL) 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM Ac) could disintegrate lignocellulose, but the extent strongly depends on the water or acid content in the pretreatment liquid. To elucidate the enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated biomass, cellulase adsorption during hydrolysis was investigated. The initial reaction rate correlated to the adsorbed enzyme loading as predicted by the adsorption isotherm. However, reaction rate slows down during hydrolysis progress, and the adsorbed cellulase loading during the hydrolysis process drifts away from the enzyme adsorption isotherm. Particle size decrease, porosity increase and composition change partly contribute to the adsorption drift. The irreversible cellulose adsorption and activity loss during hydrolysis mainly cause the rate decrease. In addition, during hydrolysis, most solvents, such as IL, ethanol, or 2 -MTHF had a negative effect on the hydrolysis yield. In contrast, itaconic acid, as the platform chemical produced from biomass, had no significant effect on enzymatic hydrolysis. Thus, itaconic acid could be recycled as a buffer component in the enzymatic hydrolysis. The solvent effect on the hydrolysis mostly depended on the effect to the cellulase activity. 2 % ethanol and 1 % 2 - methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) was found to enhance the cellulase activity, whereas 10 % ethanol caused 20 % activity decrease. The cellulase stability was not affected by 10 % ethanol compared to pure buffer. In contrast, 10 % 2 -MTHF caused more than 40 % activity loss, and the stability decreased significantly while incubated in the 2 -MTHF solution. To determine the enzyme activity quickly and easily, an online cellulase activity measurement method based on HPAEC-PAD was developed. Besides, the enzyme mixture was optimized to reach higher enzymatic hydrolysis yield for fermentation in next bio-refinery step. In summary, several pretreatment methods and their effects on the enzymatic hydrolysis were evaluated. Fundamental understanding of enzymatic hydrolysis, in particular, the relationship of the biomass properties and the hydrolysis rate, as well as solvent effects were identified. In the future, the online cellulase activity assay could be used for further enzyme mixture optimization for other substrates and for the control of enzymatic hydrolysis. All these findings can be useful for the economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass in a further bio-refinery process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} methods for the controlled synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on flat substrates and on micron sized particles. The carbon nanomaterials were synthesized using three different types of CVD reactors at atmospheric pressure. The vertical CVD reactor was used to study CNT formation on thermally oxidized silicon wafers and to synthesize individual single-walled CNTs on Si 3 N 4 substrates. By using CO as the carbon source and iron as the catalyst, the temperature dependence of CNT growth on the silica substrate was studied by changing the CO 2 concentration and catalyst sputtering time. A variation {{of the number of}} CNT walls from 1 to 4 was found by changing the synthesis temperature from 590 to 1070 °C, together with CO 2 concentration. This incremental variation of the number of CNT walls as well as the CNT lengths with temperature was explained by an enhancement of carbon solubility and diffusivity. Individual single-walled CNT synthesis was performed across 1. 5 µm wide Si 3 N 4 slits for studying the chirality dependent properties of individual tubes. By employing a horizontal laboratory scale CVD reactor, we reported {{for the first time the}} growth of CNFs on cement and clinker particles without additional catalyst. CNFs and CNTs were also synthesized on silica particles impregnated by iron salt.
