5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. <b>Speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia was non-medically {{described}} in early texts, {{such as the}} Bible and writings of Homer, {{but there was no}} further mention of what aphasia was or how it occurred at that time. In medical research, speechlessness was described as an incorrect prognosis, and there was no assumption that underlying language complications existed. The earliest recorded medical cases of aphasia were made back in the Middle Ages, where it was thought to be an imbalance of bodily fluids in the brain that caused the inability to speak one's mind. The first medical documents dating back to the late 19th century contain early descriptions of aphasia. Broca and his colleagues were some of the first to write about aphasia, but Wernicke was the first credited to have written extensively about aphasia being a disorder that contained comprehension difficulties. Despite claims of who reported on aphasia first, it was F.J. Gall that gave the first full description of aphasia after studying wounds to the brain, as well as his observation of <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> resulting from vascular lesions.|$|E

40|$|The TT (Talk Test) {{has been}} a useful tool when {{prescribing}} exercise intensity. It {{has been shown to}} have significant relationship to the Ventilatory Threshold (VT) and Respiratory Compensation Threshold (RCT). There however have been no studies that have directly measured the perception of <b>speech</b> <b>difficulty</b> while performing the TT. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the perception of <b>speech</b> <b>difficulty</b> as a continuous variable (Visual Analogue Scale) and comparing it to the TT measured as a categorical variable (yes, yes/no, no). Twenty (n = 20) physically active volunteers participated in three incremental maximal exercise tests on an electronically braked bicycle ergometer. Exercise tests were performed in a counterbalanced order with the same protocol (25 W + 25 W/ 2 min) until fatigue. The results found that females perceived <b>speech</b> <b>difficulty</b> higher than males using the VAS with a significant difference (p <. 05) at the Last Positive (LP), Equivocal (EQ), and Negative (NEG) stage of the TT. The main finding of the study was that perception of <b>speech</b> <b>difficulty</b> increased with exercise in a curvilinear fashion...|$|R

25|$|Since 2017, Dave Raymond is {{the primary}} {{television}} play-by-play announcer. Since 1982 on both TV and radio, Busby has had various stints in various positions on Rangers broadcasts from play-by-play to color commentary to pre-game and post-game analysis. In June 2012, Busby moved back to his current role after Dave Barnett left his position as game announcer following an episode in which he experienced <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Beginning in 2016, Dave Raymond will substitute for Busby on select games. Tom Grieve {{is the primary}} color analyst. A former Rangers player and general manager, Grieve {{has been in the}} TV booth since 1995 following the end of his tenure as GM. Another former Ranger, Mark McLemore, substitutes for Grieve and has been doing so more often in recent seasons. McLemore often joins the booth for an inning during home games. He and former Ranger Iván Rodríguez are among the pre-game and post-game analysts used on Fox Sports Southwest. FSSW pre-game and post-game shows are hosted by a rotation among Dana Larson, John Rhadigan, Ric Renner, and Erin Hartigan. In-game reporters include Jim Knox, Rhadigan, Hartigan, and Rangers employee Emily Jones (formerly of FSSW).|$|E
500|$|Edward Falco, a playwriting {{professor}} at Virginia Tech, {{has acknowledged that}} Cho wrote both plays in his class. The plays are fewer than 12 pages long and have several grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Falco said of the plays, [...] "They're not good writing, {{but at least they}} are a form of communication." [...] Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as [...] "very adolescent" [...] and [...] "silly", with attempts at [...] "slapstick comedy" [...] and [...] "elements of violence".|$|E
500|$|A stroke is a {{decrease}} in blood supply to {{an area of the}} brain causing cell death and brain injury. This can lead {{to a wide range of}} symptoms, including the [...] "FAST" [...] symptoms of facial droop, arm weakness, and <b>speech</b> <b>difficulties</b> (including with speaking and finding words or forming sentences). Symptoms relate to the function of the affected area of the brain and can point to the likely site and cause of the stroke. Difficulties with movement, speech, or sight usually relate to the cerebrum, whereas imbalance, double vision, vertigo and symptoms affecting more than one side of the body usually relate to the brainstem or cerebellum.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{parameter}} for {{estimating the}} difficulty of a continuous speech recognition task, called <b>speech</b> decoding <b>difficulty,</b> is presented in this work. It is obtained from the language model defined for the recognition task and the phonetic similarity between the transcriptions of the words {{that make up the}} vocabulary used. Two variants of the proposed task difficulty measure are introduced: ideal <b>speech</b> decoding <b>difficulty</b> (ISDD), which is uninfluenced by practical considerations on the recognition system implemented, and a second, more realistic variant, called practical <b>speech</b> decoding <b>difficulty</b> (PSDD) to study the performance of a specific recognition system when confronting a given task.

50|$|Watershed stroke {{symptoms}} {{are due to}} the reduced blood flow to {{all parts of the}} body, specifically the brain, thus leading to brain damage. Initial symptoms, as promoted by the American Stroke Association, are FAST (stroke), representing F = Facial weakness (droop), A = Arm weakness (drift), S = <b>Speech</b> <b>difficulty</b> (slur), and T = Time to act (priority of intervention).|$|R

25|$|A {{mnemonic}} {{to remember}} the warning signs of stroke is FAST (facial droop, arm weakness, <b>speech</b> <b>difficulty,</b> and time to call emergency services), as advocated by the Department of Health (United Kingdom) and the Stroke Association, the American Stroke Association, the National Stroke Association (US), the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS). Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this case}} report was to present the {{orthodontic}} treatment of an adult with spaced dentition, Class III malocclusion, and open-bite tendency.

She had a mild tongue thrust, hypertropic upper frenum, and mild <b>speech</b> <b>difficulty</b> while pronouncing “s”. Her profile was straight with prominent lips. Molar relationship was Class III on both sides. Anterior teeth were in an end-to-end relationship. Lower dental midline was deviated to the left side. Cephalometric analysis revealed a skeletal Class III relationship with hyperdivergent facial pattern. The treatment plan included myotherapeutic exercises for the tongue thrust habit and a diagnostic set-up for closure of diastemas. A strict retention protocol was followed combined with gingivoplasty, fiberotomy, and frenectomy procedures.
