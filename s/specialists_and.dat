5|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) is {{a useful}} treatment when OCD is present, and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of habit reversal (HRT) {{in the treatment of}} tics.

40|$|Background There is {{a sizable}} body of {{empirical}} literature supporting the unique contributions of <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced practice roles to health care. However, {{there is very}} little international evidence to inform the integration of a future model for advanced or specialist practice in the Irish health care system. Aim The aim {{of this study was to}} inform and guide the development of a future model of <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced nursing and midwifery practice. Design A qualitative study was conducted to initiate this important area of inquiry. Methods Purposive sampling was used to generate a sample of informants (n= 15) for the interviews. Nurses and midwives working in <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced practice and participants from other areas such as legislative, regulatory, policy, medicine and education, were included in the sampling frame. Results Arguments for a new model of <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced practice were voiced. A number of participants proposed that flexibility within <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced practitioner career pathways was essential. Otherwise, there existed the possibility of being directed into specialised ‘silos’, precluding movement to another area of integrated practice. Future <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced practice education programs need to include topics such as the development of emotional and political intelligence. Conclusion The contribution of <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced practice roles to the health service include providing rapid access to care, seamless patient flow across services, early discharge and lead coordinator of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s care trajectory. There was a recommendation of moving towards a universal model to cultivate <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> advanced nurse and midwife practitioners...|$|R

5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou <b>specialists,</b> <b>and</b> the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> generalist herbivores.|$|E

However, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the university in the early 20th century, saw those fields as vocations, and he encouraged Morgan to continue her focus on science.|$|E
5|$|News {{of these}} {{conditions}} was relayed to Britain, mainly by William Howard Russell, special correspondent of The Times. Hearing the news, Samuel Morton Peto, {{one of the leading}} railway contractors of the day, offered with his partners Edward Betts and Thomas Brassey, to build at cost, without any contract or personal advantage, a railway to transport supplies from the port of Balaclava to the troops outside Sevastopol. They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava. The offer was accepted and the contractors began to obtain supplies, to purchase or hire ships, and to recruit the men, who included <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> navvies. The fleet set sail on December 21 and arrived at the beginning of February.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E

5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> generalist herbivores. Most quantitative metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of an}} {{operation}} {{that resulted in the}} Coral Sea battle, the Japanese Navy sent troops to occupy Tulagi and nearby islands in the southern Solomons. These troops—mainly members of the 3d Kure Special Naval Landing Force—occupied Tulagi on 3 May 1942, and constructed a seaplane, ship refueling, and communications base on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Gavutu, Tanambogo and Florida, all of which were soon operational. Aware of the Japanese efforts on Tulagi, the Allies' concern increased in early July 1942 when the Japanese Navy began constructing a large airfield near Lunga Point on nearby Guadalcanal. By August 1942, the Japanese had about 900 troops on Tulagi and nearby islands, and 2,800 personnel (many of whom were Korean and Japanese construction <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> laborers) on Guadalcanal. The airfield—when complete—would protect Japan's major base at Rabaul, threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for possible future offensives against Fiji, New Caledonia, and Samoa (Operation FS).|$|E
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on <b>specialists),</b> <b>and</b> it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to understanding the nature of <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> generalist human capital by exploring the ways in knowledge workers view their experience of working in <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> generalist roles in pharmaceutical firms in Ireland and the UK. The findings are based on interviews with 55 knowledge workers employed in a range of scientific, technical and managerial positions in four Irish and two UK firms located in the pharmaceutical sector. Interviews were also conducted with nine human resource/training and development managers within these six firms. The findings suggest that the categorisation of human capital as either specialist or generalist is too rigid and does not take account of the fact that individuals may themselves choose to shape their careers by investing in a range of education, training and development opportunities that will enable them to move between <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> generalist roles. The paper unpacks the concepts of <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> generalist human capital from an employee perspective and challenges the sharp distinction that is made between <b>specialist</b> <b>and</b> generalist human capital. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1979, Taraki {{attended}} {{a conference of}} the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back he stopped in Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal {{was present at the}} meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki's Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and <b>specialists,</b> <b>and</b> the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price. However, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.|$|E
5|$|New York faced similar {{architectural}} challenges, but {{in comparison}} to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other <b>specialists,</b> <b>and</b> instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than {{a partnership with the}} mechanical arts. Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling atelier style workshops. Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city. The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance. Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York. Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its own style. Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly.|$|E
5|$|The black honeyeater may be {{adversely}} affected {{by the loss of}} the emu bush to grazing and weed control by farmers. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be particularly rapid; the current population seems to be of sufficient numbers, and the species has a sufficiently large range, for the species to be evaluated as of species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However Claire A. Runge and colleagues observed that the black honeyeaters' range across inland Australia contracted after years of low rainfall and showed a slow and incomplete recovery even after several years. They added that although nomadic species such as the black honeyeater may have a large distribution, they are often habitat <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> hence may only occupy a small area within their range. Thus the risk of extinction of these species may be underestimated.|$|E
