25|$|When {{antiretroviral}} {{drugs are}} used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains {{can become the}} dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, <b>stavudine,</b> and lamivudine were used serially or in combination leading {{to the development of}} multi-drug resistant mutations.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} classes of drugs directed against thymidine metabolism and thereby involving thymidine kinase {{that are used}} to control cancer associated cell division. Chain terminators are thymidine analogues that are included in the growing DNA chain, but modified so that the chain cannot be further elongated. As analogs of thymidine, this type of drugs are readily phosphorylated to 5'-monophosphates. The monophosphate is further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphate and incorporated in the growing DNA chain. The analog has been modified so that it does not have the hydroxyl group in the 3'-position that is required for continued chain growth. In zidovudine (AZT; ATC:J05AF01) the 3'-hydroxyl group has been replaced by an azido group, in <b>stavudine</b> (ATC: J05AF04) it has been removed without replacement. AZT is used as substrate in one of the methods for determination of thymidine kinase in serum. This implies that AZT interferes with this method and may be a limitation: AZT is a standard component of HAART therapy in HIV infection. One common consequence of AIDS is lymphoma and the most important diagnostic application of thymidine kinase determination is for monitoring of lymphoma.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{derivative}} of <b>stavudine</b> (d4T, brand name Zerit), {{and has been}} designed to avoid dependence on the rate limiting step of phosphorylation of <b>stavudine</b> to <b>stavudine</b> monophosphate. This is governed by the supply of thymidine kinase that is available, and <b>stavudine</b> is poorly phosphorylated to its monophosphate form in thymidine kinase-deficient cells.|$|E
50|$|Further {{modification}} of the dideoxy framework {{led to the development}} of 2´,3´-didehydro-3´-deoxythymidine (<b>stavudine,</b> d4T). Activity of <b>stavudine</b> was shown to be similar to that of zidovudine, although their phosphorylation patterns differ; theaffinity for zidovudine to thymidine kinase (the enzyme responsible for the first phosphorylation) is similar to that of thymidine, whereas the affinity for <b>stavudine</b> is 700-fold weaker.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stavudine</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to affect the fetus in animal studies but no data are available from human studies. Pregnant women should therefore be given <b>stavudine</b> only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential harm to the fetus. Additionally, there have been case reports of fatal lactic acidosis in pregnant women receiving combination therapy of <b>stavudine</b> and didanosine with other antiviral agents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stavudine,</b> {{zidovudine}} and indinavir (IDV) cause {{a decrease}} in mitochondrial respiration {{and an increase in}} mitochondrial mass in fat cells. <b>Stavudine</b> also causes severe mitochondrial DNA depletion. Combining zidovudine with <b>stavudine</b> does not increase the mitochondrial toxicity compared to <b>stavudine</b> alone. Both of these drugs must be phosphorylated by host enzymes before they become active. Zidovudine inhibits the phosphorylation of <b>stavudine.</b> This might reduce the toxicity of the combination. Using indinavir in combination with the other two drugs did not increase the toxicity of the combination. Indinavir is a protease inhibitor and works by a different mechanism than the other antiviral drugs. (d4T+AZT+IDV = d4T+AZT = d4T+IDV > AZT+IDV = AZT = IDV). All three of these drugs inhibit the expression of respiratory chain subunits (cytochrome c oxidase CytOx2 and CytOx4) in white fat cells but not brown fat cells. Since <b>stavudine</b> and zidovudine are OAT1 substrates, they may have similar effects on proximal renal tubule cells as they do on fat cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stavudine</b> is a {{nucleoside}} analog of thymidine. It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases into an active triphosphate. <b>Stavudine</b> triphosphate inhibits HIV’s reverse transcriptase by {{competing with the}} natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme the virus uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA in order to insert its genetic material into the host’s DNA. Upon incorporation into the DNA strand, <b>stavudine</b> triphosphate causes termination of DNA replication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stavudine</b> {{was first}} created by Jerome Horwitz in the 1960s and was {{originally}} named D4T. When the AIDS epidemic {{occurred in the}} 1980s, William Prusoff and Dr. Tai-Shun Lin discovered the anti-HIV properties of <b>Stavudine.</b> The pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures the drug under the trade name Zerit.|$|E
50|$|Distribution: <b>Stavudine</b> {{does not}} bind to {{proteins}} in the blood.|$|E
5000|$|Lamivudine has reverse {{chirality}} {{compared to}} didanosine, <b>stavudine,</b> zidovudine, and natural nucleosides. Mitochondrial DNA polymerase may not {{recognize it as}} a substrate. Lamivudine is not toxic to mitochondria in vivo. [...] Individuals who had been taking didanosine combined with <b>stavudine</b> exhibited improved mitochondrial function when they switched to lamivudine combined with tenofovir.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stavudine,</b> {{also called}} d4T, has trade names Zerit and Zerit XR.|$|E
50|$|Absorption: <b>Stavudine</b> has rapid {{absorption}} {{and good}} oral bioavailability (F = 0.86).|$|E
50|$|Elimination: <b>Stavudine</b> {{is mostly}} {{eliminated}} {{in the urine}} and mostly in its unchanged form.|$|E
50|$|Administration {{with drugs}} with {{overlapping}} toxicity, such as zalcitabine and <b>stavudine,</b> is not recommended.|$|E
5000|$|On Monday 30 November 2009, the World Health Organization {{stated that}} [...] "WHO {{recommends}} that countries phase out {{the use of}} <b>Stavudine,</b> or d4T, because of its long-term, irreversible side-effects. <b>Stavudine</b> is still widely used in first-line therapy in developing countries due to its low cost and widespread availability. Zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) are recommended as less toxic and equally effective alternatives." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Stavudine</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of HIV-1 infection, but is not a cure. It is not normally recommended as initial treatment. <b>Stavudine</b> can also reduce the risk of developing HIV-1 infection after coming into contact with the virus either at work (e.g., needlestick) or through exposure to infected blood or other bodily fluids. It is always used in combination with other HIV medications for the better control of the infection and a reduction in HIV complications.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneous use of {{zidovudine}} is not recommended, {{as it can}} {{inhibit the}} intracellular phosphorylation of <b>stavudine.</b> Other anti-HIV drugs do not possess this property.|$|E

5000|$|William Prusoff, {{discovered}} idoxuridine, {{the first}} antiviral agent {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and discovered the anti-HIV effect of <b>stavudine</b> (D4T).|$|E
50|$|It is {{also the}} first drug to be granted {{parallel}} track status in 1992 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allowed for the agency to make <b>Stavudine</b> available to patients before being approved. <b>Stavudine</b> was submitted under the FDA’s accelerated approval process. Through this process, Stavudine’s effectiveness was measured by {{its effect on the}} surrogate marker, CD4, instead of clinical endpoints. The FDA concluded that an increase in CD4 cell counts was an indicator of how effective the drug would be against AIDS and HIV infection. <b>Stavudine</b> was the fourth drug to be approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection by the FDA on June 27, 1994. Even after approval, studies were continued to evaluate the clinical benefit of the drug. If there is no indication of clinical benefits, the accelerated approval may be withdrawn.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stavudine</b> is not protein-bound {{nor does}} it inhibit the major {{cytochrome}} P450 isoforms. Thus, significant drug interactions with drugs metabolized through these pathways or drugs that are protein-bound are unlikely.|$|E
50|$|Lamivudine/nevirapine/stavudine (3TC/NVP/d4T) is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} HIV/AIDS. It is a fixed dose combination of lamivudine, nevirapine, and <b>stavudine.</b> It is either used by itself or along with other antiretrovirals. It is taken by mouth twice a day.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and {{peripheral}} nerve problems. Severe side effects include high blood lactate, pancreatitis, and an enlarged liver. It is not generally recommended in pregnancy. <b>Stavudine</b> {{is in the}} nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of medication.|$|E
50|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{recommend}} that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants, {{in order to}} avoid the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk. There is also evidence that <b>stavudine</b> gets into animal breast milk, although no data are available for human breast milk.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleoside analogs are a {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs that work by inhibiting viral nucleic acid synthesis. The nucleoside analogs acyclovir (ACV), zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), <b>stavudine</b> (d4T), trifluridine, cidofovir, adefovir, and tenofovir (TDF) [...] are substrates of the OAT1 transporter. This may result in the buildup of these drugs in the proximal tubule cells. At high concentrations, these drugs inhibit DNA replication. This, in turn, may impair the function of these cells and may {{be the cause of}} antiviral induced Fanconi syndrome. The use of <b>stavudine,</b> didenosine, abacavir, adefovir, cidofovir [...] and tenofovir has been associated with Fanconi syndrome. Clinical features of tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome include glycosuria in the setting of normal serum glucose levels, phosphate wasting with hypophosphatemia, proteinuria (usually mild), acidosis, and hypokalemia, with or without acute renal failure.|$|E
