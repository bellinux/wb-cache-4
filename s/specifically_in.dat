5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More <b>specifically,</b> <b>in</b> a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{quality of}} oocytes {{depends largely on}} the {{capacity}} to resume meiotic maturation. In Xenopus laevis, only fully grown oocytes react to progesterone stimulation by resumption of meiotic maturation associated with the entry into the meiotic M-phase. Proteins involved in this process are poorly known. To identify novel proteins regulating M-phase entry, we performed a differential proteomic screen. We compared proteomes of fully grown stage VI oocytes characterized as poorly or highly responsive to progesterone treatment. The comparison of 2 -D gels allowed us to identify several spots including two <b>specifically</b> present <b>in</b> highly responsive oocytes and two <b>specifically</b> present <b>in</b> poorly responsive ones. By mass spectrometry we identified the two proteins <b>specifically</b> present <b>in</b> highly responsive oocytes as inosine 5 'monophosphate cyclohydrolase and YjgF homologues, and the two <b>specifically</b> present <b>in</b> poorly responsive oocytes as elongation factor 2 (EF 2) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). The proteins <b>specifically</b> expressed <b>in</b> highly responsive oocytes may participate in the stimulation of meiotic maturation and M-phase entry, while the proteins <b>specifically</b> present <b>in</b> poorly maturing oocytes may participate in the inhibition of meiotic resumption...|$|R

5|$|During {{the colonial}} era, {{there were two}} {{distinct}} fields {{of what is now}} considered classical music. One was associated with amateur composers and pedagogues, whose style was originally drawn from simple hymns and gained sophistication over time. The other colonial tradition was that of the mid-Atlantic cities like Philadelphia and Baltimore, which produced a number of prominent composers who worked almost entirely within the European model; these composers were mostly English in origin, and worked <b>specifically</b> <b>in</b> the style of prominent English composers of the day.|$|E
