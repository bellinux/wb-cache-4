40|$|Al-substituted 11 {{angstrom}} tobermorites {{were obtained}} from stoichiometrically adjusted mixtures of newsprint recycling waste, sodium silicate and calcium oxide via hydrothermal synthesis at 100 degrees C. Hydrothermal processing in water yielded a highly crystalline 11 angstrom tobermorite product with a Cs+ cation exchange capacity of 85 meq 100 g(- 1) and <b>selective</b> Cs+ <b>distribution</b> coefficient of similar to 5500 cm(3) g(- 1). Conversely, a product of inferior crystallinity was obtained from hydrothermal synthesis in alkaline liquor whose Cs+ ion exchange capacity and <b>selective</b> Cs+ <b>distribution</b> coefficient {{were found to be}} 66. 3 meq 100 g(- 1) and similar to 700 cm(3) g(- 1), respectively. Silicate chain configuration was found to have a modest impact on the number of cation exchange sites per unit cell, whereas the influence of structural defects on selectivity was more pronounced. The structures and ion exchange credentials of both 11 angstrom tobermorite products corresponded well with those of their essentially phase-pure counterparts. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Local gradient-based descriptors, such as SIFT, are encoded via a hierarchical coding scheme composed of spatial aggregating restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). For each coding layer, we regularize the RBM by encouraging representations to fit both sparse and <b>selective</b> <b>distributions.</b> Supervised fine-tuning is used to {{enhance the quality of}} the visual representation for the categorization task. We performed a thorough experimental evaluation using three image categorization data sets. The hierarchical coding scheme achieved competitive categorization accuracies of 79. 7 % and 86. 4 % on the Caltech- 101 and 15 -Scenes data sets, respectively. The visual representations learned are compact and the model's inference is fast, as compared with sparse coding methods. The low-level representations of descriptors that were learned using this method result in generic features that we empirically found to be transferrable between different image data sets. Further analysis reveal the significance of supervised fine-tuning when the architecture has two layers of representations as opposed to a single layer...|$|R

50|$|Much {{more common}} {{in recent years is}} soft censorship, defined as indirect, “often {{financial}} pressure, intended to weaken the capacities and even threaten the viability” of media outlets, especially those that criticize the government and the ruling party. Specifically, soft censorship refers to the attempt by government to influence media outlets through various forms of pressures, without using legal bans, open censorship of content or physical attacks against journalists. There are at least three forms of soft censorship: abuse of public funds; abuse of regulatory and inspection authorities, and paralegal pressures. In Montenegro, soft censorship is exerted mainly through financial pressure, that is to say through allocation of advertising services by public institutions to favored media outlets, <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> of subsidies and other state funds, paid content, and the like.|$|E
50|$|S. intercalatum {{is at risk}} of endangerment {{in large}} {{part due to the}} {{introduction}} of invasive species into its native habitat. Since 1973, both S. mansoni and S. haematobium have been found in places that have been traditionally inhabited by S. intercalatum. This is thought to be because of the increase in transportation accessibility and the increase in forestry jobs in these habitats. Male S. mansoni and S. haematobium will both take priority over S. intercalatum when it comes to mate selection, leading to a smaller proportion of female S. intercalatum available for mating. While crosses with S. mansoni give no viable offspring, the pairing with a male S. haematobium will result in a hybrid organism. Most hybrids will have a diluted genome that is more closely related to S. haematobium, helping to bring about a decline in S. intercalatum populations. The other obstacle restricting the parasite's population growth is its <b>selective</b> <b>distribution.</b> The cercariae are very particular over where they develop, needing small, forested areas with streams to infect their human host.

In Tamluk, the government had destroyed some 18,000 boats in pursuit of its denial policy in April 1942; in addition, the war-related inflation had further alienated the rural population, which became a bank of eager volunteers when local Congress recruiters came proposing an open rebellion. Beginning on 8 September 1942, {{and for the next}} three weeks, the civil administration in Tamluk became increasingly paralyzed, and in the end the army had to be called in to suppress {{the movement}}. Confrontations in Tamluk resulted in the deaths of 44, including Matangini Hazra, a 71-year-old woman who would later become a folk hero of the anti-colonial movement. Newspapers supporting the Quit India movement in Bengal were either censored or forced to close by the British authorities and their editors fined. Spokesman for the opposition in Bengal's provincial legislature claimed that knowledge of the intensity of the famine was kept from the people because the press was stifled and there was a ban on public assembly. However, many major newspapers such as The Statesman and the Amrit Bazar Patrika did continue to be published and later reported on the famine. The mistrust between the government and Indian businesses grew during 1942-45, the government suspecting Indian businesses of financing the Quit India unrest, the businesses suspecting the government of limiting their earnings in the war-related works and preserving the British commercial predominance in India. The government also attempted to address the concerns of Calcutta's [...] "priority class" [...] with <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> of economic benefits, which altered their behaviour, but not their attitudes. The disorder and distrust that were the effects and after-effects of rebellion and civil unrest placed political, logistical, and infrastructural constraints on the Government of India that contributed to later famine-driven woes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are {{the major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitters in the retina. Approximately half of the amacrine cells release glycine at their synapses with bipolar, other amacrine, and ganglion cells. Glycinergic amacrine cells are small-field amacrine cells with vertically oriented dendrites and comprise more than ten different morphological types. The retinal distributions of glycine receptor (GlyR) α 1, α 2, α 3 and α 4 subtypes have been mapped with subunit-specific antibodies. GlyRs were clustered at postsynaptic hot spots which showed <b>selective</b> <b>distributions</b> for the different subunits. As a rule, only one α subunit was expressed at a given postsynaptic site. The kinetic properties of GlyRs were measured by recording spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) from identified retinal neurons in wild-type, Glra 1 spd-ot, Glra 2 and Glra 3 knockout mice. From observed differences of sIPSCs in wild-type and mutant mice, the cell-type specific subunit composition of GlyRs could be defined. OFF-cone bipolar cells and A-type ganglion cells receive prominent glycinergic input with fast kinetics that is mainly mediated by α 1 β GlyRs (decay time constant tau ~ 5 ms). By contrast, AII amacrine cells express α 3 β GlyRs with medium fast kinetics (tau ~ 11 ms). Narrow-field (NF) and wide-field amacrine cells contain predominantly α 2 β GlyRs with slow kinetics (tau ~ 27 ms).

40|$|On 1 June 2010, a new Block Exemption Regulation (BER) and new Guidelines {{that affect}} the {{practical}} use of <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> systems enter into force. The BER exempts vertical agreements, such as <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> agreements, from the prohibition of Article 101 (1) TFEU. It is significant for individual market players to obtain knowledge of what impact the new BER and the new Guidelines have for the practical use of <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. The Commission has amended the new BER and the new Guidelines {{in the light of}} the development the last decade. Two main changes are noticed {{that affect the}} content of the new legislative documents. Firstly, it is established that many distributors have obtained larger market shares. Secondly, it is stated that Internet sales have increased largely. The basic principles of the new versions of the BER and the Guidelines are identical with the former versions but the present changes are although noticeable for companies and their <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. The new BER contains a new market share rule that is more restrictive than the corresponding rule in the former BER. However, the new market share rule is not an expression of a less tolerant approach towards <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> systems; rather an amendment necessary due to the development of distributors’ market shares. The growth of distribution in the Internet the last ten years is reflected in the new Guidelines. The Commission’s approach towards the Internet as a distribution method seems in general to be positive.

During the ten years that passed since the last Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and accompanying Guidelines were introduced, the global market has developed in a rushing speed, much thanks to the Internet. The growing online markets have created enormous opportunities as well as problems, by shrinking the world and completely change the possibility to control markets. Therefore, the treatment of online distribution was at heart of the discussion when the old rules were to be reviewed. The main issues approached were {{the application of the}} concepts of “active” and “passive” sales on the internet {{and the ways in which}} suppliers may restrict the online behaviour of their distributors within exclusive and <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. The review of the old rules led to an intense debate between the promoters for <b>selective</b> <b>distribution</b> systems on one side and the so called pro-internet lobby on the other. The former argued for the importance of controlling the online behaviour of appointed distributors, while the latter held that all restrictions on online sales must be individually justified and not benefit from the Block Exemption. The final result appears to be a compromise and the Commission has more than anything tried to find ways of translating the rules on offline distribution to online sales, giving wide opportunities for distributors to operate online once they have a physical point of sales. The Commission has done quite well in its ambition to clarify the rules on internet distribution even if some uncertainties remain. Whilst continuing towards a more economic approach, it has been clearly influenced with the aim for market integration, which can be seen in the tough treatment of restraints hindering parallel trade and the protection of differential price settings on markets within the European Union...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background For a {{long time}} now, glucose has been {{thought to be the}} main, if not the sole {{substrate}} for brain energy metabolism. Recent data nevertheless suggest that other molecules, such as monocarboxylates (lactate and pyruvate mainly) could be suitable substrates. Although monocarboxylates poorly cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), such substrates could replace glucose if produced locally. The two key enzymatiques systems required for the production of these monocarboxylates are lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1. 1. 1. 27) that catalyses the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that irreversibly funnels pyruvate towards the mitochondrial TCA and oxydative phosphorylation. Results In this article, we show, with monoclonal antibodies applied to post-mortem human brain tissues, that the typically glycolytic isoenzyme of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH- 5; also called LDHA or LDHM) is selectively present in astrocytes, and not in neurons, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is mainly detected in neurons and barely in astrocytes. At the regional level, the distribution of the LDH- 5 immunoreactive astrocytes is laminar and corresponds to regions of maximal 2 -deoxyglucose uptake in the occipital cortex and hippocampus. In hippocampus, we observed that the distribution of the oxidative enzyme PDH was enriched in the neurons of the stratum pyramidale and stratum granulosum of CA 1 through CA 4, whereas the glycolytic enzyme LDH- 5 was enriched in astrocytes of the stratum moleculare, the alveus and the white matter, revealing not only cellular, but also regional, <b>selective</b> <b>distributions.</b> The fact that LDH- 5 immunoreactivity was high in astrocytes and occurred in regions where the highest uptake of 2 -deoxyglucose was observed suggests that glucose uptake followed by lactate production may principally occur in these regions. Conclusion These observations reveal a metabolic segregation, not only at the cellular but also at the regional level, that support the notion of metabolic compartmentalization between astrocytes and neurons, whereby lactate produced by astrocytes could be oxidized by neurons. </p...|$|R
