Tempels’s book inevitably elicited considerable critical response from African philosophers, which culminated {{in a wide range of}} publications such as Wiredu’s (1980) Philosophy and an African culture, Hountondji’s (1983) African philosophy: Myth and reality, Oruka’s (1990) Sage philosophy: Indigenous thinkers and modern debate on African philosophy, <b>Shutte’s</b> (1993) Philosophy for Africa, Masolo’s (1994) African philosophy in search of identity and Gyekye’s (1995) An essay of African philosophical thought: The Akan conceptual scheme. It has been over 60 years since the publication of Temples’s book and there continues to be serious debate about African philosophy. This article sought to contribute to the debate on the various conceptions of African philosophy, but with a focus on the challenges of teaching African philosophy to Philosophy of Education students at an open distance learning institution in South Africa. This article discussed the tendency amongst undergraduate Philosophy of Education students to conflate and reduce African philosophy to African cultures and traditions, and to the notion of ubuntu, and sought to understand the reasons for students’ inclination to treat African philosophy in this way. It examined students’ background knowledge of African philosophy, their critical thinking skills and whether their official study materials are selected and packaged in a manner that, in fact, adds to the challenges they face. Finally, the article explored the ways in which Philosophy of Education lecturers can adapt their pedagogy to provide students with a better understanding of African philosophy...|$|R

He {{was born}} in Giurizzani di Materada in Istria, to a middleclass family of ancient {{southern}} dalmatian origins (his ancestor's name was Jure Jurcan Giurizzano, and came there in the XVI century in order {{to escape from the}} Ottoman invasion; southern Dalmatia and Istria were at the time both under the rule of the Republic of Venice; Venice was interested in the migration: Istria at the time was indeed underpopulated because of an epidemy). Tomizza grew up in a zone where the dialect was mixed (venetian mixed with Slavic words or slavic mixed with venetian words).He completed the high-school at the Italian Liceo [...] "Carlo Combi" [...] of Capodistria (now Koper, in Slovenia). After the diploma, he had experiences of study and work in the then Jugoslavia (Faculty of humanities in Belgrade and the shooting of a movie in Ljubljana).Following the 1954 annexation of Zone B by Yugoslavia, Tomizza moved to Trieste. Most of his writing career took place there, including three books (Materada, La miglior vita, La quinta stagione) set in the Istria of his youth. Other works include the figure of the bishop-reformer Pier Paolo Vergerio, the life of the exiled istrians in Italy, some events concerning the Slovenian community in Italy (one couple mysteriously killed during the IIWW in Trieste and the love story between an Italian official and a Slovenian girl; each story is based on true facts, using original letters), some fictions set in the venetian territory and various articles (also effect of his trips as reporter).The only book translated into English and published in the U.S. is [...] "Heavenly supper: The Story of Maria Janis", translated by Anne Jacobson <b>Shutte</b> (an expert of Pier Paolo Vergerio).A study on the author in English language: https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:be1d8655-e5b6-40e1-94b7-7c173808e8a1 ...|$|E

40|$|The {{architect}} and sculptor Fredrick Kiesler opposed the linear mechanics of modernity. As so efficiently defined in Margarette <b>Shutte</b> Lihotsky’s Frankfurt kitchen, his work expressed the ‘act of body motion’, {{in the view}} that people inhabit buildings in a dynamic and vicissitudinous way. Representative of a world essentially understood to be deterministic and ordered, the Frankfurt Kitchen encapsulated the dweller in a standardised, industrial environment. Opposed to the scientific ordering of task management, Kiesler argued that the linearly devised two-dimensional methodology of architectural design is out of context with the dynamic of living and developed his ideas in the endless house; a form in which its inhabitants could live in a poly-dimensional way. This work focuses {{on the development of}} a design process, which may reflect the character and sinuous properties of an individual’s pattern of living. The study will develop a process, investigating the application of self-organising maps as a tool for the definition of space, towards a result which is emergent. The parameters that define an individual’s pattern of living, will be instigated in an array of three-dimensional self-organising activity maps, towards the development of form...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the past}} few years, {{there has been a}} renewed {{interest}} in reusability as it applies to space flight hardware. Commercial companies such as Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) are pursuing reusable hardware. Even foreign companies are pursuing this option. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched a reusable space plane technology demonstrator and Airbus Defense and Space is planning to recover the main engines and avionics from its Advanced Expendable Launcher with Innovative engine Economy [1] [2]. To date, the Space Shuttle remains as the only Reusable Launch (RLV) to have flown repeated missions and the Space <b>Shutte</b> Main Engine (SSME) is the only demonstrated reusable engine. Whether the hardware being considered for reuse is a launch vehicle (fully reusable), a first stage (partially reusable), or a booster engine (single component), the overall governing process is the same; it must be recovered and recertified for flight. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify the key factors in determining the reusability of flight hardware. This paper begins with defining reusability to set the context, addresses the significance of reuse, and discusses areas that limit successful implementation. Finally, this research identifies the factors that should be considered when incorporating reuse...|$|E
40|$|The text {{presents}} {{the work of}} Vanda, a group based in the Milan Polytechnic where it was founded by three professors and a researcher of the Faculty of Architecture. Vanda has been researching about “theories and women’s work in architecture”. The group started its activities with a seminar entitled “Dare to think the city female. ” During a decade (I 990 - 2000) the team developed many research directions involving students and researchers, working also with local municipalities in time oriented policies. The history of architecture has long been taught only as great masters history. Only recently the historians highlighted {{the late nineteenth century}} work of the so-called Anglo-Saxon Mothers work of architecture.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to define the}} somewhat elusive 3 notion of Ubuntu, {{in terms of its}} openness towards the particularity, individuality and historicity of the other. In contrast to this, the phenomenon of Into is introduced, which basically means: a thing. It is argued that South Africa is presently experiencing a movement from Ubuntu (humanness) towards Into (treating fellow humans as things). The implications of these concepts for preaching in search of meaning in a post-apartheid South Africa are explored, and an Ubuntu model for meaningful preaching is proposed in terms of inter-facing, inter-forming, and inter-flow. 1. UBUNTU: AN AFRICAN WAY OF LIFE The concept of Ubuntu has become well known all over the world as being typical of African and specifically South African culture. 4 It is impossible to do justice to the richness of this concept within the limitations of this paper. It {{has been described as a}} way of life, a universal truth, an expression of human dignity, an underpinning of the concept of an open society, African Humanism, trust, helpfulness, respect, sharing, caring, community, unselfishness, etc. In short it means: humanity, or humanness. It stems from the belief that one is a human being through others – “I am because you are” (cf. Ramose 1999 : 49 f.; <b>Shutte</b> 1993 : 46). Etymologically speaking, the term Ubuntu comes from the Zulu and Sotho versions of a traditional African aphorism, often translated as “A person is a person through other persons”: Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu. Motho ke motho ka batho. Ubuntu is a combination of Ubu and ntu – the latter being a common root in most Sub-Sahara...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} study of the effects of high energy cosmic rays (CRs) over the astrophysical ices, {{observed}} toward the embedded class I protostar Elias 29, by using computational modeling and laboratory data. Its spectrum was observed with Infrared Space Observatory - ISO, covering 2. 3 - 190 μm. The modeling employed the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC- 3 D (Dullemond et al. 2012) and laboratory data of bombarded ice grains by CRs analogs, and unprocessed ices (not bombarded). We are assuming that Elias 29 has a self-irradiated disk with inclination i = 60 ^∘, surrounded by an envelope with bipolar cavity. The results show that absorption features toward Elias 29, are better reproduced by assuming a combination between unprocessed astrophysical ices at low temperature (H_ 2 O, CO, CO_ 2) and bombarded ices (H_ 2 O:CO_ 2) by high energy CRs. Evidences of the ice processing around Elias 29 can be observed by the good fitting around 5. 5 - 8. 0 μm, by polar and apolar ice segregation in 15. 15 - 15. 25 μm, and by presence of the CH_ 4 and HCOOH ices. Given that non-nitrogen compounds were employed in this work, we assume that absorption around 5. 5 - 8. 0 μm should not be associated with NH_ 4 ^+ ion (<b>Shutte</b> & Khanna 2003), but more probably with aliphatic ethers (e. g. R 1 -OCH_ 2 -R 2), CH_ 3 CHO and related species. The results obtained in this paper are important, because they show that the environment around protostars is better modeled considering processed samples and, consequently, demonstrates the chemical evolution of the astrophysical ices.
