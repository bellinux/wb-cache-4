40|$|In {{previous}} studies, subjects did not hit slowly moving {{objects as}} quickly as fast ones, despite being instructed to hit them all {{as quickly as}} possible.

40|$|Coherent {{collective}} behavior {{emerges from}} local interactions between individuals that generate group dynamics. An outstanding {{question is how}} to quantify group coordination of non-rhythmic behavior, {{in order to understand the}} nature of these dynamics at both a local and global level. We investigate this problem in the context of a small group of four pedestrians walking to a goal, treating their speed, and heading as behavioral variables. To measure the local coordination between pairs of pedestrians, we employ cross-correlation to estimate coupling strength and cross-recurrence quantification (CRQ) analysis to estimate dynamic stability. When compared to reshuffled virtual control groups, the results indicate lower-dimensional behavior and a stronger, more stable coupling of walking speed in real groups. There were no differences in heading alignment observed between the real and virtual groups, due to the common goal. By modeling the local <b>speed</b> <b>coupling,</b> we can simulate coordination at the dyad and group levels. The findings demonstrate spontaneous coordination in pedestrian groups that gives rise to coherent global behavior.

40|$|Monitoring {{small groups}} of sheep in {{spontaneous}} evolution in the field, we decipher behavioral rules that sheep follow at the individual scale in order to sustain collective motion. Individuals alternate grazing mode at null speed and moving mode at walking speed, so cohesive motion stems from synchronizing when they decide to switch between the two modes. We propose {{a model for the}} individual decision making process and parametrize it from data. Next, we translate this individual-based model into its density-flow equations counterpart, considering 1 D-motion along the group trajectory. Numerical solving these equations display a solitary wave propagating at constant <b>speed.</b> <b>Coupling</b> individual and collective levels, groups motion can then be seen as a wave propagating at some fraction of the individual walking speed even though each individual is at any moment either stopped or walking. Considering the minimal model embedded in these equations, we show analytically that it has the Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) Soliton as a steady regime solution. This soliton emerges from the non linear coupling of start/stop individual decisions which compensate exactly for diffusion and promotes a steady ratio of walking / stopped individuals, which in turn determines the wave speed. The convergence to only one solitary wave from any initial condition, and which can recover from perturbation, gives a high robustness to this biological system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{couplings}} and gears receive nowadays {{a particular}} attention {{since they are}} becoming competitive compared to their mechanical counterpart. Indeed, the use of rare earth permanent magnets may lead to high torque density magnetic transmissions {{with the benefit of}} reduced maintenance and improved reliability. Superconducting (SC) materials offer the possibility to produce high magnetic fields. An original topology of a magnetic coupling using HTS materials is then proposed here. It comprises two rotating parts:   The input rotor (prime mover) is made from HTS solenoids and YBCO bulks. Fundamental to the operation of the SC rotor is the modulation (by the YBCO bulks operating as perfect screens) of the magnetic field produced by the two solenoids supplied by direct currents in contra-direction. Hence, the field is shaped in a suitable way so the radial flux density along a circle in the airgap is multipolar as in conventional ac machines. The flux density waveform contains a number of space harmonics which rotate at different speeds [1]. The load is connected to a p pole-pairs permanent magnet output rotor. The value of p is chosen to be equal to one of the harmonic numbers produced by the input rotor. The torque is then transmitted to the load at a different speed (gear operation) or at the same <b>speed</b> (<b>coupling).</b> The study will focus on evaluating the influence of the design parameters on the torque transmission capability of the superconducting magnetic coupling...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with conversion between the various magnetohydrodynamic wave modes occurring in magnetic structures that dapple the Sun's surface and fill its atmosphere. We {{pay particular attention to}} fast-to-slow conversion which takes place where the sound and Alfvén speeds coincide, and show that fast-to-Alfvén conversion can also transpire in three-dimensional structures near where the fast wave reflects. Implications are explored for various model atmospheres. Specifically, exact two-dimensional isothermal solutions are found to confirm previous ray-theoretic modelling, and provide useful insights on the ability of flare waves in the high atmosphere to penetrate the magnetic canopy and reach the photosphere, proffering a possible mechanism for exciting sunquakes. In the real Sun, and more realistic models, regions of strong inclined magnetic field act as `magnetic portals' allowing otherwise trapped acoustic waves to propagate into the solar atmosphere. At the point where these fast waves necessarily suffer reflection due to the exponentially increasing Alfvén <b>speed,</b> <b>coupling</b> with Alfvén waves can see them transmit through the transition region and into the solar corona. We explore the conditions that make this journey possible by following the fast wave as it impinges on the magnetoacoustic conversion layer, until incidence on the transition region. The fast-to-Alfvén mode conversion is quantified in a cold plasma and a more realistic warm plasma, both with an appended transition region. The phase of the partially reflected fast wave is altered by the mode conversion process, with profound implications for Time-Distance helioseismology. This is explored quantitatively with and without a transition region...|$|E
40|$|To hit moving targets, one {{not only}} has {{to arrive at the}} right place but also at the right time. Moving quickly {{decreases}} the spatial precision (Fitts law) but increases temporal precision (e. g. Newell et al., 1979). The latter may explain why people generally move quicker towards fast targets (<b>speed</b> <b>coupling),</b> as arriving at the right time is more important when hitting fast targets than when hitting slow ones. The timing demand depends not only on the target's speed but also on the target's elongation in the direction of motion: the timing demand decreases with increasing elongation. Here we compare manipulations of the timing demands caused by varying speed and elongation. We asked subjects to hit targets that moved from the left to the right as quickly as possible with their index finger. The targets varied in elongation in the direction of motion (influencing both spatial and temporal demands), in elongation in the orthogonal direction (influencing spatial demand) and in speed (influencing temporal demand). In a first experiment, the targets were presented in random order. Subjects hit fast targets faster than slow ones. Their movement time was influenced by the target's size (the spatial demand), but not by the direction of the elongation. In a second experiment, we presented blocks of trials with identical targets to allow subjects to optimize their strategy for each target separately. In this case the subjects did also consider the direction of the elongation. We conclude that people do not use the object's shape to estimate the timing demands of an interception task, but that they use the perceived speed and their experience on previous trials...|$|E

S. Navy Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) atmospheric model. The SST-induced wind response is assessed from eight simulations with different subgrid-scale vertical mixing parameterizations, validated using Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) winds and satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) observations on 0. 25 ° grids. The satellite data produce a coupling coefficient of s[subscript U] = 0. 42 m s⁻¹ °C⁻¹ for wind to mesoscale SST perturbations. The eight model configurations produce coupling coefficients varying from 0. 31 to 0. 56 m s⁻¹ °C⁻¹. Most closely matching QuikSCAT are a WRF simulation with the Grenier–Bretherton–McCaa (GBM) boundary layer mixing scheme (s[subscript U] = 0. 40 m s⁻¹ °C⁻¹), and a COAMPS simulation with a form of Mellor–Yamada parameterization (s[subscript U] = 0. 38 m s⁻¹ °C⁻¹). Model rankings based on coupling coefficients for wind stress, or for curl and divergence of vector winds and wind stress, are similar to that based on s[subscript U]. In all simulations, the atmospheric potential temperature response to local SST variations decreases gradually with height throughout the boundary layer (0 – 1. 5 km).

40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal cracking on the residue stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, coke drums, a main fractionator and a hydraulic decoking system. In a typical delayed coker petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the drum overhead and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure decoking pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic decoking system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the decoking cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic decoking installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a decoking control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric motor-driven pump as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic decoking system. The HVSD or variable <b>speed</b> <b>coupling</b> (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the decoking control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable <b>speed</b> <b>coupling</b> and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the decoking pump are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|A fixed {{geometry}} hybrid {{thrust bearing}} is investigated {{with three different}} supply orifice diameters. The test rig uses a face-to-face thrust bearing design, with the test bearing acting as the rotor loading mechanism. A hydraulic shaker applies the static axial load, which is reacted by a second thrust bearing. The rotor is supported radially by two water-lubricated fluid film journal bearings and {{is attached to a}} 30, 600 rpm motor via a high <b>speed</b> <b>coupling</b> with very low axial stiffness. Thrust bearings with three different orifice diameters (1. 63, 1. 80, and 1. 93 mm) are tested for a range of supply pressures, fluid film thicknesses, and rotational speeds. The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with feed orifices located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing axial clearances. In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, operating clearances, and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or operating clearances at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid thrust bearing orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications. Larger orifices generally provide larger operating clearances and higher stiffnesses, but also require higher flow rates. For most applications, a compromise of bearing performance parameters will be desired. The test results and comparisons presented will aid in sizing orifice diameters for future hybrid thrust bearing designs...|$|E

This vehicle is capable of torque-coupling and speed-coupling between the engine and the electric machine, and for this reason has been referred to as a ‘‘dual-mode vehicle". The tool performs a bi-level (nested) coupling of design and control strategy optimization, and is able to identify the optimal design of each hybrid vehicle by minimizing the powertrain costs over a 10 -year time span. The vehicle design determines the size of battery, engine and electric machine, as well as the values of the speed ratio of each power coupling device. Different powertrain cost definitions, which account for the production costs of the components and the operating costs related to fuel consumption and battery depletion over the lifetime of the vehicle, have been proposed. The latter cost contribution depends directly on the control strategy adopted to manage the power flow between the electric machine and the engine, {{as well as on the}} selection of the transmission gear. The optimal control strategy has been identified using a specifically developed fast running dynamic programming-based optimizer, which minimizes an objective function over a given training driving mission.
