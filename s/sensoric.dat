Parts of the general concept to-gether with the used <b>sensorics</b> are introduced. The ground map and its generation as well as the collaboration between the different reflexes are shown.

50|$|Pronounced textures {{occur in}} thin films. Modern {{technological}} devices {{to a large}} extent rely on polycrystalline thin films with thicknesses in the nanometer and micrometer ranges. This holds, for instance, for all microelectronic and most optoelectronic systems or <b>sensoric</b> and superconducting layers. Most thin film textures may be categorized as one of two different types: (1) for so-called fiber textures the orientation of a certain lattice plane is preferentially parallel to the substrate plane; (2) in biaxial textures the in-plane orientation of crystallites also tend to align with respect to the sample. The latter phenomenon is accordingly observed in nearly epitaxial growth processes, where certain crystallographic axes of crystals in the layer tend to align along a particular crystallographic orientation of the (single-crystal) substrate.|$|E

But new dimensions to present era is given by the discovery of π-conjugated conducting polymers commonly such as polyacetylene (PA). Nowadays various conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), polyindole, and polythiophenes (see conductive polymer) are most studied and various methods are reported such as hard template methods, soft template methods are used for the synthesis of various nanostructures. The basic conduction mechanism in conducting polymers is due to Polarons, Bipolarons and solitons. Conducting polymers are used in various applications such as chemical sensors and biosensors, transistors and switches, data storage devices, photovoltaic cells, and actuators. But the conducting polymers metal nanocomposites allow for more efficient applications than their bulk counterparts.

5000|$|In his {{indeterminacy}} {{of translation}} theory Quine claims that, {{if one is}} to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other. A radical translation is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in {{trying to find out}} to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word [...] "gavagai" [...] is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The gavagai thought experiment tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression gavagai means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that gavagai simply translates with rabbit. Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting gavagai, and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like undetached rabbit-parts, or rabbit-tropes and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same <b>sensoric</b> stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term gavagai and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their proxy functions.Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of gavagai, but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question. To make sense of the word gavagai either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like rabbits-tropes. The finding, then, that gavagai means rabbit is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation.It {{is important to note that}} indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like German and Dutch, and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the homophonic rule in those cases, i.e., if one utters rabbit, we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another. This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word rabbit, that is because there is, in Quine's word, no fact of the matter at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the influence of different methods of primary fermentation of the vine musts on the analytical and <b>sensoric</b> parameters of the wines produced. For this goal different wine samples were produced using active dry wine yeast fermentation, spontaneous fermentation and fermentation with prepared ferment that contained original cultured yeast from local wine yard. The wines were produced from three vine varieties from year 2012 and 2013. The analytical and <b>sensoric</b> evaluation was subsequently carried out. The result of the experiment show a good and even <b>sensoric</b> quality of the wines produced using the active dry wine yeast fermentation, yet certain uniformity is apparent. On the contrary the spontaneous fermentation shows traces of unevenness in the <b>sensoric</b> quality evaluation. The most important finding is that the method that produces wine using the prepared ferment is a full alternative to the methods of spontaneous or active dry wine yeast fermentation and that in many cases leads to even better <b>sensoric</b> evaluation than these two methods. The prepared ferment method has a great potential in wine making practice mainly for high quality wines that focus on the varietal character, originality, story of origin, local tradition and "terroir"...|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, the {{excitation}} {{of surface}} plasmon polariton (SPP) {{has been widely}} used in many branches of science and technology, for example, in spectroscopy, photovoltaics [1, 2], <b>sensorics</b> [3], medicine [4] and etc., due to its resonant behavior and ability to confine field in a sub-wavelength volume. It is known, that SPP is a surface wave propagating along interface between two media, {{when one of them}} is surface active (with negative permittivity). The main property of SPP is strong localization of electric field with a maximum at the interface [5, 6].

The thesis is aimed at meaning {{and quality of the}} muscle meat of the broiler and description of the influence of the feed on the <b>sensoric</b> qualities. The samples of the broiler (breast and thigh muscle meat) were evaluated from four breeders (A, B, C, D) in three different times. The meat has been evaluated for smell, colour, stringiness, fragility, juiciness, chewability and taste. The differences among individual breeders in analysed properties were assessed as an effects of the feed. The evaluation shows the best poultry breeder {{in the sense of the}} breast muscle, has been breeder D. This breeder achieved the best results (p < 0, 05) in three parametrs (colour, chewability and taste). The best breeder, in the sense as regards thigh muscle, has been the breeder A, who achieved the best results (p < 0, 05) in four parametrs from seven (fragility, juiciness, chewability and taste).
