40|$|In storm {{waterways}} and at dam outlets, high-velocity <b>supercritical</b> <b>flows</b> are characterised by substantial {{air bubble}} entrainment. The entrainment of fine air bubbles {{and the strong}} turbulent mixing contribute both to the air-water transfer of volatile gases (e. g. oxygen, nitrogen, VOC). The paper describes new experimental data obtained in a 25 -m long channel with a 4 -degree slope. The {{analysis of the data}} provides new information on the air-water flow properties and on the distributions air-water interface area. Although the amount of entrained air is small (i. e. typically Cmean < 0. 12), the specific air-water interface area can reach over 100 m 2 per unit volume of air and water.

50|$|An {{antidune}} is a bedform {{found in}} fluvial and other channeled environments. Antidunes occur in <b>supercritical</b> <b>flow,</b> {{meaning that the}} Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this {{is also known as}} upper flow regime. In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms. As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow. Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; {{this is due to the}} <b>supercritical</b> <b>flow</b> regime. Antidune bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream. The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude. When that wave becomes unstable, breaks and washes downstream, much of the antidune bedform may be destroyed.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} the {{boundary}} layer receptivity in airfoil cascade flow caused by superposed disturbances are studied using an energetic approach. The separated terms in the Fluctuating Kinetic Energy (FKE) budget are calculated. Monotonic time-harmonic disturbances are superposed to the inflow stream using forcing frequencies close to and far from the natural frequency of fluctuation found within the unsteady (<b>supercritical)</b> basic <b>flow.</b> For <b>supercritical</b> regimes, the receptivity is evaluated around the boundary layer separation point, where Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves are naturally generated. For subcritical regimes, the receptivity is explored all over the suction-side of the airfoil since separation does not occur. Within subcritical flows, the superposed perturbation is seen to trigger the generation of T-S-like waves downstream the minimum pressure point only when the forcing frequency is close to n. Within <b>supercritical</b> <b>flows,</b> when the forcing frequency matches n, the FKE budget reflects the energetic interaction between the perturbation and the already existent boundary layer T-S wave...|$|R
