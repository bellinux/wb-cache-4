Pressing flashing buttons, multiple large screens {{stand in front of}} the desk and correspond to her choice of button selected. The first images shown on the screens feature Aguilera as Catwoman, a futuristic blue haired character, and a 1960s influenced hippie before focusing on the 60's inspired character. The blond character is shown to be holding an old fashioned handheld video camera filming scenes of high rise buildings, all the while showing shots of Aguilera editing the on <b>screen</b> <b>projection.</b> The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E

During this period he taught himself about special effects: [...] "I'd go down to the USC library and pull any thesis that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front <b>screen</b> <b>projection,</b> or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{projection}} system, the projected image {{should be able}} to meet the normal visual needs of observer, so that the viewer can get the correct projection. When the <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface is the irregular free surface, {{the projection}} geometric correction of the projected image becomes the research focus. For the question of irregular <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface, this paper presents effective geometric correction method. The geometric correction method based on the geometry of irregular <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface and ideal location of viewport to calculate the points’ three-dimensional coordinate values. In this paper, the projection geometric correction method is widely applicable to various <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface environments...|$|R

USE - The curable paint layer I is useful as a 3 -dimensionally selective layer (1) for a <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> (claimed), consists of an electron beam- or UV-cured paint (claimed), e. g. a cured paint selected from acrylates, epoxides, vinyl ether, optionally substituted styrenes (claimed), especially an acrylate based or a UV-cured paint (claimed). The contrast increasing <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> {{can be used for}} displaying static or mobile images by means of call-projection (sic) via a narrow band light source, e. g. one or more chromatic light sources. ADVANTAGE - The new <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> provides a 3 -dimensional angular characteristic of a spectrally selective reflecting <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> without the problems of disturbance of spectral selectivity or alteration of the peak position of spectrum wavelength and strong reflection from the background...|$|R
