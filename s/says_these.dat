Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E

25|$|Médecins Sans Frontières {{conducted}} a research survey in 2005 that found 11.6% of the interviewees {{who took part}} had been victims of sexual abuse since 1989. This empirical study found that witnesses to rape in Kashmir was comparatively far higher than the other conflict zones such as Sierra Lone and Sri Lanka. 63% of people had heard of rape and 13% of the people had witnessed a rape. Dr Seema Kazi holds the security forces more responsible for raping than militants due to rape by the former being larger in scale and frequency. In areas of militant activity the security forces use rape to destroy morale of Kashmiri resistance. Dr Seema Kazi <b>says</b> <b>these</b> rapes cannot be ignored as rare occurrences nor should be ignored the documented acknowledgement of individual soldiers that they were ordered to rape. Kazi explains rape in Kashmir as a cultural weapon of war: In the particular context of Kashmir where an ethnic Muslim minority population {{is subject to the}} repressive dominance of a predominantly Hindu State, the sexual appropriation of Kashmiri women by State security forces exploits the cultural logic of rape whereby the sexual dishonour of individual women is coterminous with the subjection and subordination of Kashmiri men and the community at large.Former Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court noted in his report on human rights in Kashmir: It is hard to escape the conclusion that the security forces who are overwhelmingly Hindu and Sikh, see it as their duty to beat an alien population into submission.|$|E

Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. J. Hoberman, author of Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds, writes that the Lower East Side had reached a total population of 540,000 and the world [...] "ghetto" [...] became a buzzword. Other 1910 films on the subject included Yankee's The Ghetto Seamstress and D. W. Griffith's A Child of the Ghetto. Patricia Erens, author of The Jew in American Cinema <b>says</b> <b>these</b> films highlight the hard-working Jewess in melodramatic situations that are only resolved with improbable solutions. The setting for the film included scenes in Manhattan's Chinatown and was advertised as [...] "a study of settlement conditions in the great East Side of New York City. It was produced right {{in the heart of}} the ghetto to assure a faithful presentation of East Side localities and life. Representatives of all races and nationalities pass through the picture, from the slow-stepping Russian to the gliding Chinee." [...] Some of the details of the production were recorded due to the flaws in the depicting a sweatshop and the fact the Hebrew characters are not recognizable as Hebrews.|$|E

DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticidesmany of which are subject to bioaccumulationare scrutinized.

In particular, the shapes within the ALH84001 look intergrown or embedded in the indigenous material, while likely contamination does not. While {{it has not yet}} conclusively been shown how the features in the meteorite were formed, similar features have been recreated in the lab without biological inputs by a team led by D.C. Golden. David McKay <b>says</b> <b>these</b> results were obtained using unrealistically pure raw materials as a starting point, and [...] "will not explain many of the features described by us in ALH84001."

2500|$|Geoff Harcourt {{writes that}} Keynes' {{arguments}} that reparations {{would lead to}} German economic collapse have been adopted [...] "by historians of almost all political persuasions" [...] and have influenced the way historians and the public [...] "see the unfolding events in Germany and the decades between Versailles and {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War". He says Mantoux's work [...] "is not simply a critique of Keynes", but [...] "a stimulus to question the received wisdom's interpretation of the unfolding events in Germany". Harcourt says that despite it discussing Keynes' errors [...] "in great detail", Mantoux's work [...] "has not led us to revise our general judgment of Keynes", yet [...] "it does make us question the soundness of theoretical and empirical aspects" [...] of his arguments. A. J. P. Taylor writes that in 1919 [...] "many people believed that the payment of reparations would reduce Germany to a state of Asiatic poverty", and that Keynes [...] "held this view, as did all Germans; and probably many Frenchmen". However, he also <b>says</b> <b>these</b> [...] "apprehensions of Keynes and the Germans were grotesquely exaggerated".|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea that}} our planet has limits, {{including}} the burden placed upon it by human activities, {{has been around}} for some time. In 1972, The Limits to Growth was published. It presented a model in which five variables: world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resources depletion, are examined, and considered to grow exponentially, whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only linear. Subsequently, the report was widely dismissed, particularly by economists and businessmen, and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect. [...] In 2008, Graham Turner from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) published [...] "A comparison of The Limits to Growth with thirty years of reality". Turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the [...] "standard run" [...] limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported. [...] "The comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time." [...] Turner also examined a number of reports, particularly by economists, which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model. Turner <b>says</b> <b>these</b> reports are flawed, and reflect misunderstandings about the model. In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a [...] "pioneering report", and said that it [...] "has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant." ...|$|E
