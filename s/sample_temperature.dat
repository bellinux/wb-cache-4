25|$|The basic {{principle}} underlying {{this technique is}} that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as phase transitions, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is exothermic or endothermic. For example, as a solid sample melts to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature {{at the same rate as}} the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic phase transition from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as crystallization) less heat is required to raise the <b>sample</b> <b>temperature.</b> By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{phase of}} water (i.e., whether it assumes {{the form of}} a solid, liquid, or gas) is {{determined}} by its temperature and pressure. For example, in the case of liquid-gas transition, at each pressure there is a special [...] "transition temperature" [...] such that if the <b>sample</b> <b>temperature</b> is even a little above , the sample will be a gas, but, if the <b>sample</b> <b>temperature</b> is even a little below , the sample will be a liquid; see phase transition.

The transition temperature [...] decreases with decreasing pressure (which explains why water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes and at higher temperatures in a pressure cooker; see here for more information). In the case of water vapor in air, the [...] corresponding to the partial pressure of water vapor is called the dew point. (The solid-liquid transition also happens around a specific transition temperature called the melting point.

5000|$|The {{analysis}} {{can be done}} on samples which the operator brings to the analyser or the analyser can {{be connected to the}} source of the samples and the sampling be done automatically. The source of samples for automatic sampling is commonly some kind of process such as a chemical process. Analysers which are connected to a process, and conduct automatic sampling, can be called online (or on-line) analysers or sometimes inline (or in-line) analysers. For inline analysis, a sensor can be placed in a process vessel or stream of flowing material to conduct the analysis. Another method of online analysis is allowing a sample stream to flow from the process equipment into an analyser, sometimes conditioning the sample stream in between such as reducing pressure or changing the <b>sample</b> <b>temperature.</b> Such sampling is typically for fluids (either liquids or gases). If the sample stream is not substantially modified by the analyser, it can be returned to the process. Otherwise, the sample stream is not returned; for example, if any reagents have been added for the analysis.|$|E

The equipment reference frequency is the voltage pulse repetition rate. In the conventional DLTS method this frequency multiplied by some constant (depending on the hardware used) is called the [...] "rate window". During the temperature scan, peaks appear when the emission rate of carriers from some defect equals the rate window. By setting up different rate windows in subsequent DLTS spectra measurements one obtains different temperatures at which some particular peak appears. Having a set of the emission rate and corresponding temperature pairs one can make an Arrhenius plot, which allows for the deduction of defect activation energy for the thermal emission process. Usually this energy (sometimes called the defect energy level) together with the plot intercept value are defect parameters used for its identification or analysis.On samples with low free carrier density conductance transients have also been used for a DLTS analysis.|$|E
