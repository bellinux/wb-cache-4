As device is expected to operate at RF, {{it is essential to}} observe its frequency dependent characteristics at RF. In this paper frequency dependent electro optical characteristics of Optically <b>Gated</b> Metal <b>Oxide</b> <b>Semiconductor</b> Field Effect Transistor (OGMOSFET) are investigated numerically. Variation of drain current-voltage characteristics, gate capacitance and transconductance of OGMOSFET, with varying frequency, is reported. MOSFET having length of 0. 35 µm is selected for investigation, which is optically gated with incident radiations of optical power of 0. 25 mW and wavelength of 800 nm. MATLAB is used as computational platform to test and tune the results. Results show that increase in modulating frequency of OGMOSFET decreases drain current, gate capacitance, transconductance and output conductance. This is due to decrease in life time of inversion charges at very high frequencies. Operating bandwidth of the device is up to 4 GHz.

It is based on the Impulse Sensitivity Function (ISF) which describes carefully the sensitivity of an oscillator to a parasite impulse current injection in different nodes of the circuit. The obtained results pointed out that the ISF function is sinusoidal and its period is nearly the same of the oscillator output signal for different dielectric oxide. It also states that the phase noise of a Colpitts oscillator is not affected by the use of the high-k materials. Finally this method, if extended, is a good tool to investigate a perturbation response on such circuits...|$|R
