5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile.

In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E

500|$|Hoshino {{has named}} Takeshi Obata and Osamu Akimoto as inspiring her work. Her most notable work D.Gray-man is greatly {{influenced}} by her previous titles. Characters are often carried over from unpublished manga Hoshino worked on early in her career. D.Gray-man and its predecessor Zone share many major concepts, such as the creation of demons known as akuma, the Exorcists' role to eliminate these demons, and the overall plot of both works. The main antagonist of Zone, known simply as the Millennium Earl, retains his appearance and name in D.Gray-man while {{the features of the}} female protagonist were changed to create the more masculine appearance of D.Gray-mans male protagonist Allen Walker. The characters Lavi and Yu Kanda were carried over from two unpublished titles.

500|$|Although Caged Bird was {{refreshing}} in its honesty, something {{its readers}} and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in Gather Together had become, as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it, [...] "more and more formulaic". McWhorter {{asserts that the}} events that Angelou describes in Gather Together and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although she expects her readers to accept them on face value. In Gather Together, for example, Angelou insists {{that she is not}} religious, but she refuses welfare, and even though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in Gather Together, and for not explaining them fully, and states, [...] "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".|$|E

[...] In June Juanico's book Elvis in the Twilight of Memory, she stated <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> getting pregnant. However, since the singer's death, many claims to relationships have been made by women who were no more than acquaintances or had short affairs which were exaggerated for personal gain.

Alisa meets her mother's family later in the series and even receives her mother's tools from her grandmother.|$|E

2500|$|With the 2010 film Pankh, Basu {{returned}} as an imaginary character who {{exists in the}} protagonist’s mind. She was then featured as a Kashmiri girl in Rahul Dholakia's Lamhaa, which explored socio-political problems in Kashmir. Principal photography of Lamhaa was disrupted many times by the locals due to the controversial theme. During the shooting of Lamhaa, she left the sets at Anantnag {{and headed back to}} Mumbai citing <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the crowd there. Producer Bunty Walia thought of replacing her with Vidya Balan, but she returned for the shoot later with necessary security arrangements. NDTV Movies wrote, [...] "Bipasha sinks herself into her character imparting a dramatic resonance into the role without resorting to stock expressions. The sequence where she gets mauled by militant women is as traumatic to watch as it must have been for Bipasha to shoot." [...] Basu then appeared as the wife of a ruthless cop in Priyadarshan's Aakrosh who helps the police with investigation on honour killings in their village. She met with mixed reviews for the film. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, [...] "Bipasha actually doesn't have much to do and does seem to be miscast as the much-abused, bruised and battered wife of Paresh Rawal." ...|$|E
