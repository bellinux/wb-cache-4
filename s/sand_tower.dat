These were filled with the help of sanding equipment. For sanding there was either a sanding system with an elevated bunker or a <b>sanding</b> <b>tower.</b> The special <b>sand</b> was kept in its own store. On a <b>sanding</b> <b>tower</b> a telescopic pipe was hooked up to the sandbox, the lock released and the locomotive sandbox filled as required.

50|$|It {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} developed beach resorts on the island. Cala En Porter has a beach cove similar to that of Lulworth Cove, England, UK, with high imposing limestone cliffs. Whilst the western cliff remains totally undeveloped, the eastern side is now covered in villas and terrace bars. It is also famous for the twin <b>sand</b> <b>towers</b> 'Nino's towers' constructed in 2016. The resort is home to a number of restaurants and bars, as well as the nightclub Cova de en Xoroi (commonly called The Caves).|$|R
50|$|The Four Points by Sheraton, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Golden <b>Sands</b> <b>Tower,</b> is a 43-floor hotel tower in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building, constructed of steel and glass, has a total structural height of 166 m (545 ft), and currently stands as the 40th-tallest structure in the Dubai. Construction of the tower began in 2005 and was completed in early 2007. The hotel is operated by Four Points by Sheraton, and stands {{as one of the}} tallest all-hotel structures in the city. However, the building does not surpass the Burj Al Arab or the Rose Tower to become the tallest hotel in Dubai.|$|R
50|$|The Four Points by Sheraton was {{originally}} proposed for construction as the Golden <b>Sands</b> <b>Tower.</b> The building {{was designed as}} a 43 floor all-residential apartment tower; it began construction in 2004, with a set estimated completion date of 2006. Starwood Hotels & Resorts entered the project after construction had already begun, and the building was subsequently renamed Four Points by Sheraton Sheikh Zayed Road. The building plans were revised to provide for the addition of a Four Points by Sheraton hotel, and the tower was redesigned to contain both hotel and residential units, as well as a helipad. However, plans for the inclusion of residential units were later abandoned. The building was structurally completed in early 2007 and fully completed later that year.|$|R

50|$|Prince Albert's CN rail yard {{has gone}} through severe {{attrition}} since the 1990s; having lost the scale house, <b>sanding</b> <b>tower,</b> bulk fuel tanks, CN station (now a strip mall) and many other rail related buildings. Since 1991 branchlines in the Prince Albert area began to disappear, including the abandonment of the Canadian Pacific Railway yard. Carlton Trail however began reusing the roundhouse and turntable shortly after purchasing the Canadian National line. The roundhouse provides cover for their equipment and engines (CN would leave their engines outside next to the roundhouse). Carlton Trail continues to repair cars that have been damaged during derailments along their line. In recent years, larger shortline railways have removed oddball motive power, such as ALCO and MLW units from their roster; as such Carlton Trail now strictly operates used EMD units that they have purchased. Currently the only operational engines are three GP10s that run between Saskatoon & Prince Albert.|$|R

In 1998 the tower was further damaged by Hurricane Georges. Supporters raised $50,000 locally and $160,000 from the state to correct the tilt. The tower was righted and a new foundation built under it in 2002. However, the base was still exposed to surf, and the new foundation began deteriorating. The tower collapsed on October 22, 2005.|$|R
5000|$|This {{group was}} built near the Thames estuary for {{anti-aircraft}} defence, and made-up of several towers north of Herne Bay and 9.2 {{miles from the}} nearest land. One of the 7 towers collapsed in 1963 when fog caused the ship Ribersborg to stray off course and collided with one of towers. In 1964 the Port of London Authority placed wind and tide monitoring equipment on the Shivering <b>Sands</b> searchlight <b>tower,</b> which was isolated {{from the rest of the}} fort by the demolished tower. This relayed data to the mainland via a radio link. In August and September 2005, artist Stephen Turner spent six weeks living alone in the searchlight tower of the Shivering Sands Fort in what he described as [...] "an artistic exploration of isolation, investigating how one's experience of time changes in isolation, and what creative contemplation means in a 21st-century context".|$|R
50|$|Constructed on {{the same}} {{unstable}} <b>sand</b> as the <b>tower</b> and cathedral, the Baptistery leans 0.6 degrees toward the cathedral. Originally {{the shape of the}} Baptistery, according to the project by Diotisalvi, was different. It was perhaps similar to the church of Holy Sepulchre in Pisa, with its pyramidal roof. After the death of the architect, Nicola Pisano continued the work, changing the style to the more modern Gothic one. Also an external roof was added giving the shape of a cupola. As a side effect of the two roofs, the pyramidal inner one and the domed external one, the interior is acoustically perfect, making of that space a resonating chamber.|$|R
40|$|Iron is {{the primary}} source for {{discolouration}} problems in the drinking water distribution system. The removal of iron from groundwater is a common treatment step {{in the production of}} drinking water. Even when clear water meets the drinking water standards, the water quality in the distribution system can deteriorate due to settling of iron (hydroxide) particles or posttreatment flocculation of dissolved iron. Therefore it is important to remove dissolved and particulate iron to very low levels. The objective {{of this study was to}} reduce the particle load towards the distribution system and to improve the iron removal at the groundwater pumping station Harderbroek, consisting of aeration, rapid <b>sand</b> filtration and <b>tower</b> aeration. A maximum flow of 1800 m 3 /h can be treated and the average production is 800 m 3 /h. Although previous research showed the clear water meets the drinking water regulations, the drinking water company Vitens is not satisfied with the turbidity and iron concentration of the clear water. The mean iron concentration is 0. 04 mg/l. Sanitary EngineeringWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Deep foundations, {{including}} driven piles, {{are used}} to support vertical loads of structures and lateral forces. Typical structures subjected to lateral loads include bridge abutments, transmission <b>tower,</b> <b>sand</b> offshore platforms. Traffic, wind, wave, and seismic forces are common types of lateral loads subjected to pile foundations. The present work is focused on understanding the lateral load capacity of vertical piles located near crest of the slope and subjected to the lateral and inclined loads. The experimental investigation was carried out to study the effect of reinforcing an earth slope on the inclined loading behavior of a single vertical pile located near the slope. Layers of geogrid were used to reinforce a sandy slope of 1 V: 2 H. The parametric studies were performed by varying the length of pile(L), angle of inclination of load (θ), number of geogrid reinforcement (Nr) and crest distance. It was observed that the lateral load capacity of pile depends upon these parameters. The lateral load capacity of pile increases with increase in inclination of load, length of pile(L), number of geogrid reinforcement (Nr) and crest distance...|$|R
5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the <b>Sands</b> in the <b>Tower</b> of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The Prince refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|R
40|$|In a {{proposed}} {{design for a}} concentrated solar power <b>tower,</b> <b>sand</b> is irradiated by solar energy and transfers its energy to another fluid stream {{by means of a}} finned tube heat exchanger. To maximize heat transfer and minimize potential damage to the heat exchanger, it is desired to have a very uniform flow through the heat exchanger. However, performing full scale flow tests can be expensive, impractical, and depending upon the specific quantities of interest, unsuitable for revealing the details of what it happening inside of the flow stream. Thus, the discrete element method has been used to simulate and study particulate flows. In this project, the flow of small glass beads through a square pyramid shaped hopper and a wedge shaped hopper were studied at the lab scale. These flows were also simulated using computers running two versions of discrete element modeling software – EDEM and LIGGGHTS. The simulated results were compared against the lab scale flows and against each other. They show that, in general, the discrete element method can be used to simulate lab scale particulate flows as long as certain material properties are well known, especially the friction properties of the material. The potential for increasing the accuracy of the simulations, such as using better material property data, non-uniform particle size distributions, and non-spherical particle shapes, as well as simulating heat transfer within a granular flow are also discussed.

40|$|Iron is {{the primary}} source for {{discolouration}} problems in the drinking water distribution system. The removal of iron from groundwater is a common treatment step {{in the production of}} drinking water. Even when clear water meets the drinking water standards, the water quality in the distribution system can deteriorate due to settling of iron (hydroxide) particles or post-treatment flocculation of dissolved iron. Therefore it is important to remove dissolved and particulate iron to a large extent. This paper describes the study towards the current iron removal processes and experimental work towards improving removal of dissolved and particulate iron. The study was carried out at groundwater treatment plant Harderbroek, consisting of aeration, rapid <b>sand</b> filtration and <b>tower</b> aeration. The research contains two parts: 1) a particle fingerprint of the treatment, resulting in a quantification of particles breaking through the rapid sand filtration. 2) Small column experiments on the oxidation and filterability of iron. The fingerprint showed that operational events such as switching on/off of filters and backwashing {{have a significant impact on}} the volume concentration of particles breaking through the filter. A frequency plot of the different size ranges of particles indicates that mainly the filterability of the middle size ranges (2 – 7 ?m) of particles was influenced by switching a filter on/off. A backwash event mainly affects the bigger particle size ranges. The column experiments showed that in the cascade effluent the majority of the iron is dissolved iron(II), indicating that the oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III) is the rate determining step at Harderbroek, which is limited by pH. Dosing caustic soda resulted in a significant increase of the oxidation rate and improved the removal of iron(II) in the column. Crushed limestone filtration gave promising results, but the contact time applied was too short to completely oxidize iron(II) ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{veracity}} and the ideality {{which are}} so signally combined in Wordsworth's poetic descriptions of Nature, made themselves {{at least as much}} felt whenever Nature was the theme of his discourse. In his intense reverence for Nature he regarded all poetical delineations of her with an exacting severity; and if the descriptions were not true, and true in a twofold sense, the more skilfully executed they were, the more was his indignation roused by what he deemed a pretence and a deceit. An untrue description of Nature was to him a profaneness, a heavenly message sophisticated and falsely delivered. He expatiated much to me one day, as we walked among the hills above Grasmere, on the mode in which Nature had been described by one of the most justly popular of England's modern poets--one for whom he preserved a high and affectionate respect. 'He took pains,' Wordsworth said; 'he went out with his pencil and note-book, and jotted down whatever struck him most--a river rippling over the <b>sands,</b> a ruined <b>tower</b> on a rock above it, a promontory, and a mountain ash waving its red berries. He went home, and wove the whole together into a poetical description.' After a pause, Wordsworth resumed with a flashing eye and impassioned voice, 'But Nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms! He should have left his pencil and note-book at home; fixed his eye, as he walked, with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him, and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy. Then, after several days had passed by, he should have interrogated his memory as to the scene. He would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him, much was also most wisely obliterated. That which remained--the picture surviving in his mind--would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene, and done so, in a large part, by discarding much which, though in itself striking, was not characteristic. In every scene many of the most brilliant details are but accidental. A true eye for Nature does not note them, or at least does not dwell on them.' On the same occasion he remarked, 'Scott misquoted in one of his novels my lines on Yarrow. He makes me write, ...|$|R
