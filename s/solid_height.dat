40|$|In {{the area}} of image {{retrieval}} from data bases and for copyright protection of large image collections {{there is a growing}} demand for unique but easily computable fingerprints for images. These fingerprints can be used to quickly identify every image within a larger set of possibly similar images. This paper introduces a novel method to automatically obtain such fingerprints from an image. It is based on a reinterpretation of an image as a Riemannian manifold. This representation is feasible for gray value images and color images. We discuss the use of the spectrum of eigenvalues of different variants of the Laplace operator as a fingerprint and show the usability of this approach in several use cases. Contrary to existing works in this area we do not only use the discrete Laplacian, but also with a particular emphasis the underlying continuous operator. This allows better results in comparing the resulting spectra and deeper insights in the problems arising. We show how the well known discrete Laplacian is related to the continuous Laplace-Beltrami operator. Furthermore we introduce the new concept of <b>solid</b> <b>height</b> functions to overcome some potential limitations of the method.

Interesting instabilities are expected to occur when the solid is non-hydrostatically stressed. (1) A compact interdigital capacitor {{is used as a}} level detector to observe solid He- 4 to which stresses are applied externally. The capacitor consists of 38 interlaced 50 m wide and 3. 8 mm long gold films separated by 50 m and deposited onto a 5 mm by 5 mm sapphire substrate. The capacitor is placed on one flat end wall of a cylindrical chamber (xx mm diameter and xx mm long). The solid is grown to a known height and a stress is applied by a tubular PZT along the cylindrical axis. The observed small change in height of the solid at the wall is linearly proportional to the applied stress. The <b>solid</b> <b>height</b> decreases under compressive stress but does not change under tensile stress. The response of the solid on compressive stress is consistent with the expected quadratic dependence on strain.

The casein fraction forms a deposited layer on the membrane surface. Little {{is known about the}} structure of these layers and how transmembrane pressure affects their structure. In order to assess the properties, casein micelle deposits were characterized by dead-end microfiltrations. Casein micelle deposits of constant composition were formed following a standardized layer build up (permeate mass, pressure, pH). Then protein free milk serum was filtered through the deposit. Thus, the impact of compressive forces and protein-protein interactions on physical cake properties during constant <b>solid</b> <b>height</b> filtrations could be determined by stepwise variations of transmembrane pressure and pH without further deposition of proteins. It was found that the casein micelle deposits became more compactable, when their surface charge was lower. Specific cake properties were related to hydrophilic repulsion between casein micelles, whereas the influence of electrostatic interactions between micelles was negligible. The observed cake material properties obtained from dead-end filtrations provide valuable insights into deposit layer build-up and structure. Results obtained for dead-end filtrations were used to describe cross-flow filtrations. For this purpose a new method was developed to assess the specific cake resistances by the evaluation of the kinetic of flux decrease due to deposit layer build-up at the start of filtrations. For the first time it could be shown that deposits consisting of casein micelles during cross-flow filtration were thin layers (1 - 3 μm), resulting in high specific resistances (up to 20 • 10 - 15 m/kg). The specific cake resistance was pressure dependent and increased when the hydrophilic repulsion between casein micelles was reduced at a pH beyond the isoelectric point...|$|E

The particles entered the riser from a fluidised bed, via a short horizontal pipe and a bend of radius 75 mm. Measured variables included solids flow rates, air flow rates, inlet and outlet air pressures P 1 and P 2, and the pressure profile in the riser. The solids flow rate was consistent with some earlier models of similar systems, in which the plugs of packed solids move up at a velocity of about U-U mf, where U=superficial air velocity and U mf=incipient fluidising velocity. Solids-wall friction is significant and suppresses fluidisation. To model the system approximately, a conveying efficiency=(power for air compression) /(rate of gain of potential energy of solids) is defined and correlated against solids flux. It {{was found that the}} conveying efficiency tended to an asymptote just above 20 %. The correlation led to a tentative design formula, Eq. (6), for predicting P 1 -P 2 at a given solids flow rate.

In the present work, {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation and experimental methods were employed to study suspension of high density particles (nickel) at high solids concentration in water. The work first focused on establishing the velocity field in a liquid-only system and then progressed to a solid-liquid system. In the liquid-only system, the influence of tank geometry and simulation strategies, including turbulence models, on fluid flow pattern and mixing was investigated in a tank stirred by a Rushton turbine. The standard k-f. model gave better overall predictions of mean velocity fields than the k-ro and RNG k-f. models. The CFD simulation and experimental results obtained with the laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) method showed that mixing time and homogenization energy decreased with {{a decrease in the}} impeller bottom clearance. It was further shown that there is a bottom clearance range in which a draft tube can aid mixing in a tank stirred by the Rushton turbine. In the solid-liquid system, a hydrofoil impeller was used to investigate the influence of simulation strategies, particle properties and hydrodynamic operating conditions on mixing features such as the off-bottom <b>solids</b> suspension, cloud <b>height,</b> <b>solids</b> concentration distribution and local particle size distribution. The simulation results were compared with experimental ones, in which the off-bottom solids suspension was determined visually and an optical attenuation technique was employed to determine the cloud <b>height</b> and <b>solids</b> concentration distribution.

A better agreement between the simulation and experimental results was obtained with drag models that account for the solids loading or free stream turbulence than those that do not.

A CFD simulation strategy for studying mixing of high density solids is proposed and it is shown that a CFD simulation method can be used to develop empirical models that predict mixing features.

The model {{is based on}} Kynch theory (Kynch, 1952), i. e. it describes systems with solids fractions sufficiently low that the solids have not gelled into a weight-bearing network. However the model incorporates a modification to describe how raking the suspension causes flocs or aggregates within it to densify. This floc densification opens up channels between the flocs through which liquid escapes, making the suspension easier to dewater. The densification theory presented here predicts profiles of varying <b>solids</b> fraction vs <b>height</b> in the settling zone in a thickener, information which is not normally available when designing thickeners via the conventional Kynch theory. Performance enhancements for thickeners due to raking can be readily determined, either in terms of increased underflow solids fraction or increased solids flux.

Experiments with the natural coal system have also demonstrated that the separation effectiveness of the cascade could be improved by a multi-pass process in which the products and rejects were reprocessed in subsequent passes in the cascade.;The present work should be viewed as a first attempt to investigate the performance of the cascade in the separation of flotsam-rich solids systems. Continuation of the present experimental program as well as further theoretical development is recommended for a more thorough understanding of the cascade...|$|R
