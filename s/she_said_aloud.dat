6000|$|... "He has not heard," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> in an expressionless voice, and, turning, {{would have}} slipped away without another word.|$|E
6000|$|... "That little {{poisonous}} Indian viper," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> attributing Aaron's mood to the doctor. Her {{husband was}} noisily bolting the door.|$|E
6000|$|How really beautifully {{this room}} is done,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b> 'This hard plaited matting--what a lovely colour it is, the colour of cool light!' ...|$|E
60|$|MY mother's lips moved, {{as if she}} {{answered}} 'Yes, my dear Edward,' but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>aloud.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true, I'll be married, because I ought--I must," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud.</b> [...] "Because I can't help myself. I {{ought to}} want to--for dad's sake.... But I don't--I don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|Trot wakened {{just as the}} sun rose, and {{slipping}} out of the blankets, went {{to the edge of}} the Great Orchard and looked across the plain. Something glittered in the far distance. [...] "That looks like another city," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> half <b>aloud.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think you}} ought to read,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> to her husband. 'But the doctor'll be here soon, and I'll ask 'im then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, my Winkie!' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> {{and that}} was {{something}} she had picked up from Dan. 'I b'lieve I've tickled up a Gleason cow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> {{laughing}} to herself. [...] "I am {{not your}} master, and you rebel. Nevertheless, I'll conquer you, my fine brute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>aloud</b> in her earnestness, [...] "I {{believe that}} that is what Miss Panney meant. She has spoken so well of him to me; she has heard about that girl, and <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> yes, <b>she</b> certainly did say, 'It shall be done.' She wants it, I truly believe; she wants me to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this news}} the Jewess Sumi turned pale, but {{glancing at the}} Book of Spells her face brightened, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> half <b>aloud,</b> 'There is no cause for disquiet; they will capture the dervish,' while Hassan lamented loudly {{that as soon as}} fortune {{appeared}} on one side she fled on the other! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> it <b>aloud,</b> {{but added}} to herself, as she resumed her knitting: [...] "Hah! Good day, age about forty, height {{about five feet}} nine, black hair, {{generally}} rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression! Good day, one and all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{how exactly}} like an egg he is!' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> {{standing}} {{with her hands}} ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am well rid of Masilo," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> in {{the hearing}} of Galazi, [...] "but I had been better pleased to see him dead before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b> 'To get {{him here}} without letting {{him know that}} I have any other object than that of getting a useful man--that's the difficulty--and that I think I can master.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{does the}} man remind me of?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>aloud,</b> but to herself. [...] "Allemachter! {{his face is}} the face of that English lord who visited us with the lawyer more than fifty years ago. Yes, his face {{is the face of}} Ralph's cousin. Girl," [...] she added, turning on me fiercely, [...] "tell me that man's name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> resignedly, half <b>aloud,</b> [...] "we {{must try}} {{to make him feel}} that he isn't a third in our party," [...] and turned the corner that looked over Friars Pardon, giddy, sick, and faint.|$|R
6000|$|... "There he is," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> quite <b>aloud,</b> so {{that the}} whole room should hear. [...] "He's a bill-sticker!" [...] and she pointed the finger of scorn at her sister's lover.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do look nice," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> with {{a little}} curtsey to the radiant reflection. [...] "It is all the dress, I know. I feel like a queen in it--no, like a girl again--and that's better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't go, anyway," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> [...] "for the gig is broken;" [...] and, {{her brother}} {{coming in at}} that moment, she {{informed}} him, {{with an air of}} much relief, how the matter had settled itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're such {{children}} for the water, mine are," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> without reflecting {{that there was no}} one to hear her; [...] "they'll be brought in dead and drownded some day. I wish that river was far enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it is one}} of them," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to herself, [...] "he {{ought to}} know it instantly! And even if it isn't, he ought to know. They will be in a terrible state; {{somebody}} should be here, and Herbert has gone to the mountains. There is no one else." [...] She now began to walk more rapidly. [...] "Yes," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> speaking <b>aloud</b> in the intensity of her emotion, [...] "he ought to come, anyway. I can't be left here to take any chances. And if he does not know immediately, he cannot get here today." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>said</b> this <b>aloud,</b> thus {{breaking}} {{in on her}} own thoughts and his. A feeling of restlessness seized her now. She was cold, too, for the April breeze was biting and had searched {{out the back of}} her neck underneath the sable stole and caused her to shiver in the spring sunshine.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>aloud,</b> and smiling, [...] "there {{is nothing}} terrible {{in this piece}} of crape, except that it hides a face which I am always glad to look upon. Come, good sir, let the sun shine from behind the cloud. First lay aside your black veil: then {{tell me why you}} put it on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The dear, big, irritating goose!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b> [...] "There {{never was}} such a lovable idiot before. He's just like the {{alligator}} in the old rhyme, who wouldn't go along, and wouldn't keep still, but just kept bobbing up and down." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{meantime}} Mrs Chick sat swelling and bridling, and tossing her head, {{as if she}} were still repeating that solemn formula of farewell to Lucretia Tox. At length, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> 'Oh the extent to which her eyes had been opened that day!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{mother said}} to herself, [...] "He'd get to see him sooner or later." [...] She drew her breath in a long sigh, {{and went into the}} cabin. [...] "What a day, what a day! It seems a {{thousand}} years," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you are a}} {{man after}} all," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{laughing}} <b>aloud.</b> [...] "Now, man--my man--who, if we live through this, shall be my husband if you will--yes, my husband, for I'll pay, and be proud of it--listen to my commands. See you, I am Moses, and yonder in the Abbey sits Pharaoh with a hardened heart, {{and you are the}} angel--the destroying angel with the sword of the plagues of Egypt. To-night there will be fire in the Abbey--such fire as fell on Cranwell Towers. Nay, nay, I know; the church will not burn, nor all the great stone halls. But the dormitories, and the storehouses, and the hayricks, and the cattle-byres, they'll flame bravely after this time of drought, and if the wains are ashes, how will they draw in their harvest? Will you do it, my man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One thing's {{about as}} good as another, and one's got to do something," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> expressing what he {{supposed}} to be her attitude, much in her accent. Perhaps she detected the imitation, for looking gently at him, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with ironical composure: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{just the}} face he would have loved," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>aloud,</b> yet {{speaking}} to herself. [...] "Yes, it {{is the face of}} which he used to dream and talk--pale and sad, but very fair: and though I used to bid him mind his work, and bring down his heart to love some poor honest labouring girl, I did not the less often think over his strange fancies. And Jacques told you that he loved you, did he, Mademoiselle? I wonder at that--I wonder at that; it would have been more like himself to have carried his love a secret to the grave." ...|$|R
6000|$|She eyed it wistfully, {{grasping}} its virtues at {{a glance}} and thrilling again at the unaccountable sensations it aroused. [...] "It must be very warm in time of frost," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> though {{she felt that she}} must make strange sounds with her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not unconscious," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> {{and quite}} calmly, [...] "and was quite aware just {{now that you}} laid rough hands on a {{helpless}} woman. Since I am equally helpless and in your power I pray you to command what I must do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look as if}} you didn't {{like the}} {{prospect}} very well," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> for Mac had rammed the volume of Shelley {{into his pocket and}} the glorified expression was so entirely gone, Rose fancied she had been mistaken about the mountaintop behind the mists.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I know,’ <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> sobbing <b>aloud,</b> ‘that what I {{say to you}} now, {{seems like}} the ravings of fever. I have been told so before, less kindly than by you. I am not a young woman; and they do say, that as life steals on towards its final close, the last short remnant, {{worthless}} {{as it may seem}} to all beside, is dearer to its possessor than all the years that have gone before, connected though they be with the recollection of old friends long since dead, and young ones—children perhaps—who have fallen off from, and forgotten one as completely as if they had died too. My natural term of life cannot be many years longer, and should be dear on that account; but I would lay it down without a sigh—with cheerfulness—with joy—if what I tell you now, were only false, or imaginary. To-morrow morning he of whom I speak will be, I know, though I would fain think otherwise, beyond the reach of human aid; and yet, to-night, though he is in deadly peril, you must not see, and could not serve, him.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now you've chewed {{something}} thirty-seven times, I suppose?" [...] <b>she</b> thought, but <b>said</b> politely <b>aloud,</b> [...] "Are {{your legs}} troubling you to-day, Mr. Pepper?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{quite a while}} Rezu went on staring. Then he <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> {{as if he were}} {{thinking}} to himself.|$|R
