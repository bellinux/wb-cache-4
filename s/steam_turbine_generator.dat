5|$|The nominal 250 MW solar {{electric}} generating facility generates steam {{in solar}} steam generators, which will expand through a <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> to produce electrical power from twin, independently operable solar fields, each feeding a 125 MW power island. The plant should generate 617,000 MWh of power annually, enough power {{for more than}} 88,000 households and will prevent the emission of over 430 kilotons of CO2 a year.

25|$|This small shaft deflection, only {{detectable}} by eccentricity meters, {{would be}} enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> unit when it is restarted. The shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed (about one percent rated speed) by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop.|$|E
25|$|The steam turbine-driven {{generators}} have {{auxiliary systems}} {{enabling them to}} work satisfactorily and safely. The <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator,</b> being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also {{has to be kept}} in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft has a number of bearings. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like Babbitt metal. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated.|$|E
2500|$|An {{auxiliary}} {{oil system}} pump {{is used to}} supply oil at the start-up of the <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator.</b> It supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine's main inlet steam stop valve, [...] the governing control valves, the bearing and seal oil systems, the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|Westinghouse upper {{management}} apparently had its main {{focus on the}} Fuel Use Act, and {{saw it as a}} death sentence to the long-term future of gas turbines.

2500|$|The {{electrical}} power industry had high productivity growth. [...] Many large central power stations, equipped with high pressure boilers and <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generators</b> began being built after 1913.

Although the converting machines are frequently called 'rotary converters' or 'rotary frequency converters', they are not the rotary converter used frequently by subways to convert low-frequency alternating current to DC power. The converters used are more precisely described as motor generators and consist of two synchronous AC machines on a common shaft with different ratios of poles; they are not electrically connected as in a true rotary converter.|$|R

The data-driven nature of the algorithms allows for machine specific characteristics of individual turbines to be learned and reasoned about. The paper provides a case study illustrating the routine alarm paradigm and the applicability of systems using such techniques...|$|R
