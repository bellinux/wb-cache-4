5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E

50|$|The rise of {{telemarketing}} can {{be traced}} back to the 19th century telephonists, or <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators.</b> Trans-cultural hiring of <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> (mostly women) became especially popular in North America throughout the 20th century, partially due to popularity gained through advertising. After the shift from public switched telephone network to computer-based electronic switching system, the job of <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> gradually diminished. However, with the rise of advertising and with the popularity of the telephone use, new jobs, including telemarketing jobs, were created.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, {{companies}} used manual telephone <b>switchboards,</b> and <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> connected calls by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate jacks.|$|R

25|$|Telephone {{numbers were}} first used in 1879 in Lowell, Massachusetts, when they {{replaced}} {{the request for}} subscriber names by callers connecting to the <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator.</b> Over the course of telephone history, telephone numbers had various lengths and formats, and even included most {{letters of the alphabet}} in leading positions when telephone exchange names were in common use until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The second ransom drop was successful. On December 20, Krist {{called and}} gave to a <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> of the FBI vague {{directions}} to Mackle's burial place. The FBI {{set up their}} base in Lawrenceville, Gwinnett’s county seat, and more than 100 agents spread out through the area {{in an attempt to}} find her, digging the ground with their hands and anything they could find to use. Mackle was rescued dehydrated but otherwise unharmed. She had spent more than three days underground.|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of rotating shifts and permanent night shifts {{gives rise to}} a large number of problems that have harmful effects on the physical, psychological, and social well-being of the worker. In this thesis I examine the impact of shift work on 23 hospital female <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> and 23 male porters in two different hospitals. Each of the 46 respondents in the study were interviewed in depth and diaries were kept by 30 of them. In addition I observed the work routines of the respondents. Three theoretical models have been chosen to describe the negative consequences of shift work; the Circadian, Psychological, and Sociological models. Among the different models the Sociological model appeared to be the most informative in interpreting the job effects on individuals. The findings revealed that the occupation of switchboard operating is much more stressful than the occupation of portering. The effects of shiftwork added to the job demands of <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> increases their already stressful occupational demands. Some reasons for this are that family responsibilities weigh heavily on most female <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators,</b> and these responsibilities increase during certain stages of the life cycle. Male porters do not face the same degree of stress in their jobs, nor are they as likely to deal with conflicting demands of the family to the same degree as female <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators.</b> Indeed many of the porters preferred shift work despite stressful levels that may occur. Quite surprising in the research findings was the discovery of the ability of those respondents experiencing stress to cope with these condition...|$|R
25|$|Insull {{was born}} on November 11, 1859, in London, the son of Samuel Insull, a {{tradesman}} and lay preacher who {{was active in the}} Temperance movement, and Emma Short. He had a brother, Martin Insull. His career began as an apprentice clerk for various local businesses at age 14. He {{went on to become a}} stenographer at Vanity Fair. Through a newspaper ad, the 19-year-old became the <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> for the London office of Edison's telephone companies. When he learned of a job with Edison in the US, Insull indicated he would be glad to have it, provided it was as Thomas Edison's personal secretary.|$|E
25|$|The {{class of}} 1951 {{subsequently}} returned the statue to the college, where she remained for over 20 years, until students staged a high-profile heist in 1977. In June 1977 the statue {{was displayed at}} the 25th reunion {{of the class of}} 1952 in order to raise donations for the college. The class required that the statue be placed on display, however, so she was mounted behind plexiglass in Converse Hall. In the early hours of October 13, three masked students entered the hall, tied up the <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator,</b> and pried the statue loose. At the last minute the students enlisted Prince Albert Grimaldi (then a student at the college) so they could claim diplomatic immunity if necessary. They were apprehended less than a month later, when campus police, having learned of their plan to fly the statue over a football game, staked out the local airports.|$|E
25|$|When the Second World War broke out, Lee {{volunteered to}} fight for the Finnish forces during the Winter War in 1939. He and other British volunteers were kept away from actual fighting, but they were issued winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe {{distance}} from the front lines. After a fortnight, they returned home. Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator.</b> When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard. In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force.|$|E

2500|$|When {{telephone}} numbers were first used {{they were very}} short, from one to three digits, and were communicated orally to a <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> when initiating a call. As telephone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass worldwide communication, {{telephone numbers}} have become longer. In addition to telephones, they {{have been used to}} access other devices, such as computer modems, pagers, and fax machines. [...] With landlines, modems and pagers falling out of use in favor of all-digital always-connected broadband Internet and mobile phones, telephone numbers are now often used by data-only cellular devices, such as some tablet computers, digital televisions, video game controllers, and mobile hotspots, on which it is not even possible to make or accept a call.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1926, Underwood {{began her}} job as the <b>switchboard</b> <b>operator</b> at the Los Angeles Record. It was at the Record that Underwood learned the {{newspaper}} business from the ground up. [...] She was a quick study and worked hard at any task to which she was assigned. She assisted Gertrude Price, who wrote a woman's column under the pseudonym of Cynthia Grey, in the Christmas basket program for the poor. Price recognized Underwood's innate talent and became Underwood's mentor. In December 1927 William Edward Hickman kidnapped, murdered, and then butchered twelve-year-old Marion Parker. [...] Hickman was on the run when Underwood saw the United Press flash {{that he had been}} captured in Oregon. Underwood telephoned her husband with the news. Price overheard the call and reprimanded Underwood for talking about a story outside of the newsroom before it was in print. [...] Underwood never made that mistake again.|$|E
5000|$|Each pair of plugs {{was part}} of a cord circuit with a switch {{associated}} that let the operator participate in the call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required a generator on the phone to be cranked by hand). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer Direct Dial (DDD) calling, <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> would work with their counterparts in the distant central office to complete long distance calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the calling party without additional human intervention. <b>Switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> are typically required to have very strong communication skills.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, the Bell System {{developed}} the North American Numbering Plan, {{a system of}} initially 86 allocated area codes which were used at first only by <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> to route trunk calls between plan areas. Direct long-distance dialing by customers, using the three-digit area code and a seven-digit telephone number, commenced in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The Hello Girls was a British comedy-drama (not to {{be mistaken}} for a sitcom) which {{originally}} aired on BBC One for two series from 5 September 1996 to 13 August 1998.

2500|$|In 1944, Pitts tackled Broadway, {{making her}} {{debut in the}} mystery, Ramshackle Inn. The play, written {{expressly}} for her, did well, and she took the {{show on the road}} in later years. Post-war films continued to give Pitts the chance to play comic snoops and flighty relatives in such fare as Life with Father (1947), but in the 1950s she started focusing on television. This culminated in her best known series role, playing second banana to Gale Storm on CBS's The Gale Storm Show (1956) (also known as Oh, Susannah) in the role of Elvira Nugent ("Nugie"), the shipboard beautician. In 1961, Pitts was cast opposite Earle Hodgins in the episode [...] "Lonesome's Gal" [...] on the ABC sitcom, Guestward, Ho!, set on a dude ranch in New Mexico. In 1962, Pitts appeared in an episode of CBS's Perry Mason, [...] "The Case of the Absent Artist".

2500|$|In 1954 a man {{threw his}} {{mistress}} into the well. Police {{wanted to prove}} that he killed her so the divers were dispatched to find the body, but they failed. Still, her body resurfaced ten days later. This story served as an inspiration for Dušan Makavejev when he wrote and directed the movie Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing <b>Switchboard</b> <b>Operator</b> in 1967. In 1964 Alfred Hitchcock visited the well and praised the [...] "ambience". In 1967/68, new exploration of the object was conducted. The divers discovered that the bottom is full of sludge and retrieved a number of skeletons, several animal ones and two human. The Roman Well served as an inspiration for another , which was nominated by Serbia for an Oscar in 2002.

25|$|Automatic exchanges, or dial service, {{came into}} {{existence}} in the early 20th century. Their purpose was to {{eliminate the need for}} human <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> who completed the connections required for a telephone call.

50|$|A {{telephone}} switchboard is a telecommunications system {{used in the}} {{public switched telephone network}} or in enterprises to interconnect circuits of telephones to establish telephone calls between the subscribers or users, or between other exchanges. The switchboard was an essential component of a manual telephone exchange, and was operated by <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> who used electrical cords or switches to establish the connections.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was {{inspired}} by the idea of manufacturing automatic telephone exchanges that would not require <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators.</b> He founded the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the automatic telephone exchange. Subsequently, in 1901, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.|$|R
