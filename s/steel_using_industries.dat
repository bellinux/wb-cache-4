40|$|Dr. Helen Elizabeth RyanThis {{work has}} {{assessed}} {{the durability of}} a series of polyurethane polymer coatings for <b>use</b> on <b>steel.</b> <b>Using</b> standard <b>industry</b> techniques, a variety of polyurethane polymers were prepared which were subsequently subjected to different weathering exposure environments. The performance of these polyurethane coatings were then assessed using a range of methods including standard industry tests and advanced spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. This analysis highlighted the specific polymers that possessed the greatest durability after exposure in harsh weathering environments. In order to gain more insight into the different durability performance of these polyurethane polymers, theoretical DFT calculations were utilised to help identify sites within the polymer matrix that may be susceptible to free-radical degradation processes that may occur during oxidative stress. The DFT calculations identified that the thermodynamic product was not always kinetically favoured. As such, further calculations investigated possible intermolecular vs. intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer processes; identifying that intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer was more energetically favoured. The Radical Trapping technique was utilized as an independent method of determining sites within the polymer matrix that are susceptible to free radical oxidative attack. Model substrates designed to reflect key linkages within the polyurethanes of interest, were combined with tert-butoxyl radicals {{in the presence of the}} stable nitroxide TMIO. The product mixture was analysed by HPLC, which revealed that several nitroxide trapped products were generated. These adducts were isolated and characterised by standard spectroscopic techniques. The results from this trapping experiment were in good agreement with the DFT calculations, thus verifying our theoretical approach for determining potential sites of degradation.

P 233 A twinning-induced {{plasticity}} (TWIP) steel {{strengthened by}} elegant arrays of laminated nanotwins was manufactured {{by a simple}} thermomechanical treatment consisting of cold rolling and recovery annealing. Different to other lab-scale methods making nano-structured materials, the present simple thermomechnical treatment is suitable for large-scale production in the <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> <b>using</b> existing facilities, which makes the present steel being an attractive structure material. The steel achieved a high yield strength (1450 MPa), high ultimate tensile strength (1600 MPa) and considerable uniform tensile elongation (20 %). During the recovery annealing, the nanotwins are thermally stable so that they remain in the sample after recovery annealing. On the contrary, the dislocation density was reduced greatly after recovery annealing. The deformation mechanism of the present nanotwinned steel is investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, nanoindentation and electrical resistivity, illustrating that the dislocation density increases dramatically with strain while the volume fraction of nanotwins remains constant. Therefore, the work hardening behaviour of the nanotwinned steel is mainly provided by the accumulation of dislocations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Although risk {{assessment}} and accident prevention program {{have been widely}} <b>used</b> in <b>industries</b> such as steel industry, there are still numerous accidents in these industries. Hence, applying an accident analysis method can identify the root causes and casual factors of accidents and causal factors. Human Factors Analysis and Classification System can identify human errors in the <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> by <b>using</b> an analysis of past events. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the human errors in the <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> <b>using</b> the HFACS methodology.. Material and Method: In this study first, incident reports of industries with high risk, such as Ahvaz steel and pipe industries existing in the department of work and social security was gathered. Then, an analysis of accident was done based on HFACS model. This model has 4 levels and 18 categories which are 1 - unsafe acts of operators (that includes four subtypes) 2 - pre-conditions for unsafe acts (with seven categories) 3 - unsafe supervision (includes four categories) and 4 - the effect of association (with three categories).. Result: In this study, 158 reports of accident in Ahvaz steel industry were analyzed by HFACS technique. This analysis showed that most of the human errors were: in the first level was related to the skill-based errors, in the second to the physical environment, in the third level to the inadequate supervision and in the fourth level to the management of resources.. Conclusion: Studying and analyzing of past events using the HFACS technique can identify the major and root causes of accidents and can be effective on prevent repetitions of such mishaps. Also, it can be used as a basis for developing strategies to prevent future events in steel industries...|$|R

Given the limited research on effective energy conservation in China's industrial sectors, this paper analyzes the total factor energy efficiency and the corresponding energy conservation potential of China's iron and <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> <b>using</b> the excessive energy-input stochastic frontier model. The results show that there was an increasing trend in energy efficiency between 2005 and 2011 with an average energy efficiency of 0. 699 and a cumulative energy conservation potential of 723. 44 million tons of coal equivalent (Mtce). We further analyze the regional differences in energy efficiency and find that energy efficiency of Northeastern China is high while that of Central and Western China is low. Therefore, there is a concentration of energy conservation potential for the {{iron and steel}} industry in the Central and Western areas. In addition, we discover that inefficient factors are important for improving energy conservation. We find that the structural defect in the economic system is an important impediment to energy efficiency and economic restructuring is the key to improving energy efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
