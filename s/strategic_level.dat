After several days of constant fighting for the town of Radzymin and its immediate vicinity, the Russian attack was repelled and the Poles were able to mount a successful counteroffensive, forcing the Russian armies out of Poland and in the end destroying them completely.|$|E
5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians in recent decades. The reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his abilities as operational and <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> commander, and his role (if any) in the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and <b>strategic</b> <b>level.</b> A more recent debate concerns the integration of design thinking into strategic management as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.|$|E

5|$|The {{program began}} in 1984 as the Advanced Operational Studies Fellowship (AOSF) by {{diverting}} lieutenant colonel War College selectees to Fort Leavenworth for an equivalent education program. The AOSF program had students completing the AMSP coursework, and then {{serving as the}} principal instructors of AMSP during their second year. In 1995, {{the name of the}} program was changed to the Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship (AOASF), and in the early 21st century its curriculum was more closely aligned to the <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> of war. In 2013, the program was again modified in part to bring it more in alignment with TRADOC policies, and to prepare it for Joint Professional Education II accreditation. It was at that time renamed the Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program (ASLSP).|$|E
5|$|At the <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> {{the general}} {{uprising}} never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical disaster for the communists. Regardless, the offensive {{was a turning point}} in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions of imminent victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory. In its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> Marlborough had a rare {{grasp of the}} broad issues involved, and was able {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the {{conflict}} in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies did come close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of Isle de France, although {{prompted by the}} defeat at Grand Port, had been the ultimate intention of Rowley's squadron since its creation in 1809 and had been planned carefully both on a <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> by Bertie at Cape Town and Lord Minto at Madras and on a tactical level by Rowley and his British Army counterpart Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Keating on Rodriguez. The transport ships and soldiers would come from the Indian garrisons at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta, to be led by General John Abercromby (although they were also accompanied by Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury, whom Bertie ordered to return to Madras before the invasion) while the naval forces to protect and support the invasion force were to be provided by Bertie from the Cape of Good Hope. These forces were to gather at Rodriguez {{in preparation for the}} invasion. The landings themselves were planned by Rowley and Keating, who relied on Willoughby's intimate knowledge of the coastline of Isle de France and a series of careful surveys of the reefs that surrounded the island to select a landing site.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> the ARVN and the South Vietnamese {{government}} had both rallied after {{appearing on the}} verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> {{the general}} {{uprising}} never eventuated, and in late-February the communist offensive collapsed after suffering more than 45,000 killed, against South Vietnamese and allied losses of 6,000 men. Regardless, {{it proved to}} be {{a turning point in the}} war and although it had been a tactical disaster for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory as confidence in the American military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in the United States. Prior to Tet, American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that General William Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the offensive, and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched, had shocked the American public and contradicted such predictions of imminent victory; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would no longer seek a second term in office. Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel.|$|E

25|$|South Africa {{fought a}} long and bitter {{counter-insurgency}} conflict in South West Africa from 1966 to 1989, the date on which that territory began to exercise its independence. On a <b>strategic</b> <b>level,</b> the South African government was at a unique disadvantage: its continued rule over South West Africa, {{under the auspices of}} a defunct League of Nations mandate granted shortly after World War I, was regarded both internally and internationally as an illegal, pseudo-colonial occupation. South Africa also drew criticism for imposing its policy of racial apartheid on its mandate, which provoked dissent and helped gave rise to an insurgency by the Marxist South West African People's Organization. SWAPO demanded that all South African military and paramilitary units be withdrawn and replaced via a multinational United Nations effort to oversee elections. It also insisted on the relinquishment of Walvis Bay, an enclave then regarded {{as an integral part of}} South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Locally, {{mopping up}} {{operations}} around Cape Gloucester continued throughout early 1944, although by February 1944 US planners began preparing {{to expand their}} lodgement further east. In early March 1944, the Americans launched an operation to capture Talasea, on the northern coast of New Britain, as part of actions to follow up Japanese troops who were beginning a general withdrawal towards Cape Hoskins and Rabaul. The 1st Marine Division was relieved around Cape Gloucester on 23 April 1944, and were replaced by the 40th Infantry Division. After this, a period of relative quiet followed on New Britain as the US confined their operations largely to {{the western end of}} the island, having decided at a <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> to bypass Rabaul, while the Japanese stayed close to their base around Rabaul {{at the opposite end of}} the island. Later, responsibility for operations on New Britain transferred from US forces to the Australians. In November 1944, they landed at Jacquinot Bay before beginning a limited offensive aimed at securing Wide Bay and Open Bay and confining the larger Japanese force to the Gazelle Peninsula, where they remained until the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>strategic</b> <b>level,</b> the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the South Vietnamese {{government}} had both rallied after appearing close to collapse, {{and the threat}} to Saigon subsided by late 1965. Yet further troop increases were required if General William Westmoreland, Commander US MACV, was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US forces planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December. The Australian government increased its own commitment on 8 March 1966, announcing that 1 RAR would be replaced {{at the end of}} its tour by a two-battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineers and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal Australian Navy elements would also be deployed, with total Australian strength in Vietnam planned to rise to 6,300. Meanwhile, 1 RAR's attachment to US forces had highlighted the differences between Australian and American operational methods. The Americans relied on massed firepower and mobility in big-unit search and destroy operations as part of a war of attrition which often resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Whereas the Australians—although not eschewing conventional operations—emphasised deliberate patrolling using dispersed companies supported by artillery, APCs and helicopters to separate the Viet Cong from the population in the villages, while slowly extending government control. Consequently, 1 ATF would be allocated its own Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR) in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing them to pursue operations more independently using their own methods.|$|E
