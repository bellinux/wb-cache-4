5|$|The 2009 {{version was}} {{released}} for sale September 9, 2008. Symantec set several goals for version 2009 while in development: complete installations under {{minute and a}} footprint of 100 MB. Average installation times range from eight to ten minutes, and the previous 2008 version had a 400 MB footprint. Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20–30 seconds to 10 seconds, and file scanning times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files.

2500|$|The term {{hardware}} in {{open source}} hardware has been historically used {{in opposition to}} the term software of open source software. That is, to refer to the electronic hardware on which the <b>software</b> <b>runs</b> (see previous section). However, as more and more non-electronic hardware products are made open source (for example , [...] or [...] ), this term tends to be used back in its broader sense of [...] "physical product." [...] Indeed, the field of open source hardware has been shown to go beyond electronic hardware and to cover a larger range of product categories such as machine tools, vehicles and medical equipment. In that sense, hardware refers to any form of tangible product, may it be electronic hardware, mechanical hardware, textile or even construction hardware. The Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Definition 1.0 defines hardware as [...] "tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things." ...|$|E
2500|$|The default IEEE 754 {{exception}} handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, in 1996 the maiden {{flight of the}} Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion {{due in part to}} the Ada programming language {{exception handling}} policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow. In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct. According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5. The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that [...] "An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same <b>software</b> <b>runs</b> in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment." ...|$|E
