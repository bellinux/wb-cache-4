5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.

Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography. At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> from semi-leptonic decay of heavy flavor in p + p collisions at √ s= 200 GeV {{has been carried}} out with the PHENIX detector in the RHIC Year- 2005 and Year- 2006 run. Measured <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> include contribution from both charm and bottom. This measurement provides a good test of the perturbative QCD. The separate {{measurement of}} pT distribution about <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> from bottom is important for a precise test of not only perturbative QCD but also fragmentation process. The measurement of heavy flavor in p + p collisions also provides an important base line to interpret the measurement of heavy flavor in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, since heavy flavor is only produced in the initial collisions. A strong suppression of the <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> from heavy flavor at high pT has been observed in central Au+Au collisions compared with p+p collisions. The suppression indicates charm quarks lose a large fraction of their energy in the hot and dense medium, since the magnitude of energy loss of bottom in the medium is expected to be much smaller than that of charm due to the large difference of their masses. The contribution from bottom in the <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> from heavy flavor must be determined for the discussion of the energy loss of bottom...|$|R
5|$|Silver {{is similar}} in its {{physical}} and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table, copper and gold. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4d105s1, similarly to copper (3d104s1) and gold (4f145d106s1); group 11 {{is one of the few}} groups in the d-block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations. This distinctive electron configuration, with a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolNa (from Latin natrium) and atomic number11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, {{because it has}} a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na+ cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.|$|E

Both the pressure dependence and magnitude of the single-electron response are in agreement with previous measurements of electroluminescence yield in xenon.

40|$|It {{was found}} that at {{cryogenic}} temperatures the spontaneous emission of <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> from cathode of PMT is increased by lowering the temperature of PMT. This effect has not found yet a satisfactory explanation. It was suggested by us {{that the source of}} cryogenic dark current is a conversion of hidden photons on a metallic surface. To check this hypothesis a series of measurements have been performed using a multicathode counter developed by us as a detector of <b>single</b> <b>electrons.</b> Upon the results of measurements during 78 days in configurations R 1 and R 2 of a multicathode counter with a copper cathode the dependence of the counting rate of <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> on temperature has been obtained.

An atom of any other element ionized down to a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schrödinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for the energy. They can be obtained analytically, meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see hydrogen atom).|$|E

50|$|In a superconductor, {{the basic}} charge {{carriers}} are pairs of electrons (known as Cooper pairs), {{rather than the}} <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> in a normal conductor. The total spin of a Cooper pair is an integer number, thus the Cooper pairs are bosons (while the <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> in the normal conductor are fermions). Cooled bosons, contrary to cooled fermions, are allowed to occupy a single quantum energy level, in an effect known as the Bose-Einstein condensate. In a classical interpretation it would correspond to multiple particles occupying the same position in space and having an equal momentum, effectively behaving as a single particle.|$|R

25|$|Mainly, {{this is an}} {{attribute}} of metals, meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an element the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the alkali metals are most electropositive of all. This is {{because they have a}} <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low ionization energies.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, Robert Andrews Millikan began {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to determine the electric charge carried by a <b>single</b> <b>electron.</b> He began by measuring the course of charged water droplets in an electrical field. The results suggested that the charge on the droplets is a multiple of the elementary electric charge, but the experiment was not accurate enough to be convincing. He obtained more precise results in 1910 with his famous oil-drop experiment in which he replaced water (which tended to evaporate too quickly) with oil.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1908, while a {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, Millikan worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a <b>single</b> <b>electron.</b> J. J. Thomson had already discovered the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. However, the actual charge and mass values were unknown. Therefore, if one of these two values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated. Millikan and his then graduate student Harvey Fletcher used the oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron (as well as the electron mass, and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known).|$|E

25|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein solved this {{apparent}} paradox by describing light as composed of discrete quanta, now called photons, rather than continuous waves.

A photon above a threshold frequency has the required energy to eject a <b>single</b> <b>electron,</b> creating the observed effect. This discovery led to the quantum revolution in physics and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. By wave-particle duality the effect can be analyzed purely in terms of waves though not as conveniently.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the source}} of an EPR {{spectrum}} {{is a change in}} an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra for a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> spin would consist of one line. However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constant of a nucleus {{is directly related to the}} spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{elementary}} charge {{is one of}} the fundamental physical constants, and accurate knowledge of its value is of great importance. His experiment measured the force on tiny charged droplets of oil suspended against gravity between two metal electrodes. Knowing the electric field, the charge on the droplet could be determined.
