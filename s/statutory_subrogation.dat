40|$|A third person, {{who pays}} off a creditor, acquires the paid-off claim {{up to the}} amount of the given payment (art. 518 § 1 of the civil code). It is the case of a <b>statutory</b> <b>subrogation</b> which covers a wide range of various situations. It is aimed to {{strengthen}} a position of the person paying off a creditor. At the outset the author analyses a question of separating the <b>statutory</b> <b>subrogation</b> from allied institutions. He is advocating for a position according to which we are dealing here with a recourse claim (in a wide sense). The <b>statutory</b> <b>subrogation</b> is therefore a specific type of claim. Next, particular instances of the <b>statutory</b> <b>subrogation</b> are analyzed by the author. His remarks are started with a discussion of a guarantors claim who satisfied a creditor. He represents the opinion that in this case the guarantor fulfils his own obligation {{and at the same time}} he pays another's debt for which he is liable personally. This position implies a solution of secondary questions related to the guarantor's recourse. If the guarantors are few, the provisions of joint and several debt are to be applied to their mutual relations in case of paying off a credit by one of them. In turn the author presents those instances where a third person is liable for a paid-off debt with certain material objects. A pledge and a real estate mortgage come into consideration. The author represents the opinion that a construction of the so called real obligation has to be adopted in this type of real securities. It implies that a pledger or an owner of mortgaged estate are real debtors bearing a limited liability to the creditor. The author also dwells on complex problems related to paying off a secured debt (in the light of the new act of 1982). A conclusion is reached that a mortgage expires when a creditor is redeemed by the owner of the estate. Next questions deal with paying off a claim which has a priority in settlement. Its practical effect is presently unimportant. A case of paying off a creditor by a third person with the consent of a debtor is eased in the present laws. It is the instance of the so called conversion. The payment is in a way imposed upon a creditor who cannot refuse acceptance of a performance which is already enforceable. In the final remarks the author dwells on premises of a recourse claim of an insurance institution vs. an injurer. It is the instance of property and not of personal insurance. In the result of subrogation the legal position of a debtor cannot be deteriorated and is entitled to all defences he had against the creditorDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|Sections 433 and 561 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) {{preserve}} the circulating assets {{of a company}} or their proceeds {{for the benefit of}} priority creditors including employee creditors. A number of recent decisions have contemplated or recognised a right of equitable subrogation available to secured creditors whose security has been diminished by the application of ss 433 or 561. However, it remains unclear whether ss 433 and 561 impose trust obligations and whether a breach of a trust obligation is necessary for equitable subrogation to be available. This article argues that a <b>statutory</b> right of <b>subrogation</b> should be enshrined in legislation whereby a secured creditor may recover from the free assets of the company to the extent that his or her security has been diminished...|$|R
