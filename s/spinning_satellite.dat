50|$|In 1970, Hughes Aircraft Company (HAC) Space and Communications Group {{offered the}} first {{standardized}} satellite: the HS 333 design. A <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite,</b> {{it was based}} on previous one-design satellites like Intelsat I. HAC built eight of these 300 watt, 12 channel single antenna satellites between 1970 and 1977.|$|E
50|$|The early {{satellites}} {{were designed}} with cylindrical bodies {{to maximize the}} size of the satellite that could fit inside of the rocket's nose cone or fairing which was also round. The early design satellites also relied on spinning at about 30 rpm for stability in orbit. The <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> is a gyroscope.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{attitude}} instability experience by Explorer 1, many papers {{have been written}} on the effects if internal dissipation on {{the attitude}} stability of <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites.</b> In the engineering literature, stability analysis is restricted to the variational or linearized perturbational equations, {{despite the fact that}} <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites</b> are almost always critical cases in the Liapunov-Poincaré stability theory. This is certainly true in the case of dual <b>spin</b> <b>satellites,</b> which have the further complication that the linearized perturbational equations have periodic coefficients. The purpose of this note is to treat some problems of attitude stability of <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites</b> in a rigorous manner and to show that, with certain restrictions, the linearized stability analysis correctly predicts the attitude stability of <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{for determining the}} effect of gravity in the testing of nutation dampers on symmetric single or dual <b>spin</b> <b>satellites.</b> The basic theory is developed and then applied to the partially filled viscous ring damper and the spring-mass-dashpot damper. A comparison with test results for the viscous ring damper is also given. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of the NASA Shuttle for {{commercial}} purposes was the deployment of the SBS 3 satellite in November, 1982 from STS-5. SBS engineers designed the cradle that sat in the cargo bay of the shuttle and spun up to 50 RPM, then ejected the <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> {{with the use of}} explosive bolts.|$|E
50|$|Amongst the {{technologies}} tested on LES1 through LES4 were solid-state X-band radio equipment, low-power logic circuits, electronic despinning (using optics {{to determine the}} location of the Earth and Sun relative to a <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> at any moment, and then transmitting via whichever of several antennae were best positioned with respect to the Earth), and magnetic torquers.|$|E
50|$|The Marisat {{satellites}} were a cylindrical <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> design {{similar to}} earlier satellites like Syncom 1, Intelsat I and II, {{relying on the}} gyroscopic forces generated by rotating at approximately 30 rpm to provide stability in the Earth's gravitational field. They were originally designed to last 5 years, but survived much longer, with Marisat F2 operating successfully for 32 years.|$|E
40|$|Satellites come in {{a variety}} of sizes and {{configurations}} including <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites</b> and three-axis stabilized satellites. All of these characteristics have a significant effect on spacecraft charging considerations. There are, however, certain fundamentals which can be considered which indicate the nature and extent of the problem. The global positioning system satellite serves to illustrate certain characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hysteresis dampers are {{commonly}} used in Passive magnetic Attitude Control System (PACS). In PACS these rods produce a damping torque and reduce the satellite angular momentum and angular velocity. In this paper, a <b>spin</b> <b>satellite</b> was investigated which utilizes a passive magnetic damper consisting of magnetic hysteresis rods aligned with principal axis or <b>spin</b> axis of <b>satellite</b> and de-tumbling of the satellite, and the pure spin was achieved. An analytical model was presented to analyze hysteresis damper and a numerical simulation was performed to obtain dynamic properties of the spin attitude. In addition, assuming a dynamic imbalance, attitude behavior and damper effect on the <b>spin</b> rate of <b>satellite</b> were analyzed. The behavior of this passive magnetic stabilized satellite was simulated from the initial post separation phase...|$|R

50|$|The Intelsat VI {{satellite}} {{was designed}} as a <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> as had previous satellite designs. The main body of the spacecraft was spun at 30 revolutions per minute (rpm) to impart gyroscopic stability to the satellite in the Earth's gravitation field. A section of the spacecraft supporting the communications payload and antenna was de-spun to allow the antenna to point at the desired location on the earth.|$|E
50|$|Any <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> {{made of a}} {{conductive}} material {{will lose}} rotational momentum in Earth's magnetic field due to generation of eddy currents in its body and the corresponding braking force proportional to its spin rate. Aerodynamic friction losses can also play a part. This means that the magnetorquer {{will have to be}} continuously operated, and at a power level which is enough to counter the resistive forces present. This is not always possible within the energy constraints of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|Once in orbit, 4 wire {{segments}} of 40 metre length each were spooled {{out in a}} radial direction {{from the edge of}} the <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> disc. Also, 2 stiff rods of 4 metre length were extended in the axial direction. A sensor pod was stationed at the end of each of these, forming three orthogonal pairs. Together they could measure the electric field of the earth in all three dimensions. Stiff booms were also extended for other types of sensors and antennas.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{measurement}} {{results of the}} antenna phase patterns onboard flying <b>spin</b> <b>satellites</b> during the SELENE (KAGUYA) mission period, and shows monthly variations clearly for the first time. When an antenna is loaded on a <b>spin</b> <b>satellite,</b> due {{to the effects of}} the antenna phase patterns, periodical components with the spin frequency f(s) and higher order harmonics occur and influence Doppler measurements. Because Rstar and Vstar, two subsatellites of SELENE, have octagonal prismatic bodies, the 8 th, 16 th, and 24 th harmonics are relatively stronger than the other ones in the 2 -way and 4 -way Doppler data. These three harmonics' amplitudes over the entire mission longer than one year clearly varied with a period of 27. 32 days (one sidereal month). The antenna phase patterns were estimated using 1 - 26 th harmonics, whose rms variations were also with a period of 27. 32 days. From the 24 th harmonic and the antenna phase patterns, the spin frequency variations of Rstar and Vstar over the entire mission were estimated with an accuracy of 10 (- 5) Hz...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{adaptive control}} {{law for the}} attitude control of satellites using gyrotorquers is presented. The derivation of the control law does not require any information on the system dynamics and the environmental disturbance torques acting on the satellite. A simplified control law for <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites</b> is derived. The controller requires only attitude tracking error and its derivative for feedback. Simulation results are presented which show that, in the closed-loop system, precise attitude control can be accomplished {{in spite of the}} uncertainty in the syste...|$|R

50|$|The third US Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3) was {{launched}} on May 7, 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV; and 3) continuously search {{the sky for}} X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> with pointing capability. SAS 3 {{was the first to}} discover X-rays from a highly magnetic WD binary system, AM Her, discovered X-rays from Algol and HZ 43, and surveyed the soft X-ray background (0.1-0.28 keV).|$|E

5000|$|Short tether {{systems are}} {{commonly}} used on satellites and robotic space probes. Most notably, tethers {{are used in the}} [...] "yo-yo de-spin" [...] mechanism, often used in systems where a probe set spinning during a solid rocket injection motor firing, but needs the spin removed during flight. In this mechanism, weights on the end of long cables are deployed away from the body of the <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite.</b> When the cables are cut, much or all of the angular momentum of the spin is transferred to the discarded weights. As an example, the Dawn Mission utilized two 3 kg of weights deployed on 12 meter cables.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the phase {{patterns}} of antennas onboard flying <b>spin</b> <b>satellites</b> on the Doppler measurements is reported. Phase patterns mean that there are deviations in wave fronts from perfect sphericity, expressed {{as a function of}} the angular position around the antenna. We analyzed what effect the phase patterns of dipole and patch antennas onboard two flying <b>spin</b> <b>satellites,</b> Rstar and Vstar, used in the Japanese lunar mission, SELENE (KAGUYA), had on 2 -way and 4 -way Doppler measurements, and detected higher harmonics in the spin frequency up to an order of 26 in the Doppler frequency. We developed a low-pass filter (LPF) using a Kaiser window, with the optimal parameters empirically determined, to remove the influence of phase patterns and to precisely conserve information on the lunar gravity field. We processed the 2 -way and 4 -way Doppler data of SELENE by using LPF. After using LPF, a high degree of accuracy of about 0. 001 Hz was achieved for the 2 -way Doppler measurements, and signals that reflected the gravity field on the far side of the Moon were first detected from the 4 -way Doppler data. We also suggested a method for estimating the phase response of satellite antennas using the Doppler frequency variations. In order to estimate the Doppler frequency variation, a filtering technique was adopted to extract the harmonics of interest in the residual signal, from which the antenna phase pattern was derived...|$|R
40|$|The High Energy Solar Physics (HESP) {{spacecraft}} is {{an intermediate}} class satellite proposed by NASA to study solar high-energy phenomena {{during the next}} cycle of high solar activity in the 1998 to 2005 time frame. The HESP spacecraft is a <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> which points to the sun with stringent pointing requirements. The natural dynamics of a <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> includes an undesirable effect: nutation, {{which is due to}} the presence of disturbances and offsets of the spin axis from the angular momentum vector. The proposed Attitude Control System (ACS) attenuates nutation with reaction wheels. Precessing the spacecraft to track the sun in the north-south and east-west directions is accomplished with the use of torques from magnetic torquer bars. In this paper, the basic dynamics of a spinning spacecraft are derived, control algorithms to meet HESP science requirements are discussed and simulation results to demonstrate feasibility of the ACS concept are presented...|$|E

50|$|A yo-yo de-spin {{mechanism}} is a device {{used to reduce}} the <b>spin</b> of <b>satellites,</b> typically right after launch. It consists of two lengths of cable with weights on the ends. The cables are wrapped around the final stage and/or satellite, {{in the manner of}} a double yo-yo. When the weights are released, the spin of the rocket flings them away from the spin axis. This transfers enough angular momentum to the weights to reduce the <b>spin</b> of the <b>satellite</b> to the desired value. The weights are often released.|$|R

It is shown that observations from a <b>spinning</b> <b>satellite</b> at any given angle from nadir are sufficient to recover the auroral form...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} performed on the effects of stochastic geometry and random environmental torques on the pointing accuracy of spinning and three-axis stabilized satellites. The Euler equations for the motions of satellites yielded the stochastic principal moments and a Fokker-Planck analog simulation was employed to model the response vector of a rigid satellite. White noise inputs were obtained from a random number generator. Attention was given to both fast and slow <b>spin</b> <b>satellites.</b> Responses grew with time in all cases. The growth was initially exponential and eventually reached stable values. In comparison with other theoretical techniques, the Fokker-Planck model detailed the most responses and showed that spin-stabilization is preferable for satellites with low inertial noise levels...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} {{problematic}} {{interaction with the}} spacecraft Attitude Control System (ACS), especially for <b>spinning</b> <b>satellites</b> which can suffer resonance between slosh and nutation, or adverse changes to the rotational inertia. Because {{of these types of}} risk, in the 1960s the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) extensively studied liquid slosh in spacecraft tanks, and in the 1990s NASA undertook the Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment on the space shuttle. The European Space Agency has advanced these investigations with the launch of SLOSHSAT. Most spinning spacecraft since 1980 have been tested at the Applied Dynamics Laboratories drop tower using sub-scale models. Extensive contributions have also been made by the Southwest Research Institute, but research is widespread in academia and industry.|$|R
