40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method has}} been developed for predicting the directivity of the sound that is radiated {{from one side of}} a panel, or an opening, which is excited by sound incident {{from the other side of}} the panel, or the opening, from a room or duct. This directivity needs to be known when one is predicting the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> at an <b>external</b> position which is due to the radiation of sound from the roof, wall, ventilating duct or chimney flue of a factory. The theoretical method is essentially a two dimensional method, although it does include some three dimensional considerations. This paper compares this theoretical method with published experimental data. The theory presented in this paper agrees with the average trend of the experimental measurements. However the experimental results show significant variability about the theoretical predictions. This is believed to be due to both experimental and theoretical difficulties...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the perception of soundscape reproduced by an ambisonic reproduction system on a horizontal plane, how the experience of space affected the perception of soundscape reproduction, and how the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment on soundscape reproduction affected the perception of soundscape compared with actual conditions. There were three experiments conducted: a soundwalk in situ in Manchester (United Kingdom) city centre, listening tests in Salford (United Kingdom), and listening tests in Bandung (Indonesia). The listening tests used material recorded from four locations on the soundwalk route in Manchester. The Salford listening tests were performed at the in-situ measured <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> and {{the participants were asked to}} adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents actual locations. The listening test in Bandung was conducted to understand the effect of participants who never come to the actual location to the perception of soundscape and the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment. The listening tests in Bandung were conducted at the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> at 9. 5 dB below the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (based on the preference <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> from the experiment in Salford), and the participants were also requested to adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents the actual space (to examine the consistency with the experiment in Salford). In each case, soundscape perception was measured on 19 semantic differential scales. Analysis of the semantic differential results showed that the ambisonic reproduction produced a similar subjective experience to the in situ soundwalk when the reproduction <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was 9. 5 dB lower than the actual <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in situ. Reproduction at the actual <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in situ produced a different dimensional space.

The pH of the Longissimus thoracis or lumborum, 30 min after sticking (pH 30 LT) was measured. 8508 pigs were examined and the pH was measured on the carcasses. The results show that the cut-off value of 85 dB(A) during the pre-slaughtering phase is not only a threshold to evaluate animal welfare but can also be associated with a slower drop of pH if <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> are < 85 dB(A).

40|$|The {{realisation}} {{and maintenance}} of a desired quality of the indoor environment is an important item in the building and housing process. Many complaints in buildings are related to an uncomfortable thermal climate (too warm, too cold, draughts), poor air quality (stuffy and odorous atmosphere, dust) and insufficient lighting conditions (glare, reflection, low contrast), causing headache, eye symptoms, fatigue and difficulty in concentrating (1). In the initial phase of a building and housing project it is of utmost importance that the client (principal/buyer/tenant) can explicitely make clear the implicitely required quality of the indoor climate. When this condition is not fulfilled choices for design and construction of a building and HVAC-system are made that later might induce complaints about the indoor climate. Therefore, it is desirable that when building, buying or renting an office building {{the quality of the}} indoor climate can unambiguously be defined and tested. When designing a building, the performance criteria for the office indoor environment have to be translated into a concrete design of construction and installation. This design process is simplified when the performance criteria for the indoor climate can directly be converted into performance criteria for building and installation. So for instance, the allowable <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> caused by <b>external</b> sources, say < 40 dB(A), can be translated into a performance criterium for the sound insulation of the facade, say 25 dB(A).

40|$|Members and {{directors}} of symphonic orchestras {{are concerned about}} the noise levels musicians are exposed to and their ease of playing ensemble. The results of many research has shown that the noise levels within an orchestra can be high. Also, research has shown that the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> will vary between different musicians playing different instruments and musical pieces or musicians being positioned differently on various stages. Aspects of influence on <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> can be musically based: the piece and its interpretation by the orchestra; or acoustically: the impact of the stage and hall acoustics. However, the contribution of each instrument and each acoustical aspect on the total <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> cannot be determined from <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> measurements. Therefore, a <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> prediction model is proposed based on the sound strength G and the early to late reflection ratio LQ 7 - 40.

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this analysis, noise can be described as sound that is undesired, in terms of its loudness (amplitude) and frequency (pitch). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies, a frequency dependant rating relates noise to human hearing sensitivity. This is called the A‐weighted decibel (dBA) scale. This scale accounts for the human perception of a doubling of loudness as an increase of 10 dBA. Therefore, a 70 ‐dBA <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> will <b>sound</b> twice as loud as a 60 ‐dBA <b>sound</b> <b>level.</b> People generally cannot detect differences of 1 to 2 dBA between noise sources of a similar nature (e. g., an increase in traffic noise compared to existing traffic noise); however, under ideal listening conditions, differences of 2 or 3 dBA can be detected by some people. Most people under normal listening conditions would probably perceive a 5 ‐dBA change. Typical <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> in dBA are shown on Table 3. 6 ‐ 1. Noise levels that vary with time are often described in terms of the equivalent <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (Leq). The Leq is the average steady‐state <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> that, in a stated period of time, contains the same acoustic energy as the time‐varying <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> during the same time period.

Methods: <b>Sound</b> <b>levels</b> were measured continuously 24 hours a day in two separate spaces at the same time, one enclosed and one open.

Results: The hourly Leq in the open space (50. 8 - 57. 2 dB) was greater than that of the enclosed space (45. 9 - 51. 7 dB), with a difference of 0. 4 - 10. 4 dB, and a mean difference of 4. 5 dB (p < 0. 0001).
