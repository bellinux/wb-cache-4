These instantaneous changes are represented at the energy level, i. e., in the bond graph, {{in such a manner}} that the tool can handle them directly, and, consequently, enforce conservation constraints. This means that the model designer does not explicitly reset integrator values in the information model part, e. g., by using the action property of a finite state machine.

Two classes of problems are considered. In the first class, the switching parameters are stochastic processes modeled by irreducible and aperiodic Markov chains with transition rates sufficiently faster than adaptation rates of the identification algorithms. In this case, tracking real-time parameters by output observations becomes impossible and we show that an averaged behavior of the parameter process {{can be derived from}} the stationary measure of the Markov chain and can be estimated with periodic inputs and least-squares type algorithms. Upper and lower error bounds are established that explicitly show impact of unmodeled dynamics. In contrast, the second class of problems represents systems whose state transitions occur infrequently. An adaptive algorithm with variable step sizes is introduced for tracking the time-varying parameters. Convergence and error bounds are derived. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.
