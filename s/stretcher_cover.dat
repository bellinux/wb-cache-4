50|$|Dezeuze's radical {{work from}} 1967 (<b>Stretcher</b> <b>covered</b> in plastic film) {{is in the}} {{collection}} of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and was shown at the Guggenheim Museum as part of the Exhibition of Masterpieces from the Centre Pompidou.|$|R
60|$|At length {{there was}} a stir behind the brethren, and at a word from Masouda they separated, falling apart a pace or two, and stood {{opposite}} each other and sideways to Sinan. Standing thus, they saw the curtains drawn. Through them came four men, carrying a <b>stretcher</b> <b>covered</b> with a cloth, beneath which {{they could see the}} outline of a form, that lay there stirless. The four men brought the stretcher {{to the front of the}} canopy, set it on the ground, prostrated themselves, and retired, walking backwards down the length of the terrace.|$|R
5000|$|Utterson visits Lucy at [...] "The Red Rat" [...] {{with the}} money, {{along with a}} letter from Jekyll that entreats her to leave town and {{start a new life}} elsewhere. After Utterson leaves, Lucy wonders of the {{possibilities}} ahead ("A New Life"). Just then, Hyde returns. Seeing the letter from Jekyll, he tells Lucy that he and the doctor are [...] "very close" [...] and that they [...] "share everything". As he holds Lucy softly so that she does not suspect it, he slowly and savagely stabs her multiple times before slitting her throat ("Sympathy, Tenderness (reprise)"). The vile murderer runs off laughing, just as the [...] "Red Rat" [...] attendants find Lucy's body and carry her out on a <b>stretcher.</b> <b>Covered</b> in Lucy's blood, Jekyll returns to his laboratory and faces off with Hyde in a final battle for control ("Confrontation").|$|R
60|$|Then Barbara {{went to the}} <b>stretcher,</b> {{which was}} <b>covered</b> by green canvas. She thought she knew who lay behind the screens, and her look was strained.|$|R
50|$|When {{the blast}} that ripped {{her husband to}} shreds shook Nicholas's palace and rattled the windows, the Grand Duchess rushed {{to the scene of}} the explosion. Stunned but {{perfectly}} controlled, she gave instructions and kneeling in the snow, helped to gather up Sergei's still-bleeding remains. The bared torso, part of the skull, a hand bone fragment, fingers, a still booted foot, were placed on a <b>stretcher</b> and <b>covered</b> with an army great coat. She also picked the medallions that Sergei wore around his neck and clutched them in the palm of her hand.|$|R
50|$|Vanmeter's {{house is}} a two-and-a-half story brick {{building}} located within a neighborhood of well-preserved nineteenth-century houses. Built of brick laid in a <b>stretcher</b> bond, and <b>covered</b> with a metal roof, it has been ranked {{as one of the}} area's best Greek Revival structures. Upon his death, Vanmeter bequeathed his house to younger family members; in the late 1970s, it was still owned by Vanmeters.|$|R
60|$|Each {{regiment}} {{was followed}} by its ammunition mules, and hospital doolies--the latter being <b>covered</b> <b>stretchers,</b> or palkies, carried by natives. Besides these were dandies--or chairs--slung upon mules. This greatly added {{to the difficulty of}} a night march for, even in the daytime, the presence of baggage animals in a column, upon a narrow road, greatly hinders the troops and, at night, the delays occasioned by them are naturally very much greater.|$|R
40|$|En dhoolie (dans les montagnes). In draagberrie (in ‘t gebergte). " A missionary {{sister is}} shown leaving the mission in a <b>covered</b> <b>stretcher</b> carried by four porters. The caption and {{following}} information are {{printed on the}} back of the postcard: "Les Ursulines de l’Institut de Thildonck dans la Mission du Bengale, Indes. De Ursulinen van Thildonck in de Missie van Bengalen, Indië. Ern. Thill, Bruxelles. " There are several handwritten words in French on the back...|$|R
60|$|During the {{afternoon}} I went with Captain Brooke to visit {{some of the}} battalions of General Hart's Brigade and see what sort of punishment they were receiving. As we rode up the watercourse which marks {{the bottom of the}} valley a shrapnel shell cleared the western crest line and exploded among one of the battalions. At first it seemed to have done no harm, but as we climbed higher and nearer we met a stretcher carried by six soldiers. On it lay a body with a handkerchief thrown across the face. The soldiers bearing the <b>stretcher</b> were all <b>covered</b> with blood.|$|R
50|$|EMS {{stretchers}} used in ambulances have wheels {{that makes}} transportation over pavement easier, {{and have a}} lock inside the ambulance and straps to secure the patient during transport. An integral lug on the stretcher locks into a sprung latch within the ambulance {{in order to prevent}} movement during transport. Modern stretchers may also have battery-powered hydraulics to raise and collapse the legs automatically. This eases the workload on EMS personnel, who are statistically at high risk of back injury from repetitive raising and lowering of patients. Specialized bariatric stretchers are also available, which feature a wider frame and higher weight capacity for heavier patients. <b>Stretchers</b> are usually <b>covered</b> with a disposable sheet or wrapping, and are cleaned after each use {{to prevent the spread of}} infection. Shelves, hooks and poles for medical equipment and intravenous medication are also frequently included.|$|R
500|$|Of all the 2nd Battalion units, G Company {{received}} the hardest blows. Before dawn of September 1, North Korean troops had G Company platoons on separate hills under heavy assault. Shortly after 03:00 they overran the 3rd Platoon, Heavy Mortar Company, and drove {{it from its}} position. These mortarmen climbed Hill 179 and on its crest joined the 2nd Platoon of G Company. Meanwhile, the 3rd Platoon of G Company, on a low hill along the Nam River [...] from its juncture with the Naktong River, was also under close quarters attack. After daylight, Captain LeRoy E. Majeske, G Company commander, requested artillery concentrations and air strikes, but they were slow to come. At 11:45, the North Koreans had almost reached {{the crest of the}} hill, and only a narrow space separated the two forces. A few minutes later Majeske was killed, and Second Lieutenant George Roach, commanding the 3rd Platoon, again reported the situation and asked for an air strike. The US Air Force delivered the strike on the North Korean held side of the hill, and this checked the assaults. By this time many North Korean troops had captured and occupied foxholes in the platoon position and from there threw grenades into other parts of the position. One of the grenades killed Roach early in the afternoon. Sergeant First Class Junius Poovey, a squad leader, now assumed command. By 18:00, Poovey had only 12 effective troops left in the platoon, 17 of the 29 men still living were wounded. With ammunition almost gone, Poovey requested and received authority to withdraw into the main G Company position. After dark, the 29 men, three of them carried on <b>stretchers,</b> withdrew, <b>covered</b> by the arrival of US tanks. The group reached the G Company position on Hill 179 at 23:30.|$|R
50|$|Reiko Morita (Hideko Takamine) is a widow {{who loses}} {{her husband in}} war. Bombing destroys his family's shop and the widow stays to rebuild it {{as the rest of}} the family flee and runs it for 18 years out of love for her dead husband and his mother. The film starts after 18 years when a new {{supermarket}} threatens to put them out of business. The sisters conspire to turn the shop into a supermarket and get rid of their brother's widow. Meanwhile, the surviving younger brother 25-year-old Koji Morita (Yūzō Kayama) loafs around, losing jobs, getting drunk, laid and gambling. In the crisis, he confesses to his shocked sister-in-law, 12 years older, that he has always loved her and can't deal with it. She cares for him, but in the motherly, elder sister way. She rejects him and decides to return home to her family, threatening suicide if he stops her. This suits the sisters, but he follows her onto the long train ride. On the way, she softens and they disembark for a country inn, where they can talk. He resumes his approaches, but at the last minute, she can't face intimacy. He storms out and gets drunk. He calls Reiko up and says he is going back home. In the morning, Reiko looks out the window and sees him being carried into the village on a <b>stretcher,</b> his face <b>covered.</b> Someone says he fell from a cliff. Reiko runs after him but falters. The last shot is of her face, blank, as she realizes what happened.|$|R
