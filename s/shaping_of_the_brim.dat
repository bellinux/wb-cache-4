50|$|Based on the US Army helmet type M1 used in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War, {{the helmet}} {{began to be}} used by the Police Reserve after the war and was officially adopted in 1966 after {{improvements}} to the design were carried out.The helmet is a dual structure, the outer shell and the inner helmet liner, the same design as the helmet used by the US military. <b>The</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet is also similar to the M1 type, though <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet <b>brim</b> is slightly longer. In addition, as the M1 helmet was designed to fit <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> a typical Anglo-Saxon American, the inner helmet liner was re-designed to remove <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> instability while being used by a Japanese wearer. Whereas <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> pre-war helmets was to prevent bullet penetration through <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet, the Type 66 high manganese steel helmet is designed to dent utilising <b>the</b> high flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material. For this reason, rather than wear the helmet directly on the head as with pre-war designs, the helmet is a dual structure, with the shell sitting on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet liner with a gap between the two layers.The material <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helmet liner is simple moulded resin. <b>The</b> total weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer shell and helmet liner is 1.4 kilograms. The newer Kevlar helmet Type 88 model was adopted in 1988, however a full update to that model has not yet taken place within the JSDF. The Type 66 is still in use in teaching and with the Self-Defence Force reserve. And too the helmet liners based on those of Type 66 are used widely for non-combat missions.|$|R
