25|$|Inadequate medical supplies, {{water and}} {{environmental}} contamination, frequent power failures, and outdated training {{led to a}} health care crisis that added to the overall devastation. According to a 1997 UNICEF delegation, hospitals were clean but wards were devoid {{of even the most}} rudimentary supplies and equipment; <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> thermometers, scales, kidney dishes, spatulas, IV giving sets, etc. The mission saw numerous patients being treated with home made beer bottle IV sets, clearly unsterile.

Using the standard <b>sphygmomanometer</b> as gold standard, the Spacelabs had a median error of 2 mm/Hg for both systolic and diastolic. Against the Hawksley random-zero <b>sphygmomanometer,</b> median error was- 3 mm systolic and- 6 mm diastolic. The proportion of errors> 10 mm rose from 11 % (systolic) and 9 % (diastolic) with the standard <b>sphygmomanometer</b> to 16 % and 29 % with the Hawksley random-zero <b>sphygmomanometer.</b> Because it underestimates systolic and diastolic pressures, the use of the Hawksley random-zero <b>sphygmomanometer</b> as a gold standard may have resulted in misleading conclusions about performance of some automated BP recorders.

40|$|Background: Blood {{pressure}} and pulse are crucially vital {{in health care}} especially in medical sphere, since both of those sections are factors {{that can be used}} as indicator to assess a person’s cardiovascular system. Blood pressure is measured in millimeter of mercury (mmHg), and recorded as two different measurements such as systolic blood {{pressure and}} diastolic. <b>Sphygmomanometer</b> can be used to measure blood pressure. The congruence of <b>sphygmomanometer</b> is fundamental to prevent an error in measuring blood pressure. Aim: This research is aimed to prove that there is an agreement between aneroid <b>sphygmomanometer</b> and digital <b>sphygmomanometer</b> in measuring blood pressure. Methods: This study was an observational study with cross-sectional design. Samples were obtained by simple random sampling from March to April 2016. Samples were obtained from 50 subjects with three times of observation in each subject. Then, the data will be analyzed by using Cohen’s Kappa. Results: Result of the research shows that the measure of kappa systolic blood pressure using manual and digital <b>sphygmomanometer</b> is κ= 0. 855, it indicates the existent of congruence consistency between devices is excellent or sufficiently high. The measure of kappa as a result of <b>sphygmomanometer</b> manual and digital usage in diastolic blood pressure is κ= 0. 737, it indicates the existent of congruence consistency between devices is well. Conclusion: There is an agreement between aneroid sphygmomanoemetr and digital <b>sphygmomanometer</b> in measuring blood pressure.

500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and <b>sphygmomanometers</b> being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury <b>sphygmomanometers.</b> Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|E
500|$|Today, the use {{of mercury}} in {{medicine}} has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. Thermometers and <b>sphygmomanometers</b> containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In 2002, the U.S. Senate passed legislation to phase out the sale of non-prescription mercury thermometers. In 2003, Washington and Maine became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices. Mercury compounds are found in some over-the-counter drugs, including topical antiseptics, stimulant laxatives, diaper-rash ointment, eye drops, and nasal sprays. The FDA has [...] "inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness" [...] of the mercury ingredients in these products. Mercury is still used in some diuretics although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{organized}} {{through the}} ministry of the environment, Norway began phasing out the use of most mercury-containing products (not limited to amalgam fillings but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc.). The ban on the import, export, and use of most mercury-based products began on 1 January 2008. The Norwegian officials stressed {{that this is not}} a decision based on using an unsafe health product, but rather that the [...] "overall, long term goal is to eliminate the use and release of mercury to the environment". Despite the mercury ban, dental offices in Norway may apply for exemptions to use amalgam on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

2500|$|Similar to Norway, from 1995 to 2009 the Environment Ministry of the Government of Sweden {{gradually}} {{banned the}} import {{and use of}} all mercury-based products (not limited to amalgam fillings alone, but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> consumer electronics, vehicle components, lightbulbs, analytical chemicals, cosmetics, etc.). These mercury-based products were phased out for environmental reasons and precautionary health reasons. Like Norway, there was considerable public pressure in the {{years leading up to}} the ban. Since the ban, the Government of Sweden continued to investigate ways of reducing mercury pollution. [...] The Swedish Chemicals Agency state that they may grant exemptions on the use of amalgam on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of mercury}} in dental {{fillings}} is considered {{safe and effective}} in all countries practicing modern dentistry (see below). There are currently two countries, Norway and Sweden, that have introduced legislation to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings; however, in both cases amalgam {{is part of a}} larger program of reducing mercury in the environment and includes the banning of mercury-based batteries, thermometers, light bulbs, <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc. In many countries, unused dental amalgam after a treatment is subject to disposal protocols for environmental reasons. Over 100 countries are signatories to the United Nations [...] "Minamata Convention on Mercury". Unlike mercury-based batteries, cosmetics, and medical devices (which will be banned by the year 2020), the treaty has not banned the use of dental amalgam, but allows phasing down amalgam use over a time period appropriate to domestic needs, an approach advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO).|$|E
5000|$|Aneroid <b>sphygmomanometers</b> (mechanical types with a dial) are {{in common}} use; they may require {{calibration}} checks, unlike mercury manometers.

Methods: Cross-sectional observational study of 764 children. BP measurements were made at school, using both a <b>sphygmomanometer</b> and an Omron HEM 711. Immediately after the BP measurement children were asked to state which device they preferred (if any). Results: Children had no preference for whether the <b>sphygmomanometer</b> or the Omron was used. Bland-Altman plots showed a lack of consistency between the two methods of BP measurement. With systolic BP there was a trend for the Omron to underestimate when low and overestimate when high. Conclusions: Children were equally distributed in their preference for BP device.

Methods: This study involved 120 subjects, aged 20 – 59 years old. The grip strength of subjects were measured using Jamar dynamometer and aneroid <b>sphygmomanometer</b> cuff method. Spearman {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the correlation between variables and grip strength.

Jamar grip strength value can be predicted using spyghmomanometer with the formula of (0. 1157 x <b>Sphygmomanometer</b> grip strength value) – (5. 696 x sex) + (0. 0824 x age) (female = 1, male= 0). Conclusions: Grip strength correlates with physiological variables. The variables to predict Jamar grip strength using <b>sphygmomanometer</b> are sex and age.
