40|$|Abstract The {{quantity}} of suspended sediment in an estuary is regulated either by transport, where energy or {{time needed to}} suspend sediment is limiting, or by supply, where the {{quantity of}} erodible sediment is limiting. This paper presents a hypothesis that suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) in estuaries can suddenly decrease when the threshold from transport to supply regulation is crossed as an erodible <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> is depleted. This study was motivated by a statistically significant 36 % step decrease in SSC in San Francisco Bay from water years 1991 – 1998 to 1999 – 2007. A quantitative conceptual model of an estuary with an erodible <b>sediment</b> <b>pool</b> and transport or supply regulation of sediment transport is developed. Model results confirm that, if the regulation threshold was crossed in 1999, SSC would decrease rapidly after water year 1999 as observed.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between sediment nutrient enrichment and carbon sequestration, using the ratio of gross primary production to respiration (P/R), in a fish-farming impacted and an unaffected Mediterranean seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) ecosystem in the Aegean Sea, Greece. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sedimentation, nutrient <b>pools</b> in <b>sediment</b> and dissolved nutrients in pore water were significantly and positively intercorrelated, indicating close linkage between sedimentation and <b>sediment</b> nutrient <b>pools</b> in seagrass meadows. C, N and P <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> were significantly enhanced in the impacted meadow throughout the year, even during winter when fish farming activity was low. In the impacted sediment, the increase in C and N was higher than P, reflecting a faster remineralization and uptake of P than C and N. The ecosystem P/R ratio decreased exponentially with sediment nutrient enrichment. Threshold values are given for C, N and P sedimentation rates and <b>sediment</b> <b>pools,</b> and for N and P concentrations in pore waters, after which P/R ratio in the seagrass meadow decreases below 1, indicating a shift from autotrophy to heterotrophy with sediment nutrient enrichment.

40|$|Tide pools are {{challenging}} environments. They can experience rapid changes in temperature, salinity and pH yet are occupied by fishes and other organisms. While more {{attention has been}} given to community composition, zonation and competition of intertidal rockpool faunas, soft sediment tidepools are potentially important in terms of biodiversity and fisheries. Gobies, dominate the communities of both rock- and soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> by virtue of physiological and behavioural adaptations. In part their great diversity is potentially a function of the ability to cope with great adversity. The combination of physiological challenges and low resource diversity offers and useful natural laboratory for examining resource partitioning and speciation processes in extreme environments. Moreton Bay, Australia contains extensive areas of soft sediment shores on which pools commonly occur. The objectives of this thesis were to: 1) quantify the use of soft sediment tidepools by fishes and their associated meiofaunal prey, and 2) examine more closely how several gobiid species are able to coexist in such a homogenous environment. A twelve month survey of fishes in soft sediment tidepools was undertaken between January and December 2009 at three sites: Dunwich, Manly and Godwin Beach, in south-east Queensland, Australia. The gobies Favonigobius lentiginosus, Favonigobius exquisitus, Pseudogobius sp., whiting Sillago spp. and the blenny Omobranchus punctatus were the most abundant species. The mean density of fish was between 0. 29 ± 0. 13 and 5. 04 ± 1. 74 fish L- 1. Abundance of fish was positively correlated with pool volume. Most fish caught were juveniles, suggesting that soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> act as nurseries for some species. To assess prey availability and therefore the potential role of soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools</b> as foraging areas during low tide, I assayed the meiofaunal occupation of soft sediment tidepools at each of the three intertidal shores.

The higher-variability demand is modeled as a hyperexponential renewal process, and the lower-variability demand is modeled as a Poisson process. In case of <b>pooled</b> <b>capacity,</b> the arrival process at the production queue is the superposition of the two processes. We prove conditions under which the first-come [...] first-served operating rule will fail to achieve a Pareto improvement over the separate systems because it would increase inventory cost at the lower-variability warehouse.

40|$|The {{silicic acid}} uptake {{kinetics}} of diatoms were studied {{to provide a}} mechanistic explanation for previous work demonstrating both nonsaturable and Michaelis-Menten-type saturable uptake. Using 68 Ge(OH) 4 as a radiotracer for Si(OH) 4, we showed a time-dependent transition from nonsaturable to saturable uptake kinetics in multiple diatom species. In cells grown under silicon (Si) -replete conditions, Si(OH) 4 uptake was initially nonsaturable but became saturable over time. Cells prestarved for Si for 24 h exhibited immediate saturable kinetics. Data suggest nonsaturability was due to surge uptake when intracellular Si <b>pool</b> <b>capacity</b> was high, and saturability occurred when equilibrium was achieved between <b>pool</b> <b>capacity</b> and cell wall silica incorporation. In Thalassiosira pseudonana at low Si(OH) 4 concentrations, uptake followed sigmoidal kinetics, indicating regulation by an allosteric mechanism. Competition of Si(OH) 4 uptake with Ge(OH) 4 suggested uptake at low Si(OH) 4 concentrations was mediated by Si transporters. At high Si(OH) 4, competition experiments and nonsaturability indicated uptake was not carrier mediated and occurred by diffusion. Zinc {{did not appear to}} be directly involved in Si(OH) 4 uptake, in contrast to a previous suggestion. A model for Si(OH) 4 uptake in diatoms is presented that proposes two control mechanisms: active transport by Si transporters at low Si(OH) 4 and diffusional transport controlled by the <b>capacity</b> of intracellular <b>pools</b> in relation to cell wall silica incorporation at high Si(OH) 4.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Sediment {{production}} and delivery in Pacific Northwest coastal streams can have damaging effects on channel morphology and anadromous fish habitat. The research in Pistol River {{was designed to}} determine if a link exists between sediment delivery processes and degradation of fish habitat. Objectives of this basin-wide analysis were to: 1) identify and inventory major sources of sediment; 2) estimate rates, timing and volumes of sediment {{production and}} delivery to streams; and 3) attempt to link sediment delivery to changes in pool volumes. Two sets of data were collected and analyzed. The first set used aerial photos and field data to identify and estimate sediment production and delivery. The second data set used channel and pool measurements to estimate V*, the percent of fine <b>sediment</b> in <b>pools</b> (Lisle and Hilton 1992). Primary factors influencing landslides are unstable geology, steep slopesin inner gorges and management activity. Sedimert production from landsliding increased as management increased while forested areas decreased. Sediment was delivered to Pistol River streams at a rate of 400 m 3 /km 2 *yr. Fine <b>sediment</b> in <b>pools</b> was primarily stored on edges and downstream ends of pools where shear stress is typically less than at pool:heads and along the thaiweg. A positive correlation was found between total fine sediment volume and scoured pooi volume; however no relationship was found between V* and scoured pool volume. This suggests that even though larger <b>pools</b> have the <b>capacity</b> to store more sediment, the percent of fine <b>sediment</b> occupying scoured <b>pool</b> volume is independent of pool size. The relationship between V* and unjt area sediment delivery was positive and strongly correlated but only after the effects of local sediment input were considered. A spatial and temporal relationship was round between V* and time and distance of delivered sediment. The relationship between fine <b>sediment</b> volume in <b>pools</b> and <b>sediment</b> deliiiery indicated that landslide sediment delivery from years past is being transported through the stream system and stored in downstream pools, bars and terraces. Narrow, upstream reaches temporarily trap recently delivered fine sediments. Overall, in the short term (years), fine sediments are stored in pools in upland reaches.

We found no significant density-dependent effects on either the predator or prey species, likely due to meiofaunal prey oversupply; however, the diet composition of the prey species Sillago spp. changed significantly in the presence of their potential predator.

The gobies showed preference for a particular estuarine habitat at a given stage of ontogenetic development and habitat shift corresponded with change in body shape implying the level of competence exhibited by these species during ontogeny. The occurrence of larva and the early J 1 in the lower estuary around May was timed with spring bloom that was attributed to increase in the secondary production of estuaries in the bay particularly the zooplankton, which was the main prey item of gobies during the pelagic phase. The movement in the tidal creek from late J 1 to J 2 was related with shift to benthic lifestyle with preference for benthic prey {{but it could also}} be attributed to refuge from predators as well as temperature-mediated growth and morphogenesis in the shallow habitat. Relevant changes in body shape was a prelude to benthic life particularly the narrowing of the head, reduction in the angle of the mouth on the ventral surface bringing the mouth closer to the substrate, deformation at the anterior trunk region that resulted to a tumescent appearance on the dorsal region of the trunk as well as a relatively elongated and ventrally displaced tail. All these characters were attained at J 3. The gobies gained competence when they reached J 3 having the ability to explore “high-risked” habitats such as the middle estuary and a specialized habitat like the soft <b>sediment</b> <b>pools.</b> The J 3 of G. breunigii on the other hand corresponded with upstream movement to preferred adult habitats. Changes during the adult stage was primarily associated with the elaboration of the morphological form inherent at J 3.
