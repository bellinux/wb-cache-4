25|$|The largest use {{of copper}} alloy heat {{exchanger}} tubing {{on a per}} unit basis is in utility power plants. These plants contain surface condensers, heaters, and coolers, all of which contain copper tubing.

25|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> is a {{shell and}} tube heat {{exchanger}} in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes. The exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes {{as shown in the}} adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Early boilers used {{seawater}} directly, {{but this}} gave {{problems with the}} build-up of brine and scale. For efficiency, as well as conserving feedwater, marine engines have usually been condensing engines. By 1865, {{the use of an}} improved <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> permitted the use of fresh water feed, as the additional feedwater now required was only the small amount required to make up for losses, rather than the total passed through the boiler. Despite this, a large warship could still require up to 100tons of fresh water makeup to the feedwater system per day, when under full power. Attention was also paid to de-aereating feedwater, to further reduce boiler corrosion.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E
2500|$|A Davies condenser, {{also known}} as a double <b>surface</b> <b>condenser,</b> is similar to the Liebig condenser, but with three {{concentric}} glass tubes instead of two.

2500|$|The {{performance}} of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical OTEC boundary conditions {{is important to}} the Claude cycle. Many early Claude cycle designs used a <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> since their performance was well understood. However, direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages. As cold water rises in the intake pipe, the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve. If a significant amount of gas comes out of solution, placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified. Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30% of the dissolved gas evolves in the top [...] of the tube. The trade-off between [...] of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the gas evolution dynamics, deaerator efficiency, head loss, vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power. Experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some 30% better than falling jet types.|$|E
2500|$|In 1835, {{before the}} Great Western Railway had opened, Brunel {{proposed}} extending its transport network by boat from Bristol across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City. The Great Western Steamship Company {{was formed by}} Thomas Guppy for that purpose. It was widely disputed {{whether it would be}} commercially viable for a ship powered purely by steam to make such long journeys. Technological developments in the early 1830s—including the invention of the <b>surface</b> <b>condenser,</b> which allowed boilers to run on salt water without stopping to be cleaned—made longer journeys more possible, but it was generally thought that a ship {{would not be able to}} carry enough fuel for the trip and have room for a commercial cargo. Brunel applied the experimental evidence of Beaufoyand further developed the theory that the amount a ship could carry increased as the cube of its dimensions, whereas the amount of resistance a ship experienced from the water as it travelled only increased by a square of its dimensions. [...] This would mean that moving a larger ship would take proportionately less fuel than a smaller ship. To test this theory, Brunel offered his services for free to the Great Western Steamship Company, which appointed him to its building committee and entrusted him with designing its first ship, the [...]|$|E

50|$|Steam-electric {{power plants}} utilize a <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> cooled by water {{circulating}} through tubes.

50|$|A <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> is a {{commonly}} used {{term for a}} water-cooled shell and tube heat exchanger installed on the exhaust steam from a steam turbine in thermal power stations.
