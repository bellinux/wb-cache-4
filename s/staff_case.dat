This paper reports on public child welfare staff knowledge, attitudes, and practices in a state implementing the EBP, SafeCare®. A survey of public child welfare staff (N = 222) was conducted to assess knowledge, familiarity, and referral barriers and practices. Knowledge of and familiarity with SafeCare were low, especially among front line <b>staff</b> (<b>case</b> managers). Attitudes toward SafeCare were fairly positive, but somewhat less so than attitudes toward a standard, non-evidenced based parenting program. Case managers were significantly less likely to have made a referral (15 %) than other staff (46 %). Job tenure had few effects on familiarity, knowledge, attitudes, or referrals. The strongest predictors of having made referrals were familiarity with SafeCare and job position...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveNo {{previous}} studies have specifically addressed the effect of training on outcomes after concomitant aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. This study evaluated the early and late outcomes after concomitant aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting performed by surgeons in training. MethodsA retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively by the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons Cardiac Surgery Database between June 2001 and December 2009 was performed. Concomitant aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 2540 patients; of these procedures, 290 (11. 4 %) were by trainees. Patient demographics, intraoperative characteristics, and early morbidity were compared between trainee and <b>staff</b> <b>cases</b> using chi-square analysis and t tests. Multivariate analyses {{were used to determine}} the independent association of training status with 30 -day and late mortality. ResultsCompared with <b>staff</b> <b>cases,</b> trainee cases were younger (mean age, 73. 0 vs 74. 2 years; P = . 025) and less likely to present with triple vessel disease (27. 9 % vs 38. 3 %, P = . 001) or previous cardiac surgery (6. 3 % vs 2. 8 %, P = . 016). Trainee cases had longer mean perfusion (160. 4 vs 144. 6 minutes, P < . 001) and crossclamp (125. 2 vs 114. 6 minutes, P < . 001) times. The incidence of early complications was similar between the 2 groups. On multivariate analysis, trainee status was not associated with an increased risk of 30 -day mortality (2. 4 % vs 4. 0 %, P = . 348). Moreover, {{there was no significant difference}} in long-term outcomes, and 5 -year survival was comparable in both groups (79. 6 % vs 77. 4 %, P = . 200). ConclusionsConcomitant aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting can be safely and effectively performed by properly supervised trainees in the contemporary era. It is imperative to offer training opportunities to junior surgeons in this complex procedure to ensure quality patient outcomes in the future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{distinct}} {{character of}} the Civil Service Tribunal {{as well as its}} case-law has led to a number of procedural particularities and innovations. The Civil Service Tribunal encourages the parties to a case to favour an amicable settlement of the dispute. In the <b>staff</b> <b>cases</b> the amicable settlement procedure is of very significant value as it allows achieving a balanced and for both parties to a case acceptable solution. The particular attention needs to be paid to the allocation of costs according to the rules governing the procedure before the Civil Service Tribunal. It is to be noted that a special rule previously had applied to the <b>staff</b> <b>cases,</b> according to which the applicant did not pay the institution's costs even if he lost the case. The special rule was abolished as from the 1 st November 2007 and today a general rule stating that the unsuccessful party shall be ordered to pay the costs has to be applied. However, as it is apparent from the case-law of the Civil Service Tribunal, the general rule is not applied automatically. Attention must be also drawn to the provisions granting the Tribunal the possibility of ordering any claimant bringing a manifestly abusive action to reimburse the costs occasioned by that action. The Tribunal is faced with an increasing number of actions from claimants who misuse that judicature, the cases brought by those applicants often take up a disproportionate amount of the Tribunal's time and impedes its functioning. Thus, this article analyses the abovementioned specific aspects of the procedure before the Civil Service Tribunal. These procedural aspects are compared to the aspects of procedure before the Court of Justice and the General Court...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of community services to replace two long-stay psychiatric {{hospitals in the}} North East Thames Health Authority region of the UK {{has been the subject}} of a research programme since 1985. The economic evaluation is conducted by the Personal Social Services Research Unit; research results relating to the first five cohorts of hospital leavers are reported in this paper. When followed up 1 year after discharge, almost half of the sample were living in highly supported residential care units, most of which were managed by district health authorities. More than 40 services provided outside the accommodation facility were used by clients and, although contact with certain professionals remained constant, some changes in service use over time were marked. The average total cost of community care for this group was pound 493 per week (1992 - 93 prices), accommodation facility costs comprising approximately 85 % of the total. In the new service configuration, district health authorities fund half of the costs of supporting the hospital leavers, 50 % less than when they funded long-stay hospital placements.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{strategies to}} improve the way that government and community services work together {{to address the needs}} of vulnerable community members. Introduction In late 2012 I was appointed to lead the Service Sector Reform project. The goal was to explore how government and non-government service providers can work together to improve outcomes for Victorians. I was asked to lead a process that engaged all stakeholders in a discussion about community and human services and in particular, to examine how support for Victoria’s most vulnerable people could be delivered in a more integrated way. An intensive five-month consultation process took place between February and July 2013. During this period my project principal, Dr Bronte Adams, and I listened to the views of people in the community sector, public administration and the private sector. Consultation included public forums, individual meetings, focus groups and a submission process. We talked to ministers and departmental secretaries as well as frontline <b>staff,</b> <b>case</b> managers and community workers. We also heard from service users. This report is a summarised account of many hours of discussions and more than a hundred submissions. The report represents my findings, although it is clear it also seeks to capture the voice of the community...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To see how {{educational}} philosophies {{that underlie}} lecture and case {{methods of teaching}} are related to how faculty perform their teaching, research, and service. Design/methodology/approach – This paper {{is based on the}} premise that foundational philosophies, worldviews or paradigms underlie educational philosophies, and each educational philosophy favors a certain instructional methodology, which in turn implies a certain way or method of instruction. Findings – The findings of this paper are that each educational philosophy favors a certain instructional methodology, which in turn determines not only the way that the instruction is performed but also how faculty perform their teaching, research, and service. Research limitations/implications – This paper implies that differences between the underlying world views of lecture and case methods of teaching similarly lead to differences in many other aspects of the teaching and learning process. Practical implications – This paper implies that, in practice, faculty would perform their teaching, research, and service in a more consistent manner if they become consciously aware of the underlying philosophy of their teaching method. Originality/value – The original contribution of this paper is that it shows how in a systematic manner the differences in teaching philosophy lead to differences in what faculty do in all areas of their activities: teaching, research, and service.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of several adverse pregnancy outcomes including fetal growth restriction are higher in pregnancies where the fetus is male, leading to suggestions that placental insufficiency {{is more common}} in these fetuses. Placental insufficiency associated with fetal growth restriction may be identified by multi-vessel Doppler assessment, but little evidence exists regarding sex specific differences in these Doppler indices or placental function. This study aims to investigate sex specific differences in fetal and placental perfusion and to correlate these changes with intra-partum outcome. Methods and Findings: This is a prospective cohort study. We measured Doppler indices of 388 term pregnancies immediately prior to the onset of active labour (# 3 cm dilatation). Fetal sex was unknown {{at the time of the}} ultrasound assessment. Information from the ultrasound scan was not made available to clinical <b>staff.</b> <b>Case</b> notes and electronic records were reviewed following delivery. We report significantly lower Middle Cerebral artery pulsatility index (1. 34 vs. 1. 43, p = 0. 004), Middle Cerebral artery peak velocity (53. 47 cm/s vs. 58. 10 cm/s, p =, 0. 001), and Umbilical venous flow/kg (56 ml/min/kg vs. 61 ml/min/kg, p = 0. 02) in male fetuses. These differences however, were not associated with significant differences in intra-partum outcome. Conclusion: Sex specific differences in feto-placental perfusion indices exist.
