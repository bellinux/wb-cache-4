30|$|There {{are three}} mapping {{standards}} in the petroleum field: the Chinese Petroleum standard, the Dutch Shell standard and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) standard. Therefore, the conversion of a practical map from the petroleum field among these standards {{was selected as the}} study case to test the conversion accuracy and working efficiency of the developed system in this work. The basic data for the conversion of a map among three petroleum standards are mainly the mapping specifications and <b>symbol</b> <b>library</b> files of the three standards, symbol association tables, and a map based on a standard. The mapping specifications, <b>symbol</b> <b>library</b> files (*.style format) and a map based on the Chinese Petroleum standard are provided by the Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development (China), and the <b>symbol</b> <b>library</b> files (*.style format) are converted into files (*.serverstyle format) that can be recognised by the ArcGIS Engine platform. The files with *.serverstyle format are stored in the blob field of an Oracle database. According to the three symbol libraries and the different symbol codes (names) of the same spatial entity in the three standards, the symbol association tables are constructed in the Oracle database. Based on the library files (*.serverstyle) and the association tables, the map can be conveniently mutually inter-converted among the three standards.|$|E

The design rules of geometrical characteristics are put forward based on invariance class provided by the new generation GPS, and the relationship between geometrical tolerance zone and the additional symbols is established. By using of building standard <b>symbols</b> <b>library,</b> inquiring of geometrical tolerance value automatically, and simplifying user interface, the intelligent and convenience geometrical tolerance annotation is realized.
