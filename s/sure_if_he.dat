5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E

He estimated that the experiments were 99 percent complete when the interview was conducted. He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required. He also said, [...] "If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it" [...] and it was [...] "very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs".|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners {{said that}} it seemed all the {{prominent}} pieces created for The X-Files were created by [...] "accident". According to Manners, Davis {{was nothing more than}} an extra leaning on a shelf. At the start, the producers of the show were not sure about making the Smoking Man the main antagonist. Paul Rabwin commented once {{that he did not know}} if Davis could handle the role, because he was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was a [...] "good enough" [...] actor for the role. Manners later commented that Davis knew that the Smoking Man had two different characters, the first being the one played by Davis and the second was the cigarettes. He further stated that the cigarette smoke could tell a [...] "whole story" [...] by itself, thanks to Davis' talent.|$|E
500|$|During Greenwalt's {{restructuring}} of the pilot, all of the original actors save for the male lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. Joel Silver approached Dohring [...] "out of the blue and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef, and was interested by the character's [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "sharp" [...] personality. Dohring {{had to go through}} the normal audition process and was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would have gotten the role without Silver, who had [...] "pushed it all the way through to the end".|$|E

Dohring {{had to go through}} the normal audition process and was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would have gotten the role without Silver, who had [...] "pushed it all the way through to the end". Munson explained that the goal of the casting changes was [...] "to lighten the show up a bit". He believed the changes granted the studio's and network's wish to [...] "make it a little younger and hipper". O'Laughlin felt that the whole cast's becoming [...] "a little bit younger" [...] especially effected the character Josef, as the originally chosen actor, Šerbedžija, was twice Jason Dohring's age. The creators and the network were concerned that Josef, whose relationship with Mick was important, would appear as more of a [...] "father figure" [...] rather than as a friend. O'Laughlin supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting [...] "level of ease in that age difference".|$|E
500|$|Mullally later stated he did {{not know}} he was auditioning for a recast, he also stated that he wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could be {{successful}} in the role to start with. He also watched hours of footage of previous episodes {{to get an idea of}} how to portray Declan, then making a statement to Declan fans reading: [...] "I'm sure that initially people will be quite confronted by a new face with the same character name – I'm not fooling myself about that. But hopefully people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E
500|$|Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett {{approached}} Maxwell [...] "out of the blue" [...] {{and wanted}} to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me.

Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News gave the film one out of five stars, saying [...] "This film, though, lacks any spine.

500|$|Precious was {{screened}} {{during the}} 2009 Sundance Film Festival from January 15, 2009, until January 25 in Park City, Utah. At Sundance, Precious was listed under its original title of Push: Based On The Novel By Sapphire; however, {{the title was}} later altered to avoid confusion with another 2009 film entitled Push. Precious appeared in the Un Certain Regard, an award section recognising unique and innovative films, at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in May 2009. At Cannes, the film received a fifteen-minute standing ovation from the audience after the film was screened. Daniels commented that, at first he was [...] "embarrassed" [...] to show Precious at Cannes {{because he did not}} want [...] "to exploit black people" [...] and wasn’t <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> [...] "wanted white French people to see our world." [...] After the success at Precious screenings at Sundance, reporters took note that the film could mirror the success of other films that had been screened and praised at the festival. S. James Snyder, of Time, compared Precious's success at Sundance to that of 2008's The Wrestler and Slumdog Millionaire; both films later were nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and Slumdog itself won Best Picture at the 81st Annual Academy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the series}} premiere on Australian Network ABC the Sydney Morning Heralds Robin Oliver {{predicted}} that older viewers [...] "will find Eccleston easily the best time lord since Tom Baker." [...] However Harry Venning of The Stage, whilst enthusiastic about {{the revival of the}} show, labelled Eccleston as the [...] "show's biggest disappointment" [...] following the premiere episode, stating he looked uncomfortable in a fantasy role. The Guardian Stephen Kelly felt that Eccleston's Ninth Doctor had many faults, two of which he felt to be [...] "looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "fantastic" [...] at every opportunity". However, he felt that he [...] "brought warmth, wit and promise" [...] and a [...] "formidable presence". Kelly believed that Eccleston was believable as a man who had destroyed two civilisations and was dealing with the repercussions and could have brought more to the show had Eccleston stayed for a second series. Seventh Doctor actor Sylvester McCoy praised Eccleston as being [...] "quite alien" [...] as the Doctor and that [...] "we were not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was on the edge of insanity or not, which was rather good." [...] Peter Davison, who played the Fifth Doctor, criticised Eccleston's decision to quit after a single series stating [...] "I don't think you can engage with the new Doctor in the way you should be able to." ...|$|E

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{really wanted to be}} with her or if it was just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E

500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He {{is the one who}} hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell for <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the whole place collapses - which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E
2500|$|Cunningham {{wanted to}} make the Mrs. Voorhees {{character}} [...] "terrifying", and to that end he believed it was important that Palmer not act [...] "over the top". There was also the fear that Palmer's past credits, as more of a wholesome character, would make it difficult to believe she could be scary. Ari Lehman, who had previously auditioned for Cunningham's Manny's Orphans, failing to get the part, was determined to land the role of Jason Voorhees. According to Lehman, he went in very intense and afterward Cunningham told him he was perfect for the part. In addition to the main cast, Walt Gorney came on as [...] "Crazy Ralph", the town's soothsayer. The character of Crazy Ralph was meant to establish two functions: foreshadow the events to come, and insinuate that he could actually be the murderer. Cunningham has stated that he was apprehensive about including the character, and is not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> accomplished his goal of creating a new suspect.|$|E
2500|$|Van Brocklin was {{selected}} 37th {{overall in the}} 1949 NFL Draft, taken in the fourth round by the Los Angeles Rams.

Van Brocklin signed with the Rams in July and joined a team that already had a star quarterback, Bob Waterfield. [...] Beginning in 1950, new Rams coach Joe Stydahar solved his problem by platooning Waterfield and Van Brocklin. [...] The 1950 Rams scored a then-record 466 points (38.8 per game – which is still a record) with a high octane passing attack featuring Tom Fears and Elroy [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Hirsch. [...] Fears led the league and set a new NFL record with 84 receptions. [...] Van Brocklin and Waterfield finished 1-2 in passer rating as well.

According to nightclub owner Clifford Antone, who opened Antone's in 1975, Vaughan jammed with Albert King at Antone's in July 1977 and almost [...] "scared him to death", saying that [...] "it was the best I've ever saw Albert or the best I ever saw Stevie". He was also influenced by jazz guitarists like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, and George Benson. While Albert King had a substantial influence on Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix was Vaughan's greatest inspiration. Vaughan declared: [...] "I love Hendrix for so many reasons. He was so much more than just a blues guitarist–he played damn well any kind of guitar he wanted. In fact I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> even played the guitar–he played music." ...|$|E
2500|$|NPC AI is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} [...] "Fear/trust system". The trust system determines whether the NPCs will follow Blake's orders and join him in combat. To do so, the player must ensure the NPC trusts Blake, and does not suspect him of being a Thing. NPCs have four levels of trust; red, amber, green and 100%. Red means they are convinced Blake is a Thing and will attack him. Amber means they are not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is a Thing, and although they won't attack him, they won't follow his orders. Green means they trust him and will follow his orders. 100% means they have complete faith in him, will follow his orders, {{and even if he}} attacks another NPC, they will support him. To gain the trust of NPCs, Blake can give them weapons and ammo, heal them, put himself at risk to protect them, or use a blood test kit on himself to prove he is not a Thing. Actions which deplete trust include accidentally shooting teammates, taking away teammate's weapons or ammo, or pointing a weapon at them for a sustained period of time to force them to do something.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1944, well known {{choreographer}} George Balanchine was hired by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo {{to work on a}} new production called Song of Norway.

Everything seemed so simple yet perfect: An elegant ballet fell into place before my eyes." [...] At first, she was not <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was paying much attention to her, but she quickly found out he was. Balanchine [...] assigned Tallchief a solo in Song of Norway and on the night before the premiere also informed her that she would be Danilova's understudy.
