The slip ring assembly, as used in the Seasat spacecraft, was connected into the power subsystem in such a way that most of the adjacent brush assemblies were of opposite electrical polarity. This wiring arrangement, together with the congested nature of the design itself, made the Seasat slip ring assembly a unique, first-of-a-kind component that was particularly prone to shorting. The possibility of slip ring failures resulting from placing opposite electrical polarities on adjacent brush assemblies was known at least as early-as the summer of 1977 to other projects within the contractor's organization. Furthermore, failures of slip ring assemblies due to shorting between brushes had been experienced by the prime contractor on slip ring assemblies used by other programs. That the Seasat organization was not fully aware of these potential failure modes was due to a breakdown in communication within the contractor's organization...|$|E

In the paper an application of variable speed cascaded doubly fed induction generator (CDFIG) in a small DG system is considered.

50|$|On a {{practical}} level, synchros resemble motors, {{in that there}} is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes</b> connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectors.|$|R
50|$|The rotor {{is a large}} magnet with poles {{constructed}} of steel lamination projecting out of the rotorâ€™s core. The poles are supplied by direct current or magnetized by permanent magnets. The armature with a three-phase winding is attached to three <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> with <b>brushes</b> riding on them and mounted on the shaft. The field winding is wound on the rotor which produces the magnetic field and the armature winding is on the stator where voltage is induced. Direct current (DC), from an external exciter or from a diode bridge mounted on the rotor shaft, produces a magnetic field and energizes the rotating field windings and alternating current energizes the armature windings simultaneously.|$|R

On the other hand, the wiring inside the steering column did not move and was extremely reliable, since the pod containing the buttons did not turn with the wheel. The electric control current flowed {{through a set of}} <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brush</b> contacts, while the Teletouch buttons were held in the correct position with Neutral at 12 o'clock through a set of planetary gears in the steering column.

50|$|The {{design of}} {{revolving}} armature generators {{is to have}} the armature part on a rotor and the magnetic field part on stator. A basic design, called elementary generator, is to have a rectangular loop armature to cut the lines of force between the north and south poles.

The current is sent out of the generator unit through two sets of <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes,</b> one of which is used for each end of the armature. In this two-pole design, as the armature rotates one revolution, it generates one cycle of single phase alternating current (AC). To generate an AC output, the armature is rotated at a constant speed having the number of rotations per second to match the desired frequency (in hertz) of the AC output.|$|R

40|$|With growing {{interest}} in sustainable forms of energy, the wind industry is growing rapidly. The Doubly Fed Induction Generator {{is the most popular}} choice for the drivetrain because it is cost effective. However, it suffers from reliability and maintenance issues due to the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes</b> it requires. The Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Generator (B-DFIG) aims to address these drawbacks. With increased wind power penetration, tripping of wind turbines during grid disturbances is no longer acceptable for the power system. Therefore, it is important to study the performance of such wind turbine drivetrain under low voltage events. This thesis studies the Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) characteristics of the B-DFIG for its application in wind turbines. This thesis first looks at the modelling and control of the Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Generator (B-DFIG) to be used in a wind turbine drivetrain. It develops the steady state model using circuit theory to study the steady state characteristics of the machine. The dynamic model is developed to form the basis of the study of the machine during low voltage events. Further, the controller is developed based on vector control. The second part of the thesis looks at the performance of a B-DFIG based wind turbine under symmetric low voltage dips. It compares the performance of this generator with that of the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) and Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) - two of the most prevalent generators used in wind turbine drivetrains today. The thesis also looks at protection methods for these generators. It has been seen that the issue with LVRT performance of the PMSM is the rise in the DC link voltage which is due to the mismatch in power generated by the machine and the power transferred to the grid. It has also been found that apart from offering better reliability through the exclusion of <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes,</b> the B-DFIG also has an improved LVRT performance when compared with the DFIG - the protection is simpler and can be built into the control algorithm of the machine controller.

A common type of electrical generators used in wind turbines is the Doubly Fed Induction Generator. However, this type of generator suffers from reliability issues associated with <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes.</b> The Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Generator (BDFIG) is an attractive choice to eliminate the drawbacks associated with <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes.</b> To commercialize the first BDFIG wind turbine a high performance control algorithm must be designed. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} a control algorithm for a BDFIG based Wind Turbine Drivetrain (WTDT) system including sensorless position estimation. To explore the characteristics of the BDFIG, an equivalent circuit is developed to determine the machine steady state behavior. From the BDFIG equivalent circuit, a dynamic model of the machines is derived to form the basis for the control algorithm development. The control algorithm is based on a Field Orientated Control using a two cascaded control loops for control of active- and reactive power. WTDT reliability can be further improved by eliminating the rotor position sensor. In place of a position sensor, a method of estimating rotor position is required, such that a senorless control algorithm is achieved. Two methods for position estimation are investigated and theoretically validated. Indirect position estimation, though speed estimation, using Model Reference Adaptive System is developed and compared to direct position estimation through induced Back-Electromotive Force (B-EMF) in the stator windings. The developed sensorless control algorithm provides maximum wind power extraction during the expected operating range, where active- and reactive power control loops response are limited by mechanical inertia. The control algorithm uses the induced stator B-EMF for rotor position estimation. To test the validity of a sensorless control algorithm for a BDFIG, an experimental setup has been constructed. A sensorless current control of the Control Winding (CW) active- and reactive power has been experimentally validated, where the CW frequency is made to follow the CW stator flux. The experimental controller maintains synchronous mode of operation, for a limited speed range, due to presence of space harmonics.

A persistent magnetic field imposes safety issues during assembly, field service or repair. High performance permanent magnets, themselves, have structural and thermal issues. Torque current MMF vectorially combines with the persistent flux of permanent magnets, which leads to higher air-gap flux density and eventually, core saturation.

The above drawing shows the principal points {{in the construction of}} the machine. On the left is the main pulley which is run by the main drive belt; on the right is a smaller one from which a small direct current generator is run for exciting the alternator field.

50|$|More poles {{can also}} be added to {{single-phase}} generator to allow one rotation to produce more than one cycle of AC output. In an example on the left, the stator part is reconfigured to have 4 poles which are equally spaced. A north pole is adjacent to the two south poles. The shape of the armature at the rotor part is also changed. It {{is no longer a}} flat rectangle. The arm is bent 90 degrees. This allows one side of the armature to interact with a north pole while the other side interacts with a south pole similarly to the two-pole configuration. The current is still delivered out through the two sets of <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>brushes</b> in the same fashion as in the two-pole configuration. The difference is that a cycle of AC output can be completed after a 180 degree rotation of the armature. In one rotation, the AC output will be two cycles. This increases the frequency of the output of the generator. More poles can be added to achieves higher frequency at the same rotation speed of the generator, or same frequency of output at the lower rotation speed of the generator depending on the applications.|$|R
