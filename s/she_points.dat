5|$|Desperate to {{save his}} brother, Dean sells his soul to a Crossroads Demon (Ona Grauer) in {{exchange}} for Sam's resurrection, and is given only one year before collection is due. They later conduct research at Bobby's home, hoping to determine Azazel's plan. Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris), owner of the now-destroyed Roadhouse, then arrives, and is forced to drink holy water to prove {{that she is not}} possessed by a demon. After giving them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> out five X's that have been marked, representing frontier churches built by Samuel Colt—hunter and creator of the mystical Colt, a gun capable of killing anything. Research also shows that railway lines connect all the churches {{in the form of a}} pentagram, creating a giant devil's trap that demons cannot enter.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
5|$|Some {{surviving}} stories regarding Iðunn {{focus on}} her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} 9th-century Oseberg ship burial site in Norway and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe which may have had a symbolic meaning and also that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in Southwest England.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the figure}} of the glorious woman held a rod in either hand, and the rod in her right hand was white and of ivory, and the rod in her left hand was black and of ebony. And as those who came up before her throne greeted her, so <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> now with the wand of ivory in her right hand, and now with the wand of ebony in her left hand. And with the wand of ivory <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> to the gates of ivory, through which came light and laughter, and with the wand of ebony <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> to the gates of coal, through which came {{blackness}} and groans. And as <b>she</b> <b>pointed,</b> so those who greeted her turned, and went, some through the gates of light and some through the gates of blackness.|$|R

5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as <b>she</b> <b>points</b> out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{attitude}} angers Nancy. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> {{out that}} life is short. She threatens to have adventures on her own. Charlie's attitude changes after Nancy's outburst, and she retreats from her plan a bit. She is content to enjoy the moment.|$|E

25|$|Ludwig and {{the court}} spring out at them, dancing a lively can-can. The Princess is shocked and upset when she discovers that Ludwig already has three Grand Duchesses. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out, however, that her claim predates the others', and Ludwig is {{therefore}} obliged to marry her.|$|E
25|$|She {{was taught}} to read {{at the age of}} three by her {{maternal}} grandmother. She would assist with getting the family's meal of rice and beans ready, and then spend the morning at a table with a primer. As a little girl, she often pretended to be a teacher to her dolls and stuffed animals, using a small blackboard and desk. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> to this early play-time as the root of her desire to be an educator.|$|E
25|$|The actions moves {{ahead to}} 1989, where Selena y Los Dinos {{are playing a}} concert at a fair. Abraham is shocked when Selena peels off her jacket and {{performs}} in a beaded bra. He confronts Selena on the band's bus, but <b>she</b> <b>points</b> out that her mother helped her make it, and that other fashionable female musicians such as Madonna and Janet Jackson are wearing bustiers too. Abraham relents, and Selena begins to design {{more and more of}} her band's attire.|$|E

25|$|In May 2015, for {{the second}} year running, England’s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to – “The Chicken Challenge”. The focus was on the {{handling}} of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the worryingly high levels of food poisoning from the campylobacter bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (T.V cookery programmes) and advertisement. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> to the examples set by Scandinavian societies.|$|E
25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that {{the quickest way to}} get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory <b>she</b> <b>points</b> out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E
25|$|However, {{she does}} not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender {{inequality}} in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as mothers and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.|$|E

25|$|Lois {{hands her}} exposé {{in and the}} {{government}} is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the Daily Planet under cover of night and explains all to Perry. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the Daily Planet, as Lois gets her edge back. It was later revealed she never really quit the Daily Planet.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and <b>she</b> <b>points</b> him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|In her {{subsequent}} {{analysis of}} [...] "Inscription for an Ice-House" [...] <b>she</b> <b>points</b> to Barbauld's challenge of Edmund Burke's characterisation {{of the sublime}} and the beautiful and Adam Smith's economic theories in the Wealth of Nations as evidence for this interpretation.|$|E

500|$|Ideas {{of racism}} and {{segregation}} also permeate the episode. Sara Gwenllian-Jones in her book Cult Television argues that, throughout the entry, [...] "the blacks are equated with aliens," [...] turning them into {{a certain type of}} [...] "other" [...] that is [...] "never allowed to fit in or feel safe". Gwenllian-Jones highlights the scene in which Dales, late one night on the team bus, wakes to see Exley's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window {{as an example of the}} racial comparison. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out that, despite coming to Earth, Exley has moved from one segregated society—that of the aliens—into another. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> out that Exley, after revealing his true form to Dales, says that [...] "my people guard their privacy zealously. They don't want our people to intermingle with your people". This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Isabella Acres as Rose Crisp: Rose is Ted's preteen daughter. She {{attends the}} Veridian Dynamics daycare program when her nanny is not available, but prefers {{to stay at}} home. According to Ted, [...] "her mom ran off to Africa to go save the world." [...] She is often the voice of reason on the show. When Ted talks with her about work <b>she</b> <b>points</b> out the terrible choices the company makes, and often helps Ted focus on {{what needs to be}} done to set things straight. She attends Eugene Debs Elementary School.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Ondaatje {{writes in}} The Independent that the {{existence}} of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work. He considers Hemingway's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked. In her piece for Nation, [...] Brenda Wineapple describes the book as [...] "poignant but not particularly good". However, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> out that it [...] "reminds us of Hemingway's writing at its most touching, acute and beautiful best". The review in Publishers Weekly is much the same saying the [...] "old Hemingway magic flashes sporadically, like lightning, but not often enough".|$|E
