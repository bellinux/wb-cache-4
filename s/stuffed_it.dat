5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
500|$|Knut's {{remains were}} {{exhibited}} in Berlin's Museum of Natural History, although this decision has caused some controversy with fans. A full-sized sculpture covered in Knut's pelt {{was presented to}} the public on 16 February 2013. It went on display in the entrance hall of the museum where it was viewed free of charge until 5 May. It will later be used for an exhibition on climate change and environment protection. Museum spokeswoman Gesine Steiner stated that [...] "It's important to make clear we haven't had Knut <b>stuffed.</b> <b>It</b> is an artistically valuable sculpture with the original fur." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1922, {{nearly all}} of Hemingway's early writing– his juvenilia and {{apprentice}} fiction, including the duplicates– was lost. He had been sent on assignment to cover the Conference of Lausanne, leaving Hadley, who was sick with a cold, behind in Paris. In Lausanne he spent days covering the conference, and the evenings drinking with Lincoln Steffens. Before setting off to meet him in Switzerland, thinking {{he would want to}} show his work to Steffens, Hadley packed all his manuscripts into a valise which was subsequently stolen at Gare de Lyon train station. Although angry and upset, Hemingway went with Hadley to Chamby (Montreux) to ski, and apparently did not post a reward for the recovery of the valise. An early story, [...] "Up in Michigan", survived the loss because Gertrude Stein had told him it was unprintable (in part because of a seduction scene), and he had <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> in a drawer.|$|E

In the episode {{they do not want}} to harm a real cat so they took a Build A Bear carcass, <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> with ballistics gel, shot it with a 20' barrel steam cannon, then made a scatter plot of the remains. By the end of the experiment, Hyneman asked, [...] "What was it we were trying to prove again?" [...] to which Savage replied, [...] "Don't know, don't care." [...] Clips from this show appeared in the MythBusters' Simpsons Special that first aired in 2015.|$|E
