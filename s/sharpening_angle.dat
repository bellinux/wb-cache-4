Planet gears are extended into cylindrical cutters, rotating around the pencil that {{is placed on}} the sun axis. The axes of planetary gears join at the pencil <b>sharpening</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike prism {{sharpeners}}, linear blade sharpeners do not rotate {{relative to}} the pencil being sharpened, and {{may be viewed as}} just a special form of knife, with a mechanical guide for increased safety and convenience. Some models use replaceable shaving razor blades, while others have permanently-fitted blades. Linear blade sharpeners may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape and angle of taper, whereas prism sharpeners have a fixed <b>sharpening</b> <b>angle</b> and produce circular symmetry.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} on the sharpening surface must {{be harder}} (hardness is measured on the Mohs scale) than the material being sharpened; diamond is extremely hard, making diamond dust very effective for sharpening, though expensive; less costly, but less hard, abrasives are available, such as synthetic and natural Japanese waterstones. Several cutlery manufacturers now offer electric knife sharpeners with multiple stages {{with at least}} one grinding stage. These electric sharpeners are typically used in the kitchen but have the ability to sharpen blades such as pocket or tactical knives. The main benefit of using an electric sharpener is speed with many models that can complete the sharpening process in one to two minutes. The disadvantage is that the <b>sharpening</b> <b>angle</b> is fixed so some specialized knives, like a Japanese style Santoku, may need additional attention to sharpen to the ideal angle.|$|E

5000|$|In {{its native}} area, P. halepensis is widely planted for its fine timber, {{making it one}} of the most {{important}} forestry trees in Algeria and Morocco. In Israel, the Aleppo pine, along with Pinus brutia, [...] has been planted extensively by the JNF. It proved very successful in Yatir Forest in the northern Negev (on the edge of the desert), where foresters had not expected it to survive. Many Aleppo pine forests exist today in Israel and are used for recreational purposes. Although it is a local species, some argue that the historical replacement of natural oak Maquis shrubland and garrigue with tall stands of pine has created [...] "ecological deserts" [...] and has significantly changed the species assemblage of these regions. In Israel natural patches of Aleppo pine forests can be found in the Carmel and Galilee regions. The species produces timber which is valued for its hardness, density and unproblematic seasoning. Seasoned timber is inclined to tear out with planing, but this can be avoided by using sharp blades or adjusting the <b>sharpening</b> <b>angle</b> of tools.|$|E
50|$|Diamond stones can {{be useful}} in the {{sharpening}} process. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance known and as such can be used to sharpen almost any material. (Coarse diamond sharpening stones can be used for flattening waterstones.) Alternatively, tungsten carbide blades can be used in knife sharpening. Clamp-style sharpening tools use a clamp with several holes with predefined angles. The stone is mounted on a rod and is pulled through these holes, so that the angle remains consistent. Another system is the crock stick setup, where two sticks are put into a plastic or wooden base to form a V shape. When the knife is pulled up the V, the angle is held so long as the blade is held perpendicular to the base. Several cutlery manufacturers now offer electric knife sharpeners with multiple stages with at least one grinding stage. These electric sharpeners are typically used in the kitchen but have the ability to sharpen blades such as pocket or tactical knives. The main benefit of using an electric sharpener is speed with many models that can complete the sharpening process in one to two minutes.

40|$|With their {{standardized}} weight, their typical « raw » apparence, their concave {{sides and}} <b>sharpened</b> <b>angles,</b> the so-called “ox-hide” metallic ingots have been receiving researchers’ full attention. It would be tempting {{to consider this}} large-scale diffused artefact as an early form of currency, but this question still remains a matter of fierce debate. Most studies have been led so far by the bias of either ponderal or written (Linear B tablets) evidence, integrating specific economists’ terms. But a “universal” definition of the “function” or “status” of ox-hide ingots seems actually uncertain, this varying with the disponibility in copper resource among the Mediterranean peoples. Our aim is {{to give an account}} of the most relevant clues published in terms of weights, integrity and archaeological contexts for a particular and homogeneous set of oxhide ingots: with its geological peculiarity and strategic position within the Mediterranean, the Cretan situation can provide interesting clues on the diverse functions that copper oxhide ingots can take on...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{difference}} from the crosscut saw is that the edges are <b>sharpened</b> at right <b>angles</b> to the cutting plane, forming chisel-like cutting surfaces, whereas the crosscut saw is <b>sharpened</b> at an <b>angle,</b> so that each tooth has a knife-like cutting point {{in contact with the}} wood. This design keeps the saw from following grain lines, which could curve the path of the saw: by acting like a chisel, the saw can more easily cut across deviating grain lines, which is necessary if a straight cut is to be achieved. This feature enables the orthogonal cutting edge to efficiently transport wood-chips from the kerf, allowing subsequent teeth to perform a more effective cut.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the anorectal angle was preserved after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, a simple, safe, low-radiation, real-time method of imaging the anorectum was developed. A cylindrical balloon {{was placed in the}} neorectum and anal canal and filled with a solution of 99 mTc in water. A gamma camera then imaged the angulation of the balloon while the subject was at rest, during sphincteric squeeze, and during a Valsalva maneuver. Thirteen healthy volunteers and six patients were studied after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. An angle was identified in all controls and patients. In the lateral decubitus position at rest, the mean anorectal angle in controls (102 +/- 18 degrees; SD) and anopouch angle in patients (108 +/- 19 degrees) were similar (p = 0. 3). Sitting straightened the angle in both groups (p less than 0. 03), whereas sphincteric squeeze and a Valsalva maneuver <b>sharpened</b> the <b>angle</b> in both the sitting and standing positions (p less than 0. 03). In the lateral decubitus position, however, the pouch group was less able to <b>sharpen</b> the <b>angle</b> than were the controls (p = 0. 04). In controls, the anorectal junction descended during sitting and elevated during squeeze (p less than 0. 03), but this did not occur in the pouch group. In conclusion, maneuvers favoring or stressing continence (squeeze, Valsalva) <b>sharpened</b> the anorectal <b>angle</b> and elevated the pelvic floor, whereas a maneuver favoring defecation (sitting) straightened the angle and caused the pelvic floor to descend. After ileal-anal anastomosis, the angle and its movements (except those while lying) were similar to controls. Elevation of the pelvic floor during squeeze, however, was decreased, indicating a decreased mobility of the pelvic floor after operation...|$|R

40|$|Wear is {{the main}} reason for the loss of {{performance}} of the parts for agricultural machinery. It leads to the degradation of the soil working quality. This work aims to highlight the wear resistance of the harrows discs manufactured, consolidated and sharpened differently. The tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field of the Faculty of Exploitation and Repair of Agricultural Machinery of the State Technical University of Kirovograd (Ukraine) in 2015. The technical equipment consists of devices for consolidation by electric discharge and for measurement the linear wear of discs, a harrow, a sand test bed, a tractor and discs made of different materials and technologies. Some parameterized were collected during the laboratory test each 5 ha and up to 20 ha of operation and in the fields each 30 ha until the time limit of exploitation. The Laboratory tests have shown that after twenty (20) ha of operation, the wear resistance of the experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (<b>sharpening</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 °) is 2. 95 times higher than the discs in series made of steel 28 MnB 5. The field experiment gave the following results: According to agro technical requirements, the plowing depth limit of serial discs made of steel 28 MnB 5 was reached after an operating duration of 120 ha while for experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (<b>sharpening</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees) this duration is of 156 ha. The diameter wear limit of experimental discs was reached after an operating duration of 179 ha against 154 ha for the serial ones. Therefore, the new technology can be applied during the manufacture and / or the repair of the discs...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The {{development}} of a mathematical dynamic system model is necessary for analysing vibrational motion during the metal  cutting processes. The mathematical model of the dynamic system is considered to be defined if the system parameters that  unambiguously determine its state are known and the alteration of  its state over time is specified. Considering the above mentioned, each study of vibrational motion must be preceded by a  determination of the parameters of the oscillator circuits of the  mathematical model. The working part of the metal cutting tool  consists in a shank having a complex profile, which makes such  calculations very difficult to carry out. There are no sufficiently rigorous and, at the same time, acceptable formulae for  engineering practice in the literature data. Therefore, data on the  characteristics of the metal cutting tool – in particular, its stiffness  and moment of inertia – scatter significantly. The aim of the study is to obtain calculated dependences that meet these requirements and  determine the limits of their applicability for different cutting tool  diameter ranges. Methods. Approaches referring to the theory of elasticity are used for the calculations. Results.   Engineering formulae for the calculation of stiffness and  polar moment of inertia of the metal cutting tool are obtained; in  particular, three- and four-blade taps with straight flutes as well as  drills.  It is established that to increase the dynamic stability of the  metal cutting tool, it is necessary to increase the moment of inertia  of the section. This can be achieved by increasing the diameter of  the core. As the flute helix angle increases, the stiffness of the tool  decreases significantly. High stiffness of the metal cutting tool can be achieved by employing a flute with a variable helix angle.   Conclusion.   The calculated dependences allow the parameters of  the Machine-Device-Tool-Part (MDTP) system to be set with an  acceptable accuracy when analysing metal processing dynamics  using metal cutting tools. The influence of the <b>sharpening</b> <b>angles</b> on  the moment of inertia is demonstrated; the account given for the  latter will significantly increase the reliability of the results of the  analysis of the process dynamics. </p...|$|R

The resulting cut in the material is {{in the direction of}} rotation of the drill bit while the helical shape of a bit allows the removal of the cut material.|$|R
40|$|An {{operation}} has been devised to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux {{in which a}} vertical partition is made parallel to the proximal gastric lesser curvature. The technique, which can be simply, safely and rapidly performed, prevents reflux in the following ways: 1. Increasing the effective length of the 'intra-abdominal oesophagus'; 2. Increasing the crural sling and mucosal flap valve effect; 3. <b>Sharpening</b> the <b>angle</b> of entry into the gastric reservoir; 4. Creating a flutter valve and markedly reducing the gastric cross-sectional area along which reflux can occur. The stomach is neither opened nor divided. The efficacy of the operation was investigated in six dogs which had their lower oesophageal sphincter excised by circular myomectomy before vertical gastric plication. Pre- and postoperative manometric and oesophageal pH studies were performed. Vertical gastric plication prevented the oesophagitis produced by circular myomectomy alone. The {{operation has}} been performed in 26 patients over a 2 -year period. Assessment has been by clinical methods, ambulatory 24 h pH studies and endoscopy. Twenty-one patients were classified in Visick grades I and II and ambulatory pH recordings showed a marked reduction in reflux in 13 of 14 patients. The operation is technically simple, quick and safe to perform, being accurately and scientifically reproducible...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{ascertain}} whether spiking of the tibial tubercle is associated with cartilage defects detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joint. Angulation of the tip of the medial and lateral tubercles, and the height of the tubercles above the tibial plateau were measured on a standard anteroposterior radiograph of the knee joint. Cartilage defects in the tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) were determined by MRI examination. The lengthening and <b>sharpening</b> of the <b>angles</b> of the tubercles were significantly more prominent in the patients than controls. A strong association was found between angulation (if less than 70 degrees) and especially the height (if more than 0. 16) of the medial tibial spike and MRI-detected cartilage defects in the medial tibiofemoral compartment. The predictive value of the spiking of tibial tubercles for MRI-detected cartilage defects in TFJ is related to the degree and size of the spiking. The presence of tibial spiking itself may not be a reliable sign of early OA...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in image quality, data storage, and computational capacity have heightened {{the need for}} texture analysis in image process. To date various methods have been developed and introduced for assessing textures in images. One {{of the most popular}} texture analysis methods is the Texture Energy Measure (TEM) and it has been used for detecting edges, levels, waves, spots and ripples by employing predefined TEM masks to images. Despite several success- ful studies, TEM has a number of serious weaknesses in use. The major drawback is; the masks are predefined therefore they cannot be adapted to image. A new method, Adaptive Texture Energy Measure Method (aTEM), was offered to over- come this disadvantage of TEM by using adaptive masks by adjusting the contrast, <b>sharpening</b> and orientation <b>angle</b> of the mask. To assess the applicability of aTEM, it is compared with TEM. The accuracy of the classification of butterfly, flower seed and Brodatz datasets are 0. 08, 0. 3292 and 0. 3343, respectively by TEM and 0. 0053, 0. 2417 and 0. 3153, respectively by aTEM.

40|$|PURPOSE: Sensation is an {{essential}} aspect of fecal continence. We aimed to correlate manovolumetric and radiologic changes at successive levels of rectal filling sensation. METHODS: Combined anorectal manometry and proctography were performed in nine volunteers. Images, volumes, and pressures were analyzed {{at the start of}} the test, at 20 seconds before first sensation, and at first, constant, urge, and maximum tolerable sensation. RESULTS: Consecutive levels of rectal filling sensation were associated with progressive opening and dilation of the upper anal canal (up to 44 mm) and sliding down of the rectal contents (14 mm), which had already started before the first sensation. This coincided initially with a pressure decrease in the proximal anal canal (from 94 to 42 mmHg). With constant sensation and particularly with urge sensation, rectal pressure increase appeared to be responsible for further proximal anal dilation. This was accompanied by a significant increase of proximal anal pressure (up to 133 mmHg) and <b>sharpening</b> of the <b>angle</b> between the anal axis and the horizontal reference line. CONCLUSION: The proximal anal canal or its surrounding structures play an important role in the desire-to-defecate sensation. They can be activated by a progressive buildup of rectal reservoir pressure in the presence of a competent distal anal sphincter barrier. status: publishe...|$|R
