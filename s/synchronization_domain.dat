40|$|Many {{important}} real-world problems, such as patrol or {{search and}} rescue, {{could benefit from}} the ability to train teams of robots to coordinate. One major challenge to achieving such coordination is determining {{the best way for}} robots on such teams to communicate with each other.

In this way, the robots can evolve their own internal “language” to speak directly brain-to-brain.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a system of}} autonomous ordinary differential equations depending on a small parameter such that the unperturbed system has an invariant manifold of periodic solutions. The problem addressed here is the determination of sufficient geometric conditions {{for some of the}} periodic solutions on this invariant manifold to survive after perturbation. The main idea is to use a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction for an appropriate displacement function in order to obtain the bifurcation function for the problem in a form which can be recognized as a generalization of the subharmonic Melnikov function. Thus, the multidimensional bifurcation problem can be cast in a form where the geometry of the problem is clearly incorporated. An important application can be made in case the uncoupled system of differential equations is a system of oscillators in resonance. In this case the invariant manifold of periodic solutions is just the product of the uncoupled oscillations. When each of the oscillators has one degree of freedom, the bifurcation function is computed by quadrature along the unperturbed oscillations. Additional applications include the computation of entrainment domains for a sinusoidally forced van der Pol oscillator and the computation of mutual <b>synchronization</b> <b>domains</b> for a system of inductively coupled van der Pol oscillators...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The {{application}} of information theory and {{digital signal processing}} techniques to digital communication has resulted in robust methods for reliable high speed data transmission over noisy channels environments. Among these methods, multicarrier systems have become a viable solution for exploiting maximum spectral efficiency over both wideband highly dispersive static and time-varying dynamic channels. However, there remains many problems in this field to maximize performance and efficiency of such systems. Among these problems, equalization and synchronization are the major focus of this thesis. The contribution of this thesis on equalization is to optimize performance of equalizer from two different aspects: computational complexity and system capacity. A new fast equalization algorithm is developed to obtain near optimum setting of the equalizer under {{minimum mean square error}} criterion. Furthermore, a mathematical framework for analysis of maximum capacity equalization is developed. It is shown that the optimum equalization of multi-carrier system {{can be viewed as a}} constrained optimization problem where the constraint set exhibits identifiable geometric characteristic. Using these properties, a descent gradient search method for optimum equalization of multi-carrier systems is proposed.

30|$|As for the {{synchronization}} functionalities {{in case of}} spectrally agile radios, it {{is clear}} that synchronization parameter estimation cannot be implemented in time domain before major part of the selectivity is implemented and strong interferers are suppressed.

Therefore, in the context of cognitive radio, there is a strong motivation to develop synchronization methods which are operating in frequency domain, utilizing the subchannel signals only. However, for compensation of coarse <b>synchronization</b> errors, time <b>domain</b> methods are still favorable. In the following discussion, it is assumed that coarse timing and frequency offsets have been compensated in time domain.

40|$|Several {{types of}} {{industrial}} Real-Time Ethernet (RTE) networks could {{be present in}} the same plant. This work deals with the clock synchronization problems that arise when different RTE network infrastructures are interconnected. Specifically, this paper is focused on the exploitation of PROFINET IO Conformance Class C infrastructure for the interconnection of other industrial communication devices or measurement instruments that use IEEE 1588 for clock synchronization. Actually, such devices (e. g., LXI instruments, EtherNet/IP devices, etc.) cannot be satisfactorily synchronized if directly connected to the PROFINET infrastructure, because of the large time errors (up to 100 us). The solution proposed in this paper is an intelligent clock synchronization converter that has fewer limitations if compared with other systems, like boundary clocks. The basic idea is the creation of a "black-box" (a sort of remote bridging device) for the interconnection of IEEE 1588 nodes through a PROFINET IO host plant, with zero-configuration on both systems. The proposed approach differs from boundary clock since its goal is to keep the PROFINET IO and the IEEE 1588 <b>synchronization</b> <b>domains</b> separated, exploiting the possibility to tunnel the IEEE 1588 time information through the PROFINET IO infrastructure with sufficient precision. In order to verify the practical feasibility of the proposed solution, LXI Class B instruments have been connected to the infrastructure of a real PROFINET IO network. The results show that the standard deviation of the synchronization accuracy is only 10 ns higher than the one measured {{in the case of a}} dedicated (separated) network for the LXI instruments...|$|R

30|$|The {{increasing}} practical {{interest in}} filter bank multicarrier systems for next-generation wireless communication systems raises {{the demand for}} efficient synchronization methods making use of the favorable frequency containment of the filter bank to improve robustness in spectrum sharing scenarios. The focus of this work is on offset quadrature amplitude modulation orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OQAM-OFDM), since this modulation scheme provides optimal bandwidth efficiency with respect to symbol density in the time-frequency grid [1]. Common data-aided synchronization schemes, e.g., [2], use the time domain signal for symbol timing offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation. In this case, the analysis filter bank at the receiver is not involved and the advantage of separation of subchannels offered by the filter bank multicarrier systems is disregarded.

In this article, we introduce periodic team <b>synchronization</b> (PTS) <b>domains</b> as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously with low communication, but {{in which they can}} periodically synchronize in a full-communication setting. The two main contributions of this article are a flexible team agent structure and a method for inter-agent communication in domains with unreliable, single-channel, low-bandwidth communication. First, the novel team agent structure allows agents to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration between agents through the introduction of formations.

30|$|In this contribution, {{we showed}} that frame {{detection}} and synchronization can efficiently and satisfactorily be achieved in the frequency domain, {{taking advantage of the}} analysis filter bank at the receiver side. Our analysis concludes that, in theory, frequency <b>domain</b> <b>synchronization</b> schemes achieve a similar performance as time domain approaches. This is indicated by the Cramér-Rao bounds that have been derived as part of this work. In practice, the results reveal that the performance of the algorithms strongly depends on the interference introduced by the carrier frequency offset. This drawback is removed effectively by the introduction of a frequency correction stage, leading to a bit error rate that is close to the ideal one. Even though the complexity analysis demonstrates that the frequency domain approach calls for a significantly higher computational effort, its advantage lies in shared spectrum scenarios where frequency bands, which are assigned to individual users or systems, can be synchronized and processed separately.|$|R
