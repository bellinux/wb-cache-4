40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{emotional}} pain of being outshone by a <b>second</b> <b>party</b> leads to the malicious pleasure of schadenfreude when this <b>second</b> <b>party</b> subsequently suffers a misfortune. However, direct tests of this idea are rare, especially at the intergroup level. Thus, the authors presented participants with their country's defeat in international competition by a <b>second</b> <b>party</b> and then presented this <b>second</b> <b>party</b> as failing. Participants' dejection at their in-group's defeat led to schadenfreude toward the <b>second</b> <b>party.</b> Consistent with the notion that it affirms the self, schadenfreude toward the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> was associated with positive evaluation of the in-group. Dejection at defeat by a <b>second</b> <b>party</b> also led to schadenfreude toward a third party who had not defeated the in-group. Schadenfreude toward the third party was associated with negative evaluation of the third party rather than positive evaluation of the in-group. As such schadenfreude toward the third party was more malicious...|$|R
50|$|A {{creditor}} {{is a party}} (e.g. person, organization, company, or government) {{that has}} a claim on {{the services of a}} <b>second</b> <b>party.</b> It is a person or institution to whom money is owed. The first party, in general, has provided some property or service to the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> under the assumption (usually enforced by contract) that the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> will return an equivalent property and service. The <b>second</b> <b>party</b> is frequently called a debtor or borrower. The first party is the creditor, which is the lender of property, service or money.|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} of a {{zero-knowledge}} password proof is in authentication systems where one party wants to prove its identity to a <b>second</b> <b>party</b> using a password but doesn't want the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> or anybody else to learn anything about the password.|$|R

50|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of estoppel by acquiescence is applied when one party gives legal notice to a <b>second</b> <b>party</b> of a fact or claim, and the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> fails to challenge or refute that claim {{within a reasonable}} time. The <b>second</b> <b>party</b> {{is said to have}} acquiesced to the claim, and is estopped from later challenging it, or making a counterclaim. The doctrine is different from estoppel by laches to the extent that a lache may be involuntary but acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of aquiescence.|$|R
5000|$|In commerce, a [...] "third-party source" [...] means a {{supplier}} (or service provider) {{who is not}} directly controlled by either the seller (first party) or the customer/buyer (<b>second</b> <b>party)</b> in a business transaction. The third party is considered independent from the other two, even if hired by them, because not all control is vested in that connection. There can be multiple third-party sources {{with respect to a}} given transaction, between the first and <b>second</b> <b>parties.</b> A second-party source would be under direct control of the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> in the transaction.|$|R

5000|$|In such cases, {{the burden}} of proof lies on the first of said parties (e.g. the government, parent, or doctor) to {{disprove}} undue influence on the <b>second</b> <b>party.</b> This requires the dominant party to establish that the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> [...] "knew and understood what he or she was doing, and that he or she was acting independently of the influence of the dominant party". One influential factor in deciding whether the <b>second</b> <b>party</b> was acting independently is whether he or she was given an independent advice, while such an advice is not indispensable for rebutting the presumption.|$|R

We apply the classification analysis by El-Gamal and Grether (1995) {{and find that}} a parsimonious model assuming subjects are either envious or selfish best explains the punishment from both third and <b>second</b> <b>parties.</b> Third and <b>second</b> <b>parties</b> punish richer co-players, even if they chose a socially or Pareto-efficient allocation or if they are merely bystanders who made no choice. Despite their unaffected position, we do not find that third parties punish in a more impartial or normative manner. Envy, fairness, inequity aversion, norms, punishment, reciprocity...|$|R
