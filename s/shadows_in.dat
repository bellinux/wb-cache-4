5|$|Petrol cans {{were stacked}} {{along the sides}} of {{existing}} revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of petrol were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit trenches.|$|E

The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode {{prior to its}} airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with the third part updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Victim was {{released}} on LaserDisc in 1986 by RKO Home Video, and on VHS in 2002. It made its DVD debut on October 8, 2005, in a five-disc box set titled the Val Lewton Collection, comprising nine horror films released by RKO and produced by Lewton. Other films in the set include Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Ghost Ship. The Seventh Victim was also paired on a single-disc DVD alongside <b>Shadows</b> <b>in</b> the Dark, a documentary on Lewton's career. The film {{has not yet been}} released on Blu-ray.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuous}} <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> {{the south}} polar craters cause the floors of these formations {{to maintain a}} temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far-side, suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E
5|$|Van Dyke {{intended}} {{the picture to}} depict the corrupting influence white culture had on the Eskimos, much {{as he had done}} in White <b>Shadows</b> <b>in</b> the South Seas. The script originally ended with Mala and Iva escaping onto the ice, only to drown. But producer Hunt Stromberg felt this ending was too downbeat, and changed it in April 1932 to the ending now seen on film.|$|E

Riley fights {{his way into the}} belfry and while he's embattled, Buffy crashes through a window, fighting. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with Buffy. She fights while he stares, unmoving. When a minion pins her down she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates wildly for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. Buffy screams until the heads of The Gentlemen and their minions explode.|$|E

5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , comments in The <b>Shadows</b> <b>in</b> the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a middle-class}} family in Surrey, Valiente began {{practicing}} magic while a teenager. Working {{as a translator}} at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, she also married twice in this period. Developing her interest in occultism after the war, she began practicing ceremonial magic with a friend while living in Bournemouth. Learning of Wicca, in 1953 she was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition by its founder, Gerald Gardner. Soon becoming the High Priestess of Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, she helped him to produce or adapt many important scriptural texts for Wicca, such as The Witches Rune and the Charge of the Goddess, which were incorporated into the early Gardnerian Book of <b>Shadows.</b> <b>In</b> 1957, a schism resulted in Valiente and her followers leaving Gardner to form their own short-lived coven. After investigating the Wiccan tradition of Charles Cardell, in 1963 she was initiated into Raymond Howard's Coven of Atho. In 1964 she then went to work with Robert Cochrane in his coven, the Clan of Tubal Cain, although she later broke from this group.|$|E
5|$|Monet's use {{of colored}} shadows arose from color {{theories}} that were {{popular in the}} 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832) published {{one of the first}} modern descriptions of colored <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (16431727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (17861889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work. Georges Seurat (18591891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (18311902).|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{has been}} an object of veneration in many {{cultures}} throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun {{was thought to be}} a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|Versions of Gill Sans {{were created}} {{in a wide range}} of styles such as {{condensed}} and shadowed weights. An ultra-light version slightly lighter than the normal light style was also not digitally available until the 2015 Nova release. Several shadowed designs were released, including a capitals-only regular shadowed design and a light-shadowed version with deep relief <b>shadows.</b> <b>In</b> the metal type era, a 'cameo ruled' design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available. The shadowed weights were intended to be used together with the regular, printing in different colours, to achieve a simple multicolour effect. Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office, with Gill examining, critiquing and approving the designs sent to him by post. The long series of extensions, redrawings and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype's most important designs (extending long beyond Gill's death) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases. A book weight was created in 1993 in between the light and regular weight, suitable for body text, along with a heavy weight.|$|E
