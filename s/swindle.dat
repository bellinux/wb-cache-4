5|$|The Great Rock 'n' Roll <b>Swindle,</b> {{the soundtrack}} album for the still-uncompleted film, was {{released}} by Virgin Records on 24 February 1979. It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the Sex Pistols: There are the new recordings with vocals by Jones, Vicious, Cook, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as Edward Tudor-Pole, briefly considered as a permanent replacement for Rotten. McLaren himself takes the mic {{for a couple of}} numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album is completed by a couple of tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols classics. Four Top Ten singles were culled from the <b>Swindle</b> recordings, one more than had appeared on Never Mind the Bollocks.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, {{to a maximum of}} $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the serial numbers to the general public. In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to <b>swindle</b> $30,000 from a Newsweek reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.|$|E

50|$|In <b>Swindling</b> and Selling, Leff {{presented}} a wry {{analysis of the}} blurry lines between what we consider honest salesmanship and illegal fraud. Not all selling is <b>swindling,</b> but all <b>swindling</b> is selling, Leff explains. He shows how both sellers and swindlers have to overcome similar forms of buyer resistance. Leff explains these dynamics {{in the language of}} Erving Goffman and through some use of behavioral economics.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} four Sex Pistols reunited in 1996 for {{the six-month}} Filthy Lucre Tour, which included dates in Europe, North and South America, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. The band members' {{access to the}} archives associated with The Great Rock 'n' Roll <b>Swindle</b> facilitated {{the production of the}} 2000 documentary The Filth and the Fury. This film—directed, like its predecessor, by Temple—was formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to Swindles focus on McLaren and the media. In 2002—the year of the Queen's Golden Jubilee—the Sex Pistols reunited again to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. In 2003, their Piss Off Tour took them around North America for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|When {{the report}} was {{submitted}} to the House of Representatives, detractors soon began to speak against it. The notion of programs that resembled British practice were wicked along {{with the power of}} balance being shifted away from the Representatives to the executive branch were some of the prejudices that resided within the House. William Maclay suspected that several congressmen were involved in government securities, saw Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators. Congressman James Jackson also spoke against New York, with allegations of speculators attempting to <b>swindle</b> those who had not yet heard about Hamilton's report.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{a string}} of {{religious}} cult scandals making news headlines such as Sung Chi-li <b>swindling</b> NT$3 billion and Master Miao Tien <b>swindling</b> NT$2 billion, the Executive Yuan organized {{for the first time}} a forum to discuss the role and regulation of religion in Taiwan. The forum was held in Taipei on November 8, 1996 and attended by 110 senior government officials, religious leaders and scholars from 12 religious communities. The forum blamed the public's ignorance that allowed cult <b>swindling</b> to thrive.|$|R

5|$|While Allen's {{service as}} a judge in Vermont was brief, he {{continued}} to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to <b>swindle</b> Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release {{while he was in}} Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there, and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.|$|E
5|$|Monroe Edwards (1808– January 27, 1847) was an American slave trader, forger {{and convicted}} {{criminal}} {{who was the}} subject of a well-publicized trial and conviction in 1842. Originally from Kentucky, Edwards moved to New Orleans then settled in Texas. He smuggled slaves into Brazil in 1832, and used the proceeds to purchase land in Texas. In 1836 he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to <b>swindle</b> his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the Republic of Texas to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various abolitionists in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a <b>swindle</b> involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her {{to go along with}} the plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries were years of {{lawlessness}} on Lundy, {{particularly during the}} ownership of Thomas Benson (1708-1772), a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom {{he was supposed to}} be deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (1694–1754) (who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall), at a rent of £60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance <b>swindle.</b> He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of pewter and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.|$|E
