The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing {{to keep up with}} the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent <b>single</b> larger <b>diaphragm.</b>|$|R

However, temperature gradients through the thickness may exist in the composites, especially for thick, high temperature, semicrystalline composites.

Therefore, investigating temperature profile through the thickness during processing can improve the quality of SDF composite parts. A laboratory scale SDF with a cooling system was built for the temperature study through the thickness. Carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulphide (carbon/PPS) was used for the temperature study, and the effect of cooling rate on the nonisothermal crys-tallization of the carbon/PPS was also investigated using differential scanning calori-meter.

40|$|RATIONALE: Recently, we {{have shown}} that Ca 2 +-activated force {{generation}} in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>single</b> fibers is impaired in patients with mild to moderate {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). For optimal active-force generation, the passive elasticity provided by titin is indispensable. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we determined the passive-tension-length relations of single fibers of patients with mild to moderate COPD, hypothesizing that passive-elastic properties of diaphragm fibers are compromised. METHODS: Passive-tension-length relations were determined in diaphragm fibers from patients with and without COPD (predicted mean FEV 1, 76 and 102 %, respectively). In diaphragm homogenates titin expression was studied at the protein level by gel electrophoresis and at the transcript level by using a novel titin exon microarray. RESULTS: Diaphragm fibers from patients with COPD generate less passive tension on stretch. Titin content in the diaphragm did not differ between patients with and without COPD. However, titin exon transcript studies revealed up-regulation of seven exons, which code for spring elements in the elastic segment rich in proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated elevated protein expression of the up-regulated splice variant in the COPD diaphragm. Simulation studies on titin molecules including the amino acids encoded by the seven up-regulated exons predicted reduced passive-tension generation on molecule stretch. CONCLUSIONS: Passive-tension generation of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>single</b> fibers is reduced in patients with COPD. Our results suggest that alternative splicing of the titin gene, resulting in increased length of the elastic segment rich in proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine, is involved.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the dissertation work {{is to examine the}} capacity of precast concrete diaphragms. This work is part of a multi-university research effort to develop a new seismic design methodology for precast/prestressed concrete floor diaphragms. To accomplish this, two-dimensional finite element (FE) models of precast floor diaphragms are created, including new elements to match the response of reinforcing details under combined forces. Using these models, nonlinear static "pushover" analyses are performed by applying body forces in the plane of the floor. The analyses are composed of three major parts:(1) Parametric studies to determine the required diaphragm shear strength relative to design (flexural) strength, termed "shear reinforcement overstrength", to promote a ductile mechanism in precast diaphragms. The performance of precast diaphragms with different shear reinforcement overstrength is examined. Appropriate shear reinforcement overstrength design factors are proposed to produce certain performance targets, in terms of a number of key parameters related to diaphragm geometry and the properties of the diaphragm reinforcing details. (2) Parametric studies {{to examine the effects of}} "secondary" diaphragm elements (spandrels, internal beams) on precast diaphragm behavior. Though not directly counted in design to participate diaphragm action, the secondary elements and their connections to the main diaphragm may modify the strength, stiffness and deformation capacity of the diaphragm. Analytical studies are performed to examine their effect on the global characteristics and local demands of precast floor diaphragms. The parameters evaluated include the characteristics of the connection details, the seismic hazard level used in design, diaphragm geometry, and layouts of spandrels and internal beams.

In this work, the deflections of orthotropic silicon circular diaphragms which are orientated against the (100) and the (110) planes are presented. It is found that by assuming silicon is isotropic material, the maximum stress is underestimated by 9. 4 % for (110) orientated silicon diaphragms, while the maximum stress is underestimated by 8 % for (100) orientated silicon diaphragms. Therefore, when a silicon diaphragm is used in a MEMS sensor, the orthotropic properties should be taken into account for accuracy.

However, {{the nature of this}} diaphragm weakness is still unknown. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether changes at the sarcomeric level contribute to diaphragm weakness in PH. For this purpose, in control rats and rats with monocrotaline-induced PH, contractile performance and myosin heavy chain content of demembranated <b>single</b> <b>diaphragm</b> fibers were determined. We observed a reduced maximal tension of 20 % (P < 0. 05), whereas tension cost was preserved in type 2 X and 2 B diaphragm fibers in PH compared with control. The reduced maximal tension was associated with a reduction of force generated per half-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain content. Additionally, reduced Ca(2 +) sensitivity of force generation was found in type 2 X fibers compared with control, which could exacerbate diaphragm muscle weakness at submaximal activation. No changes in maximal tension and Ca(2 +) sensitivity of force generation were observed in fibers from the nonrespiratory extensor digitorum longus muscle. Together, these findings indicate that diaphragm weakness in PH is at least partly caused by sarcomeric dysfunction, which appears to be specific for the diaphragm...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{respiratory}} muscles, force {{generation and}} shortening {{depend on the}} cyclical interaction of actin and myosin (cross-bridge cycling). During crossbridge cycling, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolysed. The globular head region of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) possesses both the binding site to actin and the site for ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, the MyHC is both a structural and enzymatic protein. Different isoforms of MyHC are expressed in skeletal muscle fibres, and these MyHC isoforms provide mechanical and metabolic diversity. In the present study, the relationships between MyHC isoform expression in single rat diaphragm muscle fibres and their mechanical and energetic properties were evaluated. The expression of MyHC isoforms in <b>single</b> <b>diaphragm</b> muscle fibres was identified using electrophoretic and immunohistochemical techniques. Cross-bridge cycling kinetics in diaphragm muscle fibres clearly depend on MyHC isoform expression, and these differences are interpreted {{in the context of}} Huxley's two-state crossbridge model. It is concluded that the unique mechanical and energetic properties of myosin heavy chain isoforms are designed to accomplish different motor behaviours of the diaphragm muscle, and that, {{as a result of these}} unique properties, a selective recruitment of diaphragm muscle fibres is essential to avoid fatigue...|$|E

Unheated helium {{was used as the}} driver gas and most data were obtained at pressures of approximately 34 and 54 MN/sq m. A range of pressure ratio across the diaphragm was obtained by varying the quiescent test-gas pressure, for a given driver pressure, from 0. 0276 to 34. 5 kN/sq m. Single- and double-diaphragm modes of operation were employed and diaphragms of various materials tested. Shock velocity was determined from microwave interferometer measurements, response of pressure transducers positioned along interferometer measurements, response of pressure transducers positioned along the driven section (time-of-arrival gages), and to a lesser extent, measured tube-wall pressure. Velocities obtained from these methods are compared and limitations of the methods discussed. The present results are compared with theory and the effects of <b>diaphragm</b> mode (<b>single</b> or double <b>diaphragm),</b> diaphragm material, heating of the driver gas upon pressurization of the driver section, diaphragm opening time, interface mixing, and two-dimensional (nonplanar) flow are discussed...|$|R
