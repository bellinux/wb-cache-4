50|$|Garter <b>stall</b> {{plates are}} small {{enamelled}} brass plates located in St George's Chapel displaying {{the names and}} arms of the Knights of the Garter. Each knight is allotted a <b>stall</b> in St George's Chapel and the <b>stall</b> plate is affixed to his personal <b>stall.</b> His successor knight in that <b>stall</b> adds his own <b>stall</b> plate and thus a fairly complete series of <b>stall</b> plates survives for the successive occupants of each <b>stall.</b> Many other ancient European Orders of Chivalry use similar <b>stall</b> plates in the home church or other building of their order.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stall</b> flutter is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon resulting in unwanted oscillatory loads on the blade, such as wind turbine blade, helicopter rotor blade, and other flexible wing blades. Although the <b>stall</b> flutter and related aeroelastic control {{have been studied}} theoretically and experimentally, microtab control of asymmetric limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) in <b>stall</b> flutter cases has not been generally investigated. This paper presents an aeroservoelastic model to study the microtab control of the blade section undergoing moderate <b>stall</b> flutter and deep <b>stall</b> flutter separately. The effects of different dynamic <b>stall</b> conditions and the consequent asymmetric LCOs for both <b>stall</b> cases are simulated and analyzed. Then, {{for the design of}} the <b>stall</b> flutter controller, the potential sensor signal for the <b>stall</b> flutter, the microtab control capability of the <b>stall</b> flutter, and the control algorithm for the <b>stall</b> flutter are studied. The improvement and the superiority of the proposed adaptive <b>stall</b> flutter controller are shown by comparison with a simple <b>stall</b> flutter controller...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated unsteady {{events such}} as <b>stall</b> inception, stall-cell development, and surge. <b>Stall</b> {{is characterized by a}} decrease in overall pressure rise and nonaxisymmetric throughflow. Compressor <b>stall</b> can lead to surge which is characterized by quasi-axisymmetric fluctuations in mass flow and pressure. Unsteady measurements of the flow field around the compressor rotor are examined. During the <b>stall</b> inception process, initial disturbances were found within the rotor passage near the tip region. As the <b>stall</b> cell develops, blade lift and pressure ratio decrease within the <b>stall</b> cell and increase ahead of the <b>stall</b> cell. The <b>stall</b> inception event, stall-cell development, and <b>stall</b> recovery event were found to be nearly identical for stable rotating <b>stall</b> and surge cases. As the <b>stall</b> cell grows, {{the leading edge of the}} cell will rotate at a higher rate than the trailing edge in the rotor frame. The opposite occurs during <b>stall</b> recovery. The trailing edge of the <b>stall</b> cell will rotate at the approximate speed as the fully developed <b>stall</b> cell, while the leading edge decreases in rotational speed in the rotor frame...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the numerical analysis}} of a <b>stall</b> suppression system for helicopter rotors. The analysis employs a finite element method and includes advanced dynamic <b>stall</b> and vortex wake models. The <b>stall</b> suppression system {{is based on a}} transfer function matrix approach and uses blade root actuation to suppress <b>stall</b> directly. The rotor model used in this investigation is the UH- 60 A rotor. At a severe <b>stalled</b> condition, the analysis predicts three distinct <b>stall</b> events spreading over the retreating side of the rotor disk. Open loop results show that 2 P input can reduce <b>stall</b> only moderately, while the other input harmonics are less effective. The responses of the <b>stall</b> index, a measure of <b>stall,</b> to individual input harmonics are highly nonlinear. Such nonlinear <b>stall</b> behavior makes the closed-loop controller ineffective in suppressing <b>stall</b> and the combined effects of individual harmonics nonadditive. Also, <b>stall</b> reduction does not guarantee gains in rotor performance. 1...|$|R

5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program.

5|$|After <b>stalling</b> {{several hundred}} {{kilometres}} offshore, the storm weakened over cooler waters {{that it had}} upwelled. By May27, the system weakened to a cyclonic storm and by this time was approaching the northwestern coastline of India, near Gujarat. The following day, the storm made landfall in the Saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of 55km/h (35mph 3-minute winds). The depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on May29.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and <b>stalling</b> with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E
50|$|A {{rotational}} <b>stall</b> may be momentary, {{resulting from}} an external disturbance, {{or may be}} steady as the compressor finds a working equilibrium between <b>stalled</b> and unstalled areas. Local <b>stalls</b> substantially reduce {{the efficiency of the}} compressor and increase the structural loads on the airfoils encountering <b>stall</b> cells in the region affected. In many cases however, the compressor airfoils are critically loaded without capacity to absorb the disturbance to normal airflow such that the original <b>stall</b> cells affect neighbouring regions and the <b>stalled</b> region rapidly grows to become a complete compressor <b>stall.</b>|$|R

5|$|But strategically, Smith {{was most}} {{associated}} with his implementation of John McLendon's four corners offense, {{a strategy for}} <b>stalling</b> with a lead {{near the end of}} the game. Smith's teams executed the four corners set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft {{found that it was}} barely a tropical storm. After <b>stalling</b> during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the ordered hit, Sullivan begins robbing banks that hold Capone’s money, hoping to trade it for Connor. Sullivan is impeded when the mob withdraws its money, so he visits Rooney's accountant Alexander Rance at his hotel. The encounter is a set-up, with Rance <b>stalling</b> Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. In the ensuing crossfire, Rance is killed, Maguire is injured by flying glass shards, and Sullivan escapes with the ledgers; as Sullivan flees, Maguire shoots him in his left arm.|$|E
40|$|Lameness in {{dairy cows}} {{continues}} to be a major problem for the industry world-wide. Prevalence appears higher in free <b>stall</b> housed dairy herds than in tie <b>stall</b> herds in Wisconsin, and is especially a problem in free <b>stall</b> herds using mat or mattress <b>stall</b> surfaces compared to those herds using sand. This article describes some of the behavioral differences which contribute to this difference. In particular, lame cows housed in mattress free <b>stall</b> barns appear to spend longer standing in the <b>stall,</b> compared to lame cows in sand <b>stalls.</b> This time spent standing appears to reflect a difficulty in performing the process of lying down and standing up. Future <b>stall</b> design recommendations must be based on providing a <b>stall</b> in which lame cows can maintain normal daily activity patterns...|$|R
