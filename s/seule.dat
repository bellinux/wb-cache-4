500|$|After France's defeat by Prussia, {{there was}} a brief, bloody {{conflict}} within Paris from March to May 1871 during the Commune. Fauré escaped to Rambouillet where one of his brothers lived, and then travelled to Switzerland, where he took up a teaching post at the École Niedermeyer, which had temporarily relocated there to avoid the violence in Paris. His first pupil at the school was André Messager, who became a lifelong friend and occasional collaborator. Fauré's compositions from this period did not overtly reflect the turmoil and bloodshed. Some of his colleagues, including Saint-Saëns, Gounod and Franck produced elegies and patriotic odes. Fauré did not, but according to his biographer Jessica Duchen, his music acquired [...] "a new sombreness, a dark-hued sense of tragedy... evident mainly in his songs of this period including L'Absent, <b>Seule!</b> and La Chanson du pêcheur." ...|$|E

50|$|By 1984, as his comic-book {{distribution}} business occupied more time, and as other comics conventions, {{most notably in}} San Diego and Chicago, became larger, more prominent, and more commercial- rather than fan-driven, <b>Seuling</b> segued the Independence Day-centered Comic Art Convention into the smaller Manhattan Con, {{which took place in}} mid-June. <b>Seuling</b> died unexpectedly in August 1984, and the Comic Art Convention/Manhattan Con died with him.|$|R

2500|$|The key {{component}} of Vichy's ideology was Anglophobia. In part, Vichy's virulent Anglophobia was due to its leaders' personal dislike of the British, as Marshal Pétain, Pierre Laval and Admiral François Darlan were all Anglophobes. As early as February 1936, Pétain had told the Italian Ambassador to France that [...] "England has always been France's most implacable enemy"; {{he went on to}} say that France had [...] "two hereditary enemies", namely Germany and Britain, with the latter being easily the more dangerous of the two; and he wanted a Franco-German-Italian alliance that would partition the British Empire, an event that Pétain claimed would solve all of the economic problems caused by the Great Depression. Beyond that, in order to justify both the armistice with Germany and the Révolution nationale, Vichy needed to portray the French declaration of war on Germany as a hideous mistake, and the French society under the Third Republic as degenerate and rotten. The Révolution nationale together with Pétain's policy of la France <b>seule</b> ("France alone") were meant to [...] "regenerate" [...] France from la décadence that was said to have destroyed French society and brought about the defeat of 1940. Such a harsh critique of French society could only generate so much support, and as such Vichy blamed French problems on various [...] "enemies" [...] of France, the chief of which was Britain, the [...] "eternal enemy" [...] that had supposedly conspired via Masonic lodges first to weaken France and then to pressure France into declaring war on Germany in 1939. No other nation was attacked as frequently and violently as Britain was in Vichy propaganda. In Pétain's radio speeches, Britain was always portrayed as the [...] "Other", a nation that was the complete antithesis of everything good in France, the blood-soaked [...] "perfidious Albion" [...] and the relentless [...] "eternal enemy" [...] of France whose ruthlessness knew no bounds. The chief themes of Vichy Anglophobia were British [...] "selfishness" [...] in using and abandoning France after instigating wars, British [...] "treachery" [...] and British plans to take over French colonies. The three examples that were used to illustrate these themes were the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, the Royal Navy attack at Mers-el-Kébir on the French Mediterranean fleet that killed over 1,300 French sailors in July 1940, and the failed Anglo-Free French attempt to seize Dakar in September 1940. Typical of Vichy anti-British propaganda was the widely distributed pamphlet published in August 1940 and written by self-proclaimed [...] "professional Anglophobe" [...] Henri Béraud titled Faut-il réduire l'Angleterre en esclavage? ("Should England Be Reduced to Slavery?"); the question in the title was merely rhetorical. Additionally, Vichy mixed Anglophobia with racism and antisemitism to portray the British as a racially degenerate [...] "mixed race" [...] working for Jewish capitalists, in contrast to the [...] "racially pure" [...] peoples on the continent of Europe who were building a [...] "New Order". In an interview conducted by Béraud with Admiral Darlan published in Gringoire newspaper in 1941, Darlan was quoted as saying that if the [...] "New Order" [...] failed in Europe it would mean [...] "...here in France, the return to power of the Jews and Freemasons subservient to Anglo-Saxon policy".|$|E
