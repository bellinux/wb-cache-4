5|$|In 2002, then-San Francisco Supervisor Newsom {{promoted}} the Care Not Cash program which cut county general assistance programs {{to be replaced}} with housing {{and other forms of}} service. He also promoted a 2003 ban (Proposition M: Aggressive <b>Solicitation</b> Ban) on aggressive panhandling which included a ban for panhandling on public transportation and near ATMs. It also prohibited repeatedly soliciting money, blocking the way, touching or following a person while soliciting, or intentionally trying to intimidate.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} “marketing avoidance ” – consumer efforts to conceal themselves and to deflect marketing. The setting is one where sellers market some item through <b>solicitations</b> to potential consumers, who differ in their benefit from the item and suffer harm from receiving <b>solicitations.</b> We find that seller <b>solicitations</b> are a strategic complement with concealment by low-benefit consumers: efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the cost-effectiveness of <b>solicitations</b> and lead sellers to market more. However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market less. Concealment causes <b>solicitations</b> to be shifted to other consumers, while deflection does not. We show that concealment by low-benefit consumers increases the overall expected harm. To {{the extent that the}} increase in consumer harm outweighs the gain in seller revenue, concealment is also socially worse than deflection. In general, unless the benefit from the marketed item is large relative to the harm caused by <b>solicitations,</b> deflection is socially preferable to concealment...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been growing {{concerns}} about online sexual <b>solicitations</b> and online sexual risk behaviors. Recent studies suggest that {{only a minority of}} adolescents is confronted with online sexual <b>solicitations</b> or engages in online sexual risk behavior. Whereas more girls encounter incidences of online sexual <b>solicitations,</b> gender differences in online sexual risk behavior are relatively small. Older adolescents are more at risk of receiving online sexual <b>solicitations</b> and {{are also more likely to}} engage in online sexual risk behavior. Adolescents do not engage in online sexual risk behavior more frequently than adults, and they seem to be quite aware of the potential negative consequences of this behavior. Adolescents who encounter online sexual <b>solicitations</b> or engage in online sexual risk behavior typically also encounter problems in their offline lives...|$|R
5|$|Teller {{later learned}} of Oppenheimer's <b>solicitation</b> {{and his role}} in the Interim Committee's {{decision}} to drop the bombs, having secretly endorsed an immediate military use of the new weapons. This was contrary to the impression that Teller had received when he had personally asked Oppenheimer about the Szilard petition: that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Following Teller's discovery of this, his relationship with his advisor began to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|Following the ruling, {{the company}} barred the union from soliciting new {{members on the}} company {{property}} and began offering incentives to new workers to sign contracts wherein they promised not to join the union. The AASEREA objected to the company's policy and the prior agreement required the Public Service Commission rule on the matter. The commission sided with the company on both issues on August 26, 1914 and barred union <b>solicitation</b> on company property, and upheld {{the right of the}} company to hire non-union employees.|$|E
5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation, at {{that time}} a {{publicly}} funded community development initiative, leased the struggling Klondike in 1977 and began searching for ways to use the space. A member of the general public, Frank Grisdale, answered the <b>solicitation,</b> writing a paper outlining how the building could be successfully operated as a repertory theatre under its original name. The foundation was apparently impressed by his proposal, and Grisdale was installed as the Princess Theatre's director upon completion of renovations in 1978.|$|E

50|$|The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) permits {{creditors}} and {{insurers to}} use CRA information {{as a basis}} for sending unsolicited firm offers of credit or insurance, also known as prescreened <b>solicitations,</b> to consumers who meet certain criteria, but only within limits specified in the act. The FCRA also provides a mechanism by which consumers can elect not to receive such <b>solicitations</b> by directing CRAs to exclude their names and addresses from lists provided by these agencies for sending prescreened <b>solicitations.</b> Consumers who choose to have their names removed from lists used for prescreened <b>solicitations</b> may well still receive offers of credit or insurance by mail or telephone, but such offers will not be based on the credit records maintained by the CRAs.|$|R

5|$|The {{family was}} {{conceived}} by Groening shortly before a <b>solicitation</b> {{for a series}} of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).|$|E
5|$|While {{the game}} was simply called Magic through most of playtesting, when the game had to be officially named a lawyer {{informed}} them that the name Magic was too generic to be trademarked. Mana Clash was instead chosen to be the name used in the first <b>solicitation</b> of the game, however, everybody involved with the game continued to {{refer to it as}} Magic. After further consultation with the lawyer, it was decided to rename the game Magic: The Gathering, thus enabling the name to be trademarked.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for <b>solicitation.</b> One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

The Confederate Memorial Association engaged in fundraising for construction of the memorial, including sewing circles, bazaars, and fairs. Confederate veterans and others in Hampshire County undertook additional fundraising efforts, including entertainment shows and general <b>solicitation.</b> In addition to raising funds {{for the construction of}} the memorial, the Confederate Memorial Association also raised money for the widows and children of the Confederate dead. By October15, 1866, the gross receipts returned to the association's treasury amounted to $1,170.91 USD, of which the Confederate Memorial Association provided $421.58 USD to the Confederate widows and orphaned children. Fundraising continued until June 1867.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Carol would be filmed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and production offices would open in early January 2014, with filming expected from mid-March through May. In February 2014, the Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky Film Commission released the <b>solicitation</b> from producers for extras and vintage vehicles. Principal photography began on March 12, 2014, at Eden Park in Cincinnati. Various locations around Cincinnati, Ohio were used during production, including Downtown Cincinnati, Hyde Park, Over-the-Rhine, Wyoming, Cheviot, and Hamilton, as well as Alexandria, Kentucky. Except for the Waterloo, Iowa, motel room, which was a set built for privacy during filming of the love scene, actual locations were used for interior and exterior settings. The second floor of a now-defunct department store served as the location for the toy department of the fictional Frankenberg's. Filming was completed on May 2, 2014. The film was shot in 34 days. Edward Lachman shot Carol on Super 16 mm film using 35 mm format lenses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the letter}} column of issue 26, Rucka {{announced}} a six-issue limited series titled Lazarus: X+66 {{would be released}} monthly beginning July 2017. The series is written by Rucka and Troutman, and each issue focuses on an individual supporting character from the main series. Lark is involved as a consultant, and each issue is drawn by a different artist. This {{decision was made to}} give Lark time to work on something unrelated to Lazarus, which had been his only project since the series began. He will return with the main series in 2018. A four-page preview of the first installment, drawn by Steve Lieber, was included with the book's <b>solicitation</b> in Image Plus #16.|$|E

5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith observed a display {{in which the}} male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in <b>solicitation</b> and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's <b>solicitation</b> and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E
