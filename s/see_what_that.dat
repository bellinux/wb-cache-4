It {{was the second}} Office episode to be directed by Randall Einhorn, {{a former director of}} Survivor who also worked as the series' director of photography. In early 2007, series co-creator Greg Daniels explained to an audience at Paleyfest that Einhorn's direction had become [...] "a character in the show because [...] has an enormous amount of judgment/leeway about where he's looking. And often [...] adds a tremendous amount of comedy is the choosing to look over there and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> person thinks and back and forth.

2500|$|While on {{location}} in Nereju, Drăguș and Fundu Moldovei, he expanded the canon of anthropometry, and began recording blood type, investigated the presence and spread of syphilis, and provided free medical consultations to the peasants. Rainer and his specialist unit, including social hygienists, documented the squalid conditions of rural life. At Fundu Moldovei, {{where some of the}} villages were entirely cut off from the outside world, Rainer found that up to 50% of his samples showed contamination with syphilis, forcing him to distribute reserves of neosalvarsan. Stahl, who befriended Rainer in Fundu Moldovei, recalls that the stated purpose of Rainer's visit was an attempt to bridge physiology and sociology: [...] "he did not yet <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> connection might be, but any research should be carried out rigorously, so that, who knows, another generation, more skilled than we are, might come along and use it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014, during PAX Australia, Bethesda officially {{cancelled}} Prey 2. Hines stated, [...] "It {{was a game}} {{we believed}} in, but we never felt that it got to where {{it needed to be}} –– we never saw a path to success if we finished it. It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It’s no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it’s one that won’t surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011. We enjoyed working with the many talented people at Bethesda, and we wish them all the best of luck with any future plans they may have for the franchise." ...|$|E

"I {{have read}} also," [...] said Miss Oliver, [...] "that {{shortly before his}} death he said that his only regret in dying was that he must die before he had <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> 'extremely {{interesting}} young man, the German Emperor,' would do in his life.
