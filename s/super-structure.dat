5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined <b>super-structure</b> of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature to date is their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E

Owing to the crystal symmetry, the tetrahedral coordination between these superstructure units is again a key factor. The supertetrahedron T(1) lies at the body center and at the edge center of the unit cell. The superoctahedra O(1) locate at the body center (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) of the quarter of the unit cell. They coordinate tetrahedrally around T(1) forming a giant tetrahedron. The supertetrahedra T(2) are located at the symmetry-related positions (0.25, 0.25, 0.75); they also form a giant tetrahedron surrounding T(1). Edges of both giant tetrahedra orthogonally cross each other at their centers; at those edge centers, each B10 polyhedron bridges all the <b>super-structure</b> clusters T(1), T(2) and O(1).

We answer the question as to whether we can find a finite and minmalistic set of operations on structural elements in terms of which any theory can be expressed. We identify abstraction (grouping similar entities) and <b>super-structuring</b> (combining topologically e. g., spatio-temporally close entities) as the essential structural operations in the induction process. We show that only two more structural operations, namely, reverse abstraction and reverse <b>super-structuring</b> (the duals of abstraction and <b>super-structuring</b> respectively) suffice in order to exploit the full power of Turing-equivalent generative grammars in induction. We explore the implications of this theorem with respect to the nature of hidden variables, radical positivism and the 2 -century old claim of David Hume about the principles of con-nexion among ideas. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} e. g., biomolecular sequence analysis, image classification, text classification, {{social network}} analysis, among others require classification of topologically structured data, i. e. data whose topology reflects intrinsic dependencies between the constituent elements {{that make up}} the data. Hence, there is a growing need for automated methods for building predictive models from topologically structured data. Machine learning offers a promising approach to the design of algorithms for training computer programs to efficiently and accurately classify topologically structured data. One of the main challenges in learning from topologically structured data {{has to do with the}} representation of the data that is presented to a learner. The representation has to be rich enough to capture distinctions that are relevant from the standpoint of learning, but not so rich as to make the task of learning harder due to overfitting. Against this background, we present an abstraction-based probabilistic approach to learning accurate and, at the same time, compact predictive models from topologically structured data with applications to biological sequence and text data. Specifically, we address the problem of simplifying the data representation used by a learner on sequence classification tasks in two settings: (i) the setting in which sequences are independent and identically distributed and (ii) the setting in which sequences are not independent (e. g., as in the case of protein sequences that are linked by function). Our abstraction-based approach exploits the complementary strengths of <b>super-structuring</b> (constructing complex features by combining existing features) and abstraction (grouping similar features to generate more abstract features). <b>Super-structuring</b> provides a way to increase the predictive accuracy of the learned models by enriching the data representation (hence, <b>super-structuring</b> increases the complexity of the learned models), whereas abstraction helps reduce the number of model parameters by simplifying the data representation. Furthermore, we introduce and study abstraction augmented Markov models (AAMMs). AAMMs are directed acyclic graphical models that capture dependencies between variables and, at the same time, allow for compact representations of conditional probability tables. More precisely, AAMMs simplify the data representation used by the standard MMs by grouping similar entities to generate more abstract entities that are organized in an abstraction hierarchy. Experimental results on text document classification tasks and protein subcellular localization prediction tasks demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach: the results show that simplifying data representation by combining <b>super-structuring</b> and abstraction makes it possible to construct predictive models that use substantially smaller number of features (by one to three orders of magnitude) than those obtained using <b>super-structuring</b> alone (whose size grows exponentially with the length of direct dependencies). <b>Super-structuring</b> and abstraction-based models are competitive with and, in some cases, outperform, models that use only <b>super-structuring.</b> Collectively, the techniques developed in this thesis advance the current state of the art in terms of algorithms for building accurate and concise predictive models from topologically structured data...|$|R

Fortunately, domain knowledge can frequently be exploited to achieve dramatic computational savings, {{and in many cases}} domain knowledge can even make structure learning tractable. Several methods have previously been described for representing this type of structural prior knowledge, including global orderings, <b>super-structures,</b> and constraint rules. While <b>super-structures</b> and constraint rules are flexible in terms of what prior knowledge they can encode, they achieve savings in memory and computational time simply by avoiding considering invalid graphs. We introduce the concept of a “constraint graph” as an intuitive method for incorporating rich prior knowledge into the structure learning task. We describe how this graph can be used to reduce the memory cost and computational time required to find the optimal graph subject to the encoded constraints, beyond merely eliminating invalid graphs. In particular, we show that a constraint graph can break the structure learning task into independent subproblems even in the presence of cyclic prior knowledge. These subproblems are well suited to being solved in parallel on a single machine or distributed across many machines without excessive communication cost...|$|R
