40|$|A binary <b>star</b> is a <b>star</b> system {{consisting}} of two <b>stars</b> orbiting around their common center of mass. The brighter <b>star</b> is called the primary {{and the other is}} its companion <b>star,</b> comes, or secondary.

The term double <b>star</b> may be used synonymously with binary <b>star,</b> but more generally, a double <b>star</b> may be either a binary <b>star</b> or an optical double <b>star</b> which consists of two <b>stars</b> with no physical connection but which appear close together in the sky as seen from the Earth. A double <b>star</b> may be determined to be optical if its components have sufficiently different proper motions or different radial velocities, or if parallax measurements reveal its two components to be at sufficiently different distances from the Earth.
