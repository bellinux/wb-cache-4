50|$|One {{dispersion}} polymerization system {{being studied}} {{is the use}} of <b>supercritical</b> liquid <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (scCO2) as a solvent. Because of its unique solvent properties, supercritical CO2 is an ideal medium for dispersion polymerization for many soluble-monomer with insoluble-polymer systems. For example, polymers can be separated by releasing the high pressure under which the scCO2 is held. This process is more efficient than typical drying processes. Also, the principles of dispersion polymerization with scCO2 follows principles of green chemistry: low solvent toxicity, low waste, efficient atom economy, and avoidance of purification steps.|$|R

A single 45 minute SFE with 2. 7 mol% TBP and 3. 2 mol% TTA provided {{as much as}} 88 % ± 6. 0 extraction of americium and 69 % ± 5. 0 extraction of plutonium. Use of 5. 3 mol% TBP with 6. 8 mol% of the more acidic beta-diketone hexafluoroacetylacetone (HFA) provided 95 % ± 3. 0 extraction of americium and 83 % ± 5. 0 extraction of plutonium in a single 45 minute SFE at 3, 750 psi and 95 °C. Sequential chemical extraction techniques were used to chemically characterize soil partitioning of plutonium and americium in pre-SFE soil samples. Sequential chemical extraction techniques demonstrated that spiked plutonium resides primarily (76. 6 %) in the sesquioxide fraction with minor amounts being absorbed by the oxidizable fraction (10. 6 %) and residual fractions (12. 8 %).

25|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide overcomes many of the {{problems}} with the original industrial process. Because CO2 is a better flame inhibitor than N2, a CO2 environment allows for the use of pure oxygen directly, instead of air, with reduced flammability hazards. The solubility of molecular oxygen in solution is also enhanced in the CO2 environment. Because more oxygen is available to the system, <b>supercritical</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (Tc = 31°C) has more complete oxidation with fewer byproducts, lower carbon monoxide production, less decarboxylation and higher purity than the commercial process.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, {{to develop}} the first aerogels, Kistler used {{a process known as}} {{supercritical}} drying which avoids a direct phase change. By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a supercritical fluid state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with ethanol, the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a CO2-miscible liquid such as ethanol or acetone, then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its critical point. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of <b>supercritical</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.|$|E
