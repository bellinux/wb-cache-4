5|$|Culverhouse's {{investments}} {{included several}} banks, Provincetown-Boston Airlines, the Palmer Ranch {{real estate development}} near Sarasota, Florida, and movie productions including A Chorus Line and The Emerald Forest. He was criticized over a planned extension of Interstate 75 into South Florida, as its route went directly past land owned by numerous powerful investors, including Culverhouse, Governor Bob Graham, <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> Jim Smith, and the Arvida Corporation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the special}} {{election}} held on January 19, 2010, Republican State Senator Scott Brown defeated Democratic <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> Martha Coakley in an upset victory. Brown thus {{became the first}} Republican to be elected from Massachusetts to the United States Senate since Edward Brooke in 1972 and he began serving the remainder of Kennedy's term on February 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy won {{reelection in}} 1952 with 54% of the vote, {{defeating}} former Wisconsin <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> Thomas E.

2500|$|For {{historical}} reasons, {{the term}} United <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> {{is used for}} what in most countries is called the minister of justice because the United <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> {{is in fact the}} head of the United States Justice Department, and the <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> of each US state has a similar role.|$|R
5|$|These {{and several}} other accusations brought public and {{political}} pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second investigations led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice (equivalent to <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General)</b> accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months. On November 29, 1983, three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after {{a report by the}} state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations. This was the third <b>state</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978.|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} private practice, Higginbotham {{simultaneously}} served in several government positions; {{he was a}} special Deputy <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> from 1956 to 1962, a special hearing officer for conscientious objections for the United States Department of Justice from 1960 to 1962, and a Commissioner on the Pennsylvania Human Rights Commission from 1961 to 1962. He was a faculty member of the Rutgers University Law School.|$|E

Though Siegelman is Catholic, his wife Loriwho grew up in Birmingham, Alabamaand two children are Jewish. His daughter Dana celebrated her Bat Mitzvah at the synagogue in February 1998.|$|E
50|$|Every <b>state</b> has an <b>attorney</b> <b>general,</b> who is {{the chief}} legal advisor to the state {{government}} and the state's chief law enforcement officer, analogous to the United <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General.</b> 43 of the states directly elect their <b>attorney</b> <b>general,</b> while the others are selected by the governor, legislature, or <b>state</b> supreme court. <b>Attorneys</b> <b>general</b> often have wide discretion in what cases to prosecute and how to settle cases. <b>State</b> <b>attorneys</b> <b>general</b> can often make an impact even beyond their state, taking part in major challenges to federal laws and prosecuting major national companies. In many <b>states,</b> the <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> is arguably the second most powerful constitutional officer, after the governor.|$|R

The Santa Barbara County District Attorney also announced a misdemeanor count against one of the company’s employees.

5|$|In 1967, Ford ran for {{lieutenant}} governor, {{this time}} against {{the wishes of}} Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> Robert Matthews. Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the primary. He ran an independent campaign and won {{in the general election}} even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn. Republicans and Democrats split the state offices, with five going to Republicans and four going to Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Ned Breathitt {{was born}} in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on November 26, 1924. He was {{the only child of}} Edward Thompson and Mary (Wallace) Breathitt. Breathitt's family had a {{considerable}} tradition in politics. A distant relative, John Breathitt had been governor of Kentucky in 1832. James Breathitt, Sr., Ned Breathitt's grandfather, had served as <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> from 1907 to 1911, and his uncle, James Breathitt, Jr., was lieutenant governor from 1927 to 1932.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bevin faced <b>state</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> Jack Conway, marking the first gubernatorial race {{in state history}} {{featuring}} two candidates from Louisville, the state's largest city. The Kentucky Democratic Party attempted to play up the fractures in the Republican Party over Bevin's candidacy, launching a web site featuring fellow Republicans' criticisms of Bevin, drawn mostly from his primary race against McConnell. Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of rapidly}} {{mounting}} British pressure and an ensuing armed conflict over {{the position of}} the Uitlanders and economic control over the Witwatersrand gold fields, foreign policy in the South African Republic was eventually determined by a triumvirate: State President Kruger, State Secretary Reitz, and <b>State</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> J.C. Smuts. During 1899 they decided that an offensive attitude towards British demands was the only way forward, despite the risks this entailed. Reitz sought and received the support of the Orange Free State for this approach. On 9 October 1899 the South African Republic and the Orange Free State issued a joint ultimatum to the British government to retract their demands.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{was elected}} as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1828 and was re-elected in 1829. Following {{his second term}} in the legislature, he moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, believing it {{provided}} better opportunities for his legal practice. He was appointed as <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> in 1832 and served for five years. In 1834, he co-authored A Digest of the Statute Laws of Kentucky with Mason Brown. He represented Franklin County in the state house from 1838 to 1842 and again in 1844; he was chosen Speaker of the House in 1840, 1841, and 1844.|$|E

5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court {{and replace it with}} a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He is known to have issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the <b>state</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. A Republican in the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E

5|$|Cordray {{announced}} his 2008 candidacy for Ohio <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> on June 11, 2008. He {{was endorsed by}} Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. The vacancy {{in the office of}} the attorney general was created by the May 14, 2008, resignation of Marc Dann who was embroiled in a sex scandal. Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, DeWine, Maureen O'Connor, and Rob Portman declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites (Republican), and Robert M. Owens (Independent). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites. Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association The Columbus Dispatch called into question—and promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience. Cordray asserted that he managed the state's money safely despite the turbulence of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Clements faced Republican <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> Eldon S. Dummit. While Clements {{managed to keep}} the Democrats united {{following}} the primary, Dummit had fractured the Republicans by attacking the administration of sitting Republican governor Simeon S. Willis and his preferred successor during the Republican primary. Dummit mounted a meager challenge by citing Clements' opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, {{but this was not}} very effective. Dummit had replaced his campaign manager from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded the death knell for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general.</b> Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's voters would {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
