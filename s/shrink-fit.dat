The deep rolling treatment can also be efficiently applied to a round shape, which would otherwise be difficult on the flat specimen geometry. After introducing this solution for fretting testing, the paper shows an experimental campaign on three <b>shrink-fitted</b> connections with different sizes and material combinations.

40|$|When {{components}} such as bearings or gears are pressed onto a shaft, {{the resulting}} interference induces a pressure at the interface. The {{size of this}} pressure is important as many components fail because fatigue initiates from press-fit stress concentrations. The aim of the present work was to develop ultrasound {{as a tool for}} non-destructive determination of press-fit contact pressures. An interference fit interface behaves like a spring. If the pressure is high, there are few air gaps, so it is very stiff and allows transmission of an ultrasonic wave. If the pressure is low, then interface stiffness is lower and most ultrasound is reflected. A spring model was used to determine maps of contact stiffness from interference-fit ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure was then used to determine the pressure. The interface contact pressure has been determined for a number of different press- and <b>shrink-fit</b> cases. The results show a central region of approximately uniform pressure with edge stress at the contact sides. The magnitude of the pressure in the central region agrees well with the elastic Lamé analysis. In the more severe press-fit cases, the surfaces scuffed which led to anomalies in the reflected ultrasound. These anomalies were associated with regions of surface damage at the interface. The average contact pressure in a <b>shrink-fit</b> and press-fit joint were similar. However, in the <b>shrink-fit</b> joint more uneven contact pressure was observed with regions of poor conformity.

40|$|Cylindrical shells {{have large}} {{industrial}} applications ranging from pressure vessels, engine cylinders and hydraulic chambers to chemical and {{power plants and}} they are typically subjected to severe mechanical or thermo-mechanical environmental conditions. The fatigue life, pressure and thermal load bearing capacities of thick-walled cylinders can be considerably improved by inducing near the bore compressive residual hoop stresses. <b>Shrink-fit</b> and autofrettage processes have been effectively applied to generate favorable compressive residual stresses. The main goal of this research study is to fundamentally investigate the compound cylinders subjected to autofrettage and <b>shrink-fit</b> processes and develop new design processing technique and practical design optimization strategies to enhance their fatigue life under cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. First, the residual stresses of compound cylinders subjected to different combinations of <b>shrink-fit</b> and autofrettage processes have been evaluated using the developed finite element model in the ANSYS environment. The stresses due to different cyclic thermo-mechanical loads have also been calculated for the different combinations of compound cylinders considering the fully coupled thermo-elastic finite element model. To validate the finite element model, an experimental setup {{has been designed to}} measure the temperature history at three different locations through the wall thickness and also hoop strain at the outer surface of a two-layer compound cylinder under internal quasi-static and cyclic thermal loads. The experimental results have then been compared with those obtained from the finite element model. Moreover, to compare the performance of compound cylinders under different thermo-mechanical loads, the fatigue life due to cyclic pressure, cyclic thermal pulses and cyclic combined thermo-mechanical pulses has been calculated using ASME code for high pressure vessel. Next, to enhance the residual stress distribution along the wall thickness of the cylinder, a new double autofrettage process has been introduced. In the proposed double autofrettage process, an outer autofrettage cycle is performed prior to a standard inner autofrettage cycle. This can provide an increase in the beneficial compressive residual stresses at the near bore area of the cylinder while decreasing the detrimental tensile residual stress at the outer part of the cylinder. The proposed process has then been utilized to construct new combinations of autofrettage, <b>shrink-fit</b> and double autofrettage processes. The residual stress distribution through the thickness and fatigue life of these new combinations have been evaluated and compared with those based on conventional combinations of <b>shrink-fit</b> and autofrettage processes. Finally, a practical design optimization methodology has been developed to identify the optimal configuration of autofrettaged and shrink-fitted cylinders. Optimization problems based on the high-fidelity finite element model is computationally very expensive and may not render accurate optimum results. Considering this in the presented research, design of experiment (DOE) and response surface method (RSM) have been used in combination with the finite element model to create smooth response surface functions which can accurately describe the behavior of the residual hoop stresses with respect to the change of design variables. The developed response surface functions have been effectively utilized in the design optimization problems to simultaneously maximize the residual compressive hoop stress and minimize the residual tensile hoop stress through the thickness of the compound cylinder. Nonlinear mathematical programming technique based on the powerful sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm has been used in combination with the genetic algorithm (GA) in order to accurately capture the global optimal solutions. At the end, the residual hoop stress distribution and fatigue life of the optimum configurations for each combination of autofrettage and <b>shrink-fit</b> processes have been evaluated and compared. ...|$|E

Trunnion-Hub-Girder (THG) assembly plays a role as a fulcrum in the bascule bridge. To make the fulcrum, the trunnion is <b>shrink-fitted</b> into the hub, and then the trunnion-hub assembly is <b>shrink-fitted</b> into the girder. Hundreds of thousands of dollars could be lost due to failures during this step. Crack formations in the hubs of various Florida bascule bridges during assembly led the Florida Department of Transportation to commission a project with USF professors to investigate. Finite elements method (ANSYS package) is employed to model the THG assembly procedure and solve for the critical crack length and critical stress in this transient thermal structural problem. Design of experiments (DOE) is used with different cooling processes and the geometrical dimensions of the THG assembly to find the sensitivity of these parameters on the outputs. The influence of the hub outer diameter and the radial interference (between the trunnion and hub) is at different levels on the critical crack length and the stress ratio as it is dependent on fulcrum geometry.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the optimum design for minimization of thickness of three-layer <b>shrink-fitted</b> compound cylinder to get equal maximum hoop stresses {{in all the}} cylinders. In the shrink-fitting problems, considering long hollow cylinders, the plane strain hypothesis {{can be regarded as}} more natural. Generally, hoop stress distribution across the wall of thick cylinder is non-linear in nature from inner to outer radius of the cylinder. The stresses reduce sharply towards the outer radius. Material is not utilized properly giving unnecessary more thickness. Hence two or more cylinders can be compounded by shrinkage process where outer cylinder is heated until it will slide freely over inner cylinder thus exerting the required contact pressure on cooling. As a result of shrinking, stress redistribution occurs across the wall of the compound cylinder and reduces the hoop stress and makes it more or less uniform over the thickness. In this paper effort is made to find optimum minimum thicknesses of three cylinders so that material volume is reduced and hoop stress is equal in all the cylinders. The analytical results of optimum design calculated with computer programming are validated in comparison with Finite Element Analysis in ANSYS Workbench. Both the results agree with each other. Hence this methodology can be applied for real-world mechanical applications of multi-layer compound cylinders...|$|R

The pumped liquid itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, <b>shrink-fitted</b> in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft sleeve, mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a shaft sleeve material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a shaft sleeve made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|R

A method of numerically optimising <b>shrink-fitted</b> composite shells was developed and implemented in software, based on a plane stress assumption, with a grid search optimiser. A composite shell was designed, analysed numerically and constructed, with an integrated permanent magnet synchronous machine. Passive axial lift bearings were optimised, analysed numerically for losses and lift force, and verified with experiments. Active radial electromagnets optimised for high stiffness per ohmic loss were built and analysed in terms of force and stiffness, both numerically and experimentally.
