Booksellers' Choice Award and the 2006 Council on Botanical and Horticultural Libraries' Annual Litereature Award for best 'General Interest' book.

25|$|It becomes pseudoscientific when science {{cannot be}} {{separated}} from ideology, scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite distort the facts of science for short-term political gain, or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay. These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of <b>science</b> <b>in</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

25|$|Yet the {{formation}} of a new field, genetic engineering, would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of <b>science</b> <b>in</b> <b>society,</b> and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the Asilomar Conference, where Joshua Lederberg was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human insulin, Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Paul Feyerabend {{advanced}} {{the idea of}} epistemological anarchism, which holds {{that there are no}} useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules are unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself. Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion, magic, and mythology, and considers the dominance of <b>science</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos) that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules. Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of uniformity of law and process across time and space.|$|E

40|$|Biologists {{consider}} the 6 th species extinction crisis {{that we are}} currently undergoing as a major environmental crisis. To fight against the erosion of biodiversity and produce scientific knowledge about species before they disappear, French biologists of the National Museum of Natural History of Paris and of the NGO Pro-Natura International, have been running naturalist expeditions of unprecedented size in countries belonging to the southern hemisphere since the 2000 s (Vanuatu, Madagascar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea). This presentation {{is based on the}} ethnographic study of these expeditions in which we have studied <b>sciences</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> highly asymmetrical North-South relations. In this paper, I will focus on the moral and affective dimensions of the naturalist field <b>sciences</b> involved <b>in</b> those biodiversity surveys...|$|R

500|$|The College has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in the field of education. In 1963, it was the first independent school to have a language laboratory. It is thought to be the first school in the country to have had a careers service. Under the direction of John Lewis, a former master, it pioneered [...] Nuffield Physics in the 1960s, <b>Science</b> <b>in</b> <b>Society</b> in the 1970s, and the Diploma of Achievement in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1990s, Malvern College {{became one of the first}} schools in Britain to offer the choice between the International Baccalaureate and A-Levels in the Sixth Form. The school was one of the first boys' public schools to become fully coeducational from the preparatory department all the way to sixth form.|$|E
500|$|Deprived of {{political}} power, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write {{and work on}} physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks {{about the history of}} science, the role of <b>science</b> <b>in</b> <b>society,</b> {{and the nature of the}} universe. In September 1957, France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain. At the urging of many of Oppenheimer's political friends who had ascended to power, President John F. Kennedy awarded Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 as a gesture {{of political}} rehabilitation. Edward Teller, the winner of the previous year's award, had also recommended Oppenheimer receive it, in the hope that it would heal the rift between them. A little over a week after Kennedy's assassination, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, presented Oppenheimer with the award, [...] "for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, and for leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years". Oppenheimer told Johnson: [...] "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today." [...] The rehabilitation implied by the award was partly symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend, and its award outraged many prominent Republicans in Congress. The late President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, still living in the White House, made it a point to meet with Oppenheimer to tell him how much her husband had wanted him to have the medal. While still a senator in 1959, Kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny Oppenheimer's enemy Lewis Strauss a coveted government position as Secretary of Commerce, effectively ending Strauss' political career. This was partly due to lobbying by the scientific community on behalf of Oppenheimer.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart, however, {{often did}} {{his part in}} publicizing and {{promoting}} military service {{in general and the}} United States Air Force in particular. [...] In 1963, for example, as part of the plot in an episode of the popular television sitcom My Three Sons, Stewart appeared as himself in his brigadier-general's uniform to address high-school students about the importance of <b>science</b> <b>in</b> <b>society</b> and about the many accomplishments of the select group of so-called [...] "eggheads" [...] being educated at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. [...] Five years later, after 27 years of service, Stewart officially retired from the Air Force on May 31, 1968. [...] Stewart received a number of awards during his military service and upon his retirement was also awarded the United States Air Force Distinguished Service Medal. On May 23, 1985, President Ronald Reagan awarded Stewart the Presidential Medal of Freedom, simultaneously advancing Stewart to the rank of Major General on the U.S. Air Force Retired list.|$|E

Make him a courtier; a statesman; a philosopher; a scholar who does not blench even from the difficult Latin of Ovid and Plautus.

Then conceive him to live through the reigns of [...] "Eliza and our James," [...] without leaving in history, in <b>science,</b> <b>in</b> <b>society,</b> in law, in politics or scholarship, a single trace of his existence. He left nothing but the poems and plays usually attributed to Will.
