5|$|Workshops, {{later to}} be known as the East Workshops, were built to {{rehabilitate}} prisoners, and aid in site construction. A blacksmith's shop was constructed in 1852, and a carpenters’ shop was added in 1858. The prison was designed to have other services onsite, including a kitchen, with four boilers, scullery, pantry, cool room and stores; a bakehouse and ovens, with separate stores for flour and bread; as well as a washhouse, laundry and drying room. The building holding these <b>services</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1855. A separate building, a hospital providing medical <b>services,</b> <b>was</b> also planned, but was one of the last to be constructed. The foundations were laid in 1857, but the plans were changed the next year to provide additional space to isolate contagious or dangerous patients. The hospital was finished in 1859.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} {{state that the}} congregation's first synagogue was built at South State and South streets in 1861 and burned by the Union Army in 1863, but the veracity of this claim is disputed.

The building, which was used both as a schoolhouse and for prayer <b>services,</b> <b>was</b> the first synagogue in Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} branch line from four to eight trains per hour.

A new timetable with extra <b>services</b> <b>was</b> introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|After 9 days, {{approximately}} 3,000 buildings (out of a {{total of}} 127,947 initially damaged) were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to shattered roofs and windows, while a similar number still required assistance a further week later (as a number of tarpaulins became detached or otherwise ineffective). One month after the disaster, the main priority of the emergency <b>services</b> <b>was</b> ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following the storm.|$|E

5|$|Baird was {{the first}} cabinet {{minister}} to support Jim Flaherty's campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party's 2002 leadership election. The election was won by Flaherty's rival Ernie Eves, and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier's cabinet in April 2002. He was not, but was demoted {{to the position of}} Chief Government Whip while remaining associate minister for Francophone Affairs. His replacement in Social <b>Services</b> <b>was</b> Brenda Elliott, who was from the more centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.|$|E
5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial.

5|$|Conisbrough Castle {{was bought}} by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the freehold ownership of the land. Two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969, exposing {{the foundations of the}} buildings in the inner bailey, and then from 1973 to 1977, examining options for future visitor facilities. By 1984, when the government agency English Heritage took over the management of the property, the condition of the visitor <b>services</b> <b>was</b> unsatisfactory and the industrial character of the surrounding area was discouraging tourists.|$|E

5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the {{transport}} sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and <b>services</b> <b>was</b> rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people. The underdeveloped Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport. The nation's merchant fleet {{was one of the}} largest in the world.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters were {{confident}} that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the dayTuesday 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies {{as well as all}} the emergency <b>services,</b> <b>was</b> run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, some distance from the fire.|$|E

5|$|In 20 {{months of}} {{existence}} London Country North East had lost £5.5 million, on a turnover of £14 million. Two operating subsidiaries {{were created to}} help improve the situation, {{under the control of}} a single holding company, initially called the London Country Travel Group and later renamed to South of England Travel Group. Its chief executive, Bob Howells, had previously been West Yorkshire Road Car Company's traffic manager. A third company, Cambridge based Premier Travel <b>Services,</b> <b>was</b> added to the group in 1989 but was sold to Cambus in 1991. Both subsidiaries continued to be owned by AJS until 1991, when they were sold to new owners.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} without a sitting council from 1905 to 1921, the {{government}} of the Territories was small but still active. A small civil service force was sent to Fort Smith to set the town up as the new administrative capital in 1911. A budget to provide minimal <b>services</b> <b>was</b> still given by the federal government. Commissioner Frederick D. White administered the territories day-to-day operations during that period. During this 16-year lapse in legislative government, no new laws were created, and the Territories and its population were severely neglected even with the services provided at the time.|$|E
