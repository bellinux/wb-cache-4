5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding.

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) so that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> her place {{when she goes}} on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her {{that he does not}} find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

500|$|Meyer has {{dismissed}} such criticisms, arguing {{both that}} the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives {{as the foundation}} of modern feminism, and that Bella's damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity. Meyer also added, [...] "Just because [...] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism". Shannon Simcox of The Daily Collegian has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, [...] "While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch {{of people who want to}} suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> care of herself and Edward." ...|$|E

Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was pleased with the track, describing the yodeling as [...] "off-her-head", and referred to the track as [...] "a pinnacle of madness". IndieLondon's Jack Foley noted [...] "Wind It Up" [...] as a highlight of The Sweet Escape and called it [...] "Stefani's gift that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> something that, on paper, sounds cheesy and make it utterly, utterly cool." [...] USA Todays Ken Barnes, however, found the track [...] "campy" [...] and [...] "a tacky attempt at sexiness", adding that the combination of yodeling and the interpolation was [...] "awkward". Alex Miller of the NME also found the song campy, commenting that its [...] "dumb sexual bravado has all the sophistication of a teenage boy's wet dream", and compared the yodeling, interpolation, and [...] "erotic rap" [...] to [...] "a trench foot which screams for amputation from the tracklisting".|$|E
