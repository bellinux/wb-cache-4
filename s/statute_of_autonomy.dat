25|$|The <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of Catalonia is the {{fundamental}} organic law, {{second only to the}} Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates.|$|E
25|$|Catalonia's {{national}} symbols {{as defined}} in the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of Catalonia are the flag, Catalonia's day, and the anthem. These symbols have often a political and revindicative significance.|$|E
25|$|Catalonia is {{organised}} territorially into provinces, further {{subdivided into}} comarques and municipalities. The 2006 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of Catalonia establishes the administrative organisation of three local authorities: vegueries, comarques, and municipalities.|$|E

50|$|According {{to what is}} {{established}} by the Bolivian Political Constitution, the Law <b>of</b> <b>Autonomies</b> and Decentralization regulates de procedure for the elaboration <b>of</b> <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy,</b> the transfer and distribution of direct competences between the central government and the autonomous entities.|$|R
25|$|The Valencian <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> {{make clear}} that Valencia is {{intended}} to be the modern conception of self-government of the Valencian Country from the first autonomist movements during Second Spanish Republic, but also joining it to the traditional conception of Valencian identity, as being the successor to the historical Kingdom of Valencia. In fact, after a bipartisan reform of the Valencian <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> in 2006, it records the foral civil law, using the traditional conception of a kingdom, and, on the other hand, it also recognizes Valencia as a nationality, in accordance with the modern conception.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} the {{financial}} crisis is an increase in support for independence in Catalonia. The <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> included a package of laws that gave more power to the region and would have recognized Catalonia as a nation, although one still within Spain. As with the rest of Spain, Catalonia has had high levels of unemployment. As many as 22% of the economically active population, which is still lower than Spain's national jobless rate, yet higher than Madrid. In 2010, Spain's Constitutional Court weakened the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> for Catalonia, which further irritated Catalan secessionist organization.|$|E
25|$|The Catalan <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> {{establishes}} that Catalonia is organised politically {{through the}} Generalitat of Catalonia, conformed by the Parliament, the Presidency of the Generalitat, the Government or Executive Council {{and the other}} institutions created by the Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, recent {{amendments}} to existing <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> or the promulgation <b>of</b> new <b>Statutes</b> altogether, {{have reduced the}} asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities {{and the rest of}} the regions.|$|R
50|$|The {{headquarters}} {{of each one}} of the Upper Courts of Justice, will come collected in the respective <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> (question <b>of</b> the theoretical proof of National Police of the announcement of 2015).|$|R
5000|$|Spanish legislation, {{most notably}} in the <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the bilingual communities, use the term [...] "own {{language}}", or [...] "language proper to a community", {{to refer to a}} language other than Spanish that originated or had historical roots in that particular territory. The <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the respective autonomous communities have declared Basque the language proper to the Basque Country and Navarre, Catalan the language proper to Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—where it is historically, traditionally and officially known as Valencian—and Galician to be the language proper to Galicia. There are other protected regional languages in other autonomous communities. As a percentage of total population in Spain, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan by 17%, and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards.|$|R
25|$|Two {{major factors}} were Spain's Constitutional Court's 2010 {{decision}} to declare {{part of the}} 2006 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of Catalonia unconstitutional, {{as well as the}} fact that Catalonia contributes 19.49% of the central government’s tax revenue, but only receives 14.03% of central government's spending.|$|E
25|$|The Second Spanish Republic was {{declared}} in 1931. During the republic, the Partido Galeguista (PG) {{was the most}} important of a shifting collection of Galician nationalist parties. Following a referendum on a Galician <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy,</b> Galicia was granted the status of an autonomous region.|$|E
25|$|The vegueria is a {{new type}} of {{division}} defined as a specific territorial area for the exercise of government and inter-local cooperation with legal personality. The current <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> states vegueries are intended to supersede provinces in Catalonia, and take over many of functions of the comarques.|$|E
50|$|The {{organisation}} of the municipalities {{is governed}} by a 2 April 1985 law, completed by the 18 April 1986 royal decree. The <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the various autonomous communities also contain provisions concerning {{the relations between the}} municipalities and the autonomous governments. In general, municipalities enjoy a large degree <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> in their local affairs: many of the functions of the comarcas and provinces are municipal powers pooled together.|$|R
5000|$|Article 81.1 of the Spanish Constitution says: [...] "Organic {{laws are}} {{those related to}} the {{development}} of fundamental rights and public liberties, those that approve <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> and the general electoral regime, and others foreseen in the Constitution." ...|$|R
50|$|It had a {{noticeable}} official usage during the Second Spanish Republic, as it reflects, by example, {{the use of}} the term from the Provincial Council of Valencia (present Provincial Delegation) in a poster made by Artur Ballester i Marco. Also a good sample of it can be seen its use in the different projects from <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the CNT in 1936, of Valencian Left and Izquierda Republicana in 1937.|$|R
25|$|The basic {{institutional}} law of each {{autonomous community}} is the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy.</b> The Statutes of Autonomy establish {{the name of}} the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.|$|E
25|$|After Franco's {{death in}} 1975 and the {{adoption}} of a democratic constitution in Spain in 1978, Catalonia recovered and extended the powers that it had gained in the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of 1932 but lost with the fall of the Second Spanish Republic {{at the end of the}} Spanish Civil War in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Republican forces {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} front at Buruntza. Eventually the front stabilized temporarily on the western fringes of Gipuzkoa (Intxorta) during October 1936, when the Basque <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> was passed in Madrid, and the Basque Government was rapidly organized. As military rebels advanced, panicking civilians from the occupied areas fled towards Bilbao {{by the tens of}} thousands.|$|E
50|$|Spain: Castilian (castellano) is the {{official}} language of the State. All Spaniards have the duty to know it {{and the right to}} use it. Other Spanish languages (languages of Spain) shall be official in the respective autonomous communities, according to their <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After that, the {{government}} and parliament of the Basque Country brought a case challenging the constitutionality of that provision, but in 1986 it {{was rejected by the}} Constitutional Court <b>of</b> Spain. (The <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> in Spain were approved as Organic Law by the Cortes Generales [...] ) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{autonomous}} communities are governed {{according to the}} constitution and their own organic laws known as <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy,</b> which contain all the competences that they assume. Since devolution {{was intended to be}} asymmetrical in nature, the scope of competences vary for each community, but all have the same parliamentary structure.|$|R
25|$|The first pro-independence {{political}} party in Catalonia was Estat Català (Catalan State), founded in 1922 by Francesc Macià. Estat Català went into exile in France during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923–1930), launching an unsuccessful uprising from Prats de Molló in 1926. In March 1931, following {{the overthrow of}} Primo de Rivera, Estat Català joined with the Partit Republicà Català (Catalan Republican Party) and the political group L'Opinió (Opinion) to form Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia; ERC), with Macià as its first leader. The following month, the ERC achieved a spectacular victory in the municipal elections that preceded the 14 April proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Macià proclaimed a Catalan Republic on 14 April, but after negotiations with the provisional government he was obliged to settle for autonomy, under a revived Generalitat of Catalonia. Catalonia was granted a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> in 1932, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, General Franco abolished both the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> and the Generalitat.|$|E
25|$|Spanish (Castilian or castellano) has {{official}} status {{in all of}} Spain, including the Valencian Community. Aside from it, the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> recognizes Valencian as the language proper to the Valencian people (llengua pròpia), and commends its protection and regulation to the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL) under the Generalitat Valenciana. Valencian is also official in the autonomous communities of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it is called Catalan.|$|E
25|$|The Parliament of Catalonia was the devolved, unicameral {{legislature}} of {{the autonomous}} community of Catalonia, having legislative power in regional matters {{as defined by}} the Spanish Constitution and the Catalan <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy,</b> as well as the ability to grant or revoke confidence from a President of the Generalitat. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, with all nationals over eighteen, registered in Catalonia and in full enjoyment of all political rights entitled to vote.|$|E
50|$|The {{determination}} of the election date varied depending on the autonomous community, as they had different regulations. Initially, regional presidents didn't {{have the power to}} dissolve the regional parliaments and call elections of their own, but this notion evolved over time throughout different reforms of the autonomies' electoral laws and/or <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy.</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the regulation on the autonomous-community ombudsmaninstitutions introduced by the recently approved <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The article focuses the analysis on three dimensions of the ombudsman: itscompetences, its institutional status and its relations with other institutionsof the autonomous communities. In this sense, it states that the new statuteshave sought to establish a clear normative definition about the scope andefficiency of the ombudsman as an institution {{for the protection of}} rights. On this subject, the article explores the new normative parameters on whichthe different ombudsmen will have to base their activity, in particular a seriesof rights for citizens (mostly social rights) included for the first time insome of the recently approved <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The article finally concludesthat to efficiently warranty the protection of these rights is one ofthe major challenges the autonomous-community ombudsmen will have toface...|$|R
40|$|In a line {{similar to}} that {{proposed}} in the State Council Report of 16 February 2006 on modifi cations to the Constitution, the Constitutional Court Ruling 31 / 2010 has severely limited the constitutional functions <b>of</b> the <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> while denying them any special legislative category outside thosefound in {{any other type of}} organic law. According to the jurisprudentialdoctrine of the declaration, {{it is clear that the}} <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> are notadequate regulations for defining the powers and functions contained inthe powers that they attribute to the respective Autonomous Communities,therefore although they can be “described” these provisions lack regulatoryforce. Neither can the Statutes contemplate a possible development of the Autonomous State, given that the constitutional categories that belong toit and even the sub-matters over which it exercises competent functions constitutean interpretative monopoly of the Constitutional Court. This set oflimitations and inabilities mean that the <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> cannot ensurean ambit of exclusive autonomous powers because, under any circumstances,the State has the power to regulate the corresponding matters usingits horizontal powers, and moreover, with the effect of supremacy. Andin the end, in relation to shared powers, the State can defi ned the basics inthe amount of detail and under the form of regulations it considers appropriate(legislative, regulatory or executive). We are therefore looking at anew attempt to declare the process <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> as being closed, denyingthe <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> possible exercising the device principle and eradicating withinthem, in appropriate feedback, their regulatory strength and their constitutional functions of origin...|$|R
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of Article 74 of the French {{constitution}} and the Organic Law 2014-192 on the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> of French Polynesia, politics of French Polynesia {{takes place in a}} framework of a parliamentary representative democratic French overseas collectivity, whereby the President of French Polynesia is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of French Polynesia (the territorial assembly).|$|E
25|$|Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which {{identified}} themselves as nationalities, were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy,</b> even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution {{for the rest of}} the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, and Aragon.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> of 1979, Aranese (a dialect of Gascon Occitan) {{has also}} been {{official}} and subject to special protection in Val d'Aran. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants {{was the only place}} where a dialect of Occitan has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of Val d'Aran. Catalan Sign Language is also officially recognised.|$|E

5000|$|The {{creation}} of the autonomous communities was a diverse process, that started with the constitution, was normalized with the autonomic pacts and was completed with the <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy.</b> It is, however, an ongoing process; further devolution—or even the return of transferred competences—is always a possibility. This has been evidenced in the 2000s, at the beginning {{with a wave of}} approval <b>of</b> new <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> for many communities, and more recently with many considering the recentralization of some competences {{in the wake of the}} economic and financial crisis of 2008. Nonetheless Spain is now a highly decentralized country with a structure unlike any other, similar but not equal to a federation, even though in many respects the country can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal. The unique resulting system is referred to as [...] "Autonomous state", or more precisely [...] "State of Autonomies".|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} transition {{which occurred}} in Spain, together with {{social and economic}} changes rooted in a detailed sense of modernization, began {{at the end of}} Franco's time in power and lasted until the creation of current institutions (Spanish Constitution <b>of</b> 1978 and <b>Statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy).</b> This also produced a strong reversal of the social uses for Spanish symbols of national identification.|$|R
