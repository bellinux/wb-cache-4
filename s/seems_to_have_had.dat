5|$|Daurises, who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{the largest}} army, {{initially}} took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged {{and took the}} cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each {{in a single day}} according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts and the four crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's domestic slave trading business {{and used the}} proceeds to become a coffee plantation owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed {{the abolition of the}} transatlantic African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, he had become a very wealthy man. He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, {{the revolt}} spread further. The Ionians sent {{men to the}} Hellespont and Propontis, and {{captured}} Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing {{the spread of the}} rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion. For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an uneasy peace during these years. At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, and he left Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.|$|E

5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, and he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> better relations with the king. Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. Richard was less dogmatic {{on the rights of}} the clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took Richard to task when Richard acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, Richard escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. Richard also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{occupation}} {{of what is}} now southern Scotland <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> very little impact on settlement patterns, with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts in the south and Brochs and wheel houses in the north, continuing to be occupied in the Early Medieval period. The study of place names and archaeological evidence indicates a pattern of early Medieval settlement by the Picts, most densely around the north-east coastal plain; early Gaelic settlement was predominately in the western mainland and neighbouring islands. Anglian settlement in the south-east reached into West Lothian, {{and to a lesser extent}} into south-western Scotland. Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland, with lighter settlement in the Western Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{a similar}} {{projecting}} {{entrance to the}} Great Mosque of Mahdiya. The original building had an open central courtyard with three arcades. Its layout {{was similar to the}} Kairouan and Samarra mosques. These had round arches on pre-Islamic columns with Corinthian capitals. There were three domes (indicative of the location of the prayer hall), two at the corners of the qibla wall and one over the prayer niche, and a small brick minaret over the main entrance. The gallery around the courtyard had series of columns and the prayer hall, which had the domes built over it, had five more rows of five pillars.|$|E

5|$|Around 1498, Josquin {{most likely}} re-entered {{the service of}} the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed my hope in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
5|$|In about 1143 Foliot {{wrote an}} account of the {{proceedings}} of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no conclusion was reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes to the status quo. According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, Edith-Matilda, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused some concern, although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because Anselm of Canterbury had performed the ceremony. Foliot <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the Angevin cause, as Matilda's claim was known.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322BC. When it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state. Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed {{a greater degree of}} autonomy. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. Philippi, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} that the battle took place before Somairle and Guðrøðr struggled for the kingship. Guðrøðr is otherwise known to have married a granddaughter of Muirchertach, and <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an earlier marriage to another member of the Uí Néill. These marital unions could be evidence of an alliance between Guðrøðr and Muirchertach in the 1150s. Mac Scelling's participation in Muirchertach's service, therefore, could have been undertaken during a period of cooperation between the Isles and the Uí Néill. Nevertheless, an alliance between Somairle and Muirchertach may be perceptible as late as 1164, when the former lost his life leading an invasion of mainland Scotland. According to the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, Somairle commanded troops from Dublin, a settlement which have recognised Muirchertach's overlordship at the time. One possibility is that a pact between the two concerned Somairle's support of Muirchertach regarding the Irish high-kingship, and Muirchertach's support of Somairle via Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{position}} was worsened {{by the absence}} of Egypt's prefect, Tenagino Probus, who was battling pirates. According to Zosimus, the Palmyrenes were helped by an Egyptian general named Timagenes; Zabdas moved into Egypt with 70,000 soldiers, defeating an army of 50,000 Romans. After their victory, the Palmyrenes withdrew their main force and left a 5,000-soldier garrison. By early November, Tenagino Probus returned and assembled an army; he expelled the Palmyrenes and regained Alexandria, prompting Zabdas to return. The Palmyrene general aimed a thrust at Alexandria, where he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> local support; the city fell into Zabdas' hands, and the Roman prefect fled south. The last battle was at the Babylon Fortress, where Tenagino Probus took refuge; the Romans had the upper hand, since they chose their camp carefully. Timagenes, with his knowledge of the land, ambushed the Roman rear; Tenagino Probus committed suicide, and Egypt became part of Palmyra. In the Augustan History the Blemmyes were among Zenobia's allies, and Gary K. Young cites the Blemmyes attack and occupation of Coptos in 268 as evidence of a Palmyrene-Blemmyes alliance.|$|E
