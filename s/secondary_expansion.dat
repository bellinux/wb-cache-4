40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Leukocytes are {{believed}} to be involved in delayed cell death following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, data demonstrating that blood-borne inflammatory cells are present in the injured brain prior to the onset of secondary brain damage have been inconclusive. We therefore investigated both the interaction between leukocytes and the cerebrovascular endothelium using in vivo imaging and the accumulation of leukocytes in the penumbra following experimentally induced TBI. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Experimental TBI was induced in C 57 /Bl 6 mice (n = 42) using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model, and leukocyte-endothelium interactions (LEI) were quantified using both intravital fluorescence microscopy (IVM) of superficial vessels and 2 -photon microscopy of cortical vessels for up to 14 &# 160;h post-CCI. In a separate experimental group, leukocyte accumulation and <b>secondary</b> lesion <b>expansion</b> were analyzed in mice that were sacrificed 15 &# 160;min, 2, 6, 12, 24, or 48 &# 160;h after CCI (n = 48). Finally, leukocyte adhesion was blocked with anti-CD 18 antibodies, and the effects on LEI and <b>secondary</b> lesion <b>expansion</b> were determined 16 (n = 12) and 24 &# 160;h (n = 21), respectively, following TBI. 				 				 					 						Results 					One hour after TBI leukocytes and leukocyte-platelet aggregates started to roll on the endothelium of pial venules, whereas no significant LEI were observed in pial arterioles or in sham-operated mice. With a delay of > 4 &# 160;h, leukocytes and aggregates did also firmly adhere to the venular endothelium. In deep cortical vessels (250 &# 160;&# 956;m) LEIs were much less pronounced. Transmigration of leukocytes into the brain parenchyma only became significant after the tissue became necrotic. Treatment with anti-CD 18 antibodies reduced adhesion by 65 %; however, this treatment had no effect on <b>secondary</b> lesion <b>expansion.</b> 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					LEI occurred primarily in pial venules, whereas little or no LEI occurred in arterioles or deep cortical vessels. Inhibiting LEI did not affect <b>secondary</b> lesion <b>expansion.</b> Importantly, the majority of migrating leukocytes entered the injured brain parenchyma only after the tissue became necrotic. Our results therefore suggest that neither intravascular leukocyte adhesion nor the migration of leukocytes into cerebral tissue {{play a significant role in}} the development of <b>secondary</b> lesion <b>expansion</b> following TBI...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} memory CD 8 + T cells to rapidly proliferate and acquire cytolytic {{activity}} {{is critical for}} protective immunity against intracellular pathogens. The signals that control this recall response remain unclear.

This divergence suggests a long-term isolation among these groups, which presumably took place long before the last Pleistocene glaciation, with no secondary contact among these populations.

40|$|Species invasions {{can have}} wide-ranging {{biological}} and socio-economic effects and are generally unwanted by legislation. Identification {{of the source}} population {{as well as the}} ecology and genetics of both the invader population and the receiving community is of crucial importance. The rapid invasion of a small coregonid fish vendace (Coregonus albula) in a major northern European subarctic watercourse has resulted in a labile ecological situation in the receiving community. The ecological impact of the invasion has been thoroughly documented, but the genetics of the invasion remains to be explored. We analyzed the genetic diversity and divergence patterns among the two possible source populations from southern Finnish Lapland and three colonists populations within the Inari-Pasvik watercourse using ten microsatellite loci in order to (i) identify the most likely source of the invasion, (ii) reveal the dispersal pattern and genetic structure of the <b>secondary</b> <b>expansion,</b> and (iii) to investigate whether the initial introduction and the <b>secondary</b> <b>expansion</b> were associated with founder effects.

Both the initial introduction and the <b>secondary</b> <b>expansion</b> were found not to be associated with significant founder effects. The <b>secondary</b> <b>expansion</b> followed a stepping stone pattern and the source and colonist populations of this expansion have undergone rapid genetic divergence within a period of 15 – 35 years (ca. 8 – 17 generations). The rapid divergence may be contributed to lack of gene flow among the source and colonist populations due to the extensive hydroelectric damming in the watercourse. Multiple introductions and substantial genetic variation in combination with the boom-and-bust population development of the species thus likely counteracted the founder effects as well as fueled the rapid establishment and expansion of this species within the Inari-Pasvik watercourse...|$|E

Finally, further research on giving priority to infrastructure projects within the proposed infrastructure investment in combination with pricing policies packages is recommended. Combinations of pricing and expanding existing infrastructure may reduce the need to construct new motorway links, reduce negative impacts on nature conservation areas and rural landscapes, and result in higher net economic benefits...|$|R
40|$|Independent {{studies have}} shown that CD 27, 4 - 1 BB, and OX 40 can all promote {{survival}} of activated CD 8 + T cells. We have therefore compared their impact on CD 8 + memory T cell formation and responsiveness within one, physiologically relevant model system. Recombinant mice, selectively lacking input of one or two receptors, were challenged intranasally with influenza virus, and the immunodominant virus-specific CD 8 + T cell response was quantified at priming and effector sites. Upon primary infection, CD 27 and (to a lesser extent) 4 - 1 BB made nonredundant contributions to accumulation of CD 8 + virus-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes and lung, while OX 40 had no effect. Interestingly though, in the memory response, accumulation of virus-specific CD 8 + T cells in spleen and lung critically depended on all three receptor systems. This was explained by two observations: 1) CD 27, 4 - 1 BB, and OX 40 were collectively responsible for generation of the same memory CD 8 + T cell pool; 2) CD 27, 4 - 1 BB, and OX 40 collectively determined the extent of <b>secondary</b> <b>expansion,</b> as shown by adoptive transfers with standardized numbers of memory cells. Surprisingly, wild-type CD 8 + memory T cells expanded normally in primed OX 40 ligand- or 4 - 1 BB ligand-deficient mice.

40|$|The current {{literature}} {{on the role of}} interleukin (IL) - 2 in memory CD 8 + T-cell differentiation indicates a significant contribution of IL- 2 during primary and also <b>secondary</b> <b>expansion</b> of CD 8 + T cells. IL- 2 seems to be responsible for optimal expansion and generation of effector functions following primary antigenic challenge. As the magnitude of T-cell expansion determines the numbers of memory CD 8 + T cells surviving after pathogen elimination, these event influence memory cell generation. Moreover, during the contraction phase of an immune respons where most antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells disappear by apoptosis, IL- 2 signals are able to rescu CD 8 + T cells from cell death and provide a durable increase in memory CD 8 + T-cell counts.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis for the differential regulation of TRAIL in helped versus helpless CD 8 (+) T cells by comparing their transcriptional profiles, and have identified a transcriptional corepressor, NGFI-A binding protein 2 (Nab 2), that is selectively induced in helped CD 8 (+) T cells. Enforced expression of Nab 2 prevents TRAIL induction after restimulation of primary helpless CD 8 (+) T cells, and expression of a dominant-negative form of Nab 2 in helped CD 8 (+) T cells impairs their secondary proliferative response that is reversible by TRAIL blockade. Finally, we observe that the CD 8 (+) T-cell autocrine growth factor IL- 2 coordinately increases Nab 2 expression and decreases TRAIL expression.
