40|$|Abstract Background Better {{management}} of affective and <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> may reduce consultation rates {{in primary care}}. <b>Somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> are highly prevalent in primary care and co-morbidity with affective disorders is substantial, but it is as yet unclear which portion {{of the health care}} use may be ascribed to each disorder. Our objective was to investigate the use of primary care for undifferentiated <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders,</b> other <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders,</b> anxiety and depressive disorders prospectively. Methods In eight family practices 1046 consulting patients (25 – 79 yrs) were screened and a stratified sample of 473 was interviewed. <b>Somatoform</b> <b>disorders,</b> anxiety and depressive disorders were diagnosed (DSM IV) using SCAN 2. 1. The electronic records of 400 participants regarding somatic diseases, medication and healthcare use were available through their family physicians (FP). Results In the follow-up year patients with psychiatric disorders had more face-to-face contacts with the FP than patients who had no psychiatric disorder: average 7 – 10 versus 5. The impact on the use of primary care by patients with <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> was comparable to patients with depressive or anxiety <b>disorders.</b> Undifferentiated <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> had an independent impact on the use of primary care after adjustment for anxiety and depressive disorders, resulting in 30 % more consultations (IRR 1. 3 (95 % CI: 1. 1 – 1. 7)). Anxiety disorders had no independent effect. Conclusion Health care planning should focus on the recognition and treatment of somatoform as well as affective disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{available}} epidemiological evidence on associations between <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> with anxiety and depressive disorders. RESULTS: Clinical and population-based {{studies have found}} that the co-occurrence of some types of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> (e. g., somatization disorder, somatic-symptom-index (SSI) 4, 6, and pain disorder) and anxiety and depressive disorders is common. These findings may suggest either a causal relationship between these disorders or that they share some common etiological factors. For other forms of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders,</b> empirical evidence about co-occurrence is even thinner or not available at all, especially from non-western settings. CONCLUSION: Some implications of how these findings, or the absence of them, can help us understand better the etiology of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> and improve the classification of mental disorders as a whole are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Somatization {{disorder}} and undifferentiated <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorder</b> were combined to become somatic symptom disorder, a diagnosis which no longer requires a specific number of somatic symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Background: Psychiatric diagnoses, {{especially}} <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders,</b> {{are based}} on phenomenology, i. e. the subjective experience of the symptoms by the patient. The concept of “medically unexplained symptoms” (MUS) is now getting away with much focus on the symptoms per se rather than its explanation by some medical illness. Aim of the study: To study the symptom profile of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> and to see its variability in relation to different subtypes of the disorder. Materials and methods: Hundred consecutive patients of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders,</b> diagnosed clinically based on the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 10) criteria, were chosen after applying various inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI) Health Questionnaire N- 2 {{was used to evaluate}} symptoms of the patients. Data was analysed with chi-square test. Result: Patients of somatization disorder (SD) have significantly higher prevalence of symptoms related to eyes (p=. 0412) and higher complaints of hot sensation in the body (p=. 0007) as compared to undifferentiated <b>somatoform</b> (UD) <b>disorder</b> and other <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders.</b> Hypochondriacal ideas are significantly less in UD and SD. Conclusion: Although traditionally, subtypes of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> are supposed to have differences in the phenomenology, there is considerable overlap between them in clinical practice. It may mean that all <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> are virtually same and there may be no need to have many subtypes...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{diagnose}} psychiatric comorbidities in patients with tinnitus by using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). One hundred patients were evaluated by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. All patients were submitted to hearing tests (pure tone audiometry) and standardised questionnaires (Tinnitus Questionnaire etc.). The results showed three main diagnosis groups: 1. Affective disorders (22, 3 %) 2. Anxiety disorders (19, 4 %) 3. <b>Somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> (16, 5 %). A comparison between the CIDI and the questionnaires showed that patients with affective and anxiety disorders suffered from significantly higher tinnitus impact levels than patients without affective and anxiety disorders. No statistically significant correlations were found between patients with <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> versus patients without <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> and tinnitus impact levels. Two main causes could be involved in these results. The CIDI may not be able to diagnose <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> properly or patients with <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> may not develope higher tinnitus impact levels. Other results showed that patients with chronic decompensated tinnitus had significantly more often affective and anxiety disorders than patients with chronic compensated tinnitus. The study supports earlier results that showed the importance of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with tinnitus, especially the importance of affective and anxiety disorders. The CIDI could be used as a standardized diagnostic tool in patients with tinnitus to decrease clinical errors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: DSM-III {{introduced}} <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> as a speculative diagnostic {{category for}} somatic symptoms "not explained by a general medical condition. " Although retained and enlarged in DSM-IV, <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> {{have been the}} subject of continuing criticism by both professionals and patients. The extended period of preparation for DSM-V offers an important opportunity to reconsider the category of <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders.</b> METHOD: Exploration of the diverse aims of a diagnostic classification indicates that the authors must not only address the conceptual and practical problems associated with this category but also reconcile it with the parallel medical descriptive classification of functional symptoms and syndromes. RESULTS: The existing <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> categories require modification. The authors favor the radical option of the abolition of the categories. Diagnoses currently within <b>somatoform</b> <b>disorders</b> could be redistributed into other groupings, and the disorders currently defined solely by somatic symptoms could be placed on axis III as "functional somatic symptoms and syndromes. " Greater use could be made of "psychological factors affecting medical condition" on axis I. The authors suggest supplementing the diagnosis of functional somatic symptoms with a multiaxial formulation. CONCLUSIONS: The authors promote a classification of somatic symptoms in DSM-V that is compatible with that used in general medicine and offers new opportunities both for research into the etiology and treatment of symptoms and for the greater integration of psychiatry into general medical practice...|$|R
