30|$|The {{dependence}} of the gravimetric capacitance from the surface area of the studied carbons is depicted in Fig.  6 b. Capacitance change is almost linear with the specific surface area. However, correlation line does not intercept zero point, which does not have realistic explanation. Slope of the correlation line is 0.068  F/g which {{is less than the}} calculated Cs of any presented samples at that discharge current density (see Table  4). However, taking into account textural features of the carbons, samples can be divided into two groups in compliance with their pore structure. Such separation gives more reasonable results. Inside each group, correlation line intercepts zero point within experimental error and slope corresponds to the average values of the <b>surface</b> <b>capacitance</b> (see Table  4; Fig.  6 b). Such observation is correct through the all examined current density range. Samples in series C 540 –C 1400 possess higher average <b>surface</b> <b>capacitance</b> compared to the samples with higher surface area (C 2230 –C 3060), 0.088  F/m 2 and 0.075  F/m 2 at 0.2  A/g, respectively. Higher <b>surface</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the samples in the sequence C 540 –C 1400 can be explained by wider pore size distribution resulting in more surface accessibility. Changes in the pore structure and porosity increase for samples C 2230, C 2700 and C 3060 lead to restriction of surface availability for electrolyte ions and consequently to decrease in value of the <b>surface</b> <b>capacitance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Binding {{energy of}} {{symmetric}} nuclear matter {{can be accessed}} by anyone with a minimal experience, with the textbook mass formula and a sample of nuclear masses. We show that, with a minimally modified formula, the symmetry energy of nuclear matter can be accessed with nearly the same ease. Elementary considerations for a macroscopic nucleus show that a dependence of the surface tension on asymmetry necessarily implies {{the emergence of an}} asymmetry skin. In the lowest order, the surface tension and energy must be quadratic in the asymmetry. With the volume energy also quadratic, the surface and volume energies combine as energies of two connected capacitors, with the volume and <b>surface</b> <b>capacitances</b> proportional to the volume and area, respectively. For the minimal net energy, the net asymmetry partitions itself, into volume and surface contributions, in proportion to the capacitances. The net symmetry energy emerges in terms of the net asymmetry squared divided by the sum of volume and <b>surface</b> <b>capacitances,</b> which form can be also extracted from the droplet-model mass-formula. The surface symmetry contribution is required to describe the binding energies of light asymmetric nuclei at a level similar to that typical for other nuclei. The macroscopic considerations, with a sensible surface symmetry energy coefficient, explain the systematics of skin sizes vs asymmetry and vs neutron-proton separation energy difference and mass, observed experimentally and in microscopic structure calculations. Although characterized by large errors, the skin data are better in constraining the relative magnitude of surface and volume symmetry coefficients than are the binding energies, within our simple considerations. The combination of data produces the following constraints: 27 MeV � α � 31 MeV for the symmetry volume parameter, 11 MeV � β � 14 MeV for the surface symmetry parameter and 2. 0 � α/β � 2. 8 for the parameter ratio.

The objective of the work was to test a model describing the frequency response of the SCIP to both permittivity and electrode conductance, and to compare results with TDR and network analyzer measurements. The model was tested using liquids of known permittivity and in saline, dielectric solutions. <b>Surface</b> <b>Capacitance</b> Insertion Probe and TDR determined permittivity values are similar for sandy soils but diverge for loam and clay soils.

We propose three possible reasons for the higher than expected permittivity values observed using the SCIP: (i) higher than expected real permittivity created by dielectric dispersion, (ii) a large contribution of the imaginary permittivity due to relaxation processes assumed to be negligible, and (iii) poor model prediction of permittivity due to excessive damping of the oscillator circuit with high EC and dielectric losses.

We show that, with a minimally modified formula (along {{the lines of the}} droplet model), the symmetry energy of nuclear matter can be accessed nearly as easily. Elementary considerations for a macroscopic nucleus show that the surface tension needs to depend on asymmetry. That dependence modifies the surface energy and implies the emergence of asymmetry skin.

We investigate both the necessity and limits of an implicit solvent polarizable continuum model (PCM). In order to recover the proper electrochemical behavior of the surface and, in particular, a proper potential scale, the solvent model is determined to be mandatory: in the limit of a high dielectric constant, the <b>surface</b> <b>capacitance</b> becomes independent of the interslab space used in the model and, therefore, the electrochemical properties become intrinsic of the interface structure. We show that the computed <b>surface</b> <b>capacitance</b> is not only dependent on the implicit solvent dielectric constant, but also on the solvent cavity parameter that should be precisely tuned. This model is then applied to the Li/electrolyte interface in order to check its ability to compute thermodynamic equilibrium properties. The use of a purely implicit solvent approach allows the recovery of a more reasonable equilibrium potential for the Li+/Li redox pair, compared to vacuum approaches, but a potential that it is still off by 1. 5 V. Then, the inclusion of explicit solvent molecules improves the description of the solvent–Li+ chemical bond in the first solvation shell and allows recovery of the experimental value within 100 mV.

In this work TE layered devices composed of electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) and a phonon blocking material such as poly (3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), polyaniline (PANI) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) at the interface were prepared. The figure of merit, ZT, of each device was measured in the cross-plane direction using the Transient Harman Method (THM) and complemented with AFM-based measurements. The results show remarkable high ZT values (0. 81 < ZT < 2. 45) that are directly related with the topography, <b>surface</b> potential, <b>capacitance</b> gradient and resistance of the devices at the nanoscale...|$|R

The ions are represented by charged hard spheres and the electrode is a uniformly charged flat <b>surface.</b> The <b>capacitance</b> of this model fluid is calculated with the SRISM approach with closures based on the hypernetted chain (HNC) and Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closures and compared with simulations. As long as the magnitude of the electrode charge is not too great, the HNC closure shows the most promise. The KH results are reasonably good for a high density electrolyte but are poor when applied at low densities. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{insulation}} materials {{are used in}} high voltage gas-insulated devices for mechanical stability reasons or for the separation of different compartments of the device. While solids have generally higher breakdown strength than gases, the weakest parts are often the solid-gas interfaces of the insulation. This contribution presents first measurements of characteristics of surface flashover in a specially constructed setup. The studied samples are epoxy rods with embedded electrodes, especially designed for localized electrodeless streamer inception and discharge propagation along the <b>surface.</b> The <b>capacitances</b> of the overall system are tuned such that current measurements of the discharge can be performed. In this research {{we focus on the}} initial phase of discharge propagation – the formation and development of streamers. The main results are the streamer inception voltage and the evolution of the current shape in nitrogen at different pressures...|$|R
