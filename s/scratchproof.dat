Plasma is created by a pulse-driven magnetron. At least one layer of constant or varying thickness relative to the combination of layers is removed. USE - For a <b>scratchproof</b> coating on a plastic substrate. ADVANTAGE - Enables <b>scratchproof</b> coating up to 4 mu m to be removed, no heat damage to substrate...|$|E
40|$|DE 102005018059 A 1 UPAB: 20061204 NOVELTY - Method for linking a silane (IIa) for {{producing}} a product, {{which is a}} component (III) in double-fold, three-fold or in higher amounts, or for cross-linking a condensate, a partial condensate, polymers or partial polymers, containing structural units (IIb) over the bond R 1, comprises reacting (IIa) or its isomer, a transesterification product or a condensation product, which results by loss of an alcohol molecule of the silane, or a condensate, a partial condensate, a polymer or a partial polymer, containing (IIb), with a carbonyl compound (IV). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Method for linking a silane (IIa) of formula (B 1 -R 1 (Y 1) -Ra) a(Rb) bSi(X 1) 4 -a-b {{for producing}} a product, which is a component (III) of formula (B 1 -R 1 -Ra) a(Rb) bSi(X 1) 4 -a-b in double-fold, three-fold or in higher amounts, or for cross-linking a condensate, a partial condensate, polymers or partial polymers, containing structural units (IIb) of formula (B 3 -R 1 (Y 1) -Ra) a(Rb) bSi(OR 4) d(X 1) 4 -a-b-d over the bond R 1, where (IIa) or its isomer, a transesterification product or a condensation product, which results by loss of an alcohol molecule of the silane, or a condensate, a partial condensate, a polymer or a partial polymer, containing (IIb), reacts with a carbonyl compound (IV) of formula (Q-R 5 (-Qa) c). Ra = open-chain and/or cyclic alkyl-, aryl- or alkylaryl with 1 - 10 C atoms, interrupted {{by one or more}} of O or S atoms or carboxyl or amino groups or such atoms/groups prevents the silicium atom at their end; R 1 = a group substituted with Y 1, alkyl-, aryl- or alkylaryl with 1 - 10 C atoms, interrupted by one or more of O or S atoms or carboxyl or amino groups or such atoms/groups at their end; Rb = open-chain and/or cyclic alkyl-, aryl- or alkylaryl, preferably 1 - 20 C alkylaryl; B 1 = organically polymerizable group with at least one C=C-double bond and at least 2 carbon atoms; X 1 = a group, which is obtained under the formation of Si-O-Si-bridges in a hydrolytic condensation reaction; Y 1 = -OH or -COOH; a = 1 or 2; b = 0 or 1; B 3 = a polymerizable group as in B 1 or such a group, whose double bond is already reacted; R 4 = a bond to another silicium atom, optionally partially also to another metal atom, which can be built into silicic acid hetero polycondensation products, and optionally partially also hydrogen; d = 1 - 3; Q, Qa = NCO, -OH or -C(O) Xa; C(O) Xa = a group of carboxylic acids or an activated carbonyl compounds; c = 1 - 6; and R 5 = a single bond and the rest of any group with c+ 1 valency (where R 5 is present only in exceptional cases, when Q and Qa are activated carboxylic acid groups and c is 1). When Q and/or Qa is -NCO or -C(O) Xa, then Y 1 in (IIa) or (IIb) is OH; and when Q and/or Qa is -NCO or -OH, then Y 1 in (IIa) or (IIb) is COOH. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a silane of formula (V); (2) a condensate or a partial condensate comprising structural units of formula (VI); and (3) a polymer or a partial polymer comprising structural units of formula (VII). R 2 = R 1; Rc = Ra; Rd = Rb; X 2 = X 1; B 2 = B 1; Z 1, Z 2 = -NH-C(O) O-, -NH-C(O) - or -CO(O) -, where the first two groups are bonded over the NH group to R 3, while the carboxylate group are bonded in both directions; R 3 = a single bond (in the case of c is 1, and Z 1 and Z 2 is -C(O) -O) or any group that possesses c+ 1 valency; R- 4 a = R 4; and B 4 = B 3. USE - The silane polymers are useful as and/or for the production of coating-, filling-, gluing-, grouting- and sealing masses, fibers, particles, foils, binding agents for ceramic particles, or as embedding masses. ADVANTAGE - The <b>scratchproof</b> coatings and molded article exhibit high firmness; possess a high wet-strength; and does not exhibit any toxicological/allergic hesitation...|$|E
