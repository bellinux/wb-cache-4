40|$|Demura and Naka (1990) {{reported}} that team performance in volleyball games could be classified into {{service and the}} following four group skills: A. the performance to get points: attacking after reception of attacking from <b>service</b> <b>reception</b> by opponent team (A- 2), attacking after reception of attacking from reception by opponent team after A- 2 (A- 3), B. the performance to get side-outs: attacking after <b>service</b> <b>reception</b> (B- 1), attacking after reception of attacking from reception by opponent team after B- 1 (B- 2). In addition, they determined that four group skills consisted of various combinations based on liaison of component skills such as tossing, spiking, blocking and reception. Whether or not any component skill contributed higher to the achievement of group skills has been investigated little. The purpose of this study, therefore, {{was to determine the}} degree of contribution of component skills to the achievement of the group skills. As the group skills out of various attacking patterns, we selected attacking performed in liaison with blocking, reception, tossing and spiking in A- 2, A- 3 and B- 2, and attacking performed in liaison with <b>service</b> <b>reception,</b> tossing and spiking in B- 1, respectively. This selection has been made {{because of the fact that}} the above attacking patterns accounted for the majority of all attacking patterns occured in actual games. The gnmes were observed in the 1988 Spring League of six Intercollegiate Men's volleyball games in Kansai district, 128 sets with each team, and data were collected for in each omponent skill pattern. The analysis of theory of quantification II was used to determine the cntribution of each component skill to the achievement of the group skills. The main results can be summarized as follows: 1) In A- 2 and A- 3, tossing and spiking skills contribute highly to the achievement of attacking performed in liaison with blocking, reception, tossing and spiking. 2) In B- 1, tossing skill has the high contribution to attacking performed in liaison with <b>service</b> <b>reception,</b> tossing and spiking. 3) In B- 2, the contribution of reception and tossing skills is high in attacking performed in liaison with blocking, reception, tossing and spiking...|$|E

40|$|The first {{purpose of}} the present study was to make out the skill tests in volleyball games and examine the reliabilities and objectivities of the tests. Further, the second purpose was to clarify the {{structure}} of the group skills in games. Team performance in volleyball games could be classified into two large categories of performance: 1. the performance to get points: A- 1 : serving A- 2 : attacking after reception of attacking from <b>service</b> <b>reception</b> by opponent team A- 3 : attacking after reception of attacking from reception by opponent team after A- 2 2. the performance to get side-outs: B- 1 : attacking after <b>service</b> <b>reception</b> B- 2 : attacking after reception of attacking from reception by opponent team after B- 1 The volleyball skill tests consisted of six individual skills (Serving, Serve reception, Tossing, Spiking, Blocking and Reception) and attacking performance of opponent team. The observed games were the 1988 Spring League of six Intercollegiate Men's Volleyball in Kansai and the performed skills were rated on 30 games, 128 sets with each team and set. These 11 sets which were randomly selected out of them were rated again to investigate the reliabilities of the tests. To investigate the objectivities of the tests, the 11 sets were further rated by another experienced volleyball player. The reliabilities and objectivities of the tests were estimated by using the method of Cramer's V and rates of contingency. To determine the structure of the games, the number of rallies were counted in games. To further examine the structure of the group skills in volleyball games, the frequency of the appearance of composed skill's patterns of the group skills were calculated and investigated. The major results were as follows: 1) It could be inferred that the volleyball skill tests had relatively high reliabilities and objectivities. 2) As the frequency of rallies in volleyball games were calculated, 81. 2 % of attacking had been performed by the second rally. 3) The frequency of performance formed by only blocking was significantly greater in A- 2. The frequency of attacking performed in liaison with blocking, reception, tossing and spiking was also significant and second greatest in A- 2; The attacks of these two skill patterns occupied about 77 % in A- 2. 4) In A- 3, the frequency of attacking performed by only blocking was significantly greater and the frequency of attacking followed spike covering was significantly smaller. 5) 91. 7 % of attacking from <b>service</b> <b>reception</b> (B- 1) was performed in liaison with <b>service</b> <b>reception,</b> tossing and spiking. 6) The frequency of attacking performed by only blocking was significantly higher among the composed skill patterns in B- 2...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Since 2009, the University of Cologne {{has been}} {{developing}} a longitudinal curriculum for teaching social and communicative skills to dental students (LSK-Dent) based on {{the recommendations of the}} Association for Dental Education in Europe (ADEE). As a part of this curriculum it was considered to develop a <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> in the undergraduate treatment courses of the Department of Operative Dentistry and Periodontology involving the organizational and administrative handling of the patients by the students. Students should gain an insight into everyday practice and the <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> should function as a learning environment for social und communicative competences. This article introduces the LSK-Dent project, the implementation of the <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> and presents initial evaluation results. Methods: Patients (n= 575) and students (n= 53) filled out a questionnaire. Additionally, four semi-structured interviews with students were conducted. Results: The <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> was successfully implemented and endorsed by the students. First indications suggest that the <b>reception</b> <b>service</b> was well received by students as a learning environment for social und communicative competences and viewed as an opportunity to gain an insight into everyday practice.

Experimental families (n= 2, 382) were each assigned to a non-forensic family assessment, and control families (n= 2, 247) each received a forensic investigation. Families were assigned continuously over a 15 -month period and then tracked from 45 to 60 months from the date of assignment. Detailed information on services provided and family responses was obtained via two subsamples of experimental and control families.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a unique group of British emigrants in their double {{migration}} experience from Wales to Patagonia {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century and thence to Canada or Australia in the early twentieth. The history of the Welsh Patagonian settlements in the Chubut Valley of Argentina and the Andes foothills has been extensively documented. Less is known about the two subsequent migrations from Patagonia to Canada in 1902, and from Patagonia to Australia between 1910 and 1915. What distinguishes these movements is that, in each case, the settlers migrated as a group and placed a high priority on taking up adjoining land. In their three adopted countries they established discrete Welsh communities, some more enduring than others. There is a general consensus that the initial move from Wales to Patagonia in 1865 was for nationalistic, cultural and linguistic reasons but for those who followed later, economic motives were more common. By the time of the migration from Patagonia to Canada in 1902, there was no illusion that Welsh nationalism could be preserved intact or autonomy guaranteed. Historians dispute the primary motivation for this particular move, some arguing that socio-economic and political factors in Patagonia were paramount, others that it resulted from inducements and political manoeuvrings from Canada and Great Britain. What is clear is the desire of the settlers to return to a country 2 ̆ 7 under a British flag 2 ̆ 7. This paper addresses these issues relating to the Welsh Patagonian migration to Canada in the context of a comparison with the migration to Australia some years later. Such a comparative analysis has not previously been undertaken. Notions of identity and an erstwhile ‘Britishness’ are explored, in terms of the migrant’s sense of self and the political implications of citizenship, military <b>service,</b> <b>reception</b> and assimilation in the host societies. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Broadcasting {{systems are}} {{networks}} where the transmission is received by several terminals. Generally broadcast receivers are passive devices in the network, {{meaning that they}} do not interact with the transmitter. Providing a certain Quality of Service (QoS) for the receivers in heterogeneous reception environment with no feedback is not an easy task. Forward error control coding can be used for protection against transmission errors to enhance the QoS for broadcast services. For good performance in terrestrial wireless networks, diversity should be utilized. The diversity is utilized by application of interleaving together with the forward error correction codes. In this dissertation the design and analysis of forward error control and control signalling for providing QoS in wireless broadcasting systems are studied. Control signaling is used in broadcasting networks to give the receiver necessary information on how to connect to the network itself and how to receive the services that are being transmitted. Usually control signalling is considered to be transmitted through a dedicated path in the systems. Therefore, the relationship of the signaling and service data paths should be considered early in the design phase. Modeling and simulations are used in the case studies of this dissertation to study this relationship. This dissertation begins with a survey on the broadcasting environment and mechanisms for providing QoS therein. Then case studies present analysis and design of such mechanisms in real systems. The mechanisms for providing QoS considering signaling and service data paths and their relationship at the DVB-H link layer are analyzed as the first case study. In particular the performance of different service data decoding mechanisms and optimal signaling transmission parameter selection are presented. The second case study investigates the design of signaling and service data paths for the more modern DVB-T 2 physical layer. Furthermore, by comparing the performances of the signaling and service data paths by simulations, configuration guidelines for the DVB-T 2 physical layer signaling are given. The presented guidelines can prove useful when configuring DVB-T 2 transmission networks. Finally, recommendations for the design of data and signalling paths are given based on findings from the case studies. The requirements for the signaling design should be derived from the requirements for the main services. Generally, these requirements for signaling should be more demanding as the signaling is the enabler for <b>service</b> <b>reception...</b>|$|E
