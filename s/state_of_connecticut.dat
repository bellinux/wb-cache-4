In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Connecticut</b> has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E

A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Connecticut.</b> The house was donated to the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Connecticut</b> for use as a historic house museum.|$|E

5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Connecticut</b> for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Connecticut</b> paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Connecticut</b> was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt toilets, swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E
