This calorimeter is a zero-compensating, thermocouple, twin type. The outside diameter of the aluminum tubing was machined for a <b>slip</b> <b>fit</b> into the glass test tube. Prior to assembling in the test tube, an aluminum plug was pressed in it midway from the ends. A groove was also milled on the outside down to the plug, and a copper-constantan thermocouple was secured in the groove after assembly. A single layer of aluminum foil was used to reduce radiation effects, and stray air currents were excluded with a cotton plug. The two arms of the calorimeter were placed in a three-liter beaker filled with water. The constantan leads of the two thermocouples were soldered together to make them compensating. The copper leads were connected to a L & N potentiometer, and a L & N galvanometer was also used. The potentiometer-galvanometer circuit was so connected that before each reading of the EMF of the thermocouples, the thermal EMF in the circuit could be accounted for. The galvanometer was then mounted on a heavy brass plate. The data show that when the galvanometer is suitably mounted, {{it can be used to}} measure samples of from 50 to 75 curies with a precision of plus or minus one percent.

40|$|The 11 March 2011 Tohoku {{earthquake}} was {{the strongest}} event recorded in recent historic seismicity in Japan. Several researchers reported the deformation and possible mechanism as triggered by a mega thrust fault located offshore at the interface between the Pacific and the Okhotsk Plate. The studies to estimate the deformation in detail and the dynamics involved are still in progress. In this paper, coseismic GPS displacements associated with Tohoku earthquake are used to infer the amount of slip on the fault plane. Starting from the fault displacements configuration proposed by Caltech-JPL ARIA group and Geoazur CNRS, an optimization of these displacements is performed by developing a 3 D finite element method (FEM) model, including the data of GPS-acoustic stations located offshore. The optimization is performed for different scenarios which include the presence of topography and bathymetry (DEM) as well as medium heterogeneities. By mean of the optimized displacement distribution for the most complete case (heterogeneous with DEM), a broad slip distribution, not narrowly centered east of hypocenter, is inferred. The resulting displacement map suggests that {{the beginning of the}} area of subsidence is not at east of MYGW GPS-acoustic station, as some researchers have suggested, and that the area of polar reversal of the vertical displacement is rather located at west of MYGW. The new fault <b>slip</b> distribution <b>fits</b> well for all the stations at ground and offshore and provides new information on the earthquake generation process and on the kinematics of Northern Japan area.

Both earthquakes {{occurred on the}} southern branch of the North Anatolian Fault Zone in Marmara region, which has a lower seismic hazard relative to the northern branch. The two events are the largest earthquakes on the southern branch recorded by a modern and vast seismological network; therefore their records are valuable to evaluate seismic risk {{of the region and}} the understanding of physics of wave propagation. The analysis show that the attenuation of PGAs is very similar for two earthquakes, but they are not represented by the empirical relation obtained for earthquakes occurred on the northern branch. The waveforms of the Gemlik earthquake recorded by BYTNet array indicate an EW rupture orientation with right-lateral <b>slip</b> which <b>fits</b> to the general character of the southern branch.

Resonance frequencies of the surface waves generated within basin are very close to the 1 D site resonances at the stations obtained from H/V ratios of S waves.

The stress concentration induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band was <b>fitted</b> with Eshelby's theoretical model, from which a Hall-Petch coefficient was deduced.

We investigated the geometric alignment between the slip band and various slip systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked slip band if the slip system is poorly aligned with prismatic, pyramidal or basal slip systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of slip across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on prismatic or pyramidal slip systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the slip system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

We also used body waveform modelling inversion to confirm the focal mechanism of the mainshock as a pure thrust mechanism and rule out the existence of considerable strike slip component in the motion. The mainshock occurred along a shallow (depth 7 km), low angle (14 °) thrust fault, parallel to the coastline and dipping to the NE. Our preferred slip distribution model for the mainshock indicates that rupture initiated from SE and propagated towards NW, with a speed of 2. 0 km/s. Moment was released in a main slip patch, confined {{in an area of}} L ∼ 50 km × W ∼ 23 km. The maximum slip (∼ 2. 7 m) occurred ∼ 30 km to the NW of the hypocenter (location of rupture initiation). The average slip is 49 cm and the total moment release over the fault is 4. 38 e 19 Nm. The <b>slip</b> model adequately <b>fits</b> the distribution of the Mw ≥ 4. 3 aftershocks, as most of them are located in the regions of the fault plane that did not slip during the mainshock. The 24 May 1979 (Mw 6. 2) strongest aftershock occurred ∼ 40 km NW of the mainshock. Our preferred slip model for this event showed a characteristic two-lobe pattern, where each lobe is ∼ 7. 5 × 7. 5 km 2. Rupture initiated in the NW lobe, where the slip obtained its maximum value of 45 cm, very close to the hypocenter, and propagated towards the south-eastern lobe where it reached another maximum value — for this lobe — of 30 cm, approximately 10 km away from the hypocenter.

Despite this wealth of evidence {{a number of questions}} remain, including understanding the correlation between its violations and errors sub-components, identifying how these components are related to crash involvement, and testing whether a DBQ based on a reduced number of items can be effective.

40|$|Geodetic imaging {{data and}} seismicwaveformdata have {{complementary}} strengthswhen considering the modelling of earthquakes. The former, particularly modern space geodetic {{techniques such as}} Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), permit high spatial density of observation and thus fine resolution of the spatial pattern of fault slip; the latter provide precise and accurate timing information, and thus the ability to resolve how that fault slip varies over time. In order to harness these complementary strengths, we propose a method through which the two data types can be combined in a joint inverse model {{for the evolution of}} slip on a specified fault geometry. We present here a derivation of Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC) for the joint inversion of multiple data sets that explicitly deals with the problem of objectively estimating the relative weighting between data sets, as well as the optimal influence of model smoothness constraints in space and time. We demonstrate our ABIC inversion scheme by inverting InSAR displacements and teleseismic waveform data for the 1997 Manyi, Tibet, earthquake. We test, using a simplified fault geometry, three cases-InSAR data inverted alone, vertical component teleseismic broad-band waveform data inverted alone and a joint inversion of both data sets. The InSAR-only model and seismic-only model differ significantly in the distribution of slip on the fault plane that they predict. The joint-inversion model, however, has not only a similar distribution of <b>slip</b> and <b>fit</b> to the InSAR data in the InSAR-only model, suggesting that those data provide the stronger control on the pattern of slip, but is also able to fit the seismic data at a minimal degradation of fit when compared with the seismic-only model. The rupture history of the preferred, joint-inversion model, indicates bilateral rupture for the first 20 s of the earthquake, followed by a further 25 s of westward unilateral rupture afterwards, with slip peaking at 7 m in the upper 6 km of the fault. This joint-inversion approach is thus shown to be a viable method for the study of large shallow continental earthquakes, and may be of particular benefit in cases where near-field seismic observations are not available. © The Authors 2014.

Statistical {{analysis of the}} slip vectors is used {{to determine whether the}} North American, Eurasian, or Okhotsk plate overlies the trench. Along the northern Kuril trench, slip vectors are well-fit by the NUVEL- 1 Pacific-North America Euler pole, but are poorly fit by the Pacific-Eurasia Euler pole. Results for the Japan trench are less conclusive, but suggest that much of Honshu and Hokkaido are also part of the North American plate. The simplest geometry consistent with the trench slip vectors is a geometry in which the North American plate extends south to 41 deg N, and possibly includes northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido. Although these results imply that the diffuse seismicity that connects the Lena River delta to Sakhalin Island and the eastern Sea of Japan records motion between Eurasia and North America, onshore geologic and seismic data define an additional belt of seismicity in Siberia that cannot be explained with this geometry. Assuming that these two seismic belts constitute evidence for an Okhotsk block, two published kinematic models for motion of the Okhotsk block are tested.

40|$|International audienceWe use 3 -D {{mechanical}} modeling representing faults as planar surfaces with frictional {{properties that}} obey Coulomb-failure process {{to explore the}} long-term slip rates of the Altyn Tagh fault and Kunlun faults in the north Tibetan plateau. Crustal theology is simplified as an elastoplastic upper crust and a viscoelastic lower crust. Far-field GPS velocities and late Quaternary fault slip rates are used to constrain the model results. Rheological tests show that effective fault friction lower than 0. 1 - 0. 08 leads to high <b>slip</b> rates that <b>fit</b> with geologically and geodetically determined slip rates of the Kunlun fault (10 - 11. 7 +/- 1. 5 mm/yr). Meanwhile, the modeled Altyn Tagh fault reaches slip rates similar to 13. 7 mm/yr to similar to 7. 8 mm/yr in its central portion, between ranges of the geological slip rates. Associated with high slip rates, our model predicts that central Tibet (similar to 84 degrees E- 95 degrees E) from the Altyn Tagh fault {{to the north of}} the Himalayan arc accommodates north-south shortening and east-west extension rates of similar to 10 - 12 mm/yr and similar to 8 - 10 mm/yr, respectively. We also question the widely accepted idea that interseismic strain is driven at the base of the seismogenic zone by a screw dislocation. If this assumption fails, the presented model implies that interseismic strain around large strike-slip faults could be distributed in a much broader way if the lithosphere deforms as a thin elastic plate rather than an elastic half-space with an embedded dislocation. If this distributed deformation is ignored, and the instantaneous surface deformation field modeled as that resulting from slip on a dislocation below a specified depth embedded in an elastic half-space, the estimated slip rate will inevitably be lower than the true long-term slip rate. This appears to explain why geodetic slip rates proposed for the Altyn Tagh fault (510 mm/yr) are lower than some of the geological slip rates. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{evolution}} of slip surface topography using direct shear tests of perfectly mating surfaces. The tests are performed under imposed constant normal stress and constant slip rate conditions, to a sliding distance comparable to the roughness scale of the studied surfaces. Prismatic limestone blocks are fractured in tension using four-point bending and the generated surface topographies are measured using a laser profilometer. The initially rough fracture interfaces are tested in direct shear while ensuring a perfectly mating configuration {{at the beginning of}} each test. The predetermined sliding distance in all tests is 10 mm and the sliding velocity is 0. 05 mm/s. A constant normal stress is maintained throughout the tests using closed loop servo control. The range of normal stresses applied is between 2 MPa and 15 MPa. After shearing, the surface topographies are re-scanned and the geometrical evolution is analyzed. We find that surface roughness increases with increasing normal stress: under normal stresses below 5 MPa the surfaces become smoother compared to the original geometry, whereas under normal stresses between 7. 5 MPa and 15 MPa the surfaces clearly become rougher following shear. Statistical spectral analyses of the roughness profiles indicate that roughness increases with length-scale. Power spectral density values parallel to the <b>slip</b> orientation are <b>fitted</b> by power-law with typical power value of 2. 6, corresponding to a Hurst exponent of 0. 8, assuming self-affine roughness. This power value is consistent for the post-sheared surfaces and is obtained even when the original surface roughness does not follow initially a power-law form. The value of the scaling-law prefactor however increases with increasing normal stress. We find that the deformation associated with shearing initially rough interlocked surfaces extends beyond the immediate tested surface, further into the intact rock material. The intensity of the damage and its spatial distribution clearly increase with increasing normal stress. Wear loss is measured by subtracting the post-shear surface from the pre-shear surface matrices using known reference points. Our measurements indicate that wear loss and roughness evolution are both positively correlated with the mechanical shear work applied during the experiments. We argue, therefore, that normal stress plays a significant role in {{the evolution of}} interlocked surfaces, such as geological faults, and strongly affects the energy partitioning during slip...|$|R
40|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{have been}} shown to trap a pocket of air (or a "plastron") in between the features of their rough texture when submerged in water. A partial slip condition is created at the interface between the water and the submerged body, allowing for a reduction in skin friction drag. I begin by identifying and fabricating several superhydrophobic surfaces, and testing their ability to reduce skin friction in turbulent flows using a bespoke Taylor-Couette apparatus. These superhydrophobic surfaces possess different surface topographies and chemistry, and exhibit different amount of drag reduction, leading to a deeper investigation of the role of surface chemistry and the roughness on the robustness of the plastron. The mean square slope as the driving roughness parameter in promoting plastron stability, and suggest methods by which it may be increased in order to optimize drag-reducing performance. The air plastron captured by a passive superhydrophobic surface represents one way of creating a slip boundary condition. An active approach can be used to augment slip at the boundary. With this approach, a submerged body is heated past its Leidenfrost temperature to form a thick, continuous film of steam between itself and the water. I continue to employ superhydrophobic surfaces, but now exploit their unique heat transfer properties (i. e. the insulation to heat transfer provided by the minimal contact area between the body and the surrounding water) to drastically reduce the Leidenfrost Temperature and Critical Heat Flux, and by extension the energy input required to create and sustain such a boiling film. In the active case, vapor film completely envelops the heated body and is thicker than a typical passive plastron, which allows for a significant increase in obtained drag reduction relative to a passive superhydrophobic surface. I design and fabricate a mechanism by which a Taylor-Couette rotor can be heated past its Leidenfrost point and continuously supplied with power to maintain a boiling film under rotation rates of 60 rad/s. The results show that skin friction can be reduced by over 90 % relative to an unheated superhydrophobic surface at Re = 52, 200, and I derive a boundary layer and <b>slip</b> theory to <b>fit</b> the data to a model that calculates a slip length of 1. 04 ± 0. 3 mm.
