While in 1973, Tyler often sees images from the present day on his television, hears loved ones and medical staff talk about him and to him through phones and portable radios, along with being stalked by Test Card Girl (Rafaella Hutchinson & Harriet Rogers) and experiencing recurring hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|The {{handsome}} scribe Kameni {{has fallen}} in love with Renisenb, and eventually asks her to marry him. Unsure whether she loves him or her father's advisor Hori, whom she has known since she was a child, she leaves the choice effectively in her father's hands and becomes engaged to Kameni. She realises, however, that his relationship with Nofret was closer than she had supposed, and that jealousy may have influenced Nofret's bitter hatred towards the family. Hori and Esa, the elderly mother of Imhotep (a clever woman who although almost completely blind <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> clearer than most others - especially her son) begin to investigate the possibility of a human murderer. Ipy, himself a likely suspect, starts to boast about his new, better position with his father; he plots to get rid of housekeeper Henet and tells her so. The next morning, Ipy is found dead in the lake, drowned.|$|E

However, since his arrest {{it has been reported}} that Lambesis [...] "has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God." ...|$|E

500|$|Mary Alice is {{considered}} the most mysterious of the housewives as only parts of her story are known. A loving, doting wife and mother who was generous to her family and neighbours, she {{was the last person}} any of them expected to commit suicide. In death, Mary Alice <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> she would not have seen when she was alive: her friends' vulnerabilities, lies, and secrets. She does not judge them so much as love them more because of their foibles, pitying them for the ways they manipulate and hurt those they care about most.|$|E
500|$|We {{too often}} forget the {{humanity}} of doctors and nurses. They become godlike {{to most of us}} and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable.

It isn't that he [...] just <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> differently, he also deals with them differently. That is why Noland will dream up a baby derby, a gambling night at the hospital, a variety show at Christmas and off-track betting when patients get bored with the hospital routine.|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{returned}} to Portugal {{ahead of the}} 2001–02 season, joining Primeira Liga club União Leiria on a season-long loan. Reflecting on his time in France, he said [...] "I never hid my desire to return to Portugal, but now I can not say anything more." [...] He made his debut on 11 August 2001 in a 0–0 draw at Braga. Mendes played regularly under the management of José Mourinho prior to his departure to Porto, but fell out of favour under his replacement, Vítor Pontes. He made 16 league appearances for Leiria, helping the club finish 7th in the Primeira Liga, before returning to Strasbourg. Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club. [...] "The Union of Leiria is a complicated club at senior management level, especially the president, who <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> where they do not exist and it creates instability in the squad," [...] said Mendes who [...] "leaves great friends in Leiria".|$|E

500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It {{says there is no}} answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; but no one else does either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also <b>sees</b> <b>things</b> such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E
