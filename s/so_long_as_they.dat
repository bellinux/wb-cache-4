5|$|Souls {{provide a}} variety of effects, and are {{separated}} into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can only have one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. Bullet souls are Soma Cruz's replacement for Sub Weapons in this game, and enable the player to consume a set amount of magic points to use an ability, often some form of projectile. Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars. Guardian souls continually drain magic points <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are activated. Enchant souls are continuously active <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are equipped, and provide increases in statistics or other innate abilities—such {{as the ability to}} walk on water. Ability souls give the player innate abilities, which are often required to traverse certain areas of the castle. Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them, they do not consume magic points.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> do not emerge from their puparia.

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E

While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison {{was not one of}} the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E

5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are activated. Several Guardian souls {{can be used in}} conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E

3000|$|The “Concern” {{class is}} stereotyped with «Kind» and their subclasses have the «Subkind» stereotype.

For example, “Person” is a rigid concept, because if “John” is an instance of “Person,” then it always will be it, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> it exists. The difference between the “Kind” and “Subkind” concepts is that the first one provides the principle of identity to its instances and the second one inherits this principle of another concept.

5|$|The {{events of}} Arkham City are set {{one year after}} Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's {{erstwhile}} director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City.

During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E

Visits from non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than visits from European Union countries (and even more so than visits from Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009.
