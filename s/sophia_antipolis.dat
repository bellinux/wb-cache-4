500|$|Di Gregorio {{took the}} team's first win of the season, at Paris–Nice, winning a windy, rainy stage 7 into <b>Sophia</b> <b>Antipolis.</b> [...] Vinokourov had {{targeted}} this stage, since it {{fell on the}} anniversary of the death of his friend Andrei Kivilev in the 2003 race. It was also during this stage that Kiserlovski slid and crashed on a slippery downhill, and skidded underneath a parked truck. It took several minutes to safely extricate him, and after needing eight stitches to sew up his wounds, he did not start the final stage. Vinokourov won stage 3 of the Tour of the Basque Country with a [...] long solo attack. Kreuziger took his first win of the season at the Giro del Trentino, winning the fourth and final stage. He also was first over the day's last two climbs, which gave him enough points to win the mountains classification. The squad also won the teams classification.|$|E
