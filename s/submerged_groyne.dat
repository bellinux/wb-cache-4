50|$|A groyne (groin in the United States) is a rigid {{hydraulic}} structure built from an ocean shore (in coastal engineering) {{or from a}} bank (in rivers) that interrupts water flow and limits the movement of sediment. It is usually made out of wood, concrete or stone. In the ocean, groynes create beaches or prevent them being washed away by longshore drift. In a river, groynes prevent erosion and ice-jamming, which in turn aids navigation. Ocean groynes run generally perpendicular to the shore, extending from the upper foreshore or beach into the water. All of a groyne may be under water, in which case it is a <b>submerged</b> <b>groyne.</b> The areas between groups of groynes are groyne fields. Groynes are generally placed in groups. They are often used in tandem with seawalls. Groynes, however, may cause a shoreline {{to be perceived as}} unnatural.|$|E
50|$|<b>Groynes</b> can be <b>submerged</b> or {{not under}} normal conditions. Usually {{impermeable}} groynes are non-submerged, since flow {{over the top}} of solid groynes may cause severe erosion along the shanks. <b>Submerged</b> <b>groynes,</b> on the other hand, may be permeable depending on the degree of flow disturbance needed.|$|R
40|$|Sedimentation {{is one of}} the {{consequences}} of hydropower plant construction. Such structures not only have an influence on reservoir morphology, but also have great impact on both upstream and downstream river morphology. This study focuses on fluvial morphological changes in between two hydropower plants on the Drava River, Austria. The influence of both reservoir management methods (flushing) and human intervention (groynes) have been investigated. The first stage started with validating an unsteady Delft 3 D morphodynamic model of the meandering reach. This validation shows the importance of spatial grain size distribution in predicting bed load transport. Analysis of the flushing method includes investigation of the duration of gate-opening before and after peak flood. The results show that the duration of lowering the water level at the hydropower plant (by opening the gate) before starting the peak flood will not have a big influence on the river morphology upstream of the reservoir. However, the duration of maintaining the low water level after the peak flood has a large influence on both the river morphology in the upstream portion of the reservoir and on the sediment transport toward the reservoir In the second part of this study, hydraulic structural groynes were applied in the river reach. The objective was to design a groyne field that will minimize sediment transport to the reservoir. Both emerged and <b>submerged</b> <b>groynes</b> were investigated. In addition, the influences of both groyne head shape and the distribution of sediment grain size in the groyne zone were examined. This study shows that under an unsteady simulation, when the <b>groynes</b> are <b>submerged</b> by 1 m at normal flow, the sediment supply to the groyne zone decreases compared to the emerged case. However, if the <b>groynes</b> are <b>submerged</b> by 0. 5 m, the sediment supply to the groyne zone will be greater than the emerged case for an aspect ratio in between (0. 5 - 2). Finally, applying L-head groynes produces less erosion in the main stream and a higher sediment supply compared to straight groynes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{investigating}} flow, coherent structures, and mechanisms leading to scour around {{a series of}} three <b>submerged</b> <b>groynes</b> in a high curvature (radius of curvature (R) /channel width (B) = 1. 5) channel bend using a Large Eddy Simulation Numerical (LES) model. Flow was investigated during both an initial and a later stage of scour. The results showed that the groynes appeared effective in keeping the main core of high streamwise velocity away from the outer bank wall in the region where they were installed, although high potential still existed for local scour around the groynes. During the initial stage of scour, horseshoe vortices (HVs) showed the greatest propensity to induce scour immediately upstream of the groyne tips. During the later stage of scour, the HV in front of the first upstream groyne (G 1) induced very high mean pressure fluctuations on the outer bank wall. Scour was also of very great concern around the tip of G 1 due to severe mean bed pressure fluctuations. Downstream of the groyne field, the presence of a counter-rotating outer bank cell was capable of endangering the stability of the outer bank. The second focus of this thesis was to investigate flow in a 135 ° channel bend using both Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and LES numerical models. The RANS study examined the effects of curvature ratio (R/B), and aspect ratio (B/H, where H is the inlet flow depth), on secondary circulation strength, and bed shear stresses. The study revealed that a decrease in R/B was associated with an increase in secondary circulation strength and peak bed shear stress. A change in B/H also substantially affected cross stream circulation strength. The LES study was conducted in a 135 ° (R/B = 1. 5) bend flume with a fixed bed corresponding to near equilibrium scour conditions, and the results were compared to a similar high curvature 193 ° bend numerical study. Inner bank vortices and shear layers were present in both cases although their characteristics were substantially different. Distributions of boundary friction velocities, and turbulence were also quite different for each case...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental to the {{understanding}} of how rivers transform and shape our environment is the role of turbulence and complex, three-dimensional flow, such as vorticity, in sediment transport and erosion. However, classical sediment transport models (or formulae) are based, for the most part, on boundary shear stress and do not incorporate these natural phenomena. This is understandable given that the relationship between turbulence generation, intensity and form; the influence of turbulence on mobile sediment; and the magnitude and patterns of deposition and erosion are complex and difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, the failure to incorporate turbulence and complex, three-dimensional flow into existing models means that our understanding of sediment transport remains incomplete. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that vortical motion is the main factor in the development of local scour. To examine this, a comprehensive experimental approach was taken. This approach involved detailed measurements of the unique three-dimensional patterns of velocity, turbulence and bed morphology associated with flow in an open channel with and without the presence of submerged groyne-like structures (stream barbs and wing dikes) at both the laboratory and field scales. Using densely spaced velocity data and new techniques for processing and analyzing these data, it was possible to identify complex features of the flow field at both scales, such as the presence of vortex cores, and correlate these with changes in bed levels. These data provide a unique perspective of the spatial variability of velocity, turbulence and bed morphology in open channels (and in particular in channel bends, where flow is highly three-dimensional). In particular, it was found that, of the flow parameters analyzed, turbulent stresses were most correlated to scour in channel bends without the presence of structures. In contrast, vorticity was found to be the dominant factor in local scour hole development in the vicinity of submerged structures at both the laboratory and field scale. Such data are rare (if non-existent) in existing experimental research, particularly at the scale of a large natural river. This research also examines stream barb design and performance. Stream barbs (also known as <b>submerged</b> <b>groynes</b> or spur dikes) are a relatively novel approach to stream bank protection and are not common in Canada. The design and installation of stream barbs in a creek in Ottawa (Sawmill Creek) was undertaken to serve as a demonstration project for the use of these structures in a semi-alluvial channel, for which no such case studies exist. Three years of monitoring the site and the performance of these structures to reduce bank erosion and improve aquatic habitat have been carried out. Laboratory testing of stream barb performance was also undertaken and showed that with improper design, the outer bank in a channel bend may be more susceptible to erosion due to excessive local scour downstream of the barb. In particular, to avoid bank erosion downstream of the barb, barbs should be small, such that they create minimum flow obstruction, and include a bank key that is wider than the barb itself and extends in the downstream direction...|$|R
40|$|A river {{engineer}} {{is challenged}} {{with the task}} of setting up an appropriate model for a certain application. The model needs to provide suitable answers to the questions asked (i. e. be effective) and needs to do this within the available time (i. e. be efficient). To set up such a model with sufficient accuracy and certainty, a modeller needs to fully understand all processes that determine the flow patterns and the flow resistance. These encapsulate both the physical processes, such as bottom friction and turbulent mixing, as well as the unwanted, ’numerical processes’, due to discretization errors and grid effects. Unfortunately, these errors can be considerably large and can greatly influence model results. To quantify the effects of numerical inaccuracies on the flow patterns and resistance (or backwater) in a river, several building blocks of the governing flow equations were analyzed. In particular for moderate resolutions, where a part of the geometrical variation in a river is captured on the grid, the influence of the momentum advection scheme and the turbulence model on the model results increases. For these modelling aspects, certain common methods were therefore analyzed concerning their accuracy, efficiency and convergence properties, for grid resolutions applied in practical engineering work. The common consensus is that the backwater in river models is dominated by bottom friction and that momentum advection only has a local effect on the water levels and flow patterns. However, in this work, it is demonstrated that the artificial backwater contribution from the momentum advection approximation can be of the same order of magnitude as the bottom friction contribution, depending on the advection scheme. First this is shown using a one-dimensional (1 D) analysis and then it is verified using 1 D and two-dimensional (2 D) numerical experiments with a wavy bed, with emerged and <b>submerged</b> <b>groynes</b> and finally for an actual river. For each test, the backwater contribution of three basic first-order and two second-order accurate advection schemes are computed and compared. The size of this contribution is found to be largely determined by the conservation/constancy properties of the scheme {{and to a lesser extent}} by the order of the scheme. Of course, the bottom friction forms the most important contribution to the total backwater. In 2 D models, the bottom friction computation is considered to be straightforward, in particular when applying the newly-developed subgrid method by Casulli and Stelling [51] and Stelling [219]. However, for three-dimensional (3 D) hydrodynamic models, the computation is more complicated due to the vertical structure of the flow. Most 3 D river models apply the popular σ-layering, where the grid nicely follows the bed and free-surface. At present, z-layer models are seldomly applied in river computations, because they suffer from the problem of inaccurate and discontinuous bottom shear stress representation, commonly assumed to arise due to the staircase bottom representation. At higher grid resolution, where more features of the topography are represented on the grid, a terrain-following coordinate system such as the σ-layering can result in a strong distortion of the grid. This is avoided using a z-layer discretization. Additionally, the latter discretization could be very efficient for river applications, due to the fact that excessive vertical resolution is avoided in shallow areas, such as floodplains. For this purpose, the discretized equations for the z-layer model are analyzed and the cause of the inaccuracies is clearly shown to come from the emergence of thin near-bed layers. Based on this analysis, a new method is presented that significantly reduces the errors and the grid dependency of the results. The method consists of a near-bed layer-remapping and a modified near-bed discretization of the k-ε turbulence model. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated for uniform channel flow, using a schematized 2 D vertical (2 DV) model and for the flow over a bottom sill using the Delft 3 D modelling system (Deltares [69]). Finally a new modelling strategy is presented for improving the efficiency of computationally intensive flow problems in environmental free-surface ﬂows. The approach combines the recently developed semi-implicit subgrid method by Casulli and Stelling (Casulli [46], Casulli and Stelling [51], and Stelling [219]) with a hierarchical-grid solution strategy. The method allows the incorporation of high-resolution data on subgrid scale to obtain a more accurate and efficient hydrodynamic model. The subgrid method improves the efficiency of the hierarchical grid method by providing better solutions on coarse grids. The method is applicable to both steady and unsteady ﬂows, but it is particularly useful in river computations with steady boundary conditions. There, the combined hierarchical grid-subgrid method reduces the computational effort to obtain a steady state with factors up to 43. For unsteady models, the method can be used for efficiently generating accurate initial conditions and further dynamic computations on high-resolution grids. Additionally, the method provides automatic insight in grid convergence. The efficiency and applicability of the method is demonstrated using a schematic test for the vortex shedding around a circular cylinder and a real-world case study on the Elbe River in Germany. <br/...|$|R
