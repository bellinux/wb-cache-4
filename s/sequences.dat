5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the <b>sequences</b> when comparing <b>sequences.</b> These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the <b>sequences</b> have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the <b>sequences</b> being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide <b>sequences,</b> pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar <b>sequences</b> are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in <b>sequences</b> can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} of metagenomic data {{analysis}} requires the execution of certain pre-filtering steps, including the removal of redundant, low-quality <b>sequences</b> and <b>sequences</b> of probable eukaryotic origin (especially in metagenomes of human origin). The methods available {{for the removal of}} contaminating eukaryotic genomic DNA <b>sequences</b> include Eu-Detect and DeConseq.|$|E
5|$|The sujet (syuzhet), or the {{presentation}} of the film, is structured with two timelines: one in color and one in black-and-white. The color <b>sequences</b> are alternated with black-and-white <b>sequences.</b> The latter are put together in chronological order. The color ones, though shown forward (except for the very first one, which is shown in reverse), are ordered in reverse. Chronologically, the black-and-white <b>sequences</b> come first, the color <b>sequences</b> come next.|$|E

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein <b>sequences.</b> The relationship between the nucleotide <b>sequences</b> of genes and the amino-acid <b>sequences</b> of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} a system for giving codes to {{identify}} amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long <b>sequences</b> of amino acids.

5|$|Spielberg and Williams both {{watched a}} rough cut of the film to {{determine}} what scenes would have music. The two decided to leave music out of the fighting <b>sequences,</b> in favor of playing it over long <b>sequences</b> of eight to nine minutes that lack action. The playing of music between fighting <b>sequences</b> gives a moment of reflection for what happened. Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams. This caused the musicians to shuffle their feet in appreciation.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{can travel}} between {{a variety of}} locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which, when selected, will present the player {{with a list of}} available destinations. The DeSoto is also used for several driving <b>sequences,</b> usually involving pursuing or fleeing criminals in other vehicles. In these driving <b>sequences,</b> the player can use Sam's gun, the car's horn, or have Max attempt to communicate with other vehicles via a megaphone. In addition, special inventory items may be used to complete specific puzzles within these <b>sequences.</b> Driving <b>sequences</b> are also used for several minigames, such as pulling innocent drivers over for fabricated felonies. In keeping with the developer's heritage from the LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max Save the World is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.|$|E

In contrast, a <b>sequence</b> that is infinite in both directions—i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element—is called a bi-infinite <b>sequence,</b> two-way infinite <b>sequence,</b> or doubly infinite <b>sequence.</b> A function from the set Z of all integers into a set, such as for instance the <b>sequence</b> of all even integers ( [...] …, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8… [...] ), is bi-infinite.

5000|$|In BioJava a <b>Sequence</b> {{object is}} either a peptide <b>sequence</b> or a {{nucleotide}} <b>sequence.</b> A StrapProtein can hold {{both at the same}} time if a coding nucleotide <b>sequence</b> was read and translated into protein.

25|$|Regulatory <b>sequences</b> {{have been}} known since the late 1960s. The first {{identification}} of regulatory <b>sequences</b> in the human genome relied on recombinant DNA technology.

The evolutionary branch between the primates and mouse, for example, occurred 70–90 million years ago.

50|$|One major use of genomic {{libraries}} is hierarchichal shotgun <b>sequencing,</b> {{which is}} also called top-down, map-based or clone-by-clone <b>sequencing.</b> This strategy {{was developed in the}} 1980s for <b>sequencing</b> whole genomes before high throughput techniques for <b>sequencing</b> were available. Individual clones from genomic libraries can be sheared into smaller fragments, usually 500bp to 1000bp, which are more manageable for <b>sequencing.</b> Once a clone from a genomic library is <b>sequenced,</b> the <b>sequence</b> can be used to screen the library for other clones containing inserts which overlap with the <b>sequenced</b> clone.
