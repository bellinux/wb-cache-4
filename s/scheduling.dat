40|$|Abstract—This paper {{assesses the}} {{resilience}} of <b>scheduled</b> Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) arrival operations. Resilience is defined as an ability to return to nominal operations following a <b>schedule</b> perturbation. Results from a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiment that included off-nominal events to perturb the <b>schedule</b> are described. The <b>schedule</b> comes from a precision trajectory-based arrival manager. The experiment collected data regarding the response to perturbed <b>schedules</b> in three conditions, where: 1) a disturbance rejection algorithm made <b>schedule</b> adjustments automatically, 2) a Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) participant made <b>schedule</b> adjustments manually, or 3) no <b>schedule</b> adjustments were made. Analyses showed that the simulation’s <b>scheduled</b> PBN operations have inherent resilience, recovering from {{more than half of}} the perturbed <b>schedules</b> even with no <b>schedule</b> adjustments. Resilience to the same off-nominal events improved with <b>schedule</b> adjustments; an increased proportion of perturbed <b>schedules</b> recovered within the length of operation run, and the average duration of the <b>schedule’s</b> perturbed state decreased. Compared to the manual <b>schedule</b> adjustments condition, a greater number of <b>schedule</b> adjustments occurred for the same off-nominal events in the automated condition. However, perturbed <b>schedules</b> were recovered more frequently and perturbations were less severe in the automated condition. Subjective and objective workload in the manual and the automated <b>schedule</b> adjustment conditions were similar to the no <b>schedule</b> adjustment condition.

40|$|Six pigeons {{were trained}} on {{multiple}} variable-interval <b>schedules</b> and performance {{was measured in}} {{the presence or absence}} of another variable-interval <b>schedule</b> (the common <b>schedule)</b> arranged concurrently with both components. Manipulations included varying the rate of reinforcement on the common <b>schedule,</b> leaving the common <b>schedule</b> unchanged while the components of the multiple <b>schedule</b> were varied, varying the multiple <b>schedule</b> components in the absence of the common <b>schedule,</b> and varying one component of the multiple <b>schedule</b> while the other component and the common <b>schedule</b> were unchanged. The normal rate-increasing and rate-decreasing effects of reinforcement rate increase were found, except that changing one multiple <b>schedule</b> component did not affect the response rate in the successively available common <b>schedule</b> component. Both concurrent and multiple <b>schedule</b> performance undermatched obtained reinforcement-rate ratios, but the degree of undermatching in multiple <b>schedules</b> was reliably greater. Allocation of responses between multiple <b>schedule</b> components was unaffected by the concurrent availability of reinforcement, and allocation of responses between concurrent <b>schedules</b> was unaffected by the successive availability of different reinforcement rates...|$|R

Our proposed mechanism adaptively determines the sleeping <b>schedules</b> of sensor nodes based on the network traffic load to achieve the balance of throughput and energy consumption. This mechanism consists of two phases: <b>schedule</b> exchange phase and <b>schedule</b> generation phase. In the <b>schedule</b> exchange phase, the <b>schedule</b> parameters are piggybacked in normal transmissions. In the <b>schedule</b> generation phase, sensor nodes adaptively determine the sleeping <b>schedule</b> from the <b>schedule</b> parameters. Eventually, the <b>schedules</b> of all sensor nodes converge to one <b>schedule.</b> The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed mechanism achieves sleeping <b>schedule</b> convergence and high energy efficiency...|$|R
