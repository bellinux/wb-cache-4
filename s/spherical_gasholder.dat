50|$|In the {{southwest}} of the city core, {{at the foot of}} the Ziegenberg, is a <b>spherical</b> <b>gasholder,</b> or gasometer, which is protected by law as a monument. It is one of the oldest spherical gasholders still preserved. Another peculiarity is its riveted casing. Only three other such gasholders are known to exist worldwide (all in Germany, in Schwerte, Offenburg and Bielefeld). The holder had to be moved a few metres owing to construction on the municipal Autobahn, the Hüttentalstraße, and in the residential area of Ziegenberg, and it now forms the symbolic sun as part of a scale model of the planets above the gasholder.|$|E
5000|$|Khan's {{photographs}} or scans {{originate from}} secondary source material - for instance, every {{page of the}} Qur'an, every Beethoven sonata, every William Turner postcard from Tate Britain, or every Bernd and Hilla Becher <b>spherical</b> <b>gasholder.</b> Khan's interest in Islam and layered imagery {{can be traced back}} to his upbringing. Khan is a Muslim by origin. His father is from Pakistan. His mother converted to Islam after meeting his father. It was his father's idea that Khan - himself a non-practicing Muslim - photograph every page of the Qur'an. His work and process have been described as [...] "experiments in compressed memories" [...] and [...] "all-encompassing composites." [...] As Khan describes: [...] "It is a challenge to not define my work as a photograph but using the medium of photography to create something that exists on the surface of the paper and not to be transported back to an isolated moment in time." ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the high}} gassy and low {{permeability}} coal seams geo-conditions in Tiefa mining area in China, the features of mining-induced fractures and gas migration under U model exhaust ventiliation were studied by means of physical simulation and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) numerical modeling. The results show that mining-induced fractures are mainly generated {{on the inside of}} the retreat drift, around 1 / 3 along the retreat direction, and th zone where gas mainly flows range from 30 to 80 m away from the tailgate and behind the coalface 100 m, in which the gas concentration is up to 60 %. Secondly, the methane drainage boreholes layout principles and the echnical system were discussed combined with key technologies of surface boreholes in virgin coal seam, long cross-measure boreholes, long horizontal boreholes in-mines and burying pipe in upper corner of coalface and so on. Finally, the utilization technical problems of drained methane concentration non-uniform and heat unbalanced were solved by using gas compressors, heat unbalanced were solved by using gas compressors, heat balancing adjusters and <b>spherical</b> dehumidification <b>gasholders.</b> At the same time, the methane tranmission, storage, distribution system and the whole utilization system and the utilization modes for civil gas, commercial and industrial gas, low concentration gas power generation in Tiefa coalfield were introduced. The above-mentioned technologies have been applied in Tiefa coalfield and have got technical and economical benefits...|$|R
