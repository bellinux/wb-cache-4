50|$|The {{first step}} in therapy is {{determining}} the habitual speaking fundamental frequency of the individual using an acoustic analyzing program. This is accomplished through several tasks including sustained phonation of the vowels /i/, /a/ and /u/, reading a standardized passage and producing a spontaneous speech sample. Then the therapist and the individual determine what the target pitch should be, based on the gender acceptable range for ciswomen (i.e. a socially acceptable pitch based on the average female vocal pitch range). When therapy begins, they establish a <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> to work on, that is slightly above the client's SFF. The point is to choose a starting pitch that can be produced without strain or excessive vocal effort. As therapy progresses, the target SFF will gradually increase until the goal has been reached. Progression moves from using the target pitch in a sustained vowel to using it in a 2-5 minute conversation.|$|E
50|$|The radar-SART is used {{to locate}} a {{survival}} craft or distressed vessel by creating a series of dots on a rescuing ship's radar display. A SART will only respond to a 9 GHz X-band (3 cm wavelength) radar. It will not be seen on S-band (10 cm) or other radar. Shipboard Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) include one or more search and rescue locating devices.The radar-SART may be triggered by any X-band radar within a range of approximately 8 nautical miles (15 kilometers). Each radar pulse received causes the SART to transmit a response which is swept repetitively across the complete radar frequency band. When interrogated, it first sweeps rapidly (0.4 microsecond) through the band before beginning a relatively slow sweep (7.5 microseconds) through the band back to the <b>starting</b> <b>frequency.</b> This process is repeated {{for a total of}} twelve complete cycles. At some point in each sweep, the radar-SART frequency will match that of the interrogating radar and be within the pass band of the radar receiver. If the radar-SART is within range, the frequency match during each of the 12 slow sweeps will produce a response on the radar display, thus a line of 12 dots equally spaced by about 0.64 nautical mile (1.2 km) will be shown. When the range to the radar-SART is reduced to about 1 nautical mile (2 km), the radar display may show also the 12 responses generated during the fast sweeps. These additional dot responses, which also are equally spaced by 0.64 nautical mile (1.2 km), will be interspersed with the original line of 12 dots. They will appear stronger and larger the closer the interrogating radar gets, slowly becoming arcs at first until the SART is within 1NM, the arcs will become full circles indicating the active SART is in the general area.|$|E

Since the detection probability is a nondecreasing function of the SCNR under the log-likelihood ratio test [27], we employ the SCNR maximization as {{the objective of the}} optimization problem to improve the detection performance. LFM signals are employed as the transmit waveforms. Unlike the FS LFM signals usually adopted in MIMO radars [24, 25], where each of the transmit LFM signals has identical bandwidth and transmit energy and equally spaced <b>starting</b> <b>frequencies,</b> we propose to construct the transmit waveforms as a set of LFM signals whose <b>starting</b> <b>frequencies,</b> bandwidths, and energies can be different and are to be optimized. The prior information about the target and clutter obtained by the cognitive process is used for the waveform optimization. The constraints of the total transmit energy and the allowable range of operating frequency impose restrictions on our optimization problem.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} further {{evidence}} that solar energetic particles are organized by the kinematic properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) [1]. In particular, {{we focus on the}} <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> of type II bursts, which is related to the distance from the Sun where the radio emission starts. We find that the three groups of solar energetic particle (SEP) events known to have distinct values of CME initial acceleration, also have distinct average starting frequencies of the associated type II bursts. SEP events with ground level enhancement (GLE) have the highest <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> (107 MHz), while those associated with filament eruption (FE) in quiescent regions have the lowest <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> (22 MHz); regular SEP events have intermediate <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> (81 MHz). Taking the onset time of type II bursts as the time of shock formation, we determine the shock formation heights measured from the Sun center. We find that the shocks form on average closest to the Sun (1. 51 Rs) in GLE events, farthest from the Sun in FE SEP events (5. 38 Rs), and at intermediate distances in regular SEP events (1. 72 Rs). Finally, we present the results of a case study of a CME with high initial acceleration (~ 3 km s^- 2) and a type II radio burst with high <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> (~ 200 MHz) but associated with a minor SEP event. We find that the relation between the fluence spectral index and CME initial acceleration continues to hold even for this minor SEP event.

40|$|Gravitational-wave {{observations}} of binary neutron star systems can {{provide information about}} the masses, spins, and structure of neutron stars. However, this requires accurate and computationally efficient waveform models that take < 1 s to evaluate for use in Bayesian parameter estimation codes that perform 10 ^ 7 - 10 ^ 8 waveform evaluations. We present a surrogate model of a nonspinning effective-one-body waveform model with l = 2, 3, and 4 tidal multipole moments that reproduces waveforms of binary neutron star numerical simulations up to merger. The surrogate is built from compact sets of effective-one-body waveform amplitude and phase data that each form a reduced basis. We find that 12 amplitude and 7 phase basis elements are sufficient to reconstruct any binary neutron star waveform with a <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> of 10 Hz. The surrogate has maximum errors of 3. 8 % in amplitude (0. 04 % excluding the last 100 M before merger) and 0. 043 radians in phase. The version implemented in the LIGO Algorithm Library takes ~ 0. 07 s to evaluate for a <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> of 30 Hz and ~ 0. 8 s for a <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> of 10 Hz, resulting in a speed-up factor of ~ 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 relative to the original Matlab code.

Using N = 512 provides a minimum resolution of 31.25 Hz which is slightly larger than the required resolution for the lowest semitone frequencies. Note that in the present implementation of the Smt-MF, the first two tones (A 4 and A 4 #) will not be adequately resolved and therefore fall within a single FFT bin which will in turn be mapped to two adjacent channels because the difference between them {{is less than the}} LF resolution (7.8 Hz). To preserve the <b>starting</b> <b>frequency</b> and approach CFs to Greenwood frequencies without having an empty channel, while having frequencies of (A 4 and A 4 #) semitones being in the same bin, it is suggested to activate the first two electrodes.
