5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The <b>Saturday</b> <b>Evening</b> Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the show}} usually starts {{on one day}} and ends on the next, it is often unclear which day the show belongs to.

This is most likely because television guides in Australia start and end each day at 6am.|$|R

After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The <b>Saturday</b> <b>Evening</b> Post promoting the system.|$|E

By June 26, The Posts art editor James Yates notified Rockwell of plans for a layout of paintings with an accompanying essay or accompanying essays by President Roosevelt.|$|E

For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The <b>Saturday</b> <b>Evening</b> Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America.

His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Coggins {{obtained}} more work producing war pictures for other magazines, including {{a series of}} double-page spreads for the controversial newspaper PM, and illustrations for The <b>Saturday</b> <b>Evening</b> Post. Throughout the war years, most of the output of many large corporations was reserved for materiel production; however, management were keen to promote their connection {{to the war effort}} and keep their name before the buying public until they could resume peacetime sales. Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco, Koppers, US Steel, and Westinghouse. He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts, and he was intrigued to later find these charts used during his army basic training.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Quatermass II was telerecorded onto 35mm film during its live transmission, for a {{scheduled}} repeat the following Monday night at 10:15p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies {{in some cases}} suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the <b>Saturday</b> <b>evening,</b> and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. Quatermass II {{was one of the}} first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.|$|E
