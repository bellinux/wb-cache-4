Face-centered cubic (0 0 1) Au thin films were taken as typical examples to illustrate the physical picture. The <b>surface</b> eigen-displacement is a critical <b>surface</b> strain at the equilibrium state after normal relaxation and thus an intrinsic <b>surface</b> property. <b>Surface</b> Poisson's ratios are also intrinsic <b>surface</b> properties.

40|$|In this dissertation, a {{numerical}} method {{to design a}} curved <b>surface</b> for accurately flank milling with a general tool of revolution is presented. Instead of using the ruled <b>surface</b> as the design <b>surface,</b> the flank millable <b>surface</b> can better match the machined <b>surface</b> generated by flank milling techniques, and provide an effective tool to the designer to control the properties and the specifications of the design <b>surface.</b> A method using the least squares <b>surface</b> fitting to design the flank millable <b>surface</b> is first discussed. Grazing points on the envelope of the moving tool modeled by the grazing <b>surface</b> are used as the sample points and a NURBS <b>surface</b> is used to approximate the given grazing <b>surface.</b> The deviation between the grazing <b>surface</b> and the NURBS <b>surface</b> can be controlled by {{increasing the number of}} the control points. The computation process for this method is costly in time and effort. In engineering design, {{there is a need for}} fast and effortless methods to simplify the flank millable <b>surface</b> design procedure. A technique to approximate the grazing curve with NURBS at each tool position is developed. Based on the characteristics of the grazing <b>surface</b> and the geometries of the cutting tool, these NURBS representations at a few different tool positions, namely at the start, interior and end, are lofted to generate a NURBS <b>surface.</b> This NURBS <b>surface</b> represents the grazing <b>surface</b> and is treated as the design <b>surface.</b> Simulation results show that this design <b>surface</b> can accurately match the machined <b>surface.</b> The accuracy of the <b>surface</b> can be controlled by adding control points to the control net of the NURBS <b>surface.</b> A machining test on a 5 -axis machine was done to verify the proposed flank millable <b>surface</b> design method. The machined <b>surface</b> was checked on a CMM and the obtained results were compared with the designed flank millable <b>surface.</b> The comparison results show that the machined <b>surface</b> closely matches the design <b>surface.</b> The proposed flank millable <b>surface</b> design method can be accurately used in the <b>surface</b> design...|$|R

5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid <b>surfaces.</b> Traditionally, solid <b>surfaces</b> have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate <b>surfaces</b> so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy <b>surfaces.</b>|$|E
