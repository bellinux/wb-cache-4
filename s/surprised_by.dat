5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|Team CSC <b>{{surprise}}d</b> <b>by</b> {{announcing that}} Sastre would ride the Giro as helper for Basso, {{that he would}} ride all three Grand Tours. 2005's winner Paolo Savoldelli was strongest in the first stages, and Jan Ullrich took a surprise win in the time trial ahead of Basso, but Basso dominated with three wins on mountain finishes and in the team time trial. Basso won by 9'18.|$|E

5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the size of the crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E

5|$|BoxBoy! {{received}} a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive {{use of the}} box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the amount of content that was offered and agreed that the package was good value for money. However, the game's simple art style was divisive among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the invitation, but felt that it gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E

5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox onside kick. <b>Surprised</b> <b>by</b> the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense {{and a sense of}} optimism triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E

Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the gyrfalcon, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.|$|E
