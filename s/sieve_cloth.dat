500|$|Many basic {{variations}} of cooking utensils available today, such as frying pans, pots, kettles, and waffle irons, already existed, {{although they were}} often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire {{to keep them from}} burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, ladles and graters. In wealthy households {{one of the most common}} tools was the mortar and <b>sieve</b> <b>cloth,</b> since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was farcing (from the Latin farcio, [...] "to cram"), to skin and dress an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Salsnes Filter {{delivers}} a technology used for primary treatment of wastewater. The technology {{could be described}} as a rotating belt sieve with continuously air cleaning of the <b>sieve</b> <b>cloth.</b> The process is referred to as ‘Salsnes filtration’ throughout the text. Salsnes filtration can point out particularly high treatment efficiency, but it is not fully understood how this is obtained. Furthermore {{it is not clear how}} the process should be operated to achieve ‘optimum performance’. In an attempt to understand this, both a theoretical and an experimental approach have been applied; hence the paper consists of two main parts. In the theoretical part, different fouling mechanisms are described, and it is explained how these affect the hydraulic resistance of the <b>sieve</b> <b>cloth</b> and the resulting filtrate flux through it. In the experimental part, sieving under different pressure conditions has been explored. It was not succeeded in obtaining data suitable for statistical analyses, but some useful suggestions were given. Most importantly, it may not be beneficial to establish a particle cake under high pres-sure conditions since this provides low permeability. It was found that upholding of high pressure was sufficient to counteract this, but that a relatively small decrease in pressure results in a significant decrease in filtrate fluxes. It is concluded that Salsnes filtration should strive for a minimum decline in the ratio between pressure difference and hydraulic resistance in order to achieve the most uni-form flux through the belt sieve, which is thought to ensure the highest treatment efficiency. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{cage culture}} is a rapid aquacultural {{practice}} of producing fish with more yield compared to traditional pond culture. Several species cultured by this method include Cyprinus carpio, Orechromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zilli, Clarias lazera, C. gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Citharinus citharus, Distochodus rostratus and Alestes dentes. However, the culture of fish in cages has some problems that are due to mechanical defects of the cage or diseases due to infection. The mechanical problems which may lead to clogged net, toxicity and easy access by predators depend on defects associated with various types of nets which include fold <b>sieve</b> <b>cloth</b> net, wire net, polypropylene net, nylon, galvanized and welded net. The diseases problems are of two types namely introduced diseases due to parasites. The introduced parasites include Crustaseans, Ergasilus sp. Argulus africana, and Lamprolegna sp, Helminth, Diplostomulum tregnna: Protozoan, Trichodina sp, Myxosoma sp, Myxobolus sp. the second disease problems are inherent diseases aggravated by the very rich nutrient environment in cages for rapid bacterial, saprophytic fungi, and phytoplanktonic bloom resulting in clogging of net, stagnation of water and low biological oxygen demand (BOD). The consequence is fish kill, prevalence of gill rot and dropsy conditions. Recommendations on routine cage hygiene, diagnosis and control procedures to reduce fish mortality are highlighte...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyBiological {{wastewater}} treatment {{is often used}} in conjunction with primary treatment to reduce the constituents in wastewater. It is normally necessary to separate the biomass from the treated wastewater {{in order to meet the}} effluent discharge standards. Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) is a biofilm process where plastic carriers carrying the biomass are moving along with the wastewater and typically operating with low concentration of suspended solids in pure biofilm systems. Salsnes Filters AS (SF) is a Norwegian company specializing in design, manufacturing and supply of patented fine mesh filter machines for treatment of primary wastewater and looking to expand use of their products for the separation of biofilm solids following biofilm processes. This study describes an overall assessment of the performance of SF sieve cloths for separation of biofilm solids with and without pre-flocculation from a Norwegian municipal {{wastewater treatment}} plant, Nordre Follo Renseanlegg. The particles in the reactor effluents were characterized with a Malvern Mastersizer and with SF sieves for particle size distribution (PSD). Preliminary jar test trials were performed in order to obtain an optimal dosage of flocculant, mixing and flocculation conditions for subsequent pilot scale testing. The efficiency of two flocculants (cationic polymer based flocculant Superfloc C 496 and polyaluminium hydroxide based flocculant, PAX XL- 60) was evaluated at pilot scale flocculation. 10 different SF <b>sieve</b> <b>cloth</b> with light opening ranging from 11 μm to 500 μm were tested. The results indicate that PSDs vary according to the organic loading on the individual reactors with higher organic loading resulting in smaller particle volumes and the particle size peaked around 100 μm in diameter. The results also indicate SF sieves can be used for MBBR biofilm solids separation with and without pre-flocculation. SS and COD removal efficiencies of SF sieves cloths for unflocculated reactor effluent increased with increasing HRT, decreased organic loading and decreasing light opening of the sieves. The formation of a mat on the <b>sieve</b> <b>cloth</b> during filtration was found to lead to reduced SS removal for some sieves and the mat were found to be clogged quickly after formation. Higher hydraulic capacities lead to lower SS removal efficiencies in most cases and the hydraulic capacities decreased with decreasing light opening. Flocculation changed the particle size characteristics of the reactor effluent and the hydraulic capacities of the sieve cloths. Flocculating with Superfloc C 496 shifted PSD towards larger size range and the SS removal efficiency improved for SF sieves in the larger light opening ranges but resulted in reduced hydraulic capacities. Flocculating with PAX XL- 60 increased the percentage of smaller particle sizes, lowered overall SS removal efficiencies with negative removal in the larger light opening ranges and lowered hydraulic capacities. Online characterization of flocculation enabled the flocculation time during pilot scale flocculation studies to be optimised. It was found that with Superfloc C 496, the minimum flocculation time for the maximum floc size to be achieved is 6 minutes whereas with PAX XL 60, the minimum flocculation time is 9 minutes. Image analysis of the flocs also suggest stirrer design and flocculant have an influence on the shape and structure of the flocs...|$|E

40|$|D. Phil. Over {{a century}} gold {{exploration}} and extraction {{on the central}} Witwatersrand has left a legacy of mine residue deposits. Although {{there have been numerous}} complaints and claims of health effects associated with dust from these residue deposits, mostly these have been dismissed as mere nuisance. This study hypothesized that gold mine tailings on the Witwatersrand pose significant health risks to the nearby communities due to respirable airborne tailings material. Preliminary review of information on the tailings led to the insight that tailings source material and atmospheric properties at receptor sites are poorly characterized {{from the point of view}} of particle size-mass distributions. For years, routine monitoring of emissions from tailings storage facilities has been limited to sampling of dust fallout (settlable particles ≥ 30 μm). A suite of fifty four source samples (thirty-six slime, six newer slime and twelve sand) were collected from tailings storage facilities along the mining corridor covering deposits in the Carltonville area through to Springs. Size class characterization of source material was performed in the diameter range 0. 05 μm to 900 μm using a Malvern® MS- 14 Particle Analyser with 64 channels, from which the respirable (dp< 5 μm) and thoracic (dp < 10 μm) components were measured. Secondly, source materials were sieved (using a <b>sieving</b> <b>cloth)</b> in dp < 5 and < 10 μm fractions and the data derived was used in validating the size class results from the Malvern® MS- 14 Particle Analyser before subjecting the samples to chemical analyses (elemental, mineralogical and radioactivity). Two years of continuous dust fall samples were collected in two different residential areas close to selected tailings storage facilities and subjected to similar size class characterization with the Malvern® MS- 14 Particle Analyser. Further, continuous size-mass characterization of airborne aerosols was conducted in two different locations in the vicinity of tailings storage facilities with the Grimm® aerosol particle counter, in the diameter range 0. 25 μm to 32 μm. The Grimm® aerosol particle counter was collocated with the MicroVol® PM 10 filter sampler ambient monitor. The risk zones around selected tailings storage facilities were established by conducting dispersion modeling with American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD). The spatial evolution of tailings storage facilities and built-up areas is assessed using multiple aerial photographic images, covering four periods from 1952 to 2008. Overall, detailed spatial analysis was conducted and human inhabitants are now at greater risk than before. We have quantified the number of inhabitants living within the high-risk zone surrounding selected tailings storage facilities. The combined areas occupied by tailings storage facilities have increased from ~ 4 km 2 (1952) to 10 km 2 (2002); and residential areas ~ 4 km 2 (1952) to 27 km 2 (2002) within a buffer of 2 km. Population grew between 1952 and 2002 by a factor x 29 at Crown Gold Recoveries; x 43 at Durban Roodepoort Deep (from 1976); and x 25 at East Rand Proprietary Mines...|$|R
40|$|Early larval {{development}} of edible oyster Crassostrea madrasensis (Perston) mature {{male and female}} edible oyster Crassostrea madrasensis selected from the Tuticorin oyster farm were stripped and the eggs were artificially fertilized in glass containers. 91. 5 to 92. 2 percentages of eggs underwent successful fertilization and the larvae were reared up to umbo stage in one experiment. The size of the mature egg varied from 49 to 59 µ,. A method of filtering and washing the eggs using centrifugation was devised as the eggs could not be retained even by the finest <b>sieve</b> (nylobolt bolting <b>cloth</b> 30 HD) available. The fertilized eggs were cultured in different vessels of size ranging from 1 liter to 80 liters containing filtered ultraviolet treated sea water. 85 % of the fertilized eggs successfully reached the straight hinge-stage in 18 to 24 hours.

30|$|The primary {{fermentation}} {{was initiated}} {{by the addition of}} the starter culture. The must was stirred every 12  h with subsequent reading of the specific gravity, pH, temperature and alcohol content for 4  days. After 4  days, the wine was racked into the secondary fermenter. The secondary fermentation was done in an air tight container in which a tube was passed into a clean bottle containing clean water. The essence was to monitor the course of fermentation. This was allowed until completion of fermentation as was evidenced by lack of the appearance of bubbles in the container usually within 3  weeks. Secondary fermentation was done for 21  days. When fermentation stopped, the wine was promptly racked off the lees ensuring minimum exposure to oxygen. After secondary fermentation, the wines were clarified. The clarification/fining were done using bentonite (a clarifying agent). Exactly 500  g of bentonite was dissolved in two litres of boiling water and stirred properly to a gel form. This was allowed to stand for 24  h. Then 150  g of the gel-like bentonite was transferred into each of the wine followed by stirring to dissolve properly. A small quantity of the mixture was collected in a clean bottle which was covered tightly and was used to monitor the process of clarification. This was done for a period of 3  months. Filtration was done after the wines had completed clarification using muslin <b>cloth,</b> <b>sieve</b> and syphon tubes sterilized by 70  % alcohol. The wines was syphoned into the sieve containing four layers of muslin cloth. The residues were removed and the filtrates were allowed to mature for a period of 6  months before other chemical analysis was carried out.|$|R
