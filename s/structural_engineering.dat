5|$|In {{the realm}} of <b>structural</b> <b>engineering</b> and {{technical}} Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2010, Corinthians {{announced}} {{the construction of}} the stadium with an estimated cost of R$335million and an expected gross revenue of R$100million per year. The original plans allow for an expansion to 70,000 seats. The club expected to get financing from BNDES and sell the naming rights for the stadium to pay for the construction costs. The main architect of the project was Aníbal Coutinho; he was assisted by Antônio Paulo Cordeiro from Coutinho, Diegues, Cordeiro (DDG), partnering with Werner Sobek, who rendered <b>structural</b> <b>engineering</b> services.

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} use of low-cost video cameras and low-voltage near-infrared emitter for night-time <b>engineering</b> <b>structural</b> monitoring. The aim of the investigation {{was to determine whether}} near-infrared video could be used for night-time continuous <b>engineering</b> <b>structural</b> monitoring. <b>Engineering</b> <b>structural</b> deformation monitoring trials were carried out using wooden, steel and concrete beams. Factory floor floodlights and near-infrared emitters were used to provide light for the video recording during the tests in total darkness. Multi-station photogrammetric image processing techniques were exploited to obtain accurate 3 D models of the structural deformation. The results show that near-infrared video and colour video give similar 3 D measurement accuracy of around 0. 050 mm. Nevertheless, the near-infrared video technique is more suitable for night-time deformation monitoring as it requires less electric power to illuminate objects continuously in the dark. ...|$|R

Philip Sydney Stott, third son of Abraham and later titled as Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet, was the most prominent and famous of the Stott mill architects. He established his own practice in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries. His factories, which improved upon his father's fireproof mills, accounted for a 40% increase in Oldham's spindles between 1887 and 1914.|$|E

Despite his numerous career-related awards, Hanna was most proud of this Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. His interests also included sailing and singing in a barbershop quartet. Hanna studied both journalism and <b>structural</b> <b>engineering</b> at Compton City College, but had to drop out of college with the onset of the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in <b>structural</b> <b>engineering,</b> in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and <b>structural</b> <b>engineering</b> design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and <b>structural</b> <b>engineering</b> in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
