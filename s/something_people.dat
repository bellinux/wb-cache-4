Speaking to the Western Mail, he described it as [...] "essentially a love story" [...] between Joan and Freddie, {{and he said that}} Lyndhurst [...] "told me he thinks it's the best thing he's ever done".

Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that [...] "it's <b>something</b> <b>people</b> deeply understand.

But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is <b>something</b> <b>people</b> can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eurogamer, Chahi emphasised that the developers tried initially to avoid including overt religious elements in the game. Tribal worship, totems, and animal-shaped monuments are examples of the quasi-religious characters of From Dust. Chahi explained that, during one mission, the player would physically divide an ocean in order to assist their tribe in crossing it and so forth. He indicated that Ubisoft Montpellier were reluctant: [...] "we didn't {{want to take it}} in this direction", but the [...] "game kept pushing us back to it". When asked the meaning of the game's title, Bunier remarked that [...] "it's just another universe, another place, <b>something</b> <b>people</b> create from dust". Separately, Chahi commented that the game centered on the fragility of life and brevity of humankind.|$|E

I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not <b>something</b> <b>people</b> normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, <b>something</b> <b>people</b> have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always do. If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, {{figure out what to do}} and how to do it.|$|E
500|$|Doo wop {{is a kind}} {{of vocal}} harmony music {{performed}} by groups who became popular in the 1950s. Though sometimes considered a kind of rock, doo wop is more precisely a fusion of vocal R, gospel and jazz with the blues and pop structures, though until the 1960s, the lines separating rock from doo wop, R and other related styles were very blurry. Doo wop became the first style of R music [...] "to take shape, to define itself as <b>something</b> <b>people</b> recognized as new, different, strange, theirs" [...] (emphasis in original). As doo wop grew more popular, more innovations were added, including the use of a bass lead vocalist, a practice that began with Jimmy Ricks of The Ravens. Doo wop performers were originally almost all black, but a few white and integrated groups soon became popular. These included a number of Italian-American groups such as Dion & the Belmonts, while others added female vocalists and even formed all-female groups in the nearly universally male field; these included The Queens and The Chantels.|$|E

Hopefully it will be <b>something</b> <b>people</b> have never even {{imagined}} or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun."

2500|$|Finally Kurzweil {{addresses}} {{identity with}} futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone, or gradually turning that same person into a nonbiological entity one surgery at a time. In {{the first case}} {{it is tempting to}} say the clone is not the original person, because the original person still exists. Kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person. He explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is [...] "the ability to be copied, backed up, and re-created" [...] and this is just <b>something</b> <b>people</b> will have to get used to. Kurzweil believes identity [...] "is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us" [...] and that humans are not bound to a specific [...] "substrate" [...] like biology.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said ENDA {{goes beyond}} prohibiting unjust {{discrimination}} and poses several problems.

2500|$|Yamaguchi {{felt that}} the song was a failure, {{because it did not}} bridge the gap between {{underground}} music listeners and listeners of popular music as he had wanted it to. Yamaguchi continued to use the lyrical techniques that he had utilised in [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro", which he saw as <b>something</b> <b>people</b> were more likely to empathise with. He used these on the next song that the band produced after [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro", [...] "Identity" [...] (2010), which was released as a single four months after [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro"'s release. After [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro"'s release, Sakanaction asked electronic musician Rei Harakami to create a remix of the song, as he had done for [...] "Native Dancer", the leading track of their previous album, Shin-shiro (2009). However, Harakami could not find the time in his schedule to create it, before his death in July 2011.|$|E

She wrote: [...] "The pens sharpen – Islamophobia! No such thing.

Zimmer commented [...] "I wanted to write <b>something</b> <b>people</b> would truly hate." [...] The scores for these films were disqualified from receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score due to too many composers being listed on the cue sheet. Zimmer succeeded in reversing the decision not to nominate The Dark Knight in December 2008, arguing that the process of creating a modern film score was collaborative and {{that it was important to}} credit a range of people who had played a part in its production.
