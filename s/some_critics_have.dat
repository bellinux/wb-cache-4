5|$|While <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> {{feared the}} {{revision}} of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson {{has pointed out that}} the proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion. The villages under discussion are situated in gaps inside the perimeter of the existing Champagne regions rather than outside it.|$|E
5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided {{much of the}} basis of his late poetry, which <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E

5|$|Raiden's debut role as {{the protagonist}} of Metal Gear Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his {{unexpected}} substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> {{compared}} 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with parallels {{drawn between}} {{the relationship of}} Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant. It has also been compared to That Girl. Like That Girl and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living {{in a big city}} where she works in the television industry. That Girl was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rocks pilot.|$|E
5|$|The {{franchise}} {{has been}} commercially successful as a multimedia shared universe, though <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> {{found that some}} of its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared universes. The MCU has also {{been the focus of}} other media, outside of the shared universe, including attractions at the Disneyland Resort and Discovery Times Square, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and a commercial with Coca-Cola.|$|E

5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} the first feature length zombie film. A sequel to the film, titled Revolt of the Zombies, opened in 1936. Modern reception to White Zombie has been more positive than its initial release. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> praised {{the atmosphere of the}} film, comparing it to the 1940s horror film productions of Val Lewton, while others still have an unfavorable opinion {{on the quality of the}} acting.|$|E
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards}} to actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5000|$|Public {{awareness}} of Spare {{seems to have}} declined somewhat in the 1960s before the slow but steady revival of interest in his work beginning in the mid-1970s.

5|$|The {{characters}} in the games have been the basis of several pieces of merchandise produced by Square Enix, such as statues, action figures, apparel, and jewelry. They {{have been subject to}} mostly positive reviews; most observers favorably compared the characters to those in the previous games and praised the voice acting, however <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> stated that the plot line of the characters have been confusing when introduced. In XIII-2, the shift to new or secondary characters and the change in importance and story role of the previous game's main cast grated with some reviewers, while others applauded the new characters' development and interactions. In Lightning Returns, the characters' stories were often criticized for being underdeveloped, or simply included for the sake of ending their stories.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that this}} would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is {{nothing at all to}} do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

5000|$|However, <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>had</b> {{negative}} {{reviews for}} the season. Morven Crumlish of The Guardian found it tedious: [...] "A half-absorbed piece of fiction {{will leave the}} characters floundering in their mid-arc torpor. With no end in sight, though, Carrie and Brody can flounder without me." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph agreed: [...] "The ludicrous plot contortions of this season’s early episodes... had all been such a mess." ...|$|R
5000|$|The German {{electronic}} band Kraftwerk mentions Chernobyl at {{the beginning}} of their 1991 remix of their song [...] "Radioactivity", released on the album The Mix. Chernobyl is mentioned along with other places of nuclear incidents and accidents, such as Harrisburg, Sellafield and Hiroshima. The names were included in the remix of the song because <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>had</b> found the original version of the song to be too optimistic towards nuclear energy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>have</b> also blasted Cartoon Network {{for showing}} live-action {{programs}} rather than cartoons.|$|E

50|$|The {{premise of}} a {{paraplegic}} man whose mind remotely controls an alien body also appears in James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar, similar enough for <b>some</b> <b>critics</b> to <b>have</b> called for Anderson to receive credit.|$|R
2500|$|Overall, {{while its}} {{coverage}} of the Tour de France helped OLN expand its carriage to over 60 million homes, critics became concerned that OLN's coverage had placed too much of its focus on Armstrong as its main attraction for viewers, and doubted if OLN could sustain itself without the viewership that Lance Armstrong's presence had brought to its coverage. <b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>had</b> jokingly referred to OLN as the [...] "Only Lance Network" [...] due to its overemphasis on the American rider.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>critics</b> <b>had</b> {{recognized}} Tanaka's {{talents in}} the early Roman Porno, Secret Chronicles: She Beast Market (1974), but it was Watcher in the Attic which brought him mainstream success. Peer Cinema Club Annual, a conservative, mainstream publication, wrote that the film was [...] "a perfect marriage of decadence and art." [...] At first treated as a standard entry of Nikkatsu's [...] "Psycho Killer Showcase" [...] series, after the film began receiving mainstream critical approval, Nikkatsu promoted Walker in the Attic beyond the softcore Roman Porno market.|$|R
