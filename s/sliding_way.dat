According to the {{new kind}} of the upper arm {{mechanism}} of the slag pot carrier, optimization design, simulation and experimental research are carried out, in which the combination of conventional design, three dimensional virtual design and experimental study are applied. The motion law of multi-segment arc <b>slide</b> <b>way</b> of main arm is given by means of researching the motion process of slag ladle in the main arm <b>slide</b> <b>way.</b> The functional relationship among the internal parameters of the arm mechanism, and between load force and arm movement is revealed by studying kinematics of mechanism and dynamics law of the upper arm mechanism. The finite element analysis of the upper arm mechanism is carried out to get the weak links of structure strength, and then the improvement solution is proposed. After experiments, the method correctness of optimization and design of upper arm mechanism is testified by the coincidence of the trial results and experimentation results...|$|R

The test is not only need to be carried out once as the acceptance test but also need to be carried out periodically, in order to keep the machine on it’s best performance. In this research, machine tools will be tested especially on its accuracy of x-axis direction table movement with laser interferometer. Accuracy of table movement test content with positioning accuracy test, angular movement accuracy test and straightness movement accuracy test. Error in machining center table movement was not an individual error, but it was a result of several errors, such as imperfect component, incorrect assembly of machine tools and error in measuring system. In order to perform effective and efficient diagnoses, homogenenous transformation matrix are used to build the model of table movement error. The model of table movement error are built by applying the concept of five bearing contacts on <b>slide</b> <b>ways.</b> Through this model, the form of wear of both guide ways and ballscrew can be determined by comparing the graphic resulted from modeling with the graphic came from direct measuring with laser interferometer.

40|$|Precision surface {{finishes}} {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications. From bearing races and rolling elements to parallel <b>slide</b> <b>ways,</b> the frictional characteristics of these surfaces are critical to the performance of the products. Experimental trial and error has shown that certain surfaces outperform others in certain applications, but the specific surface characteristics that make this true have yet to be fully understood. The research goal was to develop an apparatus that can test the coefficient of rolling/sliding friction of different precision machined surfaces and to combine this data with topographic analysis of the surfaces to correlate specific 3 -D parameters with the frictional performance of a surface. The sample treatments consisted of four different surface textures (hard-turned, ground, honed and isotropic finish) and four different relative surface speeds. By monitoring the torque in the sample-mounting shaft under lubricated conditions the coefficient of rolling/sliding friction of each surface was found. Utilizing white light interferometry measurement of the surfaces, a highly detailed map of each surface was obtained. Using different characteristic values of each machined surface (RMS roughness, asperity density, lay direction, etc.), the frictional behavior of the surfaces were compared to the surface characteristics yielding insight into the relationship between surface finish and friction in rolling/sliding contact. Friction coefficient was found to correlate most strongly with RMS roughness (Sq) and density of surface summits (Sds). These parameters govern mechanical interference of asperities and surface adhesion respectively. These findings suggest that friction coefficients of surfaces could be optimized through manipulation of three-dimensional surface parameters. M. S.
