50|$|In 1889, Barber {{founded and}} {{organized}} the American Straw Board Company. He {{was one of}} the early manufacturers of rubber products, and organized and managed the Diamond Rubber Company up to the time of its acquirement by the B. F. Goodrich Company. The <b>sewer-pipe</b> and steel-tube industry next engaged his attention, and he became a western pioneer in this line of endeavor. He founded the Stirling Boiler Company which was merged with the Babcock & Wilcox Boiler Manufacturing Company of Barberton and Bayonne, New Jersey, the concern thus becoming the largest manufacturer of steel boilers in the world. For a number of years they constructed four-fifths of the product used by the United States Navy.|$|E
5000|$|Denny-Renton Clay and Coal Company, {{founded in}} 1892 as Denny Clay Company, {{was the largest}} {{producer}} of brick pavers {{in the world by}} 1905. An industry journal said in 1909 [...] "The clay products of this company have long been a standard for general excellence in Seattle and the entire northwest" [...] and described its products: [...] "Four great factories are operated by this big Seattle concern, one being devoted exclusively to the manufacture of sewer pipe, with a capacity of two miles of sewer pipe daily; one devoted exclusively to the manufacture of terra cotta; another, the Renton factory, manufactures paving brick of high quality, while the Taylor plant embraces the new <b>sewer-pipe</b> and hollow-ware, as well as the dry-press and fire-brick factories."

5000|$|Due to {{concerns}} of {{significant amount of}} air pollution resulting from the process [...] environmental clean air restrictions led {{to the demise of}} widespread use of salt glazing. It was last used on any large scale for the production of salt-glazed <b>sewer-pipes,</b> and other than limited use by some studio potters the process is obsolete, although there are reports of it still being used for <b>sewer-pipes</b> in India.|$|R
50|$|Salt-glazing, where {{common salt}} is {{introduced}} to the kiln during the firing process. The high temperatures cause the salt to volatize, depositing it {{on the surface of}} the ware to react with the body to form a sodium aluminosilicate glaze. In the 17th and 18th centuries, salt-glazing was used in the manufacture of domestic pottery. Now, except for use by some studio potters, the process is obsolete. The last large-scale application before its demise in the face of environmental clean air restrictions was in the production of salt-glazed <b>sewer-pipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several other {{stoneware}} potteries also {{operated in}} Lambeth between the mid-18th & 19th centuries, including James Stiff and Sons and Stephen Green's Imperial pottery. The former having started his pottery career at Doulton in 1830, before opening his own factory in 1843. Except {{for its use}} by a few studio potters, the process is obsolete. Before its demise, {{in the face of}} environmental clean air restrictions, it was last used in the production of salt-glazed <b>sewer-pipes.</b> The only commercial pottery in the UK currently licensed to produce salt glaze pottery is Errington Reay at Bardon Mill in Northumberland which was founded in 1878.|$|R

5000|$|As of 2010, {{coliform}} contamination {{had continued}} to beset the estuary and the beach from sewage spills and other unknown sources. [...] Over {{the course of a}} few years the city increased the cleaning regime of its <b>sewer-pipes,</b> reducing spills from an unprecedented 44 incidents during 2009 to 35 in 2010, down to 12 in 2011. Nevertheless, in February 2011, a local environmental advocacy organization filed a Clean Water Act lawsuit against the City of Santa Barbara to initiate a comprehensive refit of its sewer infrastructure. After a negotiated 2012 settlement, the City implemented a $26m five-year capital program which nearly doubled the mileage of sewer pipes that it had formerly maintained, and targeted those areas of highest risk of stormwater exfiltration.|$|R
50|$|In 1927 {{entrepreneur}} Reginald Long {{bought a}} controlling interest in Westralian Potteries Ltd and recruited Brisbane {{as general manager}} in 1929. Despite Brisbane not being a major shareholder, the company’s name was changed to H. L. Brisbane & Co. Ltd. Despite the Great Depression, he expanded the company until it challenged Brisbane’s former employer Wunderlich as market leader. In 1938 Wunderlich merged its Western Australian operation with H. L. Brisbane on condition Brisbane wouldn’t expand his business interstate. H. L. Brisbane & Wunderlich Ltd became the state's largest clay tile producer and enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the industry. Over the next 28 years Brisbane built the firm into a large and diversified manufacturing enterprise: it made stainless steel products, clay <b>sewer-pipes,</b> porcelain, refractory bricks, aluminium fabrication, building cladding and plastics. It sold to Australian Fine China in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|By the 1800s Lambeth in London {{has become}} a centre for the {{production}} of salt glaze stoneware, and most especially after the establishment of Doulton and Watts Pottery, which later became Royal Doulton. The company was founded in 1815 when John Doulton formed a partnership with the owner, Martha Jones and foreman, John Watts, of an existing pottery in Lambeth. Initially the factory specialised in utilitarian salt glazed stoneware, similar to that produced by the Fulham factories. During the 1830s and 1840s considerable amounts of salt-glazed <b>sewer-pipes</b> were produced by Doultons following Sir Edwin Chadwick's advocacy of improved sanitary conditions. Doultons were also one of the earliest manufacturers of electrical insulators, initially using salt glaze stoneware and for the electrical telegraph systems. Also, from about 1830 they started production of salt glaze stoneware vessels, which were valued for their acid resistance, for the emerging chemical industries. From the 1850s Doulton & Co.'s decorative stoneware, that was produced in association with the nearby Lambeth School of Art, enjoyed significant success at various international exhibitions, including at The Great Exhibition in 1851, Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876, and also at Chicago in 1893. Their salt glaze decorative products became known as 'Doulton Ware'. By 1890 their decorative stoneware were so successful that 350 designers and artists were employed at the Lambeth factory, including the famous George Tinworth. Doulton’s Lambeth factory closed in 1956, due largely to new clean air regulations that prohibited the production of salt glaze in the urban environment. Production, but not of salt glazing, was transferred to their factory in Burslem which had been established in 1877.|$|R
