40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pelagic</b> {{fish are}} termed “wasp-waist” species as they {{dominate}} mid trophic levels and comprise relatively few species but attain large abundances that can vary drastically in size. They {{have been found}} to exert top-down control on their prey species and bottom-up control on their predators and, in this way, appear to induce unsuspected ecosystem dynamics. Largely based on model results, this chapter explores these effects and associated dynamics, not only illustrating the importance of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish in structuring marine ecosystems, but also revealing the consistency of the role of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish across various upwelling systems in which they play key roles. The Northern and Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt, South Catalan Sea and North and Central Adriatic Sea ecosystems are compared in terms of the importance and role of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish using information gained from landings and ecological models. Trophic level of the catch, the Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index and the ratio of pelagic:demersal fish are calculated from reported landings. Sums of all flows to detritus are compared across modelled ecosystems. Models of the Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt and South Catalan Sea are used to perform two simulations: (1) closure of fisheries on <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish and (2) collapse of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> to further explore the roles of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish in the dynamics of these ecosystems.

40|$|The Java Sea {{is one of}} the {{important}} fishing areas for <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fishery in Indonesia. The production of the fishery was dominated by five fish species groups. To support the management of  that  fishery,  an  assessment  of  the  stock  of  the  five  predominant  small  pelagic  fish  species groups was conducted. Based on the result of analysis, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of the stock of five predominant <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish species was about 244. 6 thousand tons. Meanwhile, the MSY of the stock of the whole exploitable <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish species was about 315. 5 thousand tons. The optimum fishing effort (EMSY) was 1032 units. The total fishing effort was higher than EMSY and the fish stock was likely over-exploited since 2000. To ensure the optimal fish production of the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>stock</b> in the Java Sea, it is necessary to recover fish stock by controlling fishing effort to EMSY.

40|$|International audienceStudies of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish biomass {{are limited}} {{by the fact that}} {{research}} vessels and fishing boats are usually restricted to working areas with a bottom depth > 20 m. Consequently, "unsampled" areas can represent {{a large proportion of the}} continental shelf, and the biomass in those areas can be important and must be taken into account in assessment methods in order to avoid misleading interpretations in population dynamics. A time-series tell years long has been compiled from acoustic-assessment surveys of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> and the results show an overall increase in the acoustic fish density towards the coast, where values were the highest. Additional experiments on transects covering shallow-water areas (5 - 20 m) were conducted from 2001 to 2003 with small boats and a research vessel to evaluate the acoustic fish density in those areas. The results confirmed that the fish biomass in shallow water is significant, sometimes very large, and should be evaluated to avoid underestimation.

40|$|One of the {{expected}} benefits of the Sulu-Celebes Sea Project during its implementation is to have increased fish stocks at demonstration sites, {{as indicated by the}} Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE). Analysis of catch and effort data of the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fisheries by using the surplus yield model was done to obtain information on the likely trend of CPUE for the last ten years. By using the pajeko as the standardized fishing gear the trend of CPUE has been calculated. Between 2000 - 2005, the trend of production (catch), effort and CPUE followed the general pattern of the exploited fisheries that already fully exploited, where the increasing trend of effort was not followed by the increasing catch. On the other hand, the trend of CPUE is decreased. In the following years, the trend of both catch and CPUE do not follow the general pattern of the exploited fisheries. The trend of catch, effort and CPUE has likely been stable, indicating that the fishery in this period has been leveled-off. The status of exploitation of the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish resources in the Indonesian Sulawesi Sea is demermined by the MSY level that has likely been surpassed during the period 2003 - 2004. Therefore with the increasing effort in the following year the trend of catch was relatively stable.

40|$|In {{upwelling}} areas, {{the relationship}} between upwelling intensity and pelagic fish recruitment success appears to be sometimes positively and sometimes negatively correlated. The Optimal Environmemal Window (OEW) hypothesis offers an interpretation for these apparently contradictory results. The OEW hypothesis suggests that a dome shaped relationship exists between recruitment success and upwelling intensity: recruitment success increases with upwelling intensity in areas where wind speed is low or moderate,food availability is then the limiting factor; recruitment success decreases with upwelling intensity in areas of strong wind where physical constraints are the main determinants of larvae mortality rates. Several {{studies have shown that}} {{the relationship between}} recruitment success of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>stocks</b> located in upwelling areas is dome shaped and in agreement with the OEW hypothesis. The limiting factors defined by the OEW hypothesis are also able to account for apparent contradictory patterns observed between reproductive strategies of related species located in geographically distinct areas. The OEW hypothesis applies to eastern boundary current ecosystems located in tropical or subtropical areas where trade winds are responsible for the upwelling process. The applicability of the OEW 10 higher latitude areas like the ICES regions is discussed and an example of an ICES region where upwelling events take place is presented.

40|$|International audienceRecent meta-analyses {{identified}} conservation hotpots at {{the scale}} of the Mediterranean, yet those may be crude by lack of detailed information about the spatial ecology of the species involved. Here, we identify an irreplaceable marine area for > 95 % of the world population of the Scopoli’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), which is endemic to the Mediterranean and breeds on the island of Zembra off Tunis. To this end, we studied the three dimensional at-sea movements of 50 breeding adults (over a total of 94 foraging trips) in 2012 and 2013, using GPS and temperature–depth recorders. Feathers were also collected on all birds to investigate their trophic status. Despite Zembra being the largest seabird colony in the Mediterranean (141, 000 pairs), the per capita home-range of Scopoli’s shearwaters foraging from this colony was not larger than that of birds from much smaller colonies, indicating highly beneficial feeding grounds in the Gulf of Tunis and off Cap Bon. Considering depleted Mediterranean <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> supposed to be Scopoli’s shearwater prey base, we therefore speculate that birds may now also largely feed on zooplankton, something which is supported by our stable isotopic analyses. Crucially, shearwater at-sea feeding and resting areas showed very little overlap with a conservation hotspot recently defined on the western side of the Gulf of Tunis using meta-analyses of species distributions relative to anthropogenic threats. We therefore propose a major extension to this conservation hotspot.

Here we report the first results for systematic zooplankton measurements using a Laser Optical Plankton Counter (LOPC) for years 2004 and 2005. The LOPC provides in situ zooplankton abundance per size bins (size spectrum) which can be used to assess zooplankton community structure. This is defined in three major ways for a single observation: integrated by size and depth (total abundance), integrated by size (vertical profile), and integrated by depth (size structure). 13 descriptors were derived from LOPC data. Mathematical analyses such as PCA or Escoufier equivalent vector method permit to select 4 key descriptors representing the best the planktonic community. Clustering from distance matrices derivate from first four PCA components show the appearance of different structures of plankton community. These findings may result from differences in vertical structure and in plankton dynamics. Comparison with hydrological variables has also been carried out but does not show an obvious relation. However, the different plankton states display spatial areas that have already been identified using hydrological and fish egg data. The results constitute a first global view of planktonic community structure in the Bay of Biscay using data from automatic measurements.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Fisheries are {{increasingly}} being considered in dialogues about nutritional security, amid concern for stresses on fisheries production. The people of coastal Ghana, whose livelihood and culture are based on fishing, present an important case in point. Are Ghanaians who live in fishery dependent coastal communities obtaining the nutritionally and culturally appropriate allocations of locally caught fish? If not, is this due to decreased landings of the <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> <b>stocks</b> the artisanal fishery relies upon, or is it due to other factors, such as changes in post-harvest distribution of fish within the country, or changes in people’s dietary preferences? Does fish {{continue to be a}} culturally and nutritionally important food source for coastal Ghanaians? To answer these questions, I conducted structured interview surveys at five study sites in the Western and Central Regions of Coastal Ghana, from October to December 2016 (n= 308). I utilized a feminist research approach to survey women fish processors, fish sellers, and fish consumers. I also conducted elite interviews with community leaders, fishery NGO members, and government officials (n= 9). My data shows that taste in fish has not changed, and that locally-caught fish continues to be a culturally important food source for coastal Ghanaians, who recognize the role of fish as part of a healthy diet. Decreased landings and a lack of livelihood diversity seem to directly affect the ability of coastal Ghanaians, especially those in the fishery industry, to obtain fish for themselves and for their families. However, changes in consumer purchasing power due to rising costs in fish and decreased income security for those in the fishery sector, and potential changes in fish distribution, may also affect availability of food fish. There existed key differences between the Western Region study sites and the Central Region site, suggesting that the presence and reliance of a cold store, as was reported in the Central Region, affects the community’s nutritional security and vulnerability to declining stocks...|$|E
