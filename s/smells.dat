5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory, and the bad <b>smells</b> and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E
25|$|Most {{non-human}} mammals {{have a much}} keener {{sense of}} <b>smell</b> than humans, although the mechanism is similar. An example of <b>smell</b> in non-mammals is that of sharks, which combine their keen sense of <b>smell</b> with timing to determine {{the direction of a}} <b>smell.</b> They follow the nostril that first detected the <b>smell.</b> Insects have olfactory receptors on their antennae.|$|R

They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new <b>smell.</b> It is {{described}} as 'a green <b>smell,</b> a <b>smell</b> of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart <b>smell,</b> which bore some relation to the <b>smell</b> of bitten apples.' It was the described as the <b>smell</b> of death and destruction, however, it was said to <b>smell</b> fresh, lively and hopeful.|$|R
5|$|The milk {{is first}} carrot-red {{and becomes a}} maroon colour within 10 to 30minutes. The brittle and pale-yellowish flesh is often infested with maggots. If cut or injured it becomes, as the milk, first carrot-red, then maroon and within hours dirty green. The fruit body <b>smells</b> harsh, fruit-like and first tastes mild, but then {{slightly}} resinous-bitter and nearly spicy or somewhat astringent.|$|E
5|$|The white, porous {{hymenium}} has a {{thickness of}} 1–2mm and turns brown when bruised. Per millimeter, {{there are two}} to three square pores. When dried, the hymenium's color becomes pinkish-brown. The hymenium extends slightly down the stipe, and is sharply defined. Dried tissue <b>smells</b> similar to fenugreek. The morphology of the mycorrhiza {{has not yet been}} described; however, as with all other types of Boletopsis {{it is likely to be}} ectomycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia is distinguished from A.onusta {{by the absence of}} clamps, its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty cap, as well as the absence of warts or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also <b>smells</b> distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E
5000|$|Retronasal <b>smell,</b> retronasal olfaction, or mouth <b>smell,</b> is {{the ability}} to {{perceive}} flavor dimensions of foods and drinks. Retronasal <b>smell</b> is a sensory modality that produces flavor. It is best described as a combination of traditional <b>smell</b> (orthonasal <b>smell)</b> and taste modalities. Retronasal <b>smell</b> creates flavor from <b>smell</b> molecules in foods or drinks shunting up through the nasal passages as one is chewing. When people use the term "smell", they are usually referring to [...] "orthonasal smell", or the perception of <b>smell</b> molecules that enter directly through the nose and up the nasal passages. Retronasal <b>smell</b> is critical for experiencing the flavor of foods and drinks. Flavor should be contrasted with taste, which refers to five specific dimensions: (1) sweet, (2) salty, (3) bitter, (4) sour, and (5) umami. Perceiving anything beyond these five dimensions, such as distinguishing the flavor of an apple from a pear for example, requires the sense of retronasal <b>smell.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bobcat {{activities}} {{are confined to}} well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den <b>smells</b> strongly of the bobcat.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout {{that ends}} in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main olfactory system lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne <b>smells.</b> The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating <b>smells</b> was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect <b>smells</b> in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The <b>smells</b> of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of <b>smells,</b> although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E

5|$|Arsenic is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and <b>smells</b> like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15eV.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne <b>smells,</b> such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by <b>smells</b> around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
