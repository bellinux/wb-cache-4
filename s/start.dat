40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether or not <b>starting</b> block height has an effect on the head depth and head speed of competitive racing <b>starts.</b> Eleven experienced, collegiate swimmers executed competitive racing <b>starts</b> from three different <b>starting</b> heights: 0. 21 m (pool deck), 0. 46 m (intermediate block), and 0. 76 m (standard block). One-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated that <b>starting</b> height had a significant effect on the maximum depth of the center of the head, head speed at maximum head depth, and distance from <b>starting</b> wall at maximum head depth. Racing <b>starts</b> from the standard block and pool deck were significantly deeper, faster, and farther at maximum head depth than <b>starts</b> from the intermediate block. There were no differences between depth, speed, or distance between the standard block and pool deck. We conclude that there is not a positive linear relationship between <b>starting</b> depth and <b>starting</b> height, which means that <b>starts</b> do not necessarily get deeper as the <b>starting</b> height increases...|$|R
