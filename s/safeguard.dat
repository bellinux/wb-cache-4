5|$|The second <b>safeguard</b> clause was a {{commitment}} that nothing should be done which might prejudice {{the rights of the}} Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this <b>safeguard,</b> which was drafted together with the preceding <b>safeguard</b> in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary The <b>safeguards</b> {{system of}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is {{intended}} to provide the international community with credible assurance that a State is fulfilling its <b>safeguards</b> obligations. Effective and cost-efficient IAEA <b>safeguards</b> at the facility level are, and will remain, {{an important element of}} IAEA <b>safeguards</b> as those <b>safeguards</b> evolve towards a “State-Level approach. ” The <b>Safeguards</b> by Design (SBD) concept can facilitate the implementation of these effective and cost-efficient facility-level <b>safeguards</b> (Bjornard, et al. 2009 a, 2009 b; IAEA, 1998; Wonder & Hockert, 2011). This report, sponsored by the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Office of Nuclear <b>Safeguards</b> and Security, introduces a methodology intended to ensure that the diverse approaches to <b>Safeguards</b> by Design can be effectively integrated and consistently used to cost effectively enhance the application of international <b>safeguards...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The IAEA {{has never}} before been {{experienced}} with designing a credible <b>safeguards</b> approach for a large scale reprocessing plant. The <b>safeguards</b> discussion was initiated in 1988, {{but at that time}} no available model or guideline that {{could be used as a}} reference. The IAEA the State and JNFL has studied and discussed the <b>safeguards</b> approach and <b>safeguards</b> system, and established effective, efficient and credible <b>safeguards</b> for RRP, under extensive cooperation manner. This paper presents overview of the <b>safeguards</b> system at RRP from the operator’s viewpoint...|$|R
40|$|The US {{has placed}} certain special nuclear {{materials}} declared excess to their strategic needs under international <b>safeguards</b> through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This Presidential initiative has obligated materials at several Department of Energy (DOE) facilities for these <b>safeguards</b> activities {{to demonstrate the}} willingness of the US to ban production or use of nuclear materials outside of international <b>safeguards.</b> However, IAEA inspection activities generally tend to be intrusive in nature and are not consistent with several domestic <b>safeguards</b> procedures implemented to reduce worker radiation exposures and increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of accounting for and storing of special nuclear materials. To help identify and provide workable solutions to these concerns, the Office of <b>Safeguards</b> and Security has conducted a program to determine possible changes to the DOE <b>safeguards</b> and security requirements designed to help facilities under international <b>safeguards</b> inspections more easily comply with domestic <b>safeguards</b> goals during international inspection activities. This paper will discuss the impact of international inspection activities on facility <b>safeguards</b> operations and departmental <b>safeguards</b> procedures and policies...|$|R

40|$|Adult <b>safeguarding</b> is {{the subject}} of {{increasing}} attention in England and internationally. This article draws on research which developed a typology of ‘models of safeguarding’. ‘Models’ refer to different ways local authorities in England organise adult <b>safeguarding</b> (about which there is little evidence) rather than ‘model’ approaches to be emulated. The four models identified were: Dispersed-Generic (<b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken by operational teams); Dispersed-Specialist (<b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken partly by specialist social workers located in operational teams); Partially Centralised-Specialist (some <b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken by a central specialist <b>safeguarding</b> team); and Fully- Centralised-Specialist (all <b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken by a specialist <b>safeguarding</b> team). We explored associations between these models and other important variables (numbers of referrals, kinds of alleged abuse and characteristics of adults at risk) and outcomes. The article reports secondary analysis of English local authority <b>safeguarding</b> referral data and on the possible different costs of different models. Dispersed-Specialist sites appeared to have a higher rate of substantiating alleged abuse compared with other models. Statistical correlations were found with types of victim profiles and the perpetrator/victim relationship. It may be that decisions about local organisation of <b>safeguarding</b> are more affected by local organisational contexts than local authority model...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear <b>safeguards</b> are {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic {{features of}} a facility which reduce probability of the successful acquisition of special nuclear material (SNM) by hostile actors. Future bulk handling facilities in the United States will include both domestic and international <b>safeguards</b> {{as part of a}} voluntary agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. A new framework for <b>safeguards,</b> the <b>Safeguards</b> Envelope Methodology, is presented. A <b>safeguards</b> envelope is a set of operational and <b>safeguards</b> parameters that define a range, or ?envelope,? of operating conditions that increases confidence as to the location and assay of nuclear material without increasing costs from security or safety. Facilities operating within <b>safeguards</b> envelopes developed by this methodology will operate with a higher confidence, a lower false alarm rate, and reduced <b>safeguards</b> impact on the operator. Creating a <b>safeguards</b> envelope requires bringing together security, safety, and <b>safeguards</b> best practices. This methodology is applied to an example facility, the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. An example diversion scenario in the front-end of this nuclear reprocessing facility, using actual operating data, shows that the diversion could have been detected more easily by changing operational parameters, and these changed operational parameters would not sacrifice the operational efficiency of the facility, introduce security vulnerabilities, or create a safety hazard...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the {{findings}} from a study exploring the understanding of vulnerability and adult <b>safeguarding</b> within Christian faith based settings. The article concludes with recommendations for practitioners involved in <b>safeguarding</b> adults in faith based Christian settings. Design/methodology/approach – The paper considers a survey (n= 3182) into understanding of vulnerability and adult <b>safeguarding</b> for individuals who attend Church regularly or work in a Christian organisation Findings - This paper is the first to be undertaken with a UK sample and highlights a range of factors informing adult <b>safeguarding</b> practice within Christian organisations. This includes:- complexity linked to understanding vulnerability and its role in <b>safeguarding</b> activity; lack of clarity about what to do with a <b>safeguarding</b> adult concern, and the need for <b>safeguarding</b> training pertinent to the particular needs of faith based settings. Research limitations/implications - As there is currently a dearth of research in this area this paper makes a valuable contribution to the developing knowledge base around <b>safeguarding</b> and vulnerability within faith based organisations. Practical implications - Professionals need to develop increased understanding of the complexities involved in <b>safeguarding</b> activity, and specifically how those working in the wider context of supporting vulnerable adults make sense of <b>safeguarding</b> processes and procedures. Social implications – It is important that all organisations, including faith based settings, working with adults have an understanding of their roles and responsibilities with respect to <b>safeguarding</b> those at risk of harm. Originality - This paper is the first UK study to consider <b>safeguarding</b> adults at risk of harm in Christian faith context...|$|R
