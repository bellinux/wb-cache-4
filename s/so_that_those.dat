5|$|Originally, the {{decision}} to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The National Park Service {{expressed concern that the}} battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made available by Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. He chose not to sell virtual currency or power-ups <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who paid would not have an advantage over players who didn't. As {{there was no money}} to advertise for the game, the only way to advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, who had more than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E
5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E

5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ {{has taken the}} penalty of the elect - that Jesus died {{for those who would}} believe, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot be damned as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.|$|E
25|$|Under the JG, {{people of}} working age {{who are not}} in {{full-time}} education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage.

25|$|The {{shape of}} the altar was almost a square. In this respect it {{followed}} Ionic models, which specified a wall enclosing the actual sacrificial altar on three sides. On the open side the altar could be accessed via a stairway. For cultic reasons such altars were usually oriented toward the east <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> bringing sacrifices entered the altar from the west. The Pergamene altar follows this tradition, but to a truly monumental extent. The huge, almost square base was 35.64 meters wide and 33.4 meters long and included five steps surrounding the entire structure. The stairway {{on the western side}} is almost 20 meters wide and intersects with the lower level, which itself is almost six meters high. The core of the foundation is composed of intersecting tuff walls arranged like a grating, which increased earthquake stability. This foundation is still preserved and can be examined on site in Pergamon. The upper visible structure consisted of a pedestal, a frieze of slabs 2.3 meters in height with high relief scenes, and a thick, projecting cornice. Grey-veined marble from the island of Marmara was used, which was typical for Pergamon. In addition to the Proconnesian marble of the large frieze, the Telephus frieze and the foundation, darker marble with recognizable fossil inclusions was also used for the base; it came from Lesbos-Moria.|$|E
500|$|Global Times, {{a tabloid}} {{subsidiary}} of People's Daily, wrote three successive belligerent editorials on the case, an act viewed by Hong Kong media as an indirect recognition of China's {{role in the}} disappearances. The first editorial, on 4 January, opined that the bookshop's business model depended on [...] "stirring up troubles on the mainland ..... that it interferes with mainland affairs in a disguised way, and damages the mainland's vital interests to maintain its harmony and stability." [...] On 6 January 2016, they published another editorial stating that Causeway Bay Books being under investigation by Chinese officials for slander is [...] "reasonable", and also noted that [...] "all powerful agencies {{in the world have}} ways to evade the law, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> under investigation will cooperate".|$|E

[...] On May 5, 2015, Dave Magley, head coach and general manager of the Brampton A's during the season, was appointed by the league's Board of Governors to lead the investigation. He had already conducted interviews and spoken to representatives from both teams involved in the brawl. Magley also said that he would consider assuming the position of commissioner if he was approached, succeeding Paul Riley, who was fired in January 2015. Vito Frijia was named league spokesman during the investigation.|$|E

500|$|Recent {{clinical}} and laboratory research by neurosurgeon Julian Bailes, M.D., {{and his colleagues}} from West Virginia University, has resulted in papers showing that dietary supplementation with omega-3 DHA offers protection against the biochemical brain damage that occurs after a traumatic injury. Rats given DHA prior to induced brain injuries suffered smaller increases in two key markers for brain damage (APP and caspase-3), as compared with rats given no DHA. [...] “The potential for DHA to provide prophylactic benefit to the brain against traumatic injury appears promising and requires further investigation. The essential concept of daily dietary supplementation with DHA, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> at significant risk may be preloaded to provide protection against the acute effects of TBI, has tremendous public health implications.” ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the relative disorder of English eighteenth century cookery books such as Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife (1727) or Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper (1769), Mrs Rundell's text is strictly ordered and neatly subdivided. Where those books consist almost wholly of recipes, Mrs Rundell begins by explaining techniques of economy ("A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment {{should be kept in}} writing"), how to carve, how to stew, how to season, to [...] "Look clean, be careful and nice in work, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who have to eat might look on", how to choose and use steam-kettles and the bain-marie, the meanings of foreign terms like pot-au-feu ("truly the foundation of all good cookery"), all the joints of meat, the [...] "basis of all well-made soups", so it is page 65 before actual recipes begin.|$|E
