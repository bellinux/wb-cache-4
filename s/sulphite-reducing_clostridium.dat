40|$|The {{impact of}} {{removable}} and irremovable fouling on {{the retention of}} viral and bacterial indicators by the submerged microfiltration membrane in an MBR pilot plant was evaluated. Escherichia coli, <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridium</b> spores, somatic coliphages and F-specific RNA bacteriophages were used as indicators. The membrane demonstrated almost complete removal of E. coli and <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridium</b> spores. However, there was no correlation with membrane fouling. The phage removal varied {{in accordance with the}} irremovable fouling, rising from 2. 6 to 5. 6 log 10 units as the irremovable fouling increased (measured by the change in the transmembrane pressure). In contrast, removable fouling did not have any effect on the retention of viruses by the membrane. These results indicate that irremovable membrane fouling may affect the removal efficiency of MBRs and, therefore, their capacity to ensure the required microbiological standards for the permeate achievedThis research was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and Innovation (CTM 2009 - 14742 -C 02 - 01) and (CONSOLIDER-CSD 2007 - 00055...|$|E
40|$|Concerns about {{traces of}} {{numerous}} toxic substances and authenticity have prompted consumer demand for honey that is certified as organic, based on strict ecological, natural principles and traceability. The present study aims to characterize organic honey samples (n = 73) from Northeast Portugal, {{with respect to}} floral nectar origin, physicochemical parameters and microbial safety. The phenols and flavonoids contents, {{often referred to as}} responsible for honey’s bioactive properties, were also assessed. All organic honey samples were classified as monofloral lavender (Lavandula sp.), exceeded in quality the international physicochemical standards and showed low microbiological counts (yeast, moulds and aerobic mesophiles), with negative results in respect to fecal coliforms, Salmonella and <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridium</b> spp. Correlation of the palynological, physicochemical and microbiological results is necessary to check the authenticity, quality and sanitation of honey. Although not required by international legislation, results of those assessments provide a complete outlook and elucidation of the organic honey’s properties, which could promote its valorisation...|$|E
40|$|Output {{water from}} dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) {{may be a}} {{potential}} source of infection for both dental healthcare staff and patients. This study compared the efficacy of different disinfection methods {{with regard to the}} water quality and the presence of biofilm in DUWLs. Five dental units operating in a public dental health care setting were selected. The control dental unit had no disinfection system; two were disinfected intermittently with peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide 0. 26 % and two underwent continuous disinfection with hydrogen peroxide/silver ions (0. 02 %) and stabilized chlorine dioxide (0. 22 %), respectively. After three months of applying the disinfection protocols, continuous disinfection systems were more effective than intermittent systems in reducing the microbial contamination of the water, allowing compliance with the CDC guidelines and the European Council regulatory thresholds for drinking water. P. aeruginosa, Legionella spp, <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridium</b> spores, S. aureus and β-haemolytic streptococci were also absent from units treated with continuous disinfection. The biofilm covering the DUWLs was more extensive, thicker and more friable in the intermittent disinfection dental units than in those with continuous disinfection. Overall, the findings showed that the products used for continuous disinfection of dental unit waterlines showed statistically better results than the intermittent treatment products under the study conditions...|$|E
40|$|Hygienistic food {{monitoring}} {{can be performed}} at various supply chain levels; the thesis “Food chains Hygiene: monitoring of retail products and characterization of isolated microbial species (virulence factors, ability to form biofilm, antibiotic resistance) ” focused attention on {{the final phase of}} this distribution chain. Different types of meat and vegetables samples were investigated on microbiological basis. Samples were collected in Naples city (Italy). According to the the CE Regulation 2073 / 2005, the following microbiological protocols were assessed: total bacterial count, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.. The microbiological monitoring was additionally performed to evaluate: <b>Sulphite-reducing</b> Clostridia, <b>Clostridium</b> difficile, Listeria spp and L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus spp. and S. aureus, Campylobacter spp., E. coli O 157 : H 7, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus spp., Aeromonas spp [...] In addition, virulence factors studies were realized. The statistical study involved the verification of positivities registered and the frequency distributions analysis.

40|$|Dried {{culinary herbs}} and spices (DCHS) are minor food {{components}} with widespread use. Despite their low water activity, some microorganisms—including pathogenic and toxigenic ones—can survive in DCHS. The addition of microbial contaminated DCHS to ready-to-eat food in combination with improper food storage can pose a serious health risk for the consumer. In the past, several food-borne disease outbreaks were related to microbial contaminated spices. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an overview on (i) spice/herb production standards important for promoting food safety by preventing microbial contaminations, (ii) public and private standards providing microbiological criteria to assess the microbiological safety of DCHS, and (iii) product testing performed by DCHS producing/processing businesses to comply with these standards. For that, a literature search and a survey among herb/spice businesses were conducted. Several good practices and production guidelines specific for the primary production and/or processing of culinary {{herbs and spices}} were found. Microbiological criteria specific for DCHS are usually rare, but some national standards (mostly of non-EU member states) as well as recommendations by private bodies could be identified. By EU law, no mandatory microbiological criteria specific for DCHS are laid down. The survey indicated a frequent application of business-to-business agreements. The microbiological quality of DCHS was tested by the survey participants mainly in a routine manner by checking every lot or based on buyer–seller agreements. Risk-based testing was less common, which differed to chemical safety testing. Upon import into the EU, testing appeared to be performed predominantly in a routine manner for the pathogenic bacteria Salmonella spp., <b>sulphite-reducing</b> clostridia (including <b>Clostridium</b> perfringens), Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since the Romanian {{literature}} is pretty low quality {{data on the}} influence of hygienic quality ofraw materials and preparations of meat, in our research we intend to pursue these issues in pork andbeef quality I and II. Bacterial load of raw meat products brought in meat technology varies dependingon its quality. Thus, the total number is 44, 640 germs / g beef I and 86, 640 / g beef II. The number ofcoliform bacteria is 329 / g beef I and 420 / g beef II. Protein derivatives stands at a higher bacterialload in soybean meal (5. 04 million / g) than in texturate protein (4, 000 / g). Number of sporulatedaerobic germs in soy flour is 4. 115 million / g and in the protein texture 1, 000 / g. In soy flour therecorded number of coagulase-positive staphylococci is 1, 250 / g and the number of sulphite-reducingclostridium is 250 / g, compared to the number of coagulase-positive staphylococci observed in proteictexturate, 420 / g, and <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>clostridium</b> which is absent, but it is found in texture to soymeal micelium a greater number (161, 000 / g).

40|$|In Mediterranean {{countries}} such as Italy and Portugal an ancient practice among beekepers is {{the production of a}} honey-based product that is called "agua-mel" (Portuguese designation) or "abbamele" (Italian designation) that have not only food applications but also medicinal purposes. However, the characterization of such foodstuff is completely absent in Portugal. In our study the main goal was to provide the general chemical characterization and the microbiological quality of samples of "agua-mel". The chemical characterization showed a great variability of the ash percentage (0. 167 - 0. 474); electrical conductivity (407 - 1067 mu S/cm); free acidity (33. 2 - 91. 2 meq/kg); lactone acidity (14. 60 - 20. 50 meq/kg); total acidity (53. 7 - 122. 72 meq/kg); glucose (185. 57 - 258. 52 g/kg); fructose (218. 49 - 315. 36 g/kg); total polyphenols (1780. 0 - 4963. 8 mg/kg); flavonoids (188. 8 - 1702. 4 mg/kg) and 5 -(hydroxymethyl) - 2 -furaldehyde (HMF) (1812. 6 - 8428. 9 mg/kg), depending on the beekeeper and production year. The microbiological quality included the counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and moulds, Enterobacteriaceae, <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridium</b> spp. and the presence of Salmonella spp. The results showed that from all "agua-mel" samples analyzed only one sample was contaminated with Clostridium spp. and aerobic mesophilic bacteria. Taken together both chemical and microbiological data indicates a safe consumption of "agua-mel"...|$|E

40|$|High sodium intake {{has been}} linked with {{problems}} of hypertension and in Brazil, it still has above that recommended by the World Health Organization. Meat products contribute 20 – 30 % of sodium intake in the diet, indicating the necessity of {{reducing the amount of}} sodium added. The aim {{of this study was to}} reduce the sodium content in Toscana sausages by partial replacement of sodium chloride with PuraQ Arome NA 4 substitute, and to evaluate the effect on physico-chemical and microbiological parameters and sensory acceptability. Three formulations – one control (T 1), and one with 20 % (T 2) and another with 30 % (T 3) sodium reduction compared with the control – were produced. For comparative purposes, the physico-chemical, microbiological and sensory parameters were determined. In the proposed formulations with 20 % and 30 % reduction, the sodium contents were 857. 3 mg 100 g- 1 (T 2) and 790. 3 mg 100 g- 1 (T 3), compared with 926. 7 mg 100 g- 1 in T 1. The produced samples were in accordance with the physico-chemical (moisture, lipid, protein and calcium) and microbiological (Salmonella, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, and <b>sulphite-reducing</b> <b>Clostridium</b> and Coliforms at 45 °C) parameters stipulated by Brazilian law. The analysis of lightness and hue indicated that the sample T 3 had a more intense red colour, while T 1 had a less intense red colour. In the shear force evaluation, no difference was observed between the samples. The sample T 2 was the most preferred in the ordering of preference test; however, in the hedonic scale, there was no difference between the means of sensory values for roast colour, aroma, texture, flavour and overall impression, indicating that all samples had adequate sensory acceptance.
