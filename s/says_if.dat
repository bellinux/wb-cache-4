5|$|Jack Finegan noted {{some early}} writers' {{reckoning}} of the regnal years of Augustus are the equivalent to 3/2 BC, or 2 BC or later {{for the birth}} of Jesus, including Irenaeus (3/2 BC), Clement of Alexandria (3/2 BC), Tertullian (3/2 BC), Julius Africanus (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Thebes (3/2 BC), Origen (3/2 BC), Eusebius of Caesarea (3/2 BC), Epiphanius of Salamis (3/2 BC), Cassiodorus Senator (3 BC), Paulus Orosius (2 BC), Dionysus Exiguus (1 BC), and Chronographer of the Year 354 (AD 1). Finegan places the death of Herod in 1 BC, and <b>says</b> <b>if</b> Jesus was born two years or less before Herod the Great died, the birth of Jesus would have been in 3 or 2 BC. Finegan also notes the Alogi reckoned Christ's birth with the equivalent of 4 BC or AD 9.|$|E

Locke <b>says</b> <b>if</b> Charlie gives up his drugs, the island will give him his guitar, which he misses deeply. Charlie hands over the heroin, Locke shows him where the guitar is, and Charlie is ecstatic. On the beach, Kate refuses to go with Jack to the caves.

On the second day, while practicing a march, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin the flags too fast (because Squidward scolded them to spin the flags faster), causing them to fly {{into the air and}} crash into a blimp. On day three, Plankton plays his harmonica, but becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth, since the harmonica is bigger than he is. On the last day of practice, Squidward <b>says</b> <b>if</b> everyone plays loud, they will be good. However, they play poorly, and Squidward changes the plan of playing loud to quiet. A fish becomes annoyed, saying [...] "Well maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty, claws!" [...] Mr. Krabs is angered by him and attacks, causing everyone to get involved in a huge brawl, smashing the instruments and hurting each other, causing the band to break up. A grieving Squidward expresses his disappointment in all of them and goes home in distress over his failure.|$|E

500|$|After Leslie {{notices the}} name [...] "Liz Waverly" [...] {{in one of}} Kelly's Twilight books, Kelly admits she is his 12-year-old daughter. He is {{divorced}} from her mother, and wants to put Twilight into the time capsule to impress her. Leslie now wants to include it, but Ben (Adam Scott) <b>says</b> <b>if</b> she makes one exception, everyone will want their own item in the capsule. Leslie decides to hold a public meeting so all citizens can make suggestions for capsule items. The meeting descends into chaos when the participants argue over what to include and make absurd suggestions, like human ashes and dead cats. Conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) argues Twilight should not be included because it is too anti-Christian, while a civil liberties organization member says that the book isn't suitable because it is pro-Christian. Leslie tries to compromise by making multiple time capsules, but she ultimately decides to stick to one capsule and include nothing except a video recording of the meeting, which she said represents Pawnee because it shows [...] "a {{lot of people with}} a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in". Ben, a visiting state auditor, says he thinks the residents of Pawnee are strange, but he is impressed by their passion.|$|E
500|$|If {{a bishop}} is a diocesan bishop, it is {{customary}} {{for him to}} combine his arms with {{the arms of the}} diocese following normal heraldic rules. This combining is termed marshalling, and is normally accomplished by impalement, placing the arms of the diocese to the viewer's left (dexter in heraldry) and the personal arms to the viewer's right. The arms of Thomas Arundel are found impaled with those of the See of Canterbury in a document from 1411. In Germany and Switzerland, quartering is the norm rather than impalement. Guy Selvester, an American ecclesiastical heraldist, <b>says</b> <b>if</b> arms are not designed with care, marshalling can lead to [...] "busy", crowded shields. Crowding can be reduced by placing a smaller shield overlapping the larger shield, known as an inescutcheon or an escutcheon surtout. In the arms of Heinrich Mussinghoff, Bishop of Aachen, the personal arms are placed in front of the diocesan arms, but the opposite arrangement is found in front on the arms of Paul Gregory Bootkoski, Bishop of Metuchen. Cardinals sometimes combine their personal arms with the arms of the Pope who named them a cardinal. As Prefect of the Pontifical Household, Jacques Martin impaled his personal arms with those of three successive pontiffs. A married Church of England bishop combines his arms with those of his wife and the diocese on two separate shields placed accollé, or side-by-side.|$|E
500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent.

2500|$|The Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 cover {{people with}} {{contracts}} that purport {{to last for}} a limited duration. The Regulations (unlike the Directive appears to require) were written to only cover [...] "employees" [...] and not the broader group of [...] "workers". In contrast, the European Court of Justice held in Mangold v Helm that equality was a general principle of EU law. This meant that a German Act which required fixed-term contracts be objectively justified after two years work, but gave no protection to workers beyond the age of 52, was unlawful. Likewise, the UK Regulations ban less favourable treatment of fixed-term staff without objective justification. Less generous than other countries, regulation 8 <b>says</b> <b>if</b> an employee has a succession of fixed term contracts lasting over 4 years, the employee is {{to be treated as}} having a permanent contract. In practice, UK law already regulated fixed-term work in this respect, because the qualifying period for unfair dismissal will be met even if an employee has had short breaks in employment.|$|E

2500|$|As {{soon as the}} RSS {{men took}} over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who {{previously}} joined the party because of S.P. Mookerjee were sidelined. The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective {{in the long run}} was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya explained this approach by saying that [...] "coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an ‘opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power.’ Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralized. After India's defeat in the 1962 Sino Indian war, the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the left and centrist opinion, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the 1965 war with Pakistan to 'deepen suspicion about Muslims', and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the Hindi-belt, where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning cow slaughter, abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir and legislating a uniform civil code. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was 'restrictive and exclusive', arguing that [...] "its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of Brahmanism rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism." [...] Desmond <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, [...] "it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars." ...|$|E
