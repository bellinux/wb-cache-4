5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{words and}} phrases used in Revelation had a clearer meaning to ancient readers {{familiar}} with objects of their time. For example, important documents were sent written on a papyrus scroll <b>sealed</b> with several <b>wax</b> <b>seals.</b> <b>Wax</b> <b>seals</b> were typically placed across {{the opening of a}} scroll, so that only the proper person in the presence of witnesses, could open the document. This type of [...] "seal" [...] is frequently used in a figurative sense, in the book of Revelation, and only the Lamb is worthy to break off these seals.|$|R

25|$|Use of the Fisherman's Ring changed {{during the}} 15th century {{when it was}} used to seal {{official}} documents called papal briefs. That practice ended in 1842, when the <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> was replaced by a stamp which affixed the same device in red ink.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sealing</b> <b>wax</b> was {{naturally}} yellowish or pale brownish in tone, {{but could}} also be artificially colored red or green (with many intermediary variations). In some medieval royal chanceries, different colours of wax were customarily used for different functions or departments of state, or to distinguish grants and decrees made in perpetuity from more ephemeral documents.|$|E
25|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into a jar, and the steel lid {{is placed on}} top of the jar with the {{integral}} rubber seal resting {{on the rim of the}} jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used <b>sealing</b> <b>wax,</b> which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John Landis Mason and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.|$|E

25|$|Signet rings have a flat bezel, usually {{wider than}} the rest of the hoop, which is decorated, {{normally}} in intaglio, so that it will leave a raised (relief) impression of the design when the ring is pressed onto soft <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> or a similar material. They have been used since ancient times as the personal seal of an individual. In recent times the design is generally a crest, made by engraving, either in metal or engraved gems (generally semiprecious). Agate is a frequent material, especially carnelian or banded agate like sardonyx; the banding makes the impression contrast with the ground. Most smaller classical engraved gems were probably originally worn as signet rings, or as seals on a necklace. Metal signet rings can also be cast, which may be cheaper but yields a weaker material.|$|E
25|$|In early 1923, and in poor health, Baird {{moved to}} 21 Linton Crescent, Hastings, {{on the south}} coast of England. He later rented a {{workshop}} in the Queen's Arcade in the town. Baird built {{what was to become}} the world's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some darning needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> and glue that he purchased. In February 1924, he demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images. In July of the same year, he received a 1000-volt electric shock, but survived with only a burnt hand, and as a result his landlord, Mr Tree, asked him to vacate the premises. Baird gave the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television at Selfridges department store in London in a three-week series of demonstrations beginning on 25 March 1925.|$|E
25|$|Relief carving became {{common in}} 5th century BC Greece, and {{gradually}} {{most of the}} spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the Sassanian and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed <b>sealing</b> <b>wax,</b> while in the later reliefs it {{was the owner of}} the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as jewellery pendants in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals â later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse ("mirror-writing") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.|$|E

25|$|Howes {{moved to}} the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire for the {{duration}} of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, it was inevitable that another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and <b>Sealing</b> <b>Wax</b> (1946), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My Sister and I (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence {{saw that}} such a {{particle}} accelerator would soon become too long and unwieldy for his university laboratory. In pondering {{a way to make}} the accelerator more compact, Lawrence decided to set a circular accelerating chamber between the poles of an electromagnet. [...] The magnetic field would hold the charged protons in a spiral path as they were accelerated between just two semicircular electrodes connected to an alternating potential. [...] After a hundred turns or so, the protons would impact the target as a beam of high-energy particles. [...] Lawrence excitedly told his colleagues that he had discovered a method for obtaining particles of very high energy without the use of any high voltage. He initially worked with Niels Edlefsen. Their first cyclotron was made out of brass, wire, and <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> and was only four inches (10cm) in diameterâit could literally be held in one hand, and probably cost $25 in all.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wax</b> <b>seals</b> {{were being}} used on a fairly regular basis by most western royal chanceries by {{about the end of}} the 10th century. In England, few <b>wax</b> <b>seals</b> have survived of earlier date than the Norman Conquest, {{although}} some earlier matrices are known, recovered from archaeological contexts: the earliest is a gold double-sided matrix found near Postwick, Norfolk, and dated to the late 7th century; the next oldest is a mid-9th-century matrix of a Bishop Ethilwald (probably Ãthelwold, Bishop of East Anglia). The practice of <b>sealing</b> in <b>wax</b> gradually moved down the social hierarchy from monarchs and bishops to great magnates, to petty knights by the end of the 12th century, and to ordinary freemen by the middle of the 13th century. They also came to be used by a variety of corporate bodies, including cathedral chapters, municipalities, monasteries etc., to validate the acts executed in their name.|$|R

500|$|The Bohemian waxwing was {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Lanius Garrulus. The waxwings were moved to their own genus, Bombycilla, by Vieillot in 1808. The genus name Bombycilla comes from the Greek bombux, [...] "silk" [...] and the Modern Latin cilla, [...] "tail"; this is a direct translation of the German Seidenschwanz, [...] "silk-tail", and refers to the silky-soft plumage of the bird. The species name garrulus is the Latin for talkative and was applied to this bird, as [...] "Garrulus Bohemicus", by Conrad Gessner in 1555; the term is {{a reference to a}} supposed likeness to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) rather than to the waxwing's vocalisations. The English name [...] "waxwing" [...] refers to the bright red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings, which look like drops of <b>sealing</b> <b>wax,</b> while [...] "Bohemian" [...] follows Gessner's usage, and may refer to the Romani, alluding to the bird's wanderings, or to its presumed origin from Bohemia. [...] "Waxwing" [...] and [...] "Bohemian waxwing" [...] were first recorded in 1817, the former as a reference to Vieillot's separation of this bird from the [...] "chatterers".|$|E
500|$|The Bohemian waxwing is a starling-sized bird [...] {{in length}} with a [...] wingspan, {{and an average}} weight of [...] It is short-tailed, mainly brownish-grey, and has a {{conspicuous}} crest on its head. The male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat. There is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye. The lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon-coloured areas around the mask. The rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it. The wings are very distinctive; the flight feathers are black and the primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white [...] "fishhooks" [...] on the closed wing. The adult's secondaries end in long red appendages with the <b>sealing</b> <b>wax</b> appearance that gives the bird its English name. The eyes are dark brown, the bill is mainly black, and the legs are dark grey or black. In flight, the waxwing's large flocks, long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling, and its flight is similarly fast and direct. It clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground.|$|E
