40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{magnetization}} technological parameters optimized {{of sodium}} <b>silicate,</b> {{the properties of}} modified sodium <b>silicate</b> sand with ester hardening have been systematically investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} bonded strength of sodium <b>silicate</b> treated in the magnetic field may be increased by 30 %~ 40 %, the minimum addition content of sodium <b>silicate</b> in mold sand may reduce to 2. 5 %, and thus it improves markedly the collapsibility of the sodium <b>silicate</b> bonded sand. The used time of modified sodium <b>silicate</b> sand increases to 25 %, but the effect of magnetization of sodium <b>silicate</b> will be disappeared after 24 hours, and the magnetization decaying speed enhanced with increasing the modulus of sodium <b>silicate.</b> The magnetization modification has a good effect on the high modulus sodium <b>silicate</b> than the low modulus sodium <b>silicate...</b>|$|R

50|$|Silicates: <b>Silicates</b> {{are another}} small {{molecular}} compound ranging from premium lithium <b>silicates</b> to economical sodium <b>silicates.</b> Chemically, <b>silicates</b> form calcium-silicate hydrate crystals which can densify concrete surfaces and be burnished {{to develop a}} polished appearance. <b>Silicates</b> {{are known to be}} hydrophobic and oleophobic and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away. Noted for crystallization, <b>silicates</b> are frequently used for polishing concrete floors popular in large format retail outlets. <b>Silicates</b> can be applied to new and existing concrete, although they do not comply with ASTM C309 as a curing agent.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, {{there were}} two major {{corrosion}} inhibitors used in vehicles: <b>silicates</b> and phosphates. American made vehicles traditionally used both <b>silicates</b> and phosphates. European makes contain <b>silicates</b> and other inhibitors, but no phosphates. Japanese makes traditionally use phosphates and other inhibitors, but no <b>silicates.</b>|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, as the <b>silicate</b> {{concentration}} in aqueous fluids increases and <b>silicate</b> species becomes more polymerized with pressure and temperature, the types and abundance Qn species more closely resemble those in hydrous <b>silicate</b> melts (Zotov and Keppler 1998; Cody et al. 2005; Mysen 2010). This structural evolution {{may lead to}} complete miscibility between <b>silicate</b> and aqueous fluid. It is likely that complete miscibility between fluid and melt occurs at lower pressure in alkali <b>silicate</b> systems than in those of alkaline earth <b>silicate</b> systems because of the greater <b>silicate</b> solubility in alkali <b>silicate</b> fluids. This conclusion accords with experimental observations that show complete miscibility near 1 – 1.5  GPa in alkali <b>silicate</b> and aluminosilicate systems, whereas pressure exceeds 3  GPa before reaching miscibility in alkaline earth systems (Bureau and Keppler 1999; Stalder et al. 2001; Mibe et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|For decades {{ever since}} the early {{detection}} in the 1990 s of the emission spectral features of crystalline <b>silicates</b> in oxygen-rich evolved stars, there is a long-standing debate on whether the crystallinity of the <b>silicate</b> dust correlates with the stellar mass loss rate. To investigate {{the relation between the}} <b>silicate</b> crystallinities and the mass loss rates of evolved stars, we carry out a detailed analysis of 28 nearby oxygen-rich stars. We derive the mass loss rates of these sources by modeling their spectral energy distributions from the optical to the far infrared. Unlike previous studies in which the <b>silicate</b> crystallinity was often measured in terms of the crystalline-to-amorphous <b>silicate</b> mass ratio, we characterize the <b>silicate</b> crystallinities of these sources with the flux ratios of the emission features of crystalline <b>silicates</b> to that of amorphous <b>silicates.</b> This does not require the knowledge of the <b>silicate</b> dust temperatures which are the major source of uncertainties in estimating the crystalline-to-amorphous <b>silicate</b> mass ratio. With a Pearson correlation coefficient of ~ 0. 24, we find that the <b>silicate</b> crystallinities and the mass loss rates of these sources are not correlated. This supports the earlier findings that the dust shells of low mass-loss rate stars can contain a significant fraction of crystalline <b>silicates</b> without showing the characteristic features in their emission spectra.

40|$|High-resolution {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) and {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) were used to study gadolinium and lanthanum <b>silicate</b> films deposited on Si(1 0 0) substrates using electron-beam evaporaiton from pressed-powder targets. As-deposited films consist of an amorphous <b>silicate</b> layer without an interfacial layer. After annealing at 9000 C in oxygen for 2 min, an interfacial SiO 2 layer is formed in the gadolinium <b>silicate</b> film, while this interfacial layer is a SiO 2 -rich lanthanum <b>silicate</b> layer in the lanthanum <b>silicate</b> film. The formation of interfacial <b>silicate</b> layers is thermodynamically more favorable for the lanthanum films than for the gadolinium films. The gadolinium <b>silicate</b> films crystallize at a temperature between 1000 and 10500 C, while the crystallization temperature for the lanthanum <b>silicate</b> films is between 900 and 9500 C.

40|$|Evidence for {{interstellar}} {{material in}} comets is deduced from IR spectra, insitu measurements of Halley, and chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles (CP IDPs). IR spectra of comets reveal the spectrally active minerals: amorphous carbon, amorphous <b>silicates,</b> and (in some comets) crystalline <b>silicates.</b> Evidence suggests amorphous <b>silicates</b> are of interstellar origin while crystalline <b>silicates</b> are of nebular origin. 10 microns spectra of comets and submicron amorphous <b>silicate</b> spherules in CP IDPs have shapes similar to lines-of-sight through the ISM. Thermal emission models of cometary IR spectra require Fe-bearing amorphous <b>silicates.</b> Fe-bearing amorphous <b>silicates</b> may be Fe-bearing crystalline <b>silicates</b> formed in AGB outflows that are amorphized through He+ ion bombardment in supernova shocks in the ISM. Crystalline <b>silicates</b> in comets, as revealed by IR spectra, and their apparent absence in the ISM, argues for their nebular origin. The high temperatures (less than l 000 K) at which crystals form or are annealed {{occur in the}} inner nebula or in nebular shocks in the 5 - 10 AU region. Oxygen isotope studies of CP IDPs show by mass only 1 % of the <b>silicate</b> crystals are of AGB origin.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of iron and}} sulphur into dust in the interstellar medium and {{the exact nature of}} interstellar amorphous <b>silicate</b> grains is still an open question. We study the incorporation of iron and sulphur into amorphous <b>silicates</b> of olivine- and pyroxene-type and their effects on the dust spectroscopy and thermal emission. We used the Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium theory to construct the optical constants for a mixture of <b>silicates,</b> metallic iron, and iron sulphide. We also studied the effects of iron and iron sulphide in aggregate grains. Iron sulphide inclusions within amorphous <b>silicates</b> that contain iron metal inclusions shows no strong differences in the optical properties of the grains. A mix of amorphous olivine- and pyroxene-type <b>silicate</b> broadens the <b>silicate</b> features. An amorphous carbon mantle with a thickness of 10 nm on the <b>silicate</b> grains leads to an increase in absorption on the short-wavelength side of the 10 μm <b>silicate</b> band. The assumption of amorphous olivine-type and pyroxene-type <b>silicates</b> and a 10 nm thick amorphous carbon mantle better matches the interstellar <b>silicate</b> band profiles. Including iron nano-particles leads to an increase in the mid-IR extinction, while up to 5 ppm of sulphur can be incorporated as Fe/FeS nano inclusions into <b>silicate</b> grains without leaving a significant trace of its presence...|$|R

40|$|The {{exposure}} {{risks of}} toxic arsenic {{in the environment}} are dependent on the adsorption and desorption processes at solid/aqueous interfaces, which could be greatly influenced by co-existing oxyanions such as <b>silicate.</b> In the present work, the adsorption of arsenate [As(V) ], <b>silicate</b> (Si), {{and the influence of}} <b>silicate</b> on As(V) adsorption are investigated at the molecular level by in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. <b>Silicate</b> monomer, dimer, oligomer, and polymer were detected on the TiO 2 surface after 3 h, and <b>silicate</b> oligomer was the predominant surface species under the experimental conditions. The presence of <b>silicate</b> with different <b>silicate</b> and As(V) adsorption sequences did not interfere with As(V) surface species on TiO 2, but only affected the As(V) adsorption capacity. For <b>silicate,</b> the adsorption of As(V) could greatly inhibit the formation of Si monomer and dimer on TiO 2, but the <b>silicate</b> oligomer and polymer were not influenced by As(V) adsorption. The <b>silicate</b> oligomeric and polymeric surface species will gradually occupy the TiO 2 surface sites to inhibit As adsorption and TiO 2 regeneration. Our findings provide spectroscopic evidence and clearly elucidate the molecular-level interactions of <b>silicate</b> and As(V) on TiO 2, which will further our understanding of the removal of As in groundwater.
