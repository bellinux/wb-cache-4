40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to reveal the regulatory properties of bacteriophage preparations in a model of mitogen-induced <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation in mice. We showed that sepharose 4 B-purified preparations of the Staphylococcus aureus phage A 20 /R exhibited costimulatory activity in <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation induced by suboptimal (0. 25 µg/ml) concentrations of ConA. On the other hand, the purified phage fraction was regulatory with regard to <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation induced by the optimal (2. 5 µg/ml) ConA concentration. We also showed that the phage preparation can elicit IL- 6 production in <b>splenocyte</b> cultures and enhance ConA-induced production of that cytokine. Furthermore, the phages preferentially induced IL- 6 production in adherent splenocytes and increased levels of that cytokine in cultures of peritoneal cells from mice and rats. This phenomenon may explain the costimulatory activity of phages in the model described...|$|E
40|$|Background. Natural killer (NK) {{and natural}} killer T (NKT) cells {{contribute}} to the innate host defense but their role in bacterial sepsis remains controversial. Methods. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected intratracheally with 5 × 105 [*]cfu of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Animals were divided into sham group (Sham); pretreated with isotype control antibody (CON) group; pretreated with anti-asialo GM 1 antibody (NKd) group; and pretreated with anti-CD 1 d monoclonal antibody (NKTd) group before bacterial challenge. Serum and tissue samples were analyzed for bacterial load, cytokine levels, <b>splenocyte</b> apoptosis rates, and cell characteristics by flow cytometry. <b>Splenocyte</b> miRNA expression was also analyzed and survival was assessed. Results. NK cell depletion prolonged survival. Upon inhibition of NKT cell activation, spleen NK (CD 3 −/NK 1. 1 +) cells increased compared to all other groups. Inhibition of NKT cell activation led to higher bacterial loads and increased levels of serum and <b>splenocyte</b> IFN-γ. <b>Splenocyte</b> miRNA analysis showed that miR- 200 c and miR- 29 a were downregulated, while miR- 125 a- 5 p was upregulated, in anti-CD 1 d treated animals. These changes were moderate after NK cell depletion. Conclusions. NK cells appear to contribute to mortality in pneumococcal pneumonia. Inhibition of NKT cell activation resulted {{in an increase in}} spleen NK (CD 3 −/NK 1. 1 +) cells and a higher IFN-γ production, while altering <b>splenocyte</b> miRNA expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) -specific, {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes to mediate recovery of mice lethally infected with HSV was examined. Adoptive transfer of <b>splenocytes</b> from mice that had been primed in vivo with HSV and restimulated with HSV in vitro protected lethally infected normal and cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice from death. In contrast, equal numbers of normal <b>splenocytes</b> or immune <b>splenocytes</b> cultured without antigen failed to mediate recovery. Recovery was also transferred by noncultured, primary immune <b>splenocytes,</b> although the protective efficacy of these cells was 10 -fold less than when immune <b>splenocytes</b> restimulated in vitro were used. Treatment of the cells with anti-Thy 1 or anti-Lyt 2. 1 plus complement before adoptive transfer abrogated recovery. No decrease in protection was seen when in vitro-restimulated <b>splenocytes</b> were treated with anti-Lyt 1. 1 plus complement. <b>Splenocytes</b> expression natural killer activity also failed to effect recovery. The administration of hyperimmune anti-HSV antibody to normal, immunocompetent mice resulted in recovery, whereas no significant protection of immunosuppressed mice by anti-HSV was observed. When antibody was given concurrently with cultured immune <b>splenocytes,</b> the percentage of mice that recovered from infection was greater than that seen with either antibody or cultured immune <b>splenocytes</b> alone. These experiments demonstrate that Lyt 2 -positive cells with cytotoxic activity generated by in vitro immunization can mediate recovery from lethal HSV infection, whereas, under the conditions chosen, Lyt 1 -positive cells were unable to mediate recovery...|$|R
40|$|Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is {{emerging}} as a therapy for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), but the full mechanism of action and the impact on immunity have not been fully established. After murine minor histocompatibility antigen–mismatched bone marrow (BM) transplantation (allo-BMT), coinfusion of ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> with T cell–replete BM attenuated GVHD irrespective of the donor strain of the ECP-treated <b>splenocytes,</b> and was associated with increased numbers of regulatory T cells. Coculture of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) with ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> resulted in increased interleukin (IL) - 10 production after submaximal stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, male myeloid DCs exposed to ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> were less potent at inducing CD 8 + HY responses when used as a vaccine in vivo. The efficacy of ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> was enhanced when administered just before delayed donor lymphocyte infusion following T cell–depleted allo-BMT, allowing for the administration of sufficient numbers of T cells to respond to myeloid DC vaccination {{in the absence of}} a thymus. Finally, the therapeutic effect of ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> was lost in recipients of IL- 10 –deficient BM. We demonstrate that ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> attenuate GVHD irrespective of the source of ECP-treated cells via a mechanism that likely involves modulation of DCs and requires IL- 10 produced by BM-derived cells. Importantly, the attenuation of GVHD by ECP-treated <b>splenocytes</b> permits donor lymphocyte infusion–dependent responses to DC vaccines after allo-BMT...|$|R
40|$|The {{interferon}} (IFN) gamma {{production of}} <b>splenocytes</b> from closely related C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn (Sn) and C 57 BL/ 10 ScCr (Cr) mice was compared. Concanavalin A and CD 3 monoclonal antibodies induced {{high levels of}} IFN- gamma in both Sn and Cr <b>splenocytes.</b> By contrast, treatment with gram- negative bacteria induced IFN-gamma only in Sn splenocytes; in Cr <b>splenocytes,</b> the IFN-gamma response was heavily impaired. The IFN-gamma induction by bacteria requires the cooperation of IFN-gamma-producing cells with macrophages. Depletion of macrophages from Sn <b>splenocytes</b> resulted {{in the loss of}} ability to produce IFN-gamma after bacterial stimulation. Reconstitution with new Sn macrophages restored the IFN- gamma responsiveness, whereas reconstitution with Cr macrophages failed to do so. Normal function of IFN-gamma-producing cells and a defective function of macrophages of Cr mice was demonstrated by evidence showing that whole or macrophage-depleted Cr <b>splenocytes,</b> when supplemented with Sn macrophages, acquire the ability to produce IFN-gamma in response to bacteria. A similar effect was achieved by supplementing Cr <b>splenocytes</b> with supernatants of bacteria-stimulated Sn macrophages or with recombinant murine IFN-beta or IFN-alpha. Preincubation of active macrophage supernatants with antibodies to IFN-beta suppressed the helper activity for Cr <b>splenocytes.</b> Moreover, the bacteria-induced production of IFN-gamma by Sn <b>splenocytes</b> could be inhibited by antibodies to murine IFN-beta. The results provide evidence that IFN- beta is an important cofactor of IFN-gamma induction, which is not induced in Cr mice by gram-negative bacteria...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis {{is a type}} of red alga that {{contains}} seaweed polysaccharide agar. In this study, a novel non-agar seaweed polysaccharide fraction named GCP (short of crude polysaccharide obtained from Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis) was isolated from Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis. Structural analysis showed that GCP shows triple helical chain conformation when dissolved in water and has many branches and long side chains. Also, 1 → 3 linkage is the major linkage and the sugar structures are galactopyranose configurations linked by β-type glycosidic linkages. Two macromolecular substance fractions (GCP- 1 and GCP- 2) were purified by DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column chromatography. Moreover, a <b>splenocyte</b> damage assay and <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation assay were used to analyse the bioactivities of GCP, GCP- 1 and GCP- 2. It was demonstrated that polysaccharides could protect <b>splenocyte</b> damaged by H 2 O 2; GCP- 2 shows a greatest protection rate, that is, 92. 8 %, which significantly enhanced the <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation, and GCP showed the highest proliferation rate, 9. 30 %.

40|$|This study {{selected}} 13 {{fruits and}} vegetables to determine their total phenolic and flavonoid contents and their stimulatory effects on <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation from female BALB/c mice. The highest total phenolic content was observed in mulberry (1515. 9 +/- 5. 7 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) / 100 g fresh matter (FM)) among four selected fruit species. The highest total phenolic content was observed {{in a variety of}} red onions (310. 8 +/- 4. 9 mg GAE/ 100 g FM) among nine selected vegetable species.

(1) The major products of glutamine metabolism in <b>splenocytes</b> from normal and diabetic rats were ammonia, glutamate, aspartate and CO 2. (2) The addition of glucose increased (P less than 0. 01) glutamate production, but decreased (P less than 0. 01) aspartate and CO 2 production from glutamine, {{as compared with}} the values obtained in the absence of glucose. However, there were no differences in these metabolites of glutamine at 4 mM- and 15 mM-glucose.

Aim: this study is carried out to show the effect of UV on both <b>splenocyte</b> lymphoproliferative response and their capacity to produce IL- 12 and IL- 10 in mice. Methods: mice were exposed to whole body UVB and tested for the effect of recovery times on <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation and cytokine production. In addition, direct irradiation of spleens and lymphocyte suspension was done. Basal and mitogen-stimulated <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation was assessed by MTT assay while IL- 10 and IL- 12 were measured using ELISA.

We analyzed the involvement of regulatory T cells (Treg) and deletion of alloreactive cells in the induction and maintenance of tolerance after costimulation blockade in a mouse model of graft-vs-host reaction. Injection of splenocytes from the C 57 BL/ 6 parent strain into a sublethally irradiated F(1) offspring (C 57 BL/ 6 x C 3 H) induced a GVHR characterized by severe pancytopenia. Treatment with anti-CD 40 L mAb and CTLA 4 -Ig every 3 days during 3 wk after <b>splenocyte</b> injection prevented disease development and induced a long-lasting state of stable mixed chimerism (> 120 days). In parallel, host-specific tolerance was achieved as demonstrated by lack of host-directed alloreactivity of donor-type T cells in vitro and in vivo. Chimerism and tolerance were also obtained after CD 25 (+) cell-depleted <b>splenocyte</b> transfer, showing that CD 25 (+) natural Treg are not essential for tolerance induction. We further show that costimulation blockade results in enhanced Treg cell activity at early time points (days 6 - 30) after <b>splenocyte</b> transfer. This was demonstrated {{by the presence of}} a high percentage of Foxp 3 (+) cells among donor CD 4 (+) cells in the spleen of treated animals, and our finding that isolated donor-type T cells at an early time point (day 30) after <b>splenocyte</b> transfer displayed suppressive capacity in vitro.

In this study, serum antibody levels, cytokines and <b>splenocyte</b> chemical mediators and peritoneal macrophage cultures from ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized and -challenged mice were examined after continuously consuming G. tsugae supplementation diets for 5 weeks. The results showed that OVA sensitization and challenge significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased the spontaneous production of IL- 2 (Th 1) cytokine, but significantly (P < 0. 05) increased spontaneous and OVA-stimulated IL- 4 (Th 2) production in <b>splenocyte</b> cultures from experimental mice. OVA administration significantly decreased both spontaneous and LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 levels in peritoneal macrophage cultures from experimental mice. However, dietary supplementation with G. tsugae significantly increased spontaneous IL- 2 level, but slightly decreased spontaneous IL- 4 level in cultured <b>splenocyte</b> supernatants in the experimental groups. G. tsugae supplementation enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production in cultured peritoneal macrophages. However, the nitric oxide level from cultured peritoneal macrophages and serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG(2 a) antibody levels was not significantly affected. These results suggest that OVA sensitization and challenge induced a Th 2 -skewed <b>splenocyte</b> response and decreased peritoneal macrophage cytokine secretion. G. tsugae supplementation in vivo modulated the Th 1 /Th 2 balance and enhanced macrophage immune responses. However, the supplementation diet could not fully reverse the Th 2 -skewed responses to level of Th 1 -skewed responses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this process, the spleen is seeded with mobilized bone marrow cells that augment its hematopoietic ability.

To begin to understand this, we investigated the relative potency of adult <b>splenocytes</b> per se to repopulate bone marrow of lethally-irradiated mice and its functional consequences in atherosclerosis. The <b>splenocytes</b> were harvested from GFP donor mice and transplanted into myeloablated wild type recipient mice without the inclusion of any bone marrow helper cells. We found that adult <b>splenocytes</b> repopulated bone marrow of myeloablated mice and the transplanted cells differentiated into a full repertoire of myeloid cell lineages. The level of monocytes/macrophages in the bone marrow of recipient mice was dependent on the cell origin, i. e., the donor <b>splenocytes</b> gave rise to significantly more monocytes/macrophages than the donor bone marrow cells. This occurred despite a significantly lower number of hematopoietic stem cells being present in the donor <b>splenocytes</b> when compared with donor bone marrow cells. Atherosclerosis studies revealed that donor <b>splenocytes</b> displayed a similar level of atherogenic and atheroprotective activities to those of donor bone marrow cells.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{increased}} lymphocyte apoptosis (Ao) detected in peripheral blood T-cells from burn patients appears to contribute to decreased lymphocyte immunoresponsiveness. However, while {{it is known that}} sepsis induces a marked depression in the <b>splenocyte</b> immune response (i. e. decreased interleukin- 2, interferon-γ production and proliferation) in response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), it is unknown whether this depression is associated with an increase in inducible Ao and if so, which mediators control this process. To assess this, splenocytes were harvested from mice at 24 hr (a period associated with decreased Con A response) after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis [caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) ] or sham-CLP (Sham) and then stimulated with 2 · 5 μg Con A/ml (24 hr). Septic mouse splenocytes stimulated with Con A, while not showing a change in their phenotypic make-up, did exhibit a marked increase in the percentage of <b>splenocyte</b> that were Ao+ which was associated with altered cytokine release. This appears to be due to an increase in the percentage of Ao+ cells in the CD 4 + CD 8 − population and was associated with enhanced Fas antigen expression as well as an increase in mRNA for the Fas–FasL gene family. To determine if the changes in Ao are due to either endotoxin (a product of Gram-negative bacteria seen in CLP mice) or the expression of Fas ligand (FasL; a mediator of activation-induced lymphocyte Ao), a second set of studies examining Con A-inducible Ao was performed with splenocytes harvested from septic endotoxin-tolerant C 3 H/HeJ and the FasL-deficient C 3 H/HeJ-Faslgld mice. The results show that increased <b>splenocyte</b> Ao detected following CLP is due to a FasL-mediated process and not to endotoxin.

40|$|Supernatant was {{produced}} from activated peritoneal polymorphonuclear leucocyte-rich cell populations from different strains of mice. These supernatants were studied {{for their ability}} to modify spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis of syngeneic and allogeneic <b>splenocytes.</b> Our results indicate that polymorphonuclear leucocyte-rich cell cultures from two strains of mice, A/J and BALB/c, produced a supernatant that could enhance PHA-induced blastogenesis of syngeneic and allogeneic <b>splenocytes.</b> Cells from a third strain C 57 B 1 / 6, did not produce an active supernatant. In general, the response by <b>splenocytes</b> from these three strains paralleled the production of active supernatant that we observed. The response to the active supernatant was dependent upon the mitogen stimulation of the <b>splenocytes,</b> the mitogen dilution and the supernatant activity.

40|$|Abstract Background Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative {{agent for}} melioidosis. For many {{bacterial}} infections, cytokine dysregulation {{is one of}} the contributing factors to the severe clinical outcomes in the susceptible hosts. The C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice have been established as a differential model of susceptibility in murine melioidosis. In this study, we compared the innate IFN-γ response to B. pseudomallei between the C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c <b>splenocytes</b> and characterized the hyperproduction of IFN-γ in the relatively susceptible BALB/c mice in vitro. Results Naïve BALB/c <b>splenocytes</b> were found to produce more IFN-γ in response to live bacterial infection compared to C 57 BL/ 6 <b>splenocytes.</b> Natural killer cells were found to be the major producers of IFN-γ, while T cells and Gr- 1 intermediate cells also contributed to the IFN-γ response. Although anti-Gr- 1 depletion substantially reduced the IFN-γ response, this was not due to the contribution of Gr- 1 high, Ly- 6 G expressing neutrophils. We found no differences in the cell types making IFN-γ between BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 <b>splenocytes.</b> Although IL- 12 is essential for the IFN-γ response, BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 <b>splenocytes</b> made similar amounts of IL- 12 after infection. However, BALB/c <b>splenocytes</b> produced higher proinflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 β, TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 18 than C 57 BL/ 6 <b>splenocytes</b> after infection with B. pseudomallei. Conclusion Higher percentages of Gr- 1 expressing NK and T cells, poorer ability in controlling bacteria growth, and higher IL- 18 could be the factors contributing to IFN-γ hyperproduction in BALB/c mice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} optimal {{combined}} ratio of baicalin, icariin and Astragalus saponin Ⅰ from a Chinese herbal compound Biminne. Methods: Firstly, a mouse model of allergic rhinitis {{was established by}} intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) and aluminum hydroxide gel suspension, and the effective dose range of baicalin, icariin and Astragalus saponin Ⅰ was detected by 2, 3 -bis(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium- 5 -carboxanilide inner salt method. Secondly, 10 groups of combinations of baicalin, icariin and Astragalus saponin Ⅰ assembled by U* 10 (108) form were employed to determine the optimal combination by means of analyzing of the inhibitory effect on the <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation. Finally, the effects of each effective ingredient and the optimal combination were compared by observing the <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation, the contents of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 5, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in supernatant of the <b>splenocyte</b> cultures and the ratio of IL- 4 to IFN-γ in order to verify the result. Results: Baicalin or icariin at concentrations ranging from 2 to 10 μmol/L, and Astragalus saponin Ⅰ from 1 to 10 μmol/L effectively suppressed the <b>splenocyte</b> proliferation. When the proportion of baicalin, icariin and Astragalus saponin Ⅰ was 1 ∶ 2. 14 ∶ 2. 65, the inhibitory effect was most remarkable. Further research confirmed the rationality of the optimal combination. Conclusion: An optimal combination of the major effective ingredients from Chinese herbal compound Biminne most effectively suppresses the proliferation of splenocytes from sensitized mice and regulates the cytokine secreting...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{treatment of}} parenteral arginine and the {{nitric oxide synthase}} inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) {{have been shown to}} improve liver function and systemic inflammation in subacute peritonitic rats. Here, we investigated the effects of single and combined parenteral arginine and L-NAME treatments on leukocyte and <b>splenocyte</b> immunity. Male Wistar rats were subjected to cecal punctures and were intravenously given total parenteral nutrition solutions with or without arginine and/or L-NAME supplementations for 7 days. Non-surgical and sham-operated rats with no cecal puncture were given a chow diet and parenteral nutrition, respectively. Parenteral feeding elevated the white blood cell numbers and subacute peritonitis augmented the parenteral nutrition-induced alterations in the loss of body weight gain, splenomegaly, and <b>splenocyte</b> decreases. Parenteral arginine significantly increased the B-leukocyte level, decreased the natural killer T (NKT) -leukocyte and <b>splenocyte</b> levels, alleviated the loss in body weight gain and total and cytotoxic T-splenocyte levels, and attenuated the increases in plasma nitrate/nitrite and interferon-gamma production by T-splenocytes. L-NAME infusion significantly decreased NKT-leukocyte level, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha production by T-splenocytes and macrophages, and interferon-gamma production by T-leukocytes, monocytes, and T-splenocytes, as well as increased interleukin- 6 production by T-leukocytes and monocytes and nitrate/nitrite production by T-leukocytes. Combined treatment significantly decreased plasma nitrate/nitrite, the NKT-leukocyte level, and TNF-alpha production by T-splenocytes. Parenteral arginine may attenuate immune impairment and L-NAME infusion may augment leukocyte proinflammatory response, eliminate <b>splenocyte</b> proinflammatory and T-helper 1 responses, and diminish arginine-induced immunomodulation in combined treatment in subacute peritonitic rats...|$|E

Relative to lean control (Ctl), obese Ctl rats had higher serum haptoglobin and impaired T-cell-stimulated cytokine responses. VA and EA diets improved T-cell-stimulated cytokine production; but, only VA normalized serum haptoglobin. However, EA- and VA-fed rats had enhanced LPS-stimulated cytokine responses. The changes elicited by VA were likely due changes in essential fatty acid composition in PL; whereas EA-induced changes may due to direct incorporation into membrane PL...|$|E
40|$|Francisella tularensis is {{a highly}} virulent {{intracellular}} bacterium and cell-mediated immunity is critical for protection, but mechanisms of protection against highly virulent variants, such as the prototypic strain F. tularensis strain SCHU S 4, are poorly understood. To this end, we established a co-culture system, based on <b>splenocytes</b> from na, or immunized mice and in vitro infected bone marrow-derived macrophages that allowed assessment of mechanisms controlling infection with F. tularensis. We utilized the system {{to understand why the}} clpB gene deletion mutant, 3 ̆ 94 clpB, of SCHU S 4 shows superior efficacy as a vaccine in the mouse model as compared to the existing human vaccine, the live vaccine strain (LVS). Compared to na <b>splenocytes,</b> 3 ̆ 94 clpB-, or LVS-immune <b>splenocytes</b> conferred very significant control of a SCHU S 4 infection and the 3 ̆ 94 clpB-immune <b>splenocytes</b> were superior to the LVS-immune <b>splenocytes.</b> Cultures with the 3 ̆ 94 clpB-immune <b>splenocytes</b> also contained higher levels of IFN- 3 ̆b 3, IL- 17, and GM-CSF and nitric oxide, and T cells expressing combinations of IFN- 3 ̆b 3, TNF- 3 ̆b 1, and IL- 17, than did cultures with LVS-immune <b>splenocytes.</b> There was strong inverse correlation between bacterial replication and levels of nitrite, an end product of nitric oxide, and essentially no control was observed when BMDM from iNOS 2 ̆ 212 / 2 ̆ 212 mice were infected. Collectively, the co-culture model identified a critical role of nitric oxide for protection against a highly virulent strain of F. tularensis. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|There is {{controversy}} in the literature over whether the selenium (Se) influences cellular immune responses, and the mechanisms possibly underlying these effects are unclear. In this study, the effects of Se on T-cell proliferation and IL- 2 production were studied in primary porcine <b>splenocytes.</b> <b>Splenocytes</b> were treated with different mitogens {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 - 4 µmol/L sodium selenite. Se significantly promoted T-cell receptor (TCR) or concanavalin A (ConA) -induced T-cell proliferation and IL- 2 production but failed to regulate T-cell response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). In addition, Se significantly increased the levels of cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (GPx 1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR 1) mRNA, the activity of GPx 1 and the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the unstimulated, or activated <b>splenocytes.</b> These results indicated that Se improved the redox status in all <b>splenocytes,</b> including unstimulated, TCR, ConA and PHA -stimulated, but only TCR and ConA-induced T-cell activation was affected by the redox status. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a pharmacological antioxidant, increased T-cell proliferation and IL- 2 production by TCR and ConA stimulated <b>splenocytes</b> but had no effect on the response to PHA in primary porcine <b>splenocytes</b> confirming that PHA-induced T-cell activation is insensitive to the redox status. We conclude that Se promotes GPx 1 and TR 1 expression and increases antioxidative capacity in porcine <b>splenocytes,</b> which enhances TCR or ConA -induced T-cell activation but not PHA-induced T-cell activation. The different susceptibilities to Se between the TCR, ConA and PHA -induced T-cell activation may help to explain the {{controversy in}} the literature over whether or not Se boosts immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the in vivo and in vitro effects and mechanisms of action of curcumin {{on the development of}} acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) using a murine model. Methodology/Principal Findings: Mixed lymphocyte reactions were used to determine the in vitro effects of curcumin. Treatment with curcumin attenuated alloreactive T cell proliferation and inhibited the production of interferon (IFN) -c and interleukin (IL) - 17. In a murine acute GVHD model, transplantation of curcumin-treated allogeneic <b>splenocytes</b> into irradiated recipient mice significantly reduced the clinical severity scores of acute GVHD manifested in the liver, skin, colon and lung as compared with animals receiving vehicle-treated <b>splenocytes.</b> c-Fos and c-Jun expression levels in the skin and intestine, which are major target organs, were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. Expression of both proteins was reduced in epithelial tissues of skin and intestine from curcumin-treated GVHD animals. The IFN-c-expressing CD 4 + <b>splenocytes</b> and IFN-c-expressing lymph node cells were dramatically decreased in curcumin-treated mice. In contrast, CD 4 +Foxp 3 + <b>splenocytes</b> were increased in the curcumin-treated acute GVHD animals. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that animals transplanted with curcumin-treated allogeneic <b>splenocytes</b> showed increased populations of CD 4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) as well as CD 8 + Treg cells, compared to animals administered vehicle-treated <b>splenocytes.</b> Curcumin-treated acute GVHD animals could have a change in B cell subpopulations...|$|R
