40|$|Optical and {{transport}} data on GaN samples grown by low-temperature pulsed laser deposition are presented. Large below-gap band tails are observed in optical absorption spectroscopy. The most intense photoluminescence lines of medium crystalline quality samples {{can be attributed}} to excitons bounded to stacking faults. The samples of the highest quality show, besides the ubiquitous yellow band, a large near band emission (NBE) peaking at 3. 47 eV. The large width of the NBE is attributed to the joint effects of the band tails and an elevated carrier concentration. <b>Secondary</b> <b>photocurrent</b> transients show a slow decay reaching the millisecond time region for a variety of excitation wavelengths and intensities, with a power law decay exponent of around - 0. 3. The long times are attributed to the trapping of excess carriers in extended band tail states. From the comparison of photocurrent decay with excess carrier-induced microwave reflection it is concluded that the decay dynamics at the air/film and film/substrate interfaces are identical.

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>photocurrents</b> {{offer an}} {{alternative}} mechanism to photomultiplier tubes and avalanche diodes for making high gain photodetectors {{that are able to}} operate even at extremely low light conditions. While in the past secondary currents were studied mainly in ordered crystalline semiconductors, disordered systems offer some key advantages such as a potentially lower leakage current and typically longer photocarrier lifetimes due to trapping. In this work, we use numerical simulations to identify the critical device and material parameters required to achieve high photocurrent and gain in steady state. We find that imbalanced mobilities and suppressed, non-Langevin-type charge carrier recombination will produce the highest gain. A low light intensity, strong electric field, and a large single carrier space charge limited current are also beneficial for reaching high gains. These results would be useful for practical photodetector fabrication when aiming to maximize the gain...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{dependence of}} the primary (reverse) and <b>secondary</b> (forward) <b>photocurrents,</b> Jr and Jf, in Schottky barrier diodes made from glow discharge deposited a-Si : H is studied in the energy range 0. 8 - 3. 1 eV using a two beam experimental set-up. Below 1. 5 eV significant differences are observed between the spectra of Jf and Jr and also between diodes made from n-type and p-type material. They are interpreted as arising from differences between the generation rates of mobile electrons and mobile holes caused by the asymmetry of the density of gap states...|$|R
40|$|Five {{environmental}} {{models were}} constructed {{to represent the}} solar wind and the upper, middle, and lower ionosphere of Venus. The spacecraft structure was modeled with over 140 passive electrical elements representing structural elements of the spacecraft. Electron, ion, <b>secondary</b> electron, and <b>photocurrents</b> to the spacecraft from the plasma were calculated, ignoring sheath effects. In all but one case, potentials of interest were less than 1 volt. Potential differences between widely separated points on the equipment shelf were less than 1 mV. The one area of concern is the solar panel potential when the orbiter is passing through the bowshock region...|$|R
