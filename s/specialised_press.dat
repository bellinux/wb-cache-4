50|$|The <b>specialised</b> <b>press</b> and {{the general}} public had already started {{claiming}} Brazil as the new world champions for days prior to the final match, and they had reasons to do so. Brazil had won their last two matches with a very attack-minded style of play against which all efforts had proved fruitless. Uruguay, however, had encountered difficulties in their matches with Spain and Sweden, managing only a draw against Spain and a narrow victory over Sweden. When those results were compared, it seemed that the Brazilians were set to defeat Uruguay as easily as they had dispensed with Spain and Sweden.|$|E

50|$|In 1982 Clay Paky {{presented}} the Astrodisco, which used a single lamp to project multiple rays of colored light across ceilings and dance floors. Five years later it launched Brilliant, a digitally controlled moving head and forerunner {{of a new}} generation of “intelligent” projectors. This was followed in 1988 by the programmable Golden Scan, a moving mirror projector and the first luminaire to implement stepper motor technology instead of servo motors. Acclaimed by the <b>specialised</b> <b>press</b> as “the world’s most popular and best-selling projector”, the Golden Scan became a commonly used lighting effect at nightclubs and rock concerts during the late 1980s and the 1990s. The London rock band Klaxons claimed the projector was the inspiration behind their light-themed, hit single Golden Skans.|$|E

50|$|Punching, {{and press}} work in general, {{is a process}} well suited to mass production. However the initial tooling costs, of both the machine and the job-specific press tool, are high. This limits punch work from being used for much small-volume and {{prototype}} work. A turret punch {{is one way of}} addressing this cost. The tooling of a turret punch uses a large number of standard punch tools: holes of varying sizes, straight edges, commonly-used notches or mounting holes. By using a large number of strokes, with several different tools in turn, a turret press may make a wide variety of parts without having to first make a <b>specialised</b> <b>press</b> tool for that task. This saves both time and money, allowing rapid prototyping or for low volume production to start without tooling delays.|$|E
50|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} mixed review from both generalist and <b>specialised</b> <b>press.</b> Du9,who considers that {{the series is}} a success from a formal point of view, especially thanks to the “charm of Vivès’s typical feminine characters, whose beauty is sometimes only shown by a few strokes of the pencil”, also thinks that it “would be less likely that the series trigger the massive adhesion of children and pre-teen readers”, the authors addressing “rather young adults or, more likely, geeks nostalgic of Japanese series and/or being receptive to “fan service””. Télérama finds “the story efficient and funny, clearly inspired by Dragon Ball of Akira Toriyama ”. The Huffington Post points out that “Vivès uses the classical codes of martial arts tournament manga only to crush them more efficiently with his bearish and ruthless Aldana”.|$|E
50|$|In May 1985, Liverpool {{were the}} {{defending}} European Champions' Cup winners, having won the competition after defeating Roma in the penalty shootout {{in the final}} of the previous season. Again they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, who had won, unbeaten, the 1983-84 Cup Winners' Cup. Juventus had a team comprising many of Italy's 1982 FIFA World Cup winning team-who played for Juventus for many years-and their playmaker Michel Platini was considered the best footballer in Europe, being named Footballer of The Year by France Football magazine {{for the second year in}} a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the UEFA club ranking at the end of the last season and were regarded by the <b>specialised</b> <b>press</b> as the best two sides in the continent at the time. Both teams had contested the 1984 European Super Cup four months before, finishing with victory for the Italian side by 2-0.|$|E

Such was his admiration for the Nonesuch Press’s 1924 translation of Plato’s Symposium, however, that he published an almost exact copy of it. Nonesuch immediately threatened legal action, calling Caton and the Fortune Press “thieves and pirates”.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine {{collaborative}} supply chain practices and their related ways of integrating an environmental dimension. Seven case studies were analysed relating to different stages of the supply chain (supply side, forward logistics, reverse logistics). We draw on “proximity economics”, a theoretical framework at the crossroads of spatial and industrial economics. Starting with a sample of (alleged) green collaborative initiatives taken from the <b>specialised</b> <b>press</b> in the SC field, and further studied through in-depth interviews, a typology of collaborative practices was developed and characterised in terms of forms of proximity. This typology enabled us to identify the preconditions for environmental collaborative practices in terms of the forms of proximity among the actors involved...|$|E

40|$|For years, {{historians have}} been {{interested}} in the value of photographs as historical sources. They undoubtedly constitute an important historical testimony, yet this does not prevent their use from spark- ing controversy related to the methodological approach that should be applied to them. Using photographs as historical sources requires careful critical analysis and a rigorous methodology, which is not yet as estab- lished as those that have been used with other sources for centuries. Correctly interpreting photographs in- volves their contextualisation and comparison with other sources. In this article, we study what the representation or projections of school camps in Menorca {{at the turn of the}} past century wished to transmit to the public, on the basis of the images taken of them that have been preserved, supplemented by other testimony such as the daily and <b>specialised</b> <b>press.</b> </div...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} metaphorical framing {{of the global}} financial/economic crisis in the British and the Italian <b>specialised</b> <b>press,</b> using corpus methodologies, and adopting a two-fold perspective on the data, which combines the theoretical frameworks of Conceptual Metaphor Theory and grammatical metaphor within Systemic Functional Linguistics. Two specialised, comparable corpora were built {{for the purposes of}} this study, collecting first page and leading articles from all the 2008 issues of The Financial Times (London edition) and Il Sole 24 Ore. Concordances for the two keywords 'crisis' and 'crisi' were retrieved in sentence format using the online Corpus Query System Sketchengine (www. sketchengine. co. uk), and subsequently analysed for conceptual and grammatical metaphors. Against this theoretical and methodological backdrop, the work explores similarities and differences between the corpora in terms of the classes of conceptual and grammatical metaphor employed in relation to the crisis, and their linguistic realisations. The socio-cultural implications of the use of both types of metaphor, and their connections with register-idiosyncratic features of the language of (financial) journalism, are also discussed. Finally, some advantages of integrating the two theoretical frameworks in the study of metaphor in discourse are highlighted on the basis of corpus evidence...|$|E
40|$|The {{official}} {{launch of}} the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) in 2010, by ministers responsible for higher education in 47 European countries, raised public expectations and prompted a series of questions, especially from the wider public and the <b>specialised</b> <b>press,</b> regarding the impacts and future relevance of the Bologna Process. This article starts with an overview of how the process is seen {{from a variety of}} disciplinary views. It then provides a critical reflection on the evolution of the Bologna Process, {{from the point of view}} of what is largely deemed by the EHEA policy and practice community as achievements and challenges. The final aim of the article is to provide a possible answer to the question of whether the {{launch of the}} European Higher Education Area and the political call for its consolidation are mainly about realising the existing Bologna Process objectives or whether the newly established EHEA is increasingly seen as a political forum for European policy cooperation in higher education, which would impose some minimum requirements on the members, but also increasingly include ‘non-traditional’ topics for the Bologna Process, such as governance, funding etc. The political discourse in the latest EHEA Bucharest Communiqué is finally analysed in order to support this main question...|$|E

5000|$|Leonhard Josef Hubert Drach {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Aachen. [...] He studied {{jurisprudence}} at Cologne and Bonn, qualifying in 1928 and taking a post as a Court Assessor in Aachen. Late in 1931 he moved on, becoming an assistant in the Prosecutor's Office at Trier, where in April 1933 he became a senior administrative assistant <b>specialising</b> in <b>press</b> and political crimes. [...] Context for this appointment is provided by the régime change of January 1933, following which the new government lost little time in creating a one party dictatorship in Germany. It was also during 1933 that Drach joined the Nazi Party, the National Socialist Association of Legal Professionals (NSRB / Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund) and the ruling party's paramilitary wing (SA), also becoming a sponsoring member of the SS. [...] In 1934, following the conventional career path implicit in his previous year's promotion, he was appointed a district prosecutor in Trier. Between 1937 and 1940 he was simultaneously also employed by the Gau (regional) Law Office.|$|R
