40|$|Gratings are micro {{geometries}} {{that make}} use of diffractive effects in order to change the light performances, propagations, directions among the others. In lighting applications such gratings {{can be used in}} order to redirect light in defined directions. Lightguides including patterns, with diffractive grating patterns, offer advantageous properties in terms of light guiding and light redirecting performance. While the general mode of operation of such structured lightguides have been proven for small devices, large area lightguides require new production methods in order to allow for a production at reasonable costs. Within this paper the function and the geometry of diffractive gratings on lightguides will be explained. Subsequently, the <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> hot embossing process will be introduced as a particularly suitable process for the production of diffractive gratings on large surfaces. The concept for the machine system, which enables for an optimised <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> hot embossing process, will be explained...|$|R
40|$|Presently {{there are}} several {{approaches}} to achieving a high throughput, production worthy X-ray lithography system. One approach utilizes a conventional X-ray source with fast X-ray resist materials to expose a large diameter wafer (typically 3 " to 4 " in one step). Another approach also utilizes a conventional X-ray source (or perhaps a plasma X-ray source) and fast X-ray resist materials to expose in a <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> fashion a large diameter wafer (e. g., < 5 "). A third approach utilizes a storage ring source of X-ray radiation in combination with conventional resist materials (i. e., AZ, PMMA, etc.) to expose large diameter wafers in a <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> fashion. In particular, single step exposure systems are limited to small diameter wafers due to registration errors which are ameliorated in <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> systems. Furthermore, the complex multilevel resist processing necessary to obtain high throughput {{in the first two}} approaches is unattractive to some manufactur-ers. However, it may be one economic way of obtaining relatively high throughput for some applications that require a small volume of devices with < 1 p. m features. For high volume manufacturers with well established production lines using conventional resist processing, a multiple port storage ring system offers economical and performance advantages relative to other exposure systems (i. e., electron beam) for VLSI manufacturing. The important parameters of each fo the above approaches will be described in this talk...|$|R

The exposed film is developed as a roll; this is sometimes cut to individual fiche after processing or kept in roll form for duplication.|$|R

Fabric is less likely to have hotspots in photography which means it tends to absorb a flash rather than reflecting it. Vinyl is heavier duty and sometimes has brighter, more vibrant images.

40|$|There exist an {{ever-increasing}} demand for complex, durable, energy efficient and low cost lighting solutions. Refractive gratings offer great {{opportunities for the}} design of optically functionalised surfaces. In order to manufacture the referring structures, grooves with a size in the range between 1 to 5 rnicron, having optical surface quality, need to be manufactured on large surfaces. Conventional ultra precision processes like flycutting are not suitable to machine these kind of structures. Therefore, by means of <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> hot embossing methods a suitable production process is developed. For the micro structuring by means of the <b>step</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> hot embossing method a tool is repeatedly positioned, heated, and pressed into a thermoplastic substrate. The heated thermoplastic material is deformed and even very precise geometrical structures are formed in the substrate surface. Limited deformation rates of the thermoplastic material result in a strong need for process optimisation and sophisticated mechanical solutions for the realisation of the stamping movement. Temperature, forces, and embossing speed need to be adapted to the tool geometry in order to achieve the highest degree of accuracies and manufacturing speed. The adaptive hot embossing process promises to be a powerful alternative process to existing ultra precision processes. The flexibility in terms of geometrical possibilities predestines this process for the production of diffractive gratings for light guiding systems on large surfaces. Combined with electroforming and injection moulding processes, the process is suitable to provide highly complex optical components for high volume production...|$|R
