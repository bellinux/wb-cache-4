The effect of <b>strain-hardened</b> zones and the intermetallic layer on thermal conductivity coefficient was investigated.

40|$|A {{study is}} made of the {{rotation}} field in wedge indentation of metals using copper as the model material system. Wedges with apical angles of 60 and 120 are used to indent annealed copper, and the deformation is mapped using image correlation.

The rotation field, derived from the deformation measurements, provides a clear way of distinguishing between cutting and compressive modes of deformation. Largely unidirectional rotation {{on one side of}} the symmetry line with small spatial rotation gradients is characteristic of compression. Bidirectional rotation with neighboring regions of opposing rotations and locally high rotation gradients characterizes cutting. In addition, the rotation demarcates such characteristic regions as the pile-up zone in indentation of a <b>strain-hardened</b> metal.

40|$|Three {{different}} polycrystalline materials, a fine-grained {{martensitic steel}} (CrMoV), a coarse-grained high-purity copper (C 110), and a two-phase microstructure titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), {{have been selected}} to investigate the heterogeneity of deformation following indentation using a depth-sensing indentation instrument fitted with a Berkovich indenter. The geometry of the pile-up profiles, measured with an atomic force microscope, were observed to be very sensitive to the indentation size {{with respect to the}} size of the microstructure and the material properties and crystallographic plane of the indented grain. In contrast, neither the recovery of the area of indentation nor the degree of piling-up were affected by the presence of indentation size effects (ISE). Furthermore, based on the results of a full- 3 D finite element simulation, it was concluded that the misalignment of the indenter alone does not explain the significantly asymmetric piling-up in highly anisotropic materials, e. g. C 110 copper, but that this is due to the crystallographic orientation of the single grain tested. In addition, the experimental results revealed that, although a thicker mechanically hardened layer formed during polishing is more prone to recovery during unloading, leading to a smaller residual indented area, the degree of piling-up is unaffected provided that the ratio of maximum depth (hmax) to the thickness of the <b>strain-hardened</b> layer is above unity. Moreover, on the same premise, the surface roughness and the thickness of the <b>strain-hardened</b> layer can be discarded as length parameters affecting hardness measurements...|$|E

The method consists of a statistical analysis of a number of data points from each grain scanned based on the grain orientation spread and their relative position from the shot-peened edge. The output is a quantitative measure of the depth of strain-hardening effects. The tool is used at various shot-peening intensities to demonstrate the ability to distinguish between these changes, using a range of intensities from 4 to 10 Almen. An increase in shot-peening intensity is observed to increase the depth of strain-hardening effects in the alloy. A comparison with residual stress measurements using X-ray diffraction for the same material shows that the <b>strain-hardened</b> depth determined by EBSD extends to approximately half the distance of the residual stress present due to shot peening. A comparison is also made with predicted profiles from the PeenstressSM model and subsequent microhardness testing.

Furthermore, the strain-hardening equation can be supplemented to account for the effect of boundary-migration-induced softening (BMIS).

40|$|Micron-sized {{metallic}} crystals {{are much}} stronger than their bulk counterparts. However, their deformation is jerky {{and they do not}} strain harden continuously, so that precise metal forming is difficult. This work demonstrates that coating or filling aluminum microcolumns with tungsten can eliminate these strain bursts and significantly increase the strain-hardening rate. A rule-of-mixtures analysis indicates that such improvements in the mechanical behavior of the composite micropillars are not due to the load-sharing effect of the incorporated tungsten phase. Transmission electron microscopy examination reveals that the coating or filling traps dislocations inside the crystals, thus raising the stored dislocation density by up to three orders of magnitude.

30|$|Figure 4 b shows {{a map of}} the E 2 (high) phonon {{frequency}} {{from the}} region of the indentation in Fig. 3 a. In the indentation regions, it is apparent that the enhanced compressive stress mainly concentrates in the facets. The stress at the center is partly released due to the heavily deformed and <b>strain-hardened</b> lattice structure, suffered from the highest pressure under the indenter tip. Therefore, the high defect structure leads to the Raman shift shown in green at the indentation center. Outside the indentation, the formation of cracks does not cause the local stress relaxation as expected and instead leads to the increase of stress. Furthermore, a comparison of CL and Raman mapping clearly illustrates that the size of the dark defect-expanded regions observed in CL images around indentation coincides well with the profile of red regions with high compressive stress. However, in the defect-expanded regions outside the imprint, the E 2 (high) mode remains still symmetric and slightly broadened, and no A 1 (LO) mode can be observed as shown in Fig. 4 c. It is thus deduced that the recrystallization process does not happen in the defect-expanded regions despite the high residual stress.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} carried out on the effects of process annealing on the mechanical properties of <b>strain-hardened</b> copper from Kabel Metal Nigeria Limited. The cold-rolled copper samples, at different degrees of deformation, were annealed and their mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength, impact, hardness, percentage reduction in area, and percentage elongation were observed after cold working and annealing. The results obtained showed that the hardness of copper during cold rolling increases with the degree of deformation due to strain hardening. The maximum value of hardness obtained from cold-rolled copper was 117 HB at 40 % reduction in area, while the average hardness values obtained after annealing temperatures of 300 ºC, 400 ºC and 500 ºC were 79. 2, 67. 2 and 45. 7 HB, respectively. During tensile test, the material fractured with very little elongation at 35 % reduction in area. The maximum ultimate tensile stress obtained was 188. 4 N/mm 2 at 20 % reduction in area. Anneal strengthening effect was observed in the copper. The amount of strengthening effect increases with increasing degree of prior cold work. For the optimum combination of desired mechanical properties, copper wire should not be strain hardened beyond 20 % reduction in cross-sectional area without been critically annealed before any further deformation.

40|$|The {{thick-walled}} cylinder (TWC) {{technique was}} successfully used {{to investigate the}} shear-band patterning in AISI 304 stainless steel. Several factors that may influence the shear-band distribution and spacing in the TWC configuration were examined. The role of machining, annealing, and shrink fitting, {{as well as the}} variation of the shear-band distribution along the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical specimen were evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the machined surface at the internal boundary of the cylindrical specimen, where shear bands initiate, provides a <b>strain-hardened</b> layer that significantly changes the condition for their initiation. Specimens with such a layer have a higher density of bands with a smaller spacing, in comparison with those without a work-hardened layer. The nature of contact interface in the cylindrical specimen assembly, either causing a clearance that changes the initial loading conditions or introducing a pre-strained layer with shrink-fitting technique, does not influence the spacing of shear bands, but does affect the evolution and development of multiple shear bands at the initial stage. The distribution of shear bands along the cylinder has a constant spacing but the maximum lengths of bands are sensitive to the position. The collapse process of the cylindrical specimen was simulated by using the RAVEN hydrocode. The deformation, temperature, and velocity histories during the cylinder collapse were calculated. The calculated results are in good agreement with the previous experimental data...|$|E
40|$|For a {{cold-rolled}} NiTi sheet, the tensile stress-strain curves show a flat stress-plateau during tension {{along the}} rolling direction, while under tension along the transverse direction the specimens are quickly <b>strain-hardened</b> and no flat stress-plateau occurred. This {{shows that the}} deformation mechanisms of martensite twins are different when loading along different directions. TEM observations show that, in the as-annealed condition, the major type of twins in the martensite phase is [011] type II twins in the present material. Also present are (001) compound twins and {{a small amount of}} (11 (1) over bar) type I twins. Deformation details of these three types of twins are different along rolling and transverse directions. After deformation along the rolling direction to 6 % strain, reorientation and de-twinning of the [011] type II twins have occurred, while after deformation along the transverse direction to 6 % strain, no significant reorientation and de-twinning of [011] type II twins have been observed. Instead, a high density of dislocations has been generated inside the [011] type II twins and de-twinning of the (001) compound twins has been observed. A further crystallographic analysis shows that the shear direction of each type of martensite twins relative to the loading direction is different, which may explain the different deformation behaviour of the twins. This may also account for the macroscopical deformation behaviour of the material. (C) 1999 Acta Metallurgica Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|For ductile {{fractures}} {{it becomes}} progressively imperative {{to include the}} plastic components of the quantities defining each particular fracture criterion, in order to derive a relationship, which not only fits the experimental data but also satisfies some appropriate physical principle. In this paper the plastic components of stresses entering in the experessions for the specific plastic work were derived from the plastic singular solution described by the HRR stress field. In order to ascertain the accuracy of such approximate solutions for criteria based on energy balance, a comparison between the components of elastic strain energy density, and its total value, with the specific plastic work (Wp) was undertaken, in order to derive certain conclusions {{about the importance of}} the contribution of energy component and the specific plastic work. The analysis was based on the typical case of a transverse internal crack in plate under plane-stress conditions, which is submitted to a mode I deformation. While the dilatational (Tv) and the distortional (TD) components of elastic SED were calculated for impending plasticity the specific plastic work (Wp) was evaluated by assuming ssy conditions and the theory of HRR field using the plastic singular solution for mode I. It was shown that the contributions of Tv, TD, Te (Te = tv + TD) and WP for different strain hardening exponents were varying with ductile materials, presenting a strong influence of Wp. The conclusion was that for highly <b>strain-hardened</b> materials the contribution of the elastic SED and particularly of Tv is important to the mode of fracture of the plate. © 1988...|$|E
