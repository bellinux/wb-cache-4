5000|$|Surgical scissors, {{also known}} as [...] "forceps" [...] in some {{countries}} outside of the United States, are surgical instruments usually used for cutting. They include bandage scissors, dissecting scissors, iris scissors, operating scissors, stitch scissors, tenotomy scissors, Metzenbaum scissors, plastic surgery scissors, and Mayo scissors. Surgical scissors are usually made of very hard stainless steel for ongoing toughness. Some scissors have tungsten carbide reinforcements along their cutting edges. The hardness of this material allows the manufacturers to create sharper edges, which allows for easier and <b>smoother</b> <b>cuts</b> and keeps the scissors sharp for longer.|$|R

50|$|The ashlar roof {{base was}} made up of a cornice with {{supporting}} corbels, the design of which were of alternating dog heads and lion heads, reflecting a hunting theme. Photographs from 1942, show that three dogs' heads were still in place at that time. This decoration has subsequently been reconstructed on the northeast and northwest facades. With the exception of heads, the facades appear very simple, which was uncommon at the time. However, their layout is well organized and more complex than it first appears. For example, there was a gradation of materials used; rustic stone for nymphée, <b>smooth</b> <b>cut</b> stones for the roof base, plaster cornices and protruding, stepped cornices floors.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{reaction of}} brain and peripheral nerve tissue and of cerebral blood vessels {{to the application}} of two types of laser-beams is described. Lasers as cutting instruments produce <b>smoother</b> <b>cut</b> surfaces and provoke less bleeding than conventional techniques. There is almost no focal oedema. Their effects are limited to clearly determinable zones. Scar formation after laser cutting is minimised. With defocused laser-beams a photo-coagulation of tumours, for example, highly vascularised tumours or pituitary adenomas, is possible. Small arteries may be cut without bleeding.

50|$|Morphological Features of HSGross appearance. Lesions of HS are {{typically}} destructive mass lesions with a uniform, <b>smooth</b> <b>cut</b> surface and are white/cream to tan in color. Lesions have a soft consistency and may contain discolored areas (typically yellow) which indicate area of necrosis, {{which can be}} extensive. Lesions can be solitary or multiple within an organ (especially spleen). Periarticular HS has a distinctive appearance: it occurs as multiple tan nodules located in the subsynovium. These lesions may encircle the affected joint. Hemophagocytic HS does not initially form mass lesions in the primary sites (spleen and bone marrow). Typically, diffuse splenomegaly is observed; the cut surface is dark red and the consistency is firm. The liver is usually bile stained (jaundice) and disruption of the lobular pattern due to metastasis is observed - marked liver involvement can occur before destructive masses are noticeable.|$|E
50|$|Parson's worries {{soon came}} true, and Lockheed's protests {{that they could}} fix the problem {{eventually}} rang hollow. In 1949 the Air Force arranged funding for Parsons to build his machines on his own. Early work with Snyder Machine & Tool Corp proved the system of directly driving the controls from motors failed to give the accuracy needed to set the machine for a perfectly <b>smooth</b> <b>cut.</b> Since the mechanical controls did not respond in a linear fashion, you couldn't simply drive it with a given amount of power, because the differing forces meant {{the same amount of}} power would not always produce the same amount of motion in the controls. No matter how many points you included, the outline would still be rough. Parsons was confronted by the same problem that had prevented convergence of Jacquard-type controls with machining.|$|E
5000|$|The MIT {{team was}} led by William Pease {{assisted}} by James McDonough. They quickly concluded that Parsons's design could be greatly improved; if the machine did not simply cut at points A and B, but instead moved smoothly between the points, then not only would it make a perfectly <b>smooth</b> <b>cut,</b> but could do so with many fewer points - the mill could cut lines directly {{instead of having to}} define a large number of cutting points to [...] "simulate" [...] a line. A three-way agreement was arranged between Parsons, MIT, and the Air Force, and the project officially ran from July 1949 to June 1950. The contract called for the construction of two [...] "Card-a-matic Milling Machines", a prototype and a production system. Both to be handed to Parsons for attachment to one of their mills in order to develop a deliverable system for cutting stringers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a new method for remote surgical cutting by providing haptic guidance along a trajectory that is measured in-situ through a miniature, tool-tip mounted endoscopic camera. By directly augmenting the instrument with a camera, instead {{of relying on}} an additional conventional endoscope, the approach becomes independent from inherent calibration uncertainties of the telemanipulation system, other than the micro camera itself, and from registration of pre- and intra-operative surgical data. We calculate a <b>smooth</b> <b>cut</b> path with corresponding scalpel orientation to guide the user towards the optimal trajectory. Experiments are conducted with passive and active haptic virtual fixtures. During active fixturing the optimal forward velocity is calculated to follow the path. The results indicate an improvement in terms of position accuracy, blade orientation, and forward velocity.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the cutting characteristics of seven different microkeratomes and {{to compare the}} cut edges and surface characteristics of the corneas with respect to different keratome parameters, ie, blade oscillation frequencies and keratome speed. METHODS: Lamellar keratectomies were performed using each microkeratome on eight freshly enucleated porcine corneas. The freshly cut corneal bed was then examined using scanning electron microscopy. A scoring system {{was used to evaluate}} the serration of the cut edge and the regularity of the corneal wound bed. RESULTS: Serrated cut edges were produced by the Microtech microkeratome, the Automatic Corneal Shaper, the Draeger rotor keratome, and the Schwind microkeratome. The other tested cutting devices generally yielded a <b>smooth</b> <b>cut</b> edge. Smooth and regular wound surfaces were obtained with the Schwind microkeratome, the Automatic Corneal Shaper, the Microtech microkeratome, and the MKM set.

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} piezoelectric surgery (Piezosurgery; Mectron Medical Technology; Carasco, Genoa, Italy) {{as a means of}} avoiding some complications of osteotomy and osteoplasty in otologic surgery, particularly in classic canalwall- up mastoidectomy. Piezoelectric surgery is a recently developed system for cutting bone with microvibrations created by the piezoelectric effect. This effect occurs when an electric current is passed through certain ceramics and crystals, causing them to oscillate at ultrasonic frequencies. OUT study population was made up of 20 adults with unilateral chronic otitis media. In all patients, piezoelectric surgery allowed for effective, precise, safe, easy, and rapid intraoperative management. Inparticular, the instrument's precision allowed surgeonsto make exact, clean, and <b>smooth</b> <b>cuts</b> without causing any injury to adjacent soft tissue. No complications were noted. We conclude that the piezoelectric device is superior to conventionally rotating instruments for performing classic canal-wall-up mastoidectomy...|$|R

25|$|Bits {{also differ}} by the {{diameter}} of their shank, with ½ inch, 12mm, 10mm, ⅜inch, 8mm and ¼ inch and 6mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving <b>smoother</b> <b>cuts)</b> and {{are less likely to}} break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the USA ½-in and ¼-in, in Great Britain ½-in, 8mm and ¼-in, and metric sizes in Europe—although in the United States the ⅜-in and 8mm sizes are often only available for extra cost).|$|R
