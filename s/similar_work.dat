5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened {{by the success of}} his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for <b>similar</b> <b>work.</b> From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further exploration of the country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. <b>Similar</b> <b>work</b> had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may have been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E

5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a <b>similar</b> <b>work,</b> a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, {{as suggested by the}} realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1929 there were {{suggestions}} that the castle {{should be taken}} under French control. On 16November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into {{the control of the}} French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1million between them in compensation. Over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken <b>similar</b> <b>work</b> at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal’at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{grinding}} {{machinery and}} specialist {{knowledge in the}} heat treatment of metals and other areas the company had developed was so high {{during the years of}} World War I that the government ordered other British manufacturers to produce Churchill designs. One specialist area was heat-treated blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid for <b>similar</b> <b>work</b> at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E

5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his <b>similar</b> <b>work</b> ethic. He gives a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, he gives MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center for volunteers was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force's headquarters on Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for <b>similar</b> <b>work.</b> By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E
5|$|The Augustan History (Latin: Historia Augusta) is a late Roman {{collection}} of biographies, written in Latin, of the Roman Emperors, their junior colleagues, designated heirs and usurpers {{of the period}} 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the <b>similar</b> <b>work</b> of Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the Scriptores Historiae Augustae), written during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in Rome. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain {{the life of a}} single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.|$|E

ACTC also offers a Ready to Work, and a <b>similar</b> <b>Work</b> to Learn program that assists low-income students and parents in northeastern Kentucky.
