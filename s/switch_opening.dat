40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new hybrid diverter design for on-load tap changers. The design uses ‘active-shunt ’ current diversion principles. At its core, the design employs a low-voltage high-current switch-mode amplifier to divert current {{out of the}} mechanical contacts and {{into a pair of}} anti-parallel thyristors. Commutation between transformer taps may then be performed by the thyristors. The amplifier and thyristors are placed outside the normal load current path and only conduct during a tap change, producing efficiency savings and improving robustness when compared to previous hybrid OLTC implementations. An amplifier control loop that autonomously produces zero-current conditions at <b>switch</b> <b>opening</b> and zero-voltage conditions at switch closure is demonstrated Experimental results investigating the wear characteristics of contacts operated under the new hybrid diverter are presented, along with comparison results from a passive-type switching scheme.

40|$|Abstract Spatially {{resolved}} measurements in a planar microsecond POS, using spectroscopy of dopants in {{the plasma}} together with charge-exchange spectroscopy, are presented. Measurements of the axial ion velocities {{together with the}} B-field and the plasma density evolution show pushing of the protons ahead of the magnetic field together with field penetration into the carbon plasma. A plasma density drop, {{which leads to the}} <b>switch</b> <b>opening,</b> was observed during the field penetration into the carbon plasma. The pushing of protons causes plasma flow into the vacuum region between the POS and the load and influences the energy coupling to the load. These results demonstrate the great importance of the effects associated with a multicomponet plasma and makes the plasma composition an important parameters influencing the POS operation. Measurements with a reversed polarity of the POS do not show any significant difference in the magnetic field and the electron density evolution, as predicted by the electron magnetohydrodynamic theory, implying the field penetration is not dominated by Hall penetration. Alternatively, the observed penetration could also be associated with an anomalous collisionality, which would also explain the observed broad current channel. However, so far, no mechanism predicting such a high collisionality has been demonstrated...|$|E

Purple membranes (PM) of the mutant Asp 96 Asn at 15, 57, 75 and 100 % relative humidity (r. h.) were studied {{in a parallel}} X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic investigation. Light-dependent conformational changes of BR-Asp 96 Asn are observed at high hydration levels (100 and 75 % r. h.) but not in partially dehydrated samples (57 and 15 % r. h.). The FTIR spectra of continuously illuminated samples at low and high hydration, despite some differences, are characteristic of the M intermediate. The changes in diffraction patterns of samples in the M 2 state are of the same magnitude as those of wild-type samples trapped with GuaHCl in the M(G) state.

40|$|Inductive {{energy storage}} systems can have high energy density, lending to smaller, less {{expensive}} systems. The crucial element of an inductive {{energy storage system}} is the <b>opening</b> <b>switch.</b> This switch must conduct current while energy is stored in an inductor, then open quickly to transfer this energy to a load. Plasma can perform this function. The Plasma Opening Switch (POS) has been studied {{for more than two}} decades. Success with the conventional plasma <b>opening</b> <b>switch</b> has been limited. A system designed to significantly improve the performance of vacuum <b>opening</b> <b>switches</b> is described in this paper. The gap cleared of plasma is a rough figure-of-merit for vacuum <b>opening</b> <b>switches.</b> Typical opened gaps of 3 mm are reported for conventional switches. The goal for the system described in this paper is more than 3 cm. To achieve this, the command-triggered POS adds an active opening mechanism, which allows complete separation of conduction and opening. This separation is advantageous because of the widely different time scales of conduction and opening. The detrimental process of magnetic field penetration into the plasma during conduction is less important in this <b>switch.</b> The <b>opening</b> mechanism duration is much shorter than the conduction time, so penetration during opening is insignificant. Opening is accomplished with a fast magnetic field that pushes plasma out of the switch region. Plasma must be removed from the switch region to allow high voltage. This paper describes some processes important during conduction and opening, and show calculations on the trigger requirements. The design of the switch is shown. This system is designed to demonstrate both improved performance and nanosecond output jitter at levels greater than one terawatt. An amplification mechanism is described which reduces the trigger energy. Particle-in-cell simulations of the system are also shown...|$|R

The performance of the silver cadmium oxide contacts (Ag. CdO, 85 / 15 %) is evaluated over a range of currents from 1 to 10 amps, for make and break operations. The arc at break {{is found to be}} the predominant factor contributing to the erosion of the contacts for the range of currents used. Tests using a high speed camera show that the energy dissipated in the arc between the contacts can be evaluated from equations describing the arc in terms of its voltage, current and length as functions of time. Subsequently work is carried out to develop the relation between arc energy and contact erosion, with specific regard to the distribution of energy between the two contact surfaces and the arc column. This is related to the power dissipation in the two electrode fall regions, and the resulting direction of net material transfer is thought to be influenced by the length achieved by the arc before extinction. Erosion is generally in the form of anodic loss and cathodic gain and the reasons for the directional bias in this type of switch are suggested. Ways of reducing the amount of erosion per operation by changing the <b>switch</b> <b>opening</b> characteristic are discussed and supported with experimental results. PETER J...|$|E

Transition to the intermediate state is characterized by small movements in the first transmembrane helix (TM 1). Subsequent transitions to the open state are accompanied by massive rearrangements in both TM 1 and TM 2, as shown by large increases in probe dynamics, solvent accessibility and the elimination of all intersubunit spin-spin interactions.
