This challenge may be met by two approaches: (1) development of new materials for wear-prone elements, and (2) design innovation of new electromechanical devices that do not include mechanical wear-prone components. Present state-of-the-art materials require restricted operation regarding load, speed, and power for gears, bearings, and brush-slipring components. These restrictions are discussed, and methods of improvement are suggested.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} for {{reducing}} unspring mass as well as improving safety and ride properties of vehicles driven by in-wheel motors will be provided. To begin with, the advantages of vehicles armed with in-wheel motors will be described, after which some drawbacks of this idea will be studied. Then, to getting a better analysis, quarter car model will be studied in frequency domain. Gain of body acceleration and wheel dynamic load, which can be equal to ride property and safety performance respectively, will be compared. Finally, an idea that makes the drive <b>motor</b> <b>suspend</b> will be proposed for enhancing the two properties and then a LQG controller will be provided for further optimization. Through the comparison in time domain and frequency domain, one can {{come to a conclusion}} that vehicles driven by <b>suspended</b> <b>motors</b> not only simplified the structures but also can be used as an absorber for vibration reduction...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{disturbances}} of the machine tool frame is caused by operation of motion axis. Movement of high dynamic motion axis is connected with powerful force strokes that excite machine tool frame vibration and deteriorate machining surface quality and productivity. There are several possibilities how to suppress this vibration. One possibility is to use <b>suspended</b> <b>motor,</b> where the motor is connected with the machine body by spring and damper. This paper deals with new more advanced conception where the main motor is connected with the frame by an active element, that is controlled by intelligent control technique. The active element represents another linear motor, therefore the conception is shortly called “motor on motor”...|$|E

40|$|To {{answer the}} growing needs for super-clean or contact free {{actuators}} for uses in clean rooms, vacuum chambers, and space, innovative actuators which combine {{the functions of}} stepping motors and magnetic bearings in one body were developed. The rotor of the magnetically <b>suspended</b> stepping <b>motor</b> is <b>suspended</b> like a magnetic bearing and rotated and positioned like a stepping motor.

Owing to optimal design and feed-back control, a toothed stator and rotor are all that are needed structurewise for stable suspension. More than ten types of motors such as linear type, high accuracy rotary type, two-dimensional type, and high vacuum type were built and tested. This paper describes the structure and design of these motors and their performance for such applications as precise positioning rotary table, linear conveyor system, and theta-zeta positioner for clean room and high vacuum use...|$|R
40|$|Compared {{with current}} mode {{flywheel}} torque controller, speed mode torque controller has superior disturbance rejection capability. However, the speed loop delay reduces system dynamic response speed. To solve this problem, a two-degrees-of-freedom controller (2 DOFC) {{which consists of}} a feedback controller (FBC) and a command feedforward controller (FFC) is proposed. The transfer function of FFC is found based on the inverse model of motor drive system, whose parameters are identified by recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm in real-time. Upon this, Kalman filter with softening factor is introduced for the improved parameters identification and torque control performances.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two weeks of hind-limb {{suspension}} (HS) on the functional properties of slow-twitch and fast-twitch single fibers isolated from the predominantly slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch gastrocnemius of the suspended leg of rats were investigated. Single fibers were <b>suspended</b> between a <b>motor</b> arm and force transducer, and, after their functional properties were studied, the fiber type was established by the myosin heavy chain analysis. It was found that, after HS, the greatest decrease in diameter {{and a reduction in}} peak tension occurred in slow-twitch fibers from soleus, followed by slow-twitch fibers from gastrocnemius. Fast-twitch fibers from the red gastrocnemius showed a significant reduction in diameter but no change in peak tension. No effect of HS was observed on the diameter of the fast-twitch fibers from the white gastsrocnemius (which is known to contain 87 percent fast glycolytic fibers) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} hindlimb unweighting (HU) for 1 to 3 wks on the {{shortening}} velocity of a soleus fiber, its ATPase content, {{and the relative}} contents of the slow and fast myosin was investigated by measuring fiber force, V(0), ATPase activity, and myosin content in SDS protein profiles of a single rat soleus fiber <b>suspended</b> between a <b>motor</b> arm and a transducer. It was found that HU induces a progressive increase in fiber V(0) that is likely caused, at least in part, {{by an increase in}} the fiber's myofibrillar ATPase activity. The HU-induced increases in V(0) and ATPase were associated with the presence of a greater percentage of fast type IIa fibers. However, a large population of fibers after 1, 2, and 3 wks of HU showed increases in V(0) and ATPase but displayed the same myosin protein profile on SDS gels as control fibers...|$|R
2500|$|The puppeteer, often dubbed as the [...] "Muppet performer", {{holds the}} Muppet {{above his head}} or {{in front of his}} body, with one hand {{operating}} the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or by [...] "wearing" [...] the hands like gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed as the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of operation. In advanced Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate Muppets for film and television, including the use of <b>suspended</b> rigs, internal <b>motors,</b> remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to be riding a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing on-stage with no puppeteer in sight.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{hydraulic}} force on magnetically levitated (maglev) pumps should be studied carefully to improve the suspension performance and {{the reliability of the}} pumps. A maglev centrifugal pump, developed at Ibaraki University, was modeled with 926 376 hexahedral elements for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. The pump has a fully open six-vane impeller with a diameter of 72. 5 mm. A self-bearing <b>motor</b> <b>suspends</b> the impeller in the radial direction. The maximum pressure head and flow rate were 250 mmHg and 14 l/min, respectively. First, a steady-state analysis was performed using commercial code STAR-CD to confirm the model’s suitability by comparing the results with the real pump performance. Second, transient analysis was performed to estimate the hydraulic force on the levitated impeller. The impeller was rotated in steps of 1 ° using a sliding mesh. The force around the impeller was integrated at every step. The transient analysis revealed that the direction of the radial force changed dynamically as the vane’s position changed relative to the outlet port during one circulation, and the magnitude of this force was about 1 N. The current maglev pump has sufficient performance to counteract this hydraulic force. Transient CFD analysis is not only useful for observing dynamic flow conditions in a centrifugal pump but is also effective for obtaining information about the levitation dynamics of a maglev pump. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a magnetically <b>suspended</b> linear pulse <b>motor</b> for a semiconductor wafer transfer robot {{in a vacuum}} chamber. The motor can drive a wafer transfer arm horizontally without mechanical contact. In {{the construction of the}} magnetic suspension system, four pairs of linear magnetic bearings for the lift control are used for the guidance control as well. This approach allows us to make the whole motor compact in size and light in weight. The tested motor consists of a double-sided stator and a transfer arm with a width of 50 mm and a total length of 700 mm. The arm, like a ladder in shape, is designed as the floating element with a tooth width of 4 mm (a tooth pitch of 8 mm). The mover mass is limited to about 1. 6 kg by adopting such an arm structure, and the ratio of thrust to mover mass reaches to 3. 2 N/kg under a broad air gap (1 mm) between the stator teeth and the mover teeth. The performance testing was carried out with a transfer distance less than 450 mm and a transfer speed less than 560 mm/s. The attitude of the arm was well controlled by the linear magnetic bearings with a combined use, and consequently the repeatability on the positioning of the arm reached to about 2 micron. In addition, the positioning accuracy was improved up to about 30 micron through a compensation of the 128 -step wave current which was used for the micro-step drive with a step increment of 62. 5 micron...|$|R
40|$|A {{control system}} has been {{designed}} to keep a balloon-borne scientific instrument pointed toward a celestial object within an angular error of the order of an arc second. The design is intended to be adaptable to a large range of instrument payloads. The initial payload to which the design nominally applies {{is considered to be a}} telescope, modeled as a simple thin-walled cylinder 24 ft (approx. = 7. 3 m) long, 3 ft (approx. = 0. 91 m) in diameter, weighing 1, 500 lb (having a mass of. 680 kg). The instrument would be mounted on a set of motor-driven gimbals in pitch-yaw configuration. The motors on the gimbals would apply the control torques needed for fine adjustments of the instrument in pitch and yaw. The pitch-yaw mount would, in turn, be <b>suspended</b> from a <b>motor</b> mount at the lower end of a pair of cables hanging down from the balloon (see figure). The motor in this mount would be used to effect coarse azimuth control of the pitch-yaw mount. A notable innovation incorporated in the design is a provision for keeping the gimbal bearings in constant motion. This innovation would eliminate the deleterious effects of static friction. something that must be done in order to achieve the desired arc-second precision. Another notable innovation is the use of linear accelerometers to provide feedback that would facilitate the early detection and counteraction of disturbance torques before they could integrate into significant angular-velocity and angular-position errors. The control software processing the sensor data would be capable of distinguishing between translational and rotational accelerations. The output of the accelerometers is combined with that of angular position and angular-velocity sensors into a proportional + integral + derivative + acceleration control law for the pitch and yaw torque motors. Preliminary calculations have shown that with appropriate gains, the power demand of the control system would be low enough to be satisfiable by means of storage batteries charged by solar batteries during the day...|$|R
