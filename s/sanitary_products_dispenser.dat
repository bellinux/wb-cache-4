40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a randomized evaluation that distributed menstrual cups (menstrual <b>sanitary</b> <b>products)</b> to adolescent girls in rural Nepal. Girls {{in the study were}} randomly allocated a menstrual cup for use during their monthly period and were followed for fifteen months to measure the effects of having modern <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> on schooling. While girls were 3 percentage points less likely to attend school on days of their period, we find no significant effect of being allocated a menstrual cup on school attendance. There were also no effects on test scores, self-reported measures of self-esteem or gynecological health. These results suggest that policy claims that barriers to girls' schooling and activities during menstrual periods are due to lack of modern sanitary protection may not be warranted. On the other hand, <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> are quickly and widely adopted by girls and are convenient in other ways, unrelated to short-term schooling gains. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{remains one}} of the most {{questionable}} points related to the accuracy of PBLAC that there is no standard <b>sanitary</b> <b>product</b> for assessment of the score; products there were used to test and validate the score were not exactly those that are used nowadays. Accordingly, it has been a serious concern that modern superabsorbent polymer-containing <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> in comparison with old products, that were available when PBLAC was created, can confound current interpretation of the chart. Nevertheless, when women were encouraged to use the brands they commonly used, PBLAC was still significantly correlated to their perception of MBL with low intraindividual variation. Accordingly, standardization of <b>sanitary</b> <b>product</b> was not found to grossly impact the applicability of PBLAC [28]. In this review, it does not seem that the type of <b>sanitary</b> <b>product</b> contributes to the heterogeneity of results. SROC showed that studies that used the same products did not necessarily reveal comparable results and vice versa. However, Magnay et al. presented a new version of the traditional menstrual pictogram (the superabsorbent polymer-c or SAP-c version) which was designed to measure MBL on these widely used products (Always Ultra slim feminine towels “Proctor & Gamble”). A validation study of this version yielded promising results when MBL was tested against alkaline hematin method and total menstrual fluid loss (MFL) against fluid weight [29, 30]. Although initial results seem promising, implementation of this version among larger cohorts could help to recognize its feasibility, accuracy, and pitfalls and identify whether this version could be superior to the traditional PBLAC.|$|R

50|$|Menstrual cups can {{be useful}} {{as a means of}} menstrual hygiene {{management}} for women in developing countries, such as Kenya, Uganda and India, where access to affordable <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> may be limited. Menstruation can be a barrier to education for many girls, as a lack of effective <b>sanitary</b> <b>products</b> restricts girls' involvement in educational and social activities. Often they do not attend school due to fear of leaking, shame or embarrassment, period pain or inadequate sanitation facilities that do not allow them to wash or change in privacy. This applies mainly to schoolgirls from low-income families, since disposable hygiene products are a monthly expense that many females simply cannot afford. A lack of affordable hygiene products means inadequate, unhygienic alternatives are used, which can present a serious health risk. Menstrual cups offer a longer-term solution than other feminine hygiene products, because they {{do not need to be}} replaced monthly. The quality of the material also makes them a reliable and healthy menstrual hygiene solution, as long as there is access to clean water for washing them.|$|R
