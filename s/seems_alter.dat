The spark on making contact, for the reasons before given, was very small (1101. 1107.); that on {{breaking}} contact, very excellent and brilliant.

There were the usual {{entanglement}} and noise of carts, drays, omnibuses, waggons, and foot passengers, but the misfortune that had fallen on the wooden Midshipman made it strange and new. Houses and shops were {{different from what they}} used to be, and bore Mr Brogley's warrant on their fronts in large characters. The broker seemed to have got hold of the very churches; for their spires rose into the sky with an unwonted air. Even the sky itself was changed, and had an execution in it plainly.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed almost}} as though some magical {{metamorphosis}} had taken place {{within the walls of}} Ravenor Castle. Directly we came in sight of it we had the first intimation of its altered aspect. Instead of the one or two solitary lights shining above the dark woods, it seemed a very blaze of illumination, and when we drew up at the great front door the change was still mere apparent. Liveried servants with powdered hair were moving about the hall. From open doors there came the sound of laughing voices, and even Mr. Ravenor's manner, as he came out to meet us, <b>seemed</b> <b>altered.</b>|$|R

Through all the years they had been together, the elder sister had never seen before the {{expression}} which the younger's face now wore. A vague expectancy sat in her eyes, some nameless content sweetened her smile, a beautiful repose replaced the varying enthusiasm, listlessness, and melancholy that used to haunt her countenance and make it such a study. Miss Yule could not read the secret of the change, yet felt its novel charm; Sylvia could not explain it, though penetrated by its power; and for a moment the sisters looked into each other's faces, wondering why each <b>seemed</b> <b>altered.</b> Then Prue, who never wasted much time in speculations of any kind, shook her head, and repeated-- ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{support the}} rapid growth of tumors, the cell can respond by {{increasing}} the number of mitochondria, in a concerted biosynthesis of mitochondrial constituents (nuclear and mitochondria encoded). Increased transcription, availability and stability of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs, without increasing mitochondria number could also lead to more rapid energy-yielding effects. Mitochondria biogenesis and de novo formation of respiratory chain components imply coordination of nuclear and mt gene transcription. The mitochondrial mass is regulated by a number of physiopathological conditions. In response to external stimuli, mitochondria biogenesis is dependent on an orchestrated crosstalk between the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes. Based on the higher incidence of glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation in cancer tissues, we studied by differential proteomics the energy metabolism pathway of matched samples of normal and cancer tissue. Our results indicated that oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells <b>seemed</b> <b>altered</b> because there is an unbalanced coordination between nuclear- and mitochondria-encoded mitochondrial proteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which accounts for the cAMP-modulated chloride conductance of airway epithelial cells. CFTR also regulates other membrane proteins like the negative regulation of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to hyperabsorption of sodium chloride {{and a reduction in}} the periciliary salt and water content which leads to impaired mucociliary clearance. It seems that a lack of functional CFTR leads to abnormal function of the NF-ÎºB pathway in submucosal gland cells, causing an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the chemokine IL- 8, and a pro-inflammatory environment. CFTR is also expressed in neutrophils and several neutrophil functions like cytokine production, migration, phagocytosis and apoptosis <b>seem</b> <b>altered</b> in CF. In this review we describe the role of airway epithelium and blood neutrophils in the viscious circle of inflammation and infection seen in CF...|$|R
60|$|Francis {{stepped through}} the French windows into the smoking-room, where all the {{paraphernalia}} for satisfying thirst were set out upon the sideboard. He helped himself to whisky and soda and drank it absently, with his eyes fixed upon the clock. In five minutes he stepped once more back into the gardens, soft and brilliant now in the moonlight. As he did so, he heard the click of the gate in the wall, and footsteps. His host, with Lady Cynthia upon his arm, came into sight and crossed the lawn towards him. Francis, filled though his mind was with other thoughts, {{paused for a moment}} and glanced towards them curiously. Lady Cynthia seemed for a moment to have lost all her weariness. Her eyes were very bright, she walked with a new spring in her movements. Even her voice, as she addressed Francis, <b>seemed</b> <b>altered.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} {{immune tolerance}} {{is believed to}} be a major contributing factor to an increased susceptibility and severity of infections in pregnancy.

However, pregnancy does not <b>seem</b> to <b>alter</b> the protective effects vaccination.|$|R
50|$|In 1859 Lt. Jasper Hobson {{and other}} members of the Hudson's Bay Company travel through the Northwest Territories of Canada to Cape Bathurst on the Arctic Ocean on the mission to create a fort at 70 degrees, north of the Arctic Circle. The area they come to is very rich with {{wildlife}} and natural resources. Jasper Hobson and his party establish a fort here. At some point, an earthquake occurs, and from then on, laws of physics <b>seem</b> <b>altered</b> (a total eclipse happens to be only partial; tides are not perceived anymore). They eventually realise that they are on an iceberg separated from the sea ice that is drifting south. Hobson does a daily measurement to know the iceberg's location. The iceberg passes the Bering Strait and the iceberg (which is now much smaller, since the warmer waters has melted some parts) finally reaches a small island. A Danish whaling ship finds them. Every member in Hobson's party is rescued and they all survive.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a {{neurodegenerative disease}} involving progressive muscular paralysis reflecting degeneration of motor neurons. Skeletal muscle tissue seems to {{play a significant role}} in ALS pathogenesis. Here, the role of satellite cells (SCs) in ALS muscle atrophy is investigated. Methods: We isolated SCs from ALS human muscle biopsies and we analyzed their ability to grow and expand in vitro. Ultrastructural and immunophenotypical features were analyzed. Quantitative real-time RT-QPCR and western blot (WB) analyses were performed to evaluate MRFs and MyH 1 expression. Results: ALS SCs showed a high proliferative potential, but their capacity to proceed through the myogenic program and form myotubes <b>seems</b> <b>altered</b> compared to controls (Ctrls). We observed that differentiating ALS SCs showed some specific features, but they displayed an altered morphology, with a large number of vacuoles. RT-QPCR and WB showed lower Myf- 4 and MyH 1 compared to Ctrls. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the capacity of ALS SCs to proceed through the myogenic program seems to be altered: SCs seem to lose their ability to regenerate and restore mature myofibers...|$|R
