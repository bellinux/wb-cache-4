This chapter presents {{the recent developments}} of digital technologies for yarn {{structure and}} appearance analysis. The chapter broadly reviews the latest advances {{that have been made}} in digital measurement and analysis of yarn evenness, yarn hairiness, yarn twist, yarn <b>snarl,</b> <b>yarn</b> blend and yarn surface appearance.

40|$|In this paper, a {{computerized}} method {{has been proposed}} for automatic measurement and recognition of <b>yarn</b> wet <b>snarls</b> from an image of <b>snarled</b> <b>yarn</b> samples captured in a water bath. After image acquisition, image conversion and individual snarled sample extraction, the yarn profile function was extracted from the separated binary image. Fast Fourier Transform and Adaptive Orientated Orthogonal Projective Decomposition were then incorporated into a pattern recognition algorithm of <b>yarn</b> <b>snarl</b> features by treating the yarn profile function as a one-dimensional signal. In addition {{to the number of}} <b>yarn</b> <b>snarl</b> turns, the method was also accurate and efficient for the detection of <b>yarn</b> <b>snarl</b> height and width, which are unobtainable by the untwisting method. The effects of various factors on the yarn profile function were numerically examined, including distributions of <b>yarn</b> diameter and <b>snarl,</b> and the level of random noise.

40|$|This article reports {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation on <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling</b> and balloon fluttering in ring spinning. <b>Yarn</b> <b>snarling</b> and balloon fluttering affect yarn breakage in ring spinning. The theoretical model has incorporated the tangential component of air drag on a ballooning yarn, which was ignored in previous models. The {{results show that}} <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling</b> happens in the balloon when the ratio of yarn length in the balloon to balloon height is greater than a specific value {{that depends on the}} yarn type and count. Yarn tension experiences an obvious change before and after <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling.</b> The balloon flutter appears between normal balloons while the balloon loops are changing. Fluttering balloon shapes that oscillate periodically between two and three loop configurations as yarn tension varies periodically have also been observed experimentally. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the second part of}} a series {{reporting}} the recent development of a computerized method for the automatic measurement and recognition of <b>yarn</b> wet <b>snarls</b> from an image of <b>snarled</b> <b>yarn</b> samples captured in a water bath. In our earlier work, a digital image-signal approach for fully computerized yarn-snarl measurement was developed and the effects of various influencing factors on the recognition algorithms were numerically examined. In this paper, the feasibility and accuracy of the fully computerized method on the measurement of actual <b>yarn</b> wet <b>snarls</b> are evaluated through laboratory experiments. One hundred percent cotton ring spun single yarns of 7, 10, 16, and 20 Ne are prepared and used for the evaluation. In addition to the number of snarl turns per unit length, the snarl height and width of the yarn samples are also objectively measured by using the computerized method. The measurement results obtained by the computerized method are analyzed and compared with those measured manually by using a twist tester and an interactive computer method.

40|$|A {{methodology}} and apparatus {{have been proposed}} to indirectly evaluate twist liveliness of spun yarns by measuring the number of snarl turns formed of a yarn submerged in a water bath. A comparative study was carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of water in the measurement of <b>yarn</b> <b>snarls.</b> T tests showed that water has a significant effect in the snarl forming and testing results. Systematic studies were then carried out in the intra and inter laboratories to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed measurement system. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the studies showed that there is no significant difference in measuring twist liveliness between the operators in the same laboratory and between the operators from different laboratories, respectively. The largest variance in the tests is attributed to the expected variation in the level of snarl turns in different yarn specimens. The experimental results showed that the developed <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling</b> apparatus has made accurate and repeatable measurements of twist liveliness over a range of 100 % cotton ring spun yarn counts.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} improvement of denim fabric appearance by reducing the residual torque of weft yarns. In this paper, 100 % cotton low torque yarns of linear density 84 tex and 58 tex with different twist levels were produced by a new method of producing low torque yarns on a modified ring spinning machine. The results from the experiments show that the low torque yarns possess lower <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling</b> turns. Based on the mechanism analysis of 'small snake' pattern, the low torque ring yarns were applied to the denim fabric to improve fabric smoothness appearance. The experimental study demonstrates that the 'small snake' pattern of the denim fabrics has been greatly decreased by using the low residual torque ring yarns as weft yarns. Objective measurements of the low stress mechanical and surface properties of denim fabrics using low torque and conventional yarns were conducted. The {{results show that the}} denim fabric using the low torque ring yarns as weft yarns presents a smoother and more even surface. Moreover, a multiple comparisons LSD test of fabric properties indicates that there is no significant difference on tensile strength and tearing strength between fabric samples using the low torque ring yarns and conventional ring yarns with normal twist level as weft yarns, respectively. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that the 'small snake' pattern of the fabric decreased with the reduction of weft <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Residual torque or {{twist liveliness}} of a single-spun yarn, among other factors, {{is the most}} {{prominent}} and fundamen-tal factor contributing to the spirality of plain-knitted fab-rics and the skewness of denim fabrics made from the yarn. In textile processing, <b>yarn</b> <b>snarling</b> caused by the twist live-liness is also considered a serious problem that leads to yarn breakage, the deterioration of yarn properties, and equipment malfunction [1]. Over recent decades, various testing apparatus and procedures {{have been developed for}} the measurement of twist liveliness. Generally, all of these methods are based on manual operation and can be classi-fied into the three categories of direct, semi-direct, and indirect methods [2]. 1 Recently, computer vision has attracted the increasing attention of researchers in textiles and apparel.
