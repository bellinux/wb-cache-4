5|$|From the Székelys, {{continuing}} warfare demanded increased military service, and {{the royal}} administration imposed <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> on them. Although {{the leaders of}} the Székely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the foot soldiers continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought {{it back to the}} floor in the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E

When the Crown took over the administration of India from the Company in 1858, the taxes were not replaced.|$|E

25|$|Under Muslim rule, Christians were second-class citizens, {{who paid}} <b>special</b> <b>taxes,</b> had little access to {{political}} power, but were exempt from military service. The Copts {{were cut off}} from the mainstream of Christianity, but they were allowed to practice their religion unmolested. Their position improved dramatically under the rule of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century. He abolished the Jizya (a tax on non-Muslims) and allowed Egyptians (Copts) to enroll in the army. Pope Cyril IV, 1854–61, reformed the church and encouraged broader Coptic participation in Egyptian affairs. Khedive Isma'il Pasha, in power 1863–79, further promoted the Copts. He appointed them judges to Egyptian courts and awarded them political rights and representation in government. They flourished in business affairs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{local governments}} {{in an effort}} to evade the two-thirds voter {{approval}} requirement for <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> under Proposition 218 may express legally nonbinding intent to spend general tax proceeds for one or more specific purposes. This may be done in several forms such as the adoption of intention language before the tax election date, the formation of an advisory committee relating to the expenditure of the tax proceeds, or by placing a companion advisory measure on the same election ballot. The most frequent type of tax where this occurs is the local sales tax, but it can also occur with other local taxes such as utility user taxes, transient occupancy (hotel bed) taxes, business taxes, and various local excise taxes.|$|E

In total, the first war is estimated to have cost the papacy 12 million scudi and <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> were levied against the residents of Rome to refill church coffers.

25|$|Local {{governments in}} California now use imaginative {{strategies}} to maintain or increase revenue due to Proposition 13 and the attendant loss of property tax revenue (which formerly went to cities, counties, {{and other local}} agencies). For instance, many California local governments have recently sought voter approval for <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> such as parcel taxes for public services {{that used to be}} paid for entirely or partially from property taxes imposed before Proposition 13 became law. These public services include: streets, water, sewer, electricity, infrastructure, schools, parks, police protection, firefighting units, and penitentiary facilities. Provision for such taxes was made by the 1982 Community Facilities Act (more commonly known as Mello-Roos). Sales tax rates have also increased from 6% (pre-Proposition 13 level) to 8.25% and even higher in some local jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|During {{his short}} reign, Emperor Julian (361–363) {{abolished}} the <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> {{paid by the}} Jews to the Roman government and also sought to ease the burden of mandatory Jewish financial support of the Jewish patriarchate. He also gave permission for the Jews to rebuild and populate Jerusalem. In {{one of his most}} remarkable endeavours, he initiated the restoration of the Jewish Temple which had been demolished in 70 CE. A contingent of thousands of Jews from Persian districts hoping to assist in the construction effort were killed en route by Persian soldiers. The great earthquake together with Julian's death put an end to Jewish hopes of rebuilding the Third Temple. Had the attempt been successful, {{it is likely that the}} re-establishment of the Jewish state with its sacrifices, priests and Sanhedrin or Senate would have occurred.|$|E
25|$|Until their {{emancipation}} in {{the late}} 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the Jewish hat and the yellow badge, restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or {{in certain parts of}} towns (ghettos), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden). Disabilities also included <b>special</b> <b>taxes</b> levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, England in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and Spain in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 Asser Levy was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.|$|E
