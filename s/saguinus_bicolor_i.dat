Population censuses were conducted between November 2002 and July 2003, covering 6400 hectares in the Ducke Reserve, Manaus-AM, Brazil. Groups of S. bicolor were recorded 41 times accordingly distributed in the environments: plateau (20); slopes (12); and lowlands (09). The mean group size was 4. 8 indiv. /group, and ranged from 2 to 11 individuals. In the sites where the groups were recorded, and in an equivalent number of sites where no tamarins were found located at least 500 m from those {{where they had been}} recorded, we placed 50 m x 50 m plots to record the following forest structural components: abundance of trees; abundance of lianas; abundance of fruiting trees and lianas; abundance of snags; abundance of logs; percentage of canopy opening; leaf litter depth; and altitude. Bare-face Tamarin more often uses areas with lower abundance of forest logs, smaller canopy opening and with higher abundance of snags, areas in the forest with smaller canopy opening present higher density of S. bicolor groups. Apparently this species does not use the forest in a random way, and may select areas for its daily activities depending on the micro-environmental heterogeneity produced by the forest structural components...|$|R

In the Amazon region, non-human primates are commonly infected by Trypanosoma cruzi and T rangeli, which are also infective to man and several mammals. This is the first survey of trypanosomiasis in a critically endangered species of tamarin, <b>Saguinus</b> <b>bicolor</b> (Callitrichidae), from the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. Of the 96 free-ranging specimens of S. bicolor examined 45 (46. 8 %) yielded blood smears positive for trypanosomes. T rangeli was detected in blood smears of 38 monkeys (39. 6 %) whereas T. cruzi was never detected. Seven animals (7. 3 %) presented trypanosomes of the subgenus Megatrypanum. Hemocultures detected 84 positive tamarins (87. 5 %). Seventy-two of 84 (85. 7 %) were morphologically diagnosed as T rangeli and 3 (3. 1 %) as T. cruzi. Nine tamarins (9. 4 %) yielded mixed cultures of these two species, which after successive passages generated six cultures exclusively of T. cruzi and two of T rangeli, with only one culture remaining mixed. Of the 72 cultures positive for T rangeli, 62 remained as established cultures and were genotyped: 8 were assigned to phylogenetic lineage A (12. 9 %) and 54 to lineage B (87. 1 %). Ten established cultures of T. cruzi were genotyped as TCI lineage (100 %). Transmission of both trypanosome species, their potential risk to this endangered species {{and the role of}} wild primates as reservoirs for trypanosomes infective to humans are discussed.

40|$|The {{systematics}} of the subfamily Callitrichinae (Platyrrhini, Primates), a {{group of}} small monkeys from South America and Panama, remains an area of considerable discussion despite many investigations, there being continuing controversy over subgeneric taxonomic classifications based on morphological characters. The purpose of our research was to help elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the monkey genus Saguinus (Callitrichinae) using a molecular approach to discover {{whether or not the}} two different sections containing hairy-faced and bare-faced species are monophyletic, whether Saguinus midas midas and <b>Saguinus</b> <b>bicolor</b> are more closely related than are S. midas midas and Saguinus midas niger, and if Saguinus fuscicollis melanoleucus and Saguinus fuscicollis weddelli really are different species. We sequenced the 957 bp ND 1 mitochondrial gene of 21 Saguinus monkeys (belonging to six species and nine morphotypes) and one Cebus monkey (the outgroup) and constructed phylogenetic trees using maximum parsimony, neighbor joining, and maximum likelihood methods. The phylogenetic trees obtained divided the genus Saguinus into two groups, one containing the small-bodied species S. fuscicollis and the other, the large-bodied species S. mystax, S. leucopus, S. oedipus, S. midas, S. bicolor. The most derived taxa, S. midas and S. bicolor, grouped together, while S. fuscicollis melanoleucus and S. f. weddelli showed divergence values that did not support the division of these morphotypes into subspecies. On the other hand, S. midas individuals showed divergence compatible with the existence of three subspecies, two of them with the same morphotype as the subspecies S. midas niger.

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} regional climate, local weather, and nest box features on the reproductive success of mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and tree swallows (Tachycineta <b>bicolor).</b> <b>I</b> also evaluated the relative influence of local weather and parental care behaviour on mountain bluebird nestling growth and mortality. My results demonstrate that local weather can strongly influence the breeding performance of mountain bluebirds, with improved reproductive success during years of less rainfall. I conclude that this influence is likely exerted directly through acute nestling mortality rather than through nestling growth and prolonged nestling stress. As well, I show that regional climate {{plays an important role}} in tree swallow reproductive success, with improved tree swallow breeding performance during years of lower Southern Oscillation Index values (El Niño conditions). I suggest that the affect of regional climate on tree swallow reproductive success is likely due to influences that ENSO and regional climatic patterns may have on the aerial insect prey base of tree swallows in our study region near Kamloops, BC. For mountain bluebirds, I found the influence of weather on reproductive success is dependent on nest box features, including nest box entrance type.

40|$|Bioinvasions are {{becoming}} more frequent in coastal habitats. Another process that affects coastal habitats {{is an increase in}} frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, e. g. heavy precipitation and droughts that are predicted with climate change. In the face of climate change it can be questioned if native or invasive marine species cope better with abiotic stress. For an experimental study marine bivalves were collected at the coast of Rio de Janeiro state in Brazil. The species studied were the bivalves Perna perna and Isognomon bicolor. P. perna is an important ecological engineer and the dominant native species in benthic communities at Brazilian´s coastline. The invasive species <b>I.</b> <b>bicolor,</b> coming from the Carribean, first established in Brazil around the 1970 's or 80 's, became very abundant explosively in the 90 's and started to outcompete native species.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in evolutionary biology is how phenotypic variation is maintained {{in the face}} of selection that ought to deplete that variation. Much research has investigated this question in traits favored via sexual selection in males, with a common solution implicating the condition dependence of sexually selected phenotypes. Despite growing interest in sexual selection on females, it is not clear if the same mechanisms maintain variation in female ornaments, weaponry or other female behaviors targeted by sexual selection. An important step in testing condition dependence in females is thus to identify whether sexually selected female phenotypes are associated with condition and also with potential costs. Here, I examine these two components of condition dependence for a sexually selected behavior, intrasexual aggression, in female tree swallows Tachycineta <b>bicolor.</b> <b>I</b> asked whether high levels of intrasexual aggression map onto natural variation in female condition and whether aggression is associated with one potential behavioral cost: performance in a vertically challenging test of flight. More aggressive females were heavier for their body size, heavier for their wing size and showed decreased flight ability, relative to less aggressive females. These findings are consistent with condition dependence, where only females in better condition are able to be highly aggressive. The association between high aggression and reduced flight ability may result from the additional lift required to power these relatively heavier birds. These associations between natural variation in aggressive behavior, morphology and flight ability are consistent with condition dependence because they confirm two basic assumptions of condition dependence: a link between aggression and condition, and...|$|R
40|$|Overgrowth is a {{non-symbiotic}} {{association between}} living organisms (epibionts) {{on the surface}} of the hosts (basibionts). This association is known to affect the fitness of the basibionts in terms of reducing their growth rate and survivorship and to alter the interac-tions between the organisms and their environment (Wahl 2008). Colonies of the native encrusting zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum (Duchassaing & Michelotti 1860), a species typical of the infralittoral zone, reported as an aggressive competitor for vital resources such as space, dominate large areas on tropical and temperate shallow reefs. Yet, the eco-logical role that this species fulfills on reef commu-nities of Brazilian rocky shores (southwestern Atlantic) has been scarcely studied to date. The bicolor purse-oyster, Isognomon bicolor (C. B. Adams 1845), is a Caribbean species first introduced in the Brazilian coast before 1990, presumably through transport in ballast water tanks or ship hulls. This bivalve is known to outcompete native and established intertidal species, including the commercially exploited brown mussel, Perna perna (Linnaeus 1758). Records of <b>I.</b> <b>bicolor</b> at the rocky shores of Forno Inlet (Arraial do Cabo, Rio de Janeiro state, southeastern Brazil), show that this bivalve can monopolize colonization space at the intertidal zone, probably preventing native species from settling.

Under salt (NaCl) stress, inoculation of this isolate to wheat plant significantly increased plant growth in terms of various growth parameters such as shoot length/root length (20 – 39 %), fresh weight/dry weight (28 – 42 %), and chlorophyll content (24 – 56 %) following inoculation of test isolate SBP- 9. Bacterial inoculation decreased the level of proline, and malondialdehyde, whereas elevated the antioxidative enzymatic activities of superoxide-dismutase (SOD; 28 – 41 %), catalase (CAT; 24 – 56 %), and peroxidase (POX; 26 – 44 %). Furthermore, it also significantly decreased the Na+ accumulation in both shoot and roots in the range of 25 – 32 %, and increased the K+ uptake by 20 – 28 %, thereby favoring the K+/Na+ ratio.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce their {{predation}} risk, species have evolved a range of anti-predator behaviours. One co-ordinated anti-predator behaviour present in some group-living species is sentinel behaviour. In this behaviour individuals take up an elevated position and scan for threats, providing an alarm when one is spotted. However, this behaviour can lead to social conflict. Sentinel behaviour is a public good, i. e. the benefits are felt by all group members, but the costs only accrue to the actor. Thus it may be open to free loading, requiring individuals to monitor collaborators to prevent cheats. Additionally, individuals may vary in their alarm call reliability, which may select individuals to alter their behaviour based on caller ID. Monitoring others requires individuals to be closely associated, yet individuals may be spread out. For instance, foraging groups may be some distance from their nest, yet nestlings are particularly vulnerable. Adults should reduce their number of nest visits if a threat is nearby, so individuals returning from the nest may be selected to communicate about any perceived threats. Additionally, when perceiving threats, species need not use only conspecific information, because heterospecifics can also provide relevant information. In this thesis, I test these ideas in the Southern Pied Babbler (Turdoides <b>bicolor),</b> and <b>I</b> show that a) pied babblers monitor {{the quantity and quality}} of group-mates’ anti-predator behaviour; b) babblers accompany naïve sentinels and I investigate whether this may be related to anti-predator teaching; c) babblers do not appear to actively communicate about perceived nest threats because they do not alter their provisioning rate based on heterospecific derived anti-predator information; while d) avian heterospecifics are more prevalent in the presence of pied babblers, and can be attracted to areas by playback of pied babbler calls. These results show that species monitor both conspecifics and heterospecifics, and alter their behaviour based on the information they collect...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of genome analysis and proficiency of genetic manipulation in vivo and in vitro are increased by assignment of linkage groups to specific chromosomes, placement of centromeres, orientation {{with respect to}} telomeres, and linear alignment with respect to chromosomal features and dimensions. I undertook five studies aimed at integrating sorghum genomics and cytogenetics at several levels. The results help establish an entirely new "cyto-genomics" resource, impacts of which {{are likely to be}} broad. In the first study, I developed a FISH-based karyotyping system for Sorghum <b>bicolor</b> Moench. <b>I</b> used integrated structural genomic resources, including linkage maps and large-insert clonal libraries of sorghum genomic DNA to develop a 17 -locus probe cocktail for simultaneous fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). This probe enabled facile identification of all chromosome pairs in mitotic chromosome spreads. Perhaps just as important, I established time-efficient means to select sorghum BAC clones for multi-probe FISH. Thus, an integrated cyto-genomics system for sorghum can be constructed without need of chromosome flow sorting or microdissection, both of which are difficult and costly. In the second study, hybridization of DNA clones from 37 different genomic regions enabled the assignment of linkage groups and orientation of linkage maps to chromosomes. Comparisons between genetic and physical distances throughout the genome enabled a new nomenclature for linkage group designation in sorghum. The results provide an integrated nomenclature system of Sorghum bicolor chromosomes and linkage groups. In the third study, I created high-resolution maps by FISH to pachytene bivalents for two linkage groups (B and H), and defined relationships between pericentromeric heterochromatin, centromeres, mapped markers and recombination rates. These relationships will help guide the development and use of sorghum genomics. In the fifth study, I used FISH in two ongoing gene-targeted efforts. For the maturity gene ma 5 and fertility restoration gene rfl, I estimated physical lengths between currently available flanking molecular markers. This enables estimation of recombination densities in these regions and assessment of the applicability of map-based and -assisted cloning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Marine {{biological}} invasions {{have been}} {{regarded as one of}} the major causes of native biodiversity loss, with shipping and aquaculture being the leading contributors for the introductions of alien species in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, five aquatic alien species (one mollusk, three crustaceans and one fish spe-cies) were detected during dives, shore searches and from the fisheries on the coast of the Delta do Parnaíba Environmental Protection Area, in the States of Piauí and Maranhão, Northeastern Brazil. The species were the bicolor purse-oyster Isognomon bicolor, the whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, the Indo-Pacific swimming crab Charybdis hellerii and, the muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus. Ballast water (<b>I.</b> <b>bicolor,</b> C. hellerii, and O. punctatus) and aquaculture activities (L. vannamei and M. rosenbergii) in adjacent areas are the most likely vectors of introduction. All exotic species found have potential impact risks to the environment because they are able to compete against native species for resources (food and habitat). Isognomon bicolor share the same habitat and food items with the native bivalve species of mussels and barnacles. Litopenaeus vannamei share the same habitat and food items with the native penaeids such as the pinkspot shrimp Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis, the Southern brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus subtilis, and the Southern white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti, and in the past few years L. vannamei wa...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{most studies}} on {{biological}} nitrification inhibition (BNI) in sorghum {{have been performed}} with plants grown in hydroponic systems. However, {{the current study was}} conducted {{to determine whether or not}} sorghum inhibits nitrification in fields of Alfisols, and clarify the mechanism that results in inhibition of soil nitrification in the field. Nitrification activity in the rhizosphere of sorghum (Sorghum <b>bicolor</b> (L.) Moench) <b>i.</b> e. soil attached to its roots within a few millimeters was measured and compared with those in adjacent bulk soil. Sweet sorghum (6 varieties) and grain sorghum (3 varieties) were cultivated in 4 Alfisol fields in a semi-arid tropical region of India during the 2010 or 2011 rainy seasons. Soil samples were collected three times during the growing season. Nitrification activity in the rhizospheric soil was significantly lower than that in the bulk soil during 8 out of 12 samplings while the pH (H 2 O, 1 : 2) of the rhizospheric soil was significantly lower than that of the bulk soil in 10 out of 12 samplings. Acidification of the soil by sulfuric acid decreased the nitrification activity to a comparable extent, as emerged in the rhizospheric soils. Our results indicate that acidification of soil around roots would be one of the main causes of nitrification inhibition by sorghum in the field...|$|R

Charybdis hellerii is also able to cause impacts on the local fisheries as the species can decrease the populations of native portunid crabs which are commercialized in the studied region. Macrobrachium rosenbergii may be sharing natural resources with the Amazon River prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum. Omobranchus punctatus shares habit with the native redlip blenny Ophioblennius atlanticus and other fishes, such as the frillfin goby Bathigobius soporator. Some immediate remedial measures to prevent further introductions from ballast water and shrimp farm ponds should be: (i) to prevent the release of ballast water by ship/vessels in the region; (ii) to reroute all effluent waters from shrimp rearing facilities through an underground or above-ground dry well; (iii) to install adequate sand and gravel filter which will allow passage of water but not livestock; (iv) outdoor shrimp pounds located on floodable land should be diked, and; (v) to promote environmental awareness of those directly involved with ballast water (crews of ship/vessels) and shrimp farms in the region. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (3) : 909 - 923. Epub 2010 September 01. En el Área de Protección Ambiental del Delta Del Río Parnaíba, noreste de Brasil fueron detectadas cinco especies acuáticas invasoras (un molusco, tres crustáceos y un pez) : la ostra de dos colores Isognomon bicolor, el camarón patiblanco Litopenaeus vannamei, el camarón gigante de río Macrobrachium rosenbergii, el cangrejo nadador del Indo-Pacifico Charybdis hellerii y el blenio hocicudo Omobranchus punctatus.

40|$|In {{the coming}} decades, the already fragile {{agricultural}} system in West Africa will face further challenges in meeting food security, both from increasing population {{and from the}} impacts of climate change. Optimal prioritization of adaptation investments requires the assessment of various possible adaptation options and their uncertainties; successful adaptations of agriculture to climate change should not only help farmers deal with current climate risks, but also reduce negative (or enhance positive) impacts associated with climate change using robust climate projections. Here, we use two well-validated crop models (APSIM v 7. 5 and SARRA-H v 3. 2) and an ensemble of downscaled climate forcing from the CMIP 5 models to assess five possible and realistic adaptation options {{for the production of}} the staple crop sorghum (Sorghum <b>bicolor</b> Moench.) : (<b>i)</b> late sowing, (ii) intensification of seeding density and fertilizer use, (iii) increasing cultivars' thermal time requirement, (iv) water harvesting, and (v) increasing resilience to heat stress during the flowering period. We adopt a new assessment framework to account for both the impacts of proposed adaptation options in the historical climate and their ability to reduce the impacts of future climate change, and we also consider changes in both mean yield and inter-annual yield variability. We target the future period of 2031 - 2060 for the "business-as-usual" scenario (RCP 8. 5), and compare with the historical period of 1961 - 1990. Our results reveal that most proposed "adaptation options" are not more beneficial in the future than in the historical climate (- 12 % to + 4 % in mean yield), so that they do not really reduce the climate change impacts. Increased temperature resilience during the grain number formation period is the main adaptation that emerges (+ 4. 5 %). Intensification of fertilizer inputs can dramatically benefit yields in the historical/current climate (+ 50 %), but does not reduce negative climate change impacts except in scenarios with substantial rainfall increases. Water harvesting contributes to a small benefit in the current climate (+ 1. 5 % to + 4. 0 %) but has little additional benefit under climate change. Our analysis of uncertainties arising from crop model differences (conditioned on the used model versions) and various climate model projections provide insights on how to further constrain uncertainties for assessing future climate adaptation options...|$|R
