This chapter looks at the Phorm saga {{through the lens of}} Symbiotic Regulation, and suggests that Phorm’s apparent failure has been a result of their failure to understand the complexity of the regulatory matrix. In particular, Phorm underestimated the views of user-groups and digital rights advocates – and the influence and effect those views could have. The saga has many losers – as well as Phorm itself, the UK government and the ISPs all come out the worse for wear. This chapter suggests how much of this could have been avoided...|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{educational}} {{software for the}} important corporate and tertiary education markets was designed to run on a single desktop computer (or an equivalent user device). In the years immediately following 2000, planners decided to switch to server-based applications {{with a high degree}} of standardization. This means that {{educational software}} runs primarily on servers which may be hundreds or thousands of miles from the actual user. The user only receives tiny pieces of a learning module or test, fed over the internet one by one. The server software decides on what learning material to distribute, collects results and displays progress to teaching staff. Another way of expressing this change is to say that educational software morphed into an online educational <b>service.</b> US Governmental <b>endorsements</b> and approval systems ensured the rapid switch to the new way of managing and distributing learning material.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: (1) To assess {{expectations}} {{and experiences of}} a new eHealth service by patients and staff in three primary care settings; (2) to ascertain attitudes {{to a range of}} future, primary care-oriented eHealth services. Design: Qualitative case study. Setting: Three UK general practices introducing an eHealth service for booking patient appointments. Participants: Ninety patients purposively selected from users and non-users of the new service and 28 staff (clinicians, management and administrative staff). Results: Actual patient use of the service was lower than stated intention. Patients and staff felt that more active promotion of the service would have resulted in more use. Low usage did not result in a negative assessment of the service by most staff. Different patient groupings were identified with characteristics that may be used as predictors of eHealth service use and indicators of training needs. GPs and patients expressed opposing viewpoints on a range of future eHealth services. Conclusions: Take-up of eHealth services may be lower than expected. To overcome patient barriers, factors that may narrow the intention–behaviour gap such as level of <b>service</b> promotion, GP <b>endorsement,</b> and usage by different patient groups, should be investigated. For clinician barriers, the eHealth evidence base needs strengthening, while for primary care practices, a learning process including staff training needs to be instituted. The differing views of patients and GPs about components of eHealth means that policymakers need to plan for a lengthy political process to obtain agreement on contentious issues if they are to achieve successful eHealth services...|$|R
40|$|Background: Some say 'prison works', {{others say}} that it only harms. Overall, {{longitudinal}} studies of prisoners suggest some positive impact on mental state, but post-release recidivism is high. How do men {{at high risk for}} repeated imprisonment experience it? Aim: To explore prison (gaol) experience among men awaiting trial in custody. Methods: In a prospective longitudinal study, 170 men were interviewed just after reception about their social context and mental state and again three weeks later, when each was asked to describe his current prison experience; 75 % had been in prison before. Data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: Each man had views on his imprisonment. Data were saturated after 20 interviews. The core concern was its overall emotional impact, in full negative to positive range, with recognition that this could and did change in either direction, both passively and through active processes. Underpinning themes were along the dimensions of missing people to asylum from the outside world; in-prison bullying to positive staff and/or inmate relationships; boredom to relief in routine; and 'doing my head in' to salvation from drug-induced decline. Testing the model in the whole sample confirmed no association between prison impact and pre-prison factors. Negative experience was associated with severe depression within but not before this imprisonment. More positive experience related to good in-prison relationships. Conclusions: During pre-trial custodial detention, there is a greater range of experience than generally previously reported. The simple expedients of prison staff developing good relationships with prisoners, and facilitating these between prisoners, could be life-saving. Highly positive experiences may be more an indictment on community <b>services</b> than an <b>endorsement</b> of imprisonment...|$|R
