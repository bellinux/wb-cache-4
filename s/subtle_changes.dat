5|$|Styracosaurus {{is known}} from a higher {{position}} in the formation (relating specifically to its own genus) than the closely related Centrosaurus, suggesting that Styracosaurus displaced Centrosaurus as the environment changed over time and/or dimension. It {{has been suggested that}} Styracosaurus albertensis is a direct descendant of Centrosaurus (C. apertus or C. nasicornis), and that it in turn evolved directly into the slightly later species Rubeosaurus ovatus. <b>Subtle</b> <b>changes</b> can be traced in the arrangement of the horns through this lineage, leading from Rubeosaurus to Einiosaurus, to Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. However, the lineage may not be a simple, straight line, as a pachyrhinosaur-like species has been reported from the same time and place as Styracosaurus albertensis.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were <b>subtle</b> <b>changes.</b> Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E

5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice <b>subtle</b> <b>changes,</b> such as {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E
5|$|A right-arm fast bowler of express pace, Lindwall {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing {{regarded as one of the}} greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace. Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> of pace and an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, pace and control made him the most feared paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.|$|E

25|$|As {{described}} above, Mössbauer spectroscopy has {{an extremely}} fine energy resolution and can detect even <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> {{in the nuclear}} environment of the relevant atoms. Typically, there are five types of nuclear interactions that are observed: isomeric shift, chemical shift, quadrupole splitting, hyperfine splitting and Zeeman splitting.|$|E

25|$|The Marines' Hymn {{dates back}} to 1919 and is the oldest {{official}} song in the U.S. Armed Forces. It embraces {{some of the most}} important battles of the Corps at that time, including Chapultepec and Derna. <b>Subtle</b> <b>changes</b> and unofficial verses have been added as the history of the Corps grew.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{drawbacks}} {{of the technique}} are {{the limited number of}} gamma ray sources and the requirement that samples be solid in order to eliminate the recoil of the nucleus. Mössbauer spectroscopy is unique in its sensitivity to <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> in the chemical environment of the nucleus including oxidation state changes, the effect of different ligands on a particular atom, and the magnetic environment of the sample.|$|E
25|$|As an amateur, Laver was a {{somewhat}} flashy player, often a late starter. He {{had to learn}} to control his adventurous shot-making and integrate percentage tennis into his game when he turned professional. In his prime, he could adapt his style to all surfaces and to all conditions. Laver had a strong record in five-set-matches, often turning things around with <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> of tactics.|$|E

25|$|Although {{roughly the}} same, costume {{designer}} James Acheson made numerous <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> to Spider-Man's costume. The colors were made richer and bolder, the spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, the eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and the muscle suit underneath {{was made into}} pieces, to give {{a better sense of}} movement. The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eye pieces, which were easier to remove.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the alpha}} and beta (all trans) isomers of parinaric acid {{are used as}} {{molecular}} probes of lipid-lipid interactions, by monitoring phase transitions in bilayer lipid membranes. α-Parinaric acid was shown to integrate normally into the phospholipid bilayer of mammalian cells, nervous tissue, with minimal effects on the biophysical properties of the membrane. Molecular interactions with neighboring membrane lipids will affect the fluorescence of α-parinaric acid in predictable ways, and the subsequent <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> in energy intensities may be measured spectroscopically.|$|E
25|$|The V12 Vantage {{has been}} {{confirmed}} for United States market. Dr. Urlich Bez personally confirmed that USA homologation is underway. This {{is in response to}} the decision of expanding the production run beyond 1,000 units. According to the automaker, some <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> were necessary to the structure of the car in order for it to meet North and South American regulations. In addition to these enhancements, Aston also announced that it would be adding a new Carbon Black version of the V12 Vantage exclusively for the American market.|$|E
40|$|Elec. {{resistivity}} measurements {{have been performed}} on bulk semiconducting AsxTe 100 -x glasses (25 ≤ x≤ 60) in a Bridgman anvil system. The resistivity of all the AsxTe 100 -x glassy samples decreases continuously with increasing pressure, reaching metallic values at around 5 GPa. The high-pressure response of AsxTe 100 -x glasses shows a very <b>subtle</b> <b>change</b> at x = 40.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} mating in non-conceptive periods {{and to encourage}} males to maintain their proximity, males must possess imperfect knowledge of the female's fertility status. This is achieved through concealed ovulation in most animals that exhibit extended female sexuality. A review of studies revealed that, in humans, females only exhibit <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> during estrus, {{making it difficult for}} males to assess fertility with precision. In the , for instance, females lack any overt signals of fertility and are continuously receptive to sexual intercourse, encouraging males to remain and provide resources.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{multiple}} solutions {{exist for}} such non-linear warping procedures, and to balance appropriately between the potentially opposing requirements for global and local shape fit, ever more sophisticated registration algorithms are being developed. Most of these, however, are computationally expensive if applied with a high-resolution grid. The biggest advantage of DBM {{with respect to}} VBM {{is its ability to}} detect <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> in longitudinal studies. However, due to the vast variety of registration algorithms, no widely accepted standard for DBM exists, which also prevented its incorporation into major neuroimaging software packages.|$|E
25|$|The Panorama Elite III was {{the last}} in the Elite series. Improvements {{continued}} to the basic Elite design; this included rear lighting, rear emergency door and <b>subtle</b> <b>changes</b> to the front grill. The rear emergency door was brought about by changes in legislation and did improve the offside appearance of the Elite, however some early Mark IIIs were completed with front emergency doors. The rear lights abandoned the soup plates in favour of tall lozenge shaped lights and the name badges were re-located from between the side bright metal strips at the {{back to the front}} just behind the front door.|$|E
