40|$|Grain {{amaranth}} {{has been}} suggested {{as an alternative to}} marine animals as a natural source of squalene. Oil contents, squalene contents, and fatty acid profiles were determined in 11 genotypes of four grain amaranth species. Although the oil contents of grain amaranth were low (from 5. 1 % in Amaranthus tricolor to 7. 7 % in Amaranthus cruentus) as compared to other oil-containing grains, high concentrations of squalene were found in total lipids, ranging from 3. 6 % in Amaranthus hypochondriacus to 6. 1 % in A. tricolor. The major fatty acids in Amaranthus oil consisted of palmitic acid (19. 1 - 23. 4 %), oleic acid (18. 7 - 38. 9 %), and linoleic acid (36. 7 - 55. 9 %). A high degree of unsaturation was observed in Amaranthus oils, with S/U ratios of 0. 26 - 0. 32. A method to isolate and purify the squalene from Amaranthus oil was developed. After the saponification of K 112, the squalene content increased from 4. 2 % in the crude oil to 43. 3 % in the unsaponifiables by the removal of the <b>saponifiables.</b> The unsaponifiables were fractionated by silica gel column chromatography to get highly purified squalene. The squalene purity in certain fractions was as high as 98 %. Combining the fractions rich in squalene gave a 94 % squalene concentrate, with a yield of 90 %. The structure of squalene in the purified sample was confirmed by comparison of its ultraviolet spectrum with a standard and from its nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Microfiche. ix, 113 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmStimulatory {{effect of}} phospholipids, lecithin and cephalin on sexual reproduction of Phytophthora cactorum was increased by purification with column chromatography or {{thin layer chromatography}} (TLC). Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry analysis (MS) failed to detect sterols in the highly purified phospholipid samples. Trace amount of cholesterol added to the cephalin did not significantly changed the amount of oospores produced. Therefore, confirming the previous reports that sterols are not essential to sexual reproduction in pythiaceous fungi. Purification and identification of oospore stimulatory compounds from com oil and crude soybean lecithin were carried out by saponification, Florisil column chromatography, TLC, digitonin precipitation, high performance liquid chromatography and GC-MS analysis. Phytol, one of the compound identified from com oil, stimulated sexual reproduction of P. cactorum and P. parasitica. The minimum concentrations of phytol stimulatory to sexual reproduction of P. cactorum and P. parasitica were 0. 002 ppm. Lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids, and geraniol and squalene induced oospore formation of P. cactorum following purification on TLC. Purified palmitoleic acid was stimulatory to oospore formation of P. cactorum and P. parasitica. Retinol and its esters were also stimulatory to sexual reproduction of P. cactorum and P. parasitica. Nutrient deprivation or growth limitation induced sexual reproduction of P. cactorum cultured on basal medium. The fungus grown in solid or liquid basal medium formed oospores after being transferred to water agarose. Mycelial age, concentration of the basal medium and size of petri plate affected the number of oospores produced by P. cactorum. The non-saponifiables extracted from mycelia of P. cactorum cultured in liquid basal medium stimulated oospore formation of P. cactorum and P. parasitica, while the <b>saponifiables</b> were stimulatory to P. cactorum only. Over all results showed that many compounds commonly found in plants and fungi are stimulatory to sexual reproduction in pythiaceous fungi.
