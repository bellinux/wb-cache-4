40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{development}} and a user study on simulated wind in a racing video game. Our research question asked whether low-cost technology could be effective for making simulated wind, {{and how it}} could affect the racing game's usability. Two computer fans were operated by a microcontroller that was connected to a PC running a racing video game. The fans ' speed changed according to the car acceleration in the game. We conducted a Concurrent Think Aloud Protocol usability test, where 16 participants played the video game. At {{the end of the}} usability test, participants filled out a System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Results</b> indicate that all the participants felt the simulated wind usable for the game. Results also indicated that the game usability was not affected by the simulated wind, and the software/hardware configuration can be a cost-effective solution for simulating wind. Further work include experimenting with more powerful fans. Keywords—Video game; wind simulation; racing game; usability testing; multimodal interfaces. I...|$|E
40|$|Context. Gestural {{interfaces}} {{involves the}} ability of technology identifying and recognizing human body language and then interpret this into commands. This is usually used to ease our everyday life, but also to increase usability in for example mobile phones. Objectives. In this study {{the use of a}} gestural interface is evaluated as an interaction method to facilitate the introduction of new and novice users to 3 D modeling tools. A gestural interface might reduce the modeling time without making an impact {{on the quality of the}} result. Methods. A gestural interface is designed and implemented based on previous research regarding gestural interfaces. Time and quality results are gathered through an experiment where participants are to complete a set of tasks in the modeling tool Autodesk Maya that relates to modeling. These tasks are executed in both the implemented gestural interfaces as well as the standard interface of Autodesk Maya. User experience is also gathered through the use of a <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Results.</b> 17 participants took part in the experiment. Each participant generated time and quality results for each task of the experiment for each interface. For each interface the user experience was recorded through a SUS questionnaire. Conclusions. The results showed that the use of a gestural interface did increase the modeling time for the users, indicating that the use of a gestural interface was not preferable as an interaction medium. The results did show that the time difference between the interfaces was reduced for each completed task, indicating that the gestural interface might have an increase in learnability of the software. The same indication were given from the SUS questionnaire. Also, the results did not show any impact on the quality...|$|E

In the current study, we assessed the perceived usability and satisfaction with the content of a national website with information on late effects and analyzed possible determinants related to website usability and content satisfaction. CCS and their parents were contacted through our local follow-up program and via online media to complete an online questionnaire regarding their baseline characteristics, medical decision style, and the usability and content of the website. Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (<b>SUS),</b> a validated <b>questionnaire</b> <b>resulting</b> in a score from 0 to 100. For the content rating, we constructed a six-item scale resulting in a score from 1 to 5 (Cronbach's α, 0. 83). Comments were analyzed qualitatively. Fifty-five survivors and forty-three parents of survivors completed the questionnaire. Median age of respondents was 41 years (range, 17 - 58). Respondents rated the website's usability with a mean SUS score of 72. 5 (95 % CI, 69. 2 - 74. 9). The mean content rating was 3. 7 (95 % CI, 3. 5 - 3. 8). No determinants were significantly related to the perceived usability or content satisfaction in multivariate analyses. Qualitative analysis revealed respondents' preference for more detailed and even scientific information on late effects. Respondents were satisfied with the usability and the contents of a website that targeted at their information needs. As knowledge about late effects is still limited among survivors, a website can be a valuable resource to improve their knowledge, promote healthy behavior, and in the end, improve their quality of lif...|$|R

40|$|An {{objective}} and advantage of Virtual Reality {{is to promote}} the sense of “being there”, to be present. Most existing {{research in this field}} is focused on determining “if” a given factor contributes to the sense of presence. This paper compares two visualization systems regarding their contribution to the sense of presence, assessing which one contributes the most. Two low-cost low-tech systems were considered: anaglyph-based stereoscopy and large Field-of-View (FOV) screens. The <b>SUS</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> was applied to 63 participants to assess their sense of presence. Participants were divided in two groups on a between-subject experiment and watched a guided tour on a virtual University campus. It was found that both systems contribute to increase presence, but data shows that anaglyph-based stereoscopy contribute more than FOV enlargement. We conclude by suggesting that the very first step to raise the immersion of a Virtual Environment should be using stereoscopy, at least the anaglyph-based on...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in bringing medical educational materials {{to the point of}} care. We sought to develop a system for just-in-time learning in radiology. A database of 34 learning modules was derived from previously published journal articles. Learning objectives were specified for each module, and multiple-choice test items were created. A web-based system—called TEMPO—was developed to allow radiologists to select and view the learning modules. Web services were used to exchange clinical context information between TEMPO and the simulated radiology work station. Preliminary evaluation was conducted using the System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> TEMPO identified learning modules that were relevant to the age, sex, imaging modality, and body part or organ system of the patient being viewed by the radiologist on the simulated clinical work station. Users expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the system’s design and user interface. TEMPO enables just-in-time learning in radiology, and can be extended to create a fully functional learning management system for point-of-care learning in radiology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} reasons that leads to a low {{adoption}} rate of telemedicine systems is poor usability. An aspect that influences usability during the reporting of findings is the input mode, e. g., if a free-text (FT) or a structured report (SR) interface is employed. The objective of our study is to compare the usability of FT and ST telemedicine systems, specifically in terms of user satisfaction, efficiency and general usability. We comparatively evaluate the usability of these two input modes in a telecardiology system for issuing electrocardiography reports {{in the context of a}} statewide telemedicine system in Brazil with more than 350. 000 performed tele-electrocardiography examinations. We adopted a multiple method research strategy, applying three different kinds of usability evaluations: user satisfaction was evaluated through interviews with seven medical professionals using the System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and specific questions related to adequacy and user experience. Efficiency was evaluated by estimating execution time using the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). General usability was assessed based on the conformity of the systems to a set of e-health specific usability heuristics. The results of this comparison provide a first indication that a structured report (SR) input mode for such a system is more satisfactory and efficient with a larger conformity to usability heuristics than free-text (FT) input. User satisfaction using the <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> has been scored in average with 58. 8 and 77. 5 points for the FT and SR system, respectively, which means that the SR system was rated 18. 65 points higher than the FT system. In terms of efficiency, the completion of a findings report using the SR mode is estimated to take 8. 5 s, 3. 74 times faster than using the FT system (31. 8 s). The SR system also demonstrated less violations to usability heuristics (8 points) in comparison to 14 points observed in the FT system. These results provide a first indication that the usage of structured reporting as an input mode in telecardiology systems may enhance usability. This also seems to confirm the advantages of the usage of structured reporting, as already described in the literature for other areas such as teleradiology...|$|R

30|$|Although {{there is}} a wide range of methods {{available}} for assessing a system’s ease of use, few of them are so far particularly tailored to ECAs. Using established questionnaires like the Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) (Kirakowski and Corbett 1993) and the Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS) (Shannon and Weaver 1987) might be problematic as they were developed for unimodal graphical user interfaces like websites. However, the scale measuring Pragmatic Qualities of the AttrakDiff may provide meaningful results (cf. Section “Hedonic and pragmatic qualities”). A possible explanation is that the AttrakDiff measures on a relatively high level appropriate for a variety of different interfaces. The <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> also offers rather generic questions, which might be adaptable to ECAs (Brooke 1996). However, there are instrumental means to assess the cognitive load. In experimental conditions, providing a secondary task (dual task paradigm) can be used to increase the load so that indirect measures show differences in cognitive load more clearly (cf. Stevens et al. (2013) for details, especially for a method suited for ECAs).|$|R
40|$|Perceived {{usability}} affects greatly student’s learning {{effectiveness and}} overall learning experience, {{and thus is}} an important requirement of educational software. The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a well-researched and widely used questionnaire for perceived usability evaluation.

This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{in the context of}} LMSs’ perceived usability evaluation. Eleven studies involving 769 students were conducted, in which participants evaluated the usability of two LMSs (eClass and Moodle) used within courses of their curriculum. It was found that the perceived usability of the evaluated LMSs is at a satisfactory level (mean SUS score 76. 27). Analysis of the results also demonstrated the validity and reliability of SUS for LMSs’ evaluation, and that it remains robust even for small sample sizes. Moreover, the following SUS attributes were investigated in the context of LMSs evaluation: gender, age, prior experience with the LMS, Internet self-efficacy, attitude towards the Internet and usage frequency of the LMS...|$|R

40|$|If we are {{to learn}} {{the effects of the}} {{environment}} and our day-to-day actions, and choices on our physiology, we must develop systems that will label biophysiological senor data with contextual information. In this thesis I first present an architecture and implementation of FEEL: a system for the acquisition, processing and visualization of biophysiological signals and contextual information. The system comprises a mobile client application (FMC) and a backend server, The mobile client collects contextual information: phone call details, email reading details, calendar entries, and user location at a fixed interval that is transmitted to the backend server. The backend server stores the contextual information and biophysiological signal data that is uploaded by the user, processes the information and provides a novel interface for viewing the combined data. Next, I present the results of a 10 -day user study in which users wore Electrodermal Activity (EDA) wrist sensors that measured their autonomic arousal levels. These users were requested to upload the sensor data and annotate it {{at the end of the}} day at first, and then after two days. One group of users had access to both the signal and the full contextual information collected by the mobile phone and the other group could only access the bio physiological signal. At the end of the study the users were asked to fill in a System Usability Scale (<b>SUS)</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> a user experience survey and a Toronto-Alexithymia (TAS- 20) <b>questionnaire.</b> My <b>results</b> show that the FEEL system enables the users to annotate bio-physiological signals at a greater effectiveness than the current state of the art. Finally, I showed that there is a correlation between a person's ability to determine their own arousal level and their score on the Toronto-alexithymia test: the less alexythymic they were, the better their correlation between the EDA and their self-reported arousal. by Yadid Ayzenberg.

30|$|We {{tested the}} {{developed}} system {{on a set}} of 174 volunteers from various areas of Istanbul. To evaluate system usability, after using the QR Code Identity Tag system, volunteers were asked to complete the System Usability Scale (SUS) (Brooke 2013; Brooke et al. 1996) questionnaire. Many studies have been conducted to assist practitioners in assessing product/service usability. While many studies have focused on specific interface types, information from other studies may be used to analyze a wider range of interface types. In our study, we used the <b>SUS</b> <b>questionnaire</b> because it has the capacity to analyze a wide range of products and services with verified validity. Some features of the SUS make it quite useful. First, it is simple, consisting of only 10 statements, and is quick and easy for subjects to complete. Second, it is open source, free to use, and quick to score. Third, it employs agnostic technology, meaning that {{it can be used to}} analyze various types of user interfaces, such as websites, cell phones, interactive voice response systems (both touch-tone and speech), and TV applications. Finally, the result of the survey is a single score that varies between 0 and 100. Thus, it is relatively easy to understand for researchers from other disciplines who work on project teams (Bangor et al. 2008; Lewis and Sauro 2009; Sauro 2011; Bangor et al. 2009; Tullis and Stetson 2004).|$|R
