5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept {{his place in the}} Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans.

5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per <b>second.</b> <b>He</b> was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch {{the model in}} charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the <b>second</b> <b>he</b> used oil paints {{to fill in the}} figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E
5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. <b>Second,</b> <b>he</b> {{called for an end to}} slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.|$|E

5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. <b>Second,</b> <b>he</b> forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and <b>second,</b> <b>he</b> felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted {{to take control of}} the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.|$|E

5|$|In {{organizing}} a 1952 exhibition of abstract art, Marcus lured local leaders {{to the show}} by two means. First, he solicited the donation of art from the collections of David Rockefeller and his brothers, along with those from other noted national business leaders. <b>Second,</b> <b>he</b> requested that the donors personally write letters of invitation to their Dallas colleagues, feeling that the otherwise suspect art would benefit from the imprimatur of respected figures known for their fine taste. His efforts were rewarded by a numerous and appreciative turnout for the show.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. <b>Second,</b> <b>he</b> becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure of his love affair that defines the character.|$|E

5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq.

5|$|The Gospels portray Jesus {{teaching}} in well-defined sessions, such as Matthew's Sermon on the Mount or Luke's parallel Sermon on the Plain. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which {{had originally been}} recorded without context. While Jesus' miracles fit within {{the social context of}} antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. <b>Second,</b> <b>he</b> connected them to end times prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{got things}} {{started in the}} bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal <b>second.</b> <b>He</b> scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey, Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on <b>second,</b> <b>he</b> lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E
