5|$|In 661, Wulfhere is {{recorded}} in the Chronicle as harrying Ashdown, in West Saxon territory. The Gewisse, {{thought to be the}} original group from which the West Saxons came, appear to have originally settled in the upper Thames valley, and what records survive of the 6th century show them active in that region. The Mercian resurgence under Wulfhere placed them under severe pressure. Also in the early 660s, the West Saxon see of Dorchester, in the same area, was divided, and a new bishopric <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Winchester. This decision was probably a reaction to the advance of the Mercians into the traditional heartland of the West Saxons, leaving Dorchester dangerously close to the border. Within a few years, the Dorchester see was abandoned; the exact date is not known, but it was probably in the mid 660s.|$|E
