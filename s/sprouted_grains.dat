In addition, they use less water than traditional forage, making them ideal for drought conditions. Sprouted barley and other cereal grains can be grown hydroponically in a carefully controlled environment.

The practical significance of the research is the creation of innovative technology to produce a new bakery product using germinated wheat grains (Triticumaestivum L.). The analysis of the existing market of <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> and prospects of its development, the analysis of consumers' information regarding <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> was carried out. The rational regimes of germination of wheat (Triticumaestivum L.), allowing to obtain an additive in the formulation of bakery products with maximum biological activity, are determined. It is shown that the length of sprouts of germinated seeds used in this recipe should not exceed 2 mm. It was found that under the selected germination conditions, the shoots reach the required length within 48 hours of germination. Thus, in spite of a slight difference in price, the products will be in demand and be competitive in the market of bread and bakery products.

ReganA laboratory-scale {{method for}} wheat {{germination}} {{was developed and}} used to compare hard red winter wheat varieties for sprout related attributes, activity, and whole wheat bread baking performance. WB 4458, WB Grainfield, LCS Mint, LCS Wizard, SY Monument, and T 158 wheat varieties grown in three Kansas locations were germinated with the developed small-scale germination method and falling number values were compared. Byrd, Tam 204, and T 158 were germinated with a scaled-up germination method aimed at generating samples in three falling number ranges of less than 120 seconds (low falling number and highly sprouted), 250 ± 40 seconds (medium falling number), and 350 ± 40 seconds (high falling number and low sprouting). Controls were un-germinated, sound (> 400 seconds falling number), samples of each variety. The control whole <b>grain</b> and <b>sprouted</b> wheat was ground into flour. A mixograph {{was used to determine}} dough water absorption and mixing time. Whole wheat bread was made to determine bread volume, crumb characteristics, and bread texture. Overall there were few significant differences within each wheat variety for the different levels of germination. The only significant difference observed in all three varieties was that each highly <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> (< 120 seconds falling number) produced bread with significantly lower elasticity than the control within each variety, indicating that this level of germination produced a gummier bread. Elasticity was positively correlated with falling number (r=+ 0. 71). A focused analysis on the Byrd variety compared the germinated samples to samples generated with added malted barley to the same falling number ranges. RVA analysis showed the gelatinization profiles for germinated and malted samples were similar within each falling number range. The highly and medium <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> had significantly lower dough water absorption than the malted counterparts for those levels and the medium <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> also had a lower mix time then the malted sample. There {{were no significant differences in}} bread volume, crumb characteristics, or bread texture except the highly <b>sprouted</b> <b>grain</b> had significantly lower elasticity than the control and the malted counterpart was not significantly different.
