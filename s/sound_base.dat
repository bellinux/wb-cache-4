60|$|The most fickle of wooers, however, {{is apt to}} {{be caught}} at last, {{and so it was}} with John Vansittart Smith. The more he burrowed his way into Egyptology the more {{impressed}} he became by the vast field which it opened to the inquirer, and by the extreme importance of a subject which promised to throw a light upon the first germs of human civilisation and the origin of the greater part of our arts and sciences. So struck was Mr. Smith that he straightway married an Egyptological young lady who had written upon the sixth dynasty, and having thus secured a <b>sound</b> <b>base</b> of operations he set himself to collect materials for a work which should unite the research of Lepsius and the ingenuity of Champollion. The preparation of this magnum opus entailed many hurried visits to the magnificent Egyptian collections of the Louvre, upon the last of which, no longer ago than the middle of last October, he became involved in a most strange and noteworthy adventure.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the {{publication}} of the first edition, The Big Book was typically well received by most critics, referred to by one reviewer as [...] "the greatest redemptive force of the twentieth century." [...] A reviewer for the New York Times stated that the thesis of the book had more of a <b>sound</b> <b>base</b> psychologically than any other book on the subject and that the book is unlike any other book ever published. Other critics called the book extraordinary and stated that it deserved the attention of anyone worried about the problem of alcoholism.It was noted by the American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers that contact with the members of an A.A. group increases one's respect for their work. [...] "To the layman, the book is very clear. To the professional person it is at first a bit misleading in that the spiritual aspect gives the impression that this is another revival movement" [...] and that [...] "it is more impressive to the professional person to watch the technique in action than to read the book."However, not all reviewers, especially those in the medical field, found merit in the book. The review that appeared in the October 1939 volume of the Journal of the American Medical Association called the book [...] "a curious combination of organizing propaganda and religious exhortation…in no sense a scientific book." [...] Similarly, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease said The Big Book was [...] "big in words…a rambling sort of camp meeting…Of the inner meaning of alcoholism there is hardly a word. It is all on the surface material." [...] This review went on to [...] "degrade" [...] the alcoholic: [...] "Inasmuch as the alcoholic, speaking generally, lives a wish-fulfilling infantile regression to the omnipotent delusional state, perhaps he is best handled for the time being at least by regressive mass psychological methods, in which, as is realized, religious fervors belong, hence the religious trend of the book." [...] The views about the book and about alcoholism espoused in these two journals was typical of how alcoholics and other addicts were viewed by many in the psychiatric field {{during the middle of the}} 20th century.|$|E
