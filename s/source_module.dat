The present analysis is valid when the buoyancy force effects are small compared to forced convection effects. The mixed convection flow problem is formulated by two-dimensional incompressible flow with the buoyancy term represented by the Boussinesq approximation. The governing equations are solved in the stream function and vorticity formulation using high accuracy finite difference schemes. Results are reported for single and two heat <b>source</b> <b>modules</b> mounted on a horizontal plate with and without thickness. The effects of induced velocity, heat input, thickness, and location of heat <b>source</b> <b>modules</b> on heat transfer rate and thermal field {{in the vicinity of}} heat sources are reported. Results have shown that there is a decrease of maximum temperature on heat <b>source</b> <b>modules</b> with increase in free-stream velocity of the fluid. Results show that the change of location and thickness of heat <b>source</b> <b>modules</b> has a significant effect on thermal flow field characteristics. The maximum temperature and average Nusselt number on heat <b>source</b> <b>modules</b> are reported at different parameters. The reported results agreed well with experimental results available in the literature...|$|R

Neutron trajectories are created in a <b>source</b> <b>module</b> or loaded from a file created in a previous simulation. Each neutron is assigned a count rate which is modified on each interaction with the instrument, like the reflection at or transmission through a (super)mirror plate. The trajectory is discarded if the neutron does not hit the subsequent component or gets absorbed. Some components (e.g. sample environment) can multiply neutron trajectories by splitting the neutrons into several possible final states and assigning the appropriate probability to each of them, thus keeping the total neutron intensity either constant or decreasing if neutrons are lost.|$|E

The microstrip is operated in the first higher order odd mode, which is a leaky mode, and excited by a proximity-coupled center-fed slotline on the same surface of the uniplanar microwave-integrated circuit. The measured performance of an X-band transmission-type injection-locked active-integrated an-tenna <b>source</b> <b>module</b> demonstrated that such a design approach was suitable for linear array integration for quasi-optical power combining.

For the first time, {{they were able}} to image 196 (array of 14 × 14) focused beams of a multielectron beam source on a specimen using single beam scanning electron microscope (SEM) optics. The system consists of an FEI Novanano 200 SEM optics column equipped with a multielectron beam <b>source</b> <b>module.</b> The <b>source</b> <b>module</b> consists of the multibeam source and an accelerator lens. In the multibeam source, the wide angle beam of a high brightness Schottky source is divided into 196 beamlets and focused by an aperture lens array. The accelerator lens is positioned on the image plane of the multibeam source to direct the beams toward the SEM column. The array of source images is further imaged by the SEM magnetic lenses, and the beam opening angle is defined at the variable aperture of the SEM. The system is designed to deliver 14 × 14 arrays of beamlets with a minimum probe size of 1 nm. In this article, the performance of the system is examined for a fixed magnification case.

One operator utilizing the station can collect and analyze over 38, 000 data points in 11 hours. The test station is comprised of four modules and a anechoic chamber. The anechoic chamber provides a controlled test environment while the modules perform specific functions at the station. The four modules include the Computer, Control, Source, and Positioner Modules. The Computer Module interfaces with the other three modules and performs the automatic control and data processing for the test station. Automatic positioner control, manual positioner control, and manual antenna pattern measurements are provided by the Control Module. The <b>Source</b> <b>Module</b> radiates a continuous or pulsed electromagnetic wave from the tapered end of the anechoic chamber.
