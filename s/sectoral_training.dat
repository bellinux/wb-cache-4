30|$|Another {{important}} {{development has}} been the programmatic and evaluation work on <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> programs for the disadvantaged. In these programs, intermediaries bring together workers, training providers (which {{may or may not}} be community colleges) and employers who pay well and have job openings in high-demand sectors such as health care and IT (Conway et al., 2012). By developing detailed knowledge of these sectors and of employer needs, the intermediaries make sure that workers receive the training and have the characteristics that the employers will value, thus raising the probabilities that the workers will be hired after completing the training and be well-compensated.|$|E
30|$|For instance, {{as many as}} 30 {{states have}} {{implemented}} workforce development systems that are at least partially sectoral in nature {{in the past several}} years (Center for Best Practices, 2009; Edelman et al, 2011). In these states, partnerships have been developed between workforce agencies, employer associations in high-demand/high-paying industries, and training providers to develop <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> programs on a large scale. Those who operate these systems rely heavily on available data on labor market developments and openings to guide their planning. Challenges remain in many cases, especially for providing sustainable sources of funding, but at least the ambition and scale of these efforts is noteworthy.|$|E
30|$|The {{limitations}} of this approach are fairly clear. Whether our best models can be replicated and brought to appropriate scale remains uncertain. As noted above, labor demand can shift {{in ways that are}} not well anticipated, and workers {{need to be able to}} move across sectors of the economy when this occurs. The appropriate balance between general and specific occupational or <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> needs to be found. Opportunities for students to gain occupational training must also not discourage them from obtaining higher education; in other words, career and technical education in the U.S. must become more of a complement, and less of a substitute, for postsecondary training 41.|$|E

The key perspective is on the effects of the growing complexity and highly dynamic nature of corporate structures, production and labour processes. Four different questions are investigated: What is the role of knowledge in value chain restructuring? What is the impact of value chain restructuring on the use and management of knowledge in the organisation? What is the impact on the required skills of the employees involved in restructuring? What are the effects on internal labour markets and on regional or <b>sectoral</b> vocational <b>training</b> structures?

40|$|The {{insurance}} {{sector in}} South Africa is currently {{governed by the}} requirements of the South African Qualifications Act (Act No. 58 of 1995), which delegates it to the Insurance SETA (INSETA), an appointed <b>Sectoral,</b> Education and <b>Training</b> Authority (SETA), In the past, most insurance-related training and development centred on insurance process training, and although the workplace requirements have not changed, {{the requirements of the}} qualifications have. This has potentially led to tension in the industry, in that the INSETA is arguably designing standards and qualifications along behaviourist lines. This research report confirms whether or not this situation is the case. It also looks at the way the developers of the assessment tools for the unit standards and qualifications have potentially altered their methods of practice or alternatively, adopted a different philosophical stance to comply with INSETA requirements. Triangulated research was conducted using a defined set of respondents from a local perspective. The findings showed that no one respondent clearly displayed a particular philosophical standpoint and that, in every case, his or her assessment tool development methodology was in line with INSETA required practice...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{public sector}} {{is a crucial}} role-player {{to ensure that the}} development of all sectors of a country is efficient and sustainable. This is especially true for a developing country such as South Africa that needs to address macro socio-economic challenges such as poverty and unemployment. The Senior Management Staff (SMS) in the public sector have a pivotal role to ensure that the public sector is managed effectively. The reason for this qualitative study was to identify the standards that key management practices should comply with, to benchmark the applied practices of the Department of Labour (DoL) and <b>Sectoral</b> Education and <b>Training</b> Authorities (SETAS) against these standards and to recommend guidelines of how these practices could be improved. In addition the improvement of management practices would advance the implementation of strategies and policies and service delivery in the public sector. The guidelines proposed, based on the identified weaknesses should also improve the degree of compliance of the management practices. The improvement in compliance should thus ensure a more effective public sector, which delivers a better service to all citizens and contribute effectively to the sustainable socio-economic growth and development in South Africa...|$|R

As a result of the behaviour of individual banks, <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> providers and state-guided training institutions, the creation of a pool of highly skilled labour with higher levels of individual motivation varies between the countries. This research shows how by cooperating at both the sectoral and the national level companies can reduce the problem of free riders and benefit from a general improvement in the quality of available labour. However, this problem has been more successfully managed in France and Germany than in the UK...|$|E

A number of new WIOA provisions appear to be based squarely on rigorous evidence of proven and promising strategies, such as incentivizing the development of <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> partnerships with Workforce Innovation Funds and Sector Partnerships National Emergency Grants and requiring active coordination across agencies in developing training priorities and strategies to help meet employer needs for middle-skill workers. In addition, WIOA grants states more flexibility to transfer funding between Adult and Dislocated Worker programs, which will enable states to spend more on the Adult programs that produce higher returns on average and to support a more equitable distribution of training opportunities in the economy, as disadvantaged adults {{are less likely to}} be offered training on the job from employers. The implementation of WIOA should also draw on the compelling arguments and evidence for beginning training earlier for youth (in secondary schooling) through approaches that blend vocational and on-the-job training and involve employers as partners in delivering the training...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the two-year {{findings of a}} rigorous random assignment evaluation of the WorkAdvance model, a <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> and advancement initiative. Launched in 2011, WorkAd-vance goes beyond the previous generation of employment programs by introducing demand-driven skills training and a focus on jobs that have career pathways. The model is heavily influenced by the positive findings from the Sectoral Employment Impact Study (SEIS) completed in 2010. A major component of the WorkAdvance model, {{in common with the}} programs studied in the SEIS, is formal training offering industry-recognized certifications, reflecting the hypothesis that skills acquisition is necessary for advancement. The model also requires providers to be far more employer-facing than traditional training programs, taking into account multiple employers' changing skill requirements, employee assessment practices, and personnel needs. This report presents the imple-mentation, cost, participation, and two-year economic impacts of WorkAdvance. The economic results are based on unemployment insurance earnings records and a second-year follow-up survey. The WorkAdvance program operations and evaluation are funded through the federal Social Innovation Fund (SIF), a public-private partnership administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service. This SIF project is led by the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and the NYC Center for Economic Opportunity in collaboration with MDRC. Key Findings¬ïAll providers translated the WorkAdvance model into a set of concrete services, but it took time¬ó more than a year for some components and providers [...] and a substantial amount of tech-nical assistance and support. As a result, at some sites, later study enrollees were more likely than earlier ones to experience a fully implemented and "mature" WorkAdvance program. ¬ïOverall, WorkAdvance resulted in very large increases in participation in every category of services, as well as in training completion and credential acquisition, compared with what would have happened {{in the absence of the}} program. Expenditures for the operation of WorkAdvance fell between $ 5, 200 and $ 6, 700 per participant at the four providers delivering the program. ¬ïWorkAdvance providers increased earnings, with variation in results that closely matched the providers' experience in running sector-based programs and the extent to which the services they offered were demand driven. The most experienced sectoral provider, Per Scholas, had large and consistent impacts on both primary and secondary outcomes. Madison Strategies Group and Towards Employment, providers new to <b>sectoral</b> <b>training,</b> had promising but less consistent results that grew stronger for later enrollees. One provider, St. Nicks Alliance, did not produce positive impacts. The results did not differ dramatically across subgroups, though en-couragingly, WorkAdvance was able to increase earnings among the long-term unemployed. The evaluation as a whole provides important information for workforce development providers interested in pursuing a sector strategy. The analysis considers the role played by providers' sector-specific training and preparation and the role played by the nature of the sectors themselves. Future priorities that emerge from the results are (1) understanding how to help the more disadvantaged access the programs and (2) learning how to build service capacity, given how complex the model is to run...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} review of the {{literature}} on skills shortages in South Africa. It is demonstrated that different Government departments have different views concerning the definition of skills shortages. This is largely due to the omission in any official government literature of tying the concept of ‚Äúskills shortages‚Äù to productivity. There is also a complex and frequently overlapping institutional architecture that undermines the effective administration of skills development. An important example of this is that the link between providing skills training and accrediting individuals with a qualification that acknowledges this training is very poorly administered, highlighting poor coordination between the Department of Labour and Department of Education. Among <b>Sectoral</b> Education and <b>Training</b> Authorities (SETAs), there is also under-performance on their mandate to provide skills training for the unemployed ‚Äì an activity that is flagged in this review simply because of the strong public good nature to this activity and the fact that only SETAs are institutionally empowered to effect this change. A variety of policy recommendations are made with respect to both closed- and open-economy solutions to skills shortages. A key point is that immigration legislation must be relaxed in order to help solve the pervasive skills constraints in South Africa. South Africa: skills, training, education, SETAs...|$|R
40|$|Job {{satisfaction}} is no luxury: {{it is an}} integral part of human resource policy and considerably affects productivity. But because of certain sectoral specificities, the relationship between job satisfaction and training varies significantly across sectors. These specificities may relate to factors such as working practices in the sector, the principal forms of technology deployed in the production process, and social and cultural norms. These may all affect the relationship between worker and employer in any given sector, which has implications for the relationship between job satisfaction and training. The latest in Cedefop's series of studies on the benefits of vocational education and training discusses how this factor varies among sectors and contains evidence of spillover effects among workplaces within a sector in industrial clusters. Such clusters usually develop around high value-added activities, which require firms to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce. To do so, firms have to adopt advanced human resource practices. When individual firms are not able to sustain the high level of training necessary, firms must cooperate and pool resources. Just such joint training efforts make it less likely that trained workers will join other firms. The case studies collected in this report also show that public investment in training, catering to the specific needs of these high value-added firms, can be very effective in inducing firms and stakeholders to work together, generating high spillover effects across entire industrial clusters. The evidence collected by Cedefop argues for integrating VET in regional and <b>sectoral</b> growth strategies. <b>Training</b> institutions may then act as catalysts for the further development of industrial clusters. Smart growth in Europe would directly benefit from such integrated economic policies...|$|R
40|$|Magister Artium (Human Ecology) - MA(HE) A theory-based {{evaluation}} {{has been}} conducted with an improvement-orientated purpose on the Social Auxiliary Worker (SAW) Training Programme for an accredited provider to improve and continue to implement their own SAW Training Programmes. Theory-driven evaluations are essential for distinguishing between the validity of programme implementation and the validity of programme theory. Addressing the social needs of communities through social development and transformation is a top priority for the South African Government. South Africa faces a shortage of Social Work Practitioners (SWPs) due to emigration, as well as insufficient numbers of university graduates. This shortage has left the current SWPs with severe workload pressures. The South African Department of Social Development (DSD) initiated, in 2004, the training of Social Auxiliary Workers (SAWs) to serve as assistants to the SWPs. The SAW qualification initiative has been developed as a course accredited with the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) at the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) level 4. Providers of SAW training courses are accredited by the Health and Welfare <b>Sectoral</b> Education and <b>Training</b> Authority (HWSETA) and by the South African Council for Social Services Professions (SACSSP). The empirical {{part of the study}} was conducted in two stages. The first stage consisted of a clarificatory evaluation, wherein a step-by-step logical participatory process was followed for the clarification and development of the programme theory. This process resulted in logic models and a theory-of-change model against which the evaluation questions for the study were developed. These questions assessed the need for the SAW training programme - and for the SAW training programme planning and design. It was found that there was a need for SAW training programmes and that the SAW training programme had been designed to address this need. The second stage consisted of an implementation evaluation. This was done by means of a data matrix using the evaluation aspects for each of the objectives developed during the clarificatory evaluation. Data gathering was done by means of content analysis, focus group workshops and questionnaires. Data interpretations, conclusions and judgements were made with regard to each of the objectives and consolidated in a table format which indicated the outputs and outcomes, implementation results- and a judgement and recommendation for each objective. It was found that a standardised and structured process was followed most of the time, but that the knowledge and skills training elements, particularly in their practical application, left room for improvement. The study illustrates the advantages of a theory-based evaluation that assists with programme planning and modification, knowledge development and the planning of evaluation studies...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. This {{study was}} driven by a need that was {{identified}} within a <b>sectoral</b> <b>training</b> authority in South Africa to modify its talent management strategy {{in order to better}} deliver on its mandate. The need to modify its talent management strategy was identified {{as a result of a}} review of the Sector Education and Training Authorities (Setas) on their functioning and management commissioned by The National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). The aim was to identify critical challenges affecting their ability to deliver on their mandate and to develop recommendations to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness The review exercise was completed and report submitted to the office of the presidency. The report notes that due to the largely negative publicity Setas have received, their ability to source, attract and retain talent for effective and efficient functioning is severely restricted. It also highlights the fact that high attrition rates have resulted in a lack of institutional knowledge and understanding of the purpose of the skills development legislation and policies. It further recommends that an audit of current Seta human resources procedures be conducted, as well as the development of standard competency profiles for senior managers to inform recruitment, performance management, training and development, assessment of current capacity and the development of a generic induction programme. It concludes by recommending the implementation of various interventions to support Seta management, including executive coaching, mentoring and other organisational development support. This study was therefore focused on two parts: the development of a broad talent framework based on the latest literature on the subject of talent management, and secondly, the evaluation of the training authority's current talent management practice based on employee perceptions. The initial part of this study describes the development of a talent management evaluation with a broad talent management framework addressing the themes of planning, development and training, performance management, reward management as well as the related sub- themes. This objective was achieved by means of a literature search supported by input from industry practitioners. The questionnaire consists of 35 statements subdivided into eight categories contextualised under different talent management sub themes. The sample consisted of 44 employees, six of which were at management level and 38 were at non managerial level. Thirty-five questionnaires were returned of which three could not be used. The questionnaire was then administered to examine the perceptions of the 35 employees who provided usable feedback on the training authority‚Äüs performance, based on eight themes of talent management practices. The empirical results revealed that the training authority did not have strategies to ensure that there is a pool of talent to draw from in order to meet current and future needs. Concerns were raised on the training authority's ability to retain talented employees within the organisation. Issues relating to the creation and modification of roles and job descriptions to help individuals realise their career aspirations were raised. Employees were also concerned about the training authority's inability to provide resources for the support of individuals' career plans. Employees further raised transparency issues on expected behaviour, development and factors identifying individual's potential as major concerns. Reward and compensation were found to have a weak link to performance and market offering. Managers were found to have limited flexibility in distributing their pay budget...|$|E
