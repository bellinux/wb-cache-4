50|$|In 1908, Edison {{introduced}} Amberol Records {{which had}} a playing time of just over 4 minutes. The process of making the finished record {{was the same as}} the Gold Molded records, however a harder wax compound was used. In 1912, celluloid was used in place of wax, and the name was changed to Blue Amberol, as the dye was a blue color. The master was recorded and then the process of making the mold was the same as the Gold Molded process. What is different is that a steam jacketed mold with an air bladder in the center was used. Celluloid tubing was put in the mold and the end gate was closed. The rubber bladder expanded the celluloid {{to the side of the}} heated mold, and printed the negative record in positive on the celluloid. The bladder was then deflated, and cold air was used to <b>shrink</b> the <b>tubing</b> so the celluloid print could be removed. The printed tubing was put in a plaster filler. When the plaster was hard the cylinders were then baked in an oven, then the ribs made on the inside of the plaster with knives. The records were cleaned and then packaged.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} making heat-shrink tubing is as follows: First the {{material}} is chosen based on its properties. The material is often compounded with other additives (such as colorants, stabilizers, etc.) depending on the application. A starting tube is extruded from the raw material. Next, the tube is taken to a separate process where it is cross-linked, usually through radiation. The cross-linking creates a memory in the tube. Then the tube is heated to just above the polymer's crystalline melting point and expanded in diameter, often by placing it in a vacuum chamber. While in the expanded state it is rapidly cooled. Later, when heated (above the crystalline melting point of the material) by the end user, the <b>tubing</b> <b>shrinks</b> back to its original extruded size.|$|R

The operating temperature of these irons is not regulated directly; gas irons may change power by adjusting gas flow. Gas-powered irons may have interchangeable tips including different size soldering tips, hot knife for cutting plastics, miniature blow-torch with a hot flame, and small hot air blower for such applications as shrinking heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Heat {{guns are}} used in physics, {{materials}} science, chemistry, engineering, and other laboratory and workshop settings. Different types of heat gun operating at different temperatures and with different airflow {{can be used to}} strip paint, shrink heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> shrink film, and shrink wrap packaging, dry out damp wood, bend and weld plastic, soften adhesives, and thaw frozen pipes. Heat guns, often called hot air guns or hot air stations for this application, {{are used in}} electronics to desolder and rework surface-mounted circuit board components.Heat guns are also used for functional testing of overheat protection devices, in order to safely simulate an overheat condition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process is}} {{actually}} quite {{similar to the way}} heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> works: {{in the case of the}} tubing, it is molded in its [...] "shrunk" [...] size, cross-linked (usually by exposure to certain types of radiation, such as electron beams) to convert it to a thermoset, then re-heated and stretched. In the case of Strange Change figures, the figure is molded (in what appears to have been polyethylene), exposed to electron beams to cross-link it, coated with a long-lasting release agent to keep it from sticking to itself when compressed, then (in much the same process described above, only with power equipment) compressed into [...] "time capsule" [...] form.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Nobuo Tanaka, at the Kyoto Institute of Technology, {{prepared}} silica monoliths using a {{colloidal suspension}} synthesis (aka “sol-gel”) {{developed by a}} colleague. The process {{is different from that}} used in polymeric monoliths. Polymeric monoliths, as mentioned above, are created in situ, using a mixture of monomers and a porogen within the column tubing. Silica monoliths, on the other hand, are created in a mold, undergo a significant amount of shrinkage, and are then clad in a polymeric <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> like PEEK (polyetheretherketone) to reduce wall effects. This method limits the size of columns that can be produced to less than 15 cm long, and though standard analytical inner diameters are readily achieved, there is currently a trend in developing nanoscale capillary and prep scale silica monoliths.|$|E
50|$|A {{heat gun}} {{comprises}} {{a source of}} heat, usually an electrically heated element, but sometimes a gas flame; a mechanism to move the hot air such as an electric fan, unless gas pressure is sufficient; a nozzle to direct the air, which may be a simple tube pointing in one direction, or specially shaped for purposes such as concentrating the heat on a small area or thawing a pipe but not the wall behind; a housing to contain the components and keep the operator safe; a mechanism to switch it on and off such as a trigger; a handle; and a built-in or external stand if the gun {{is to be used}} hands-free. Although not called such, a hair dryer is a form of low-temperature heat gun. Gas-powered soldering irons sometimes have interchangeable hot air blower tips to produce a very narrow stream of hot air suitable for working with surface-mount devices and shrinking heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Low smoke zero halogen cable {{considerably}} {{reduces the}} amount of toxic and corrosive gas emitted during combustion. When burned, a low-smoke zero halogen cable emits a less optically dense smoke that releases at a lower rate. During a fire, a low-smoke cable is desirable because it reduces the amount and density of the smoke, which makes exiting a space easier for occupants as well as increases the safety of firefighting operations. This type of material is typically used in poorly ventilated areas such as aircraft, rail cars, tanks, subsea and offshore installations, submarines or ships. It is also used extensively in the rail industry, wherever high voltage or track signal wires must be run into and through underground tunnel systems. The nuclear industry is another area where LSZH cables have been and {{will be used in}} the future. Major cable manufacturers have been producing LSZH cables for nuclear facilities since the early 1990s. Construction of new nuclear plants will almost certainly involve extensive use of LSZH cable. This will reduce the chance of toxic gasses accumulating in those areas where personnel are working and the lack of corrosive gasses where there are computer controlled systems will reduce the possibility of wires being damaged by fire resulting in a short circuit fault.. Since the 1970s, the wire and cable industry has been using low-smoke, low-halogen materials in a number of applications. The introduction of a thermoplastic LSZH extended its use to accessories such as heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> labelling and fixtures. The objective was to create a wire and cable jacketing system that was not only flame retardant but also did not generate dense, obscuring smoke and less toxic or corrosive gases. In the military field its introduction was accelerated after 1982 following the dense black smoke emitted from HMS Sheffield after being hit by an exocet missile in Falkland’s war. Several fires, such as the King’s Cross fire in London that killed 31 people in London’s underground in 1987, increased the awareness of the contribution that wire and cable jacketing makes in a fire. As a result there has been an increased use of LSZH cables. With an increase in {{the amount of}} cable found in residential, commercial and industrial applications in recent years, there is a greater fuel load {{in the event of a}} fire and LSZH systems have a major role to play in protecting the public.|$|E

40|$|Heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of thermocouple wires through a compressor's casing feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the compressor casings. The thermocouple wires need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a disconnect strip inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after thermocouple wires bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. <b>Shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the thermocouple wires from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) type "T" thermocouple wires for each feedthrough. Use <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel tube sleeve with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b> Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various wire types, wire gauges, and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications {{require the use of}} high temperature superconductors (HTS) such as (RE=Rare Earth) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO) coated conductors [1]. HTS conductors show particularly great potential for high field magnets applications [1] due to their high upper critical fields [2], But several groups have shown that REBCO coated conductors are prone to delamination failure [3] [4] [5]. Under relatively low transverse stress the HTS film separates from the substrate and the conductor degrades [6]. This is problematic due to high transverse stresses that occur in fully epoxy impregnated solenoids wound with this conductor. Application of thin walled heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> introduces a weak plane around the conductor, preventing delamination degradation [7]. However, manual application of the <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> is impractical, requiring three operators limited to insulating 100 m lengths or less of REBCO conductor. The high risk of damage to the conductor, also associated with this process, shows the need for a mechanized process. Strict guidelines for the capabilities of the mechanized process were set: a single operator must have the capability to insulate continuous 200 m lengths of REBCO conductor with a minimum insulation rate of 50 m per work day. This thesis presents the ideation, prototyping, and construction of such a mechanized insulation process. Results of prototyping yielded an insulation rate of 100 m per work day with two operators, and the capacity to insulate 130 m of REBCO conductor [8]. Local critical current test indicated that no damage is caused to the tape from the insulation process [9]. A final mechanized Shrink Tube Insulation Apparatus (STIA) was developed, increasing the conductor length capacity to 450 m and reducing the number of operators to one. Due to unforeseen motor and tape tension issues, modifications to STIA were required, which increased the number of operators to two. Through a collaborative effort between the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) and the Kyushu University in Japan, a continuous 200 m length of Fujikora-produced REBCO conductor was provided, to be insulated by STIA. An insulation rate of 100 m per work day was achieved with two operators. In the latter of the paper, current work to rectify the issues causing the need for two operators is presented...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a low-cost, PDMS-membrane {{micropump}} with two one-way ball check-valves for lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic applications. The micropump consists of two functional PDMS layers, one holding the ball check-valves and an actuating chamber, and the other covering the chamber and holding a miniature permanent magnet on top for actuation. An additional PDMS layer is used to cover the top magnet, and thereby encapsulate the entire device. A simple approach was used to assemble a high-performance ball check-valve using a micropipette and heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b> The micropump can be driven by an external magnetic force provided by another permanent magnet or an integrated coil. In the first driving scheme, a small do motor (6 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length) with a neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet embedded in its shaft was used to actuate the membrane-mounted magnet. This driving method yielded a large pumping rate with very low power consumption. A maximum pumping rate of 774 μ L min(- 1) for deionized water was achieved at the input power of 13 mW, the highest pumping rate {{reported in the literature}} for micropumps at such power consumptions.

40|$|A direct cardiac {{compression}} (DCC) {{device is}} an active sleeve that is surgically placed around the heart to help the failing heart to pump without contacting blood. Soft robotic techniques enable fabrication of a conformable DCC device containing modular actuators oriented in a biomimetic manner that can restore the natural motion {{of the heart and}} provide tunable active assistance. In this paper we describe the fabrication of a DCC device; the optimization of pneumatic actuators, their integration into a matrix with a modulus in the range of cardiac tissue and methods to affix this device to the heart wall. Pneumatic air muscles (PAMs) were fabricated using a modified McKibben technique and four types of internal bladders; low durometer silicone tubes molded inhouse, polyester terephthalate (PET) heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> nylon medical balloons and thermoplastic urethane (TPU) balloons thermally formed in-house. Balloons were bonded to air supply lines, placed inside a braided nylon mesh with a 6. 35 mm resting diameter and bonded at one end.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this in-vitro-study was to analyse the influence of tooth resilience in correlation to the fracture strength of tooth-tooth, tooth-implant and purely implant stored four-unit zirconium-oxide bridges constructed with the LAVA® -CAD/CAM-System. The 80 dies were embedded in Paladur Clear® (Heraeus Kulzer); whereby a defined mobility of the dies was reached using heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> (3 M, type HSR) which was wrapped around the dental roots. 40 full-ceramic bridges of the same dimension were made to substitute an upper premolar and molar. The bridges were fabricated on models whose dies had different resilience. Split into four groups, the mobility of the dies was adjusted to simulate the different resilience’s around natural teeth, implants and the combination of both. The test bodies were split into four groups after having been cemented conventionally with zinc-oxide-phosphate cement (Hoffmann® Berlin) and were then stored in 0, 9 % Sodiumchloride-solution for 21 days. The bridges were then aged artificially by thermocycling. The breaking strength of the bridges was then analysed using the Zwick-machine (model Z 010 /TN 2 A, Roell®). The measured fracture strength values justify the clinical application of the LAVA® - ZrO 2 -ceramics with sufficient dimensions as a scaffolding material for tooth to tooth, tooth to implant and purely implant supported four unit bridge constructions to substitute an upper molar. The results of the fracture strength tests were analysed and described statistically with the Mann-Whitney-U-Test.

40|$|Over {{the last}} years all-ceramic crowns have gained a larger market-share than all-ceramic bridges and thus it seems that all-ceramic bridges are {{implemented}} {{with a great deal}} of caution. The purpose of this study was to show the correlation of the fracture-strength of four-unit zirconium-oxide bridges constructed with the CAD/CAM-designed LAVA-System, in a three point-bending test. Thereby special attention was placed on the different die materials and the influence of thermocycling on them. The die materials used were fibreglass-enforced resins (DC-Tell,Firm DCS), LAVA-Zirconiumoxide-ceramics (3 M ESPE) and yellow brass. Two dies of each material were embedded in Paladur Clear (Heraeus Kulzer), whereby a defined mobility of the dies was reached by a heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> (3 M, type HSR) which was previously wrapped around the dental roots. For each group of die materials 20 bridges were cemented conventionally with zinc-oxide-phosphate cement (Hoffmann Berlin) and were then stored in 0, 9 % Sodiumchloride-solution for 21 days. Subsequently half of the bridges of each group were aged artificially through thermocycling. The results of the fracture strength test were analysed and described statistically with the t-test. The results showed that when using ceramic or metal dies, the fracture strength of the bridges were clearly higher than the bridges that were cemented on resin enforced dies. The artificial aging procedure through thermocycling had no significant influence in the case of ceramic or metal die materials, whereas it lead to a visible but not significant reduction of the fracture strength when full-ceramic bridges were cemented on fibre-enforced resin die material. In conclusion it can be noted that the fracture strength, that was detected for these ceramics, implies a clear indication for use in the cantilever region. The previous reconstruction of teeth using ceramic or brass core materials, even under constant influence of changing temperatures and fluids in the oral cavity, are clearly recommended. About the implementation of resin-based core materials, when testing these bridges clinically, no reliable conclusion can be done...|$|E
40|$|A summary {{final report}} of work {{accomplished}} is presented. Work {{was performed in}} the following areas: (1) Galileo Probe science analysis, (2) Galileo probe Atmosphere Structure Instrument, (3) Mars Pathfinder Atmosphere Structure/Meteorology instrument, (4) Mars Pathfinder data analysis, (5) Science Definition for future Mars missions, (6) Viking Lander data analysis, (7) winds in Mars atmosphere Venus atmospheric dynamics, (8) Pioneer Venus Probe data analysis, (9) Pioneer Venus anomaly analysis, (10) Discovery Venus Probe Titan probe instrument design, and (11) laboratory studies of Titan probe impact phenomena. The work has resulted in more than 10 articles published in archive journals, 2 encyclopedia articles, and many working papers. This final report is organized around the four planets on which there was activity, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Titan, with a closing section on Miscellaneous Activities. A major objective was to complete the fabrication, test, and evaluation of the atmosphere structure experiment on the Galileo probe, and to receive, analyze and interpret data received from the spacecraft. The instrument was launched on April 14, 1989. Calibration data were taken for all experiment sensors. The data were analyzed, fitted with algorithms, and summarized in a calibration report for use in analyzing and interpreting data returned from Jupiter's atmosphere. The sensors included were the primary science pressure, temperature and acceleration sensors, and the supporting engineering temperature sensors. Computer programs were written to decode the Experiment Data Record and convert the digital numbers to physical quantities, i. e., temperatures, pressures, and accelerations. The project office agreed to obtain telemetry of checkout data from the probe. Work to extend programs written for use on the Pioneer Venus project included: (1) massive heat shield ablation leading to important mass loss during entry; and (2) rapid planet rotation, which introduced terms of motion not needed on Venus. When the Galileo Probe encountered Jupiter, analysis and interpretation of data commenced. The early contributions of the experiment were to define (1) {{the basic structure of}} the deep atmosphere, (2) the stability of the atmosphere, (3) the upper atmospheric profiles of density, pressure, and temperature. The next major task in the Galileo Probe project was to refine, verify and extend the analysis of the data. It was the verified, and corrected data, which indicated a dry abiabatic atmosphere within measurement accuracy. Temperature in the thermosphere was measured at 900 K. Participation in the Mars atmospheric research included: (1) work as a team member of the Mars Atmosphere Working Group, (2) contribution to the Mars Exobiology Instrument workshop, (3) asssistance in planning the Mars global network and (4) assitance in planning the Soviet-French Mars mission in 1994. This included a return to the Viking Lander parachute data to refine and improve the definition of winds between 1. 5 and 4 kilometer altitude at the two entry sites. The variability of the structure of Mars atmosphere was addressed, which is known to vary with season, latitude, hemisphere and dust loading of the atmosphere. This led to work on the Pathfinder project. The probe had a deployable meteorology mast that had three temperature sensors, and a wind sensor {{at the tip of the}} mast. Work on the Titan atmospheric probe was also accomplished. This included developing an experiment proposal to the European Space Agency (ESA), which was not selected. However, as an advisor in the design and preparation of the selected experiment the researcher interacted with scientist on the Huygens Probe Atmosphere Structure Experiment. The researcher also participated in the planning for the Venus Chemical Probe. The science objectives of the probe were to resolve unanswered questions concerning the minor species chemistry of Venus' atmosphere that control cloud formation, greenhouse effectiveness, and the thermal structure. The researcher also reviewed problems with the Pioneer Venus Probe, that caused anomalies which occurred on the Probes at and below 12. 5 km level of the Venus' atmosphere. He convened and participated in a workshop that concluded the most likely hardware cause was insulation failure in the electrical harness outside the Probes' pressure vessels. It was discovered that the <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> material failed at 600 K. This failure could explain the anomalies experienced by the probes. The descent data of the Pioneer probes, and the Soviet Vega Lander was analyzed to evaluate the presence of small scale gravity waves in and below the Venus cloud layer...|$|E
