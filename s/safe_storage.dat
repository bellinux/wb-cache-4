5|$|Using {{actinides}} {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed radioactive sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There {{is a challenge to}} develop stable and durable actinide-bearing materials, which provide <b>safe</b> <b>storage,</b> use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} {{plans of the}} Hanford Site for the <b>safe</b> interim <b>storage</b> of fissile materials. Currently, spent nuclear fuels reside in storage basins that have leaked {{in the past and}} are projected to leak in the future. Other problems in the basins include; sludge from decomposition, degraded cladding of fuel elements, and construction defects which make the basins seismically unsafe. This management plan describes the time and cost that it will take to implement a <b>safe</b> interim <b>storage</b> plan for the fissile materials...|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July 1789, the city of Paris {{was in a state}} of alarm. The partisans of the Third Estate in France, now under the control of the Bourgeois Militia of Paris (soon to become Revolutionary France's National Guard), had earlier stormed the Hôtel des Invalides without meeting {{significant}} opposition. Their intention had been to gather the weapons held there (29,000 to 32,000 muskets, but without powder or shot). The commandant at the Invalides had in the previous few days taken the precaution of transferring 250 barrels of gunpowder to the Bastille for <b>safer</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|R

50|$|With the {{cancellation}} of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, more nuclear waste is being loaded into sealed metal casks filled with inert gas. Many of these casks will be stored in coastal or lakeside regions where a salt air environment exists, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is studying how such dry casks perform in salt environments. Some hope that the casks {{can be used for}} 100 years but cracking related to corrosion could occur in 30 years or less. Robert Alvarez, a former Department of Energy official who oversaw nuclear issues, said dry casks would provide <b>safer</b> <b>storage</b> until a permanent nuclear repository was built and loaded, a process that would take decades.|$|R

5000|$|Chemical storage {{could offer}} high storage {{performance}} {{due to the}} strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve hydrolysis reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, ammonia borane and other boron hydrides, ammonia, and alane etc. [...] Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density. For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30 °C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0 mol/L while methanol has a density of 49.5 mol H2/L methanol and saturated dimethyl ether at 30 °C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1 mol H2/L dimethyl ether. These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, <b>safer</b> <b>storage</b> tanks.|$|R

25|$|In 1954 AECL {{partnered with}} the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario to build Canada's first {{nuclear power plant}} at Rolphton, Ontario, which is 30km {{upstream}} from Chalk River. On June 4, 1962 the NPD (Nuclear Power Demonstration) first reactor went critical to demonstrate the CANDU concept, generating about 20 MWe. In 1963, AECL established the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment (now Whiteshell Laboratories) in Pinawa, Manitoba where an organically moderated and cooled reactor was built. Later work on developing a SLOWPOKE reactor, thorium fuel cycle, and a proposal for <b>safe</b> <b>storage</b> of radioactive waste were carried out at this site.|$|E
25|$|Between December 1976 and January 1977, {{the power}} barge was towed {{back to the}} United States, {{sustaining}} storm-related damage so severe {{that it had to}} divert to the Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, North Carolina, and undergo temporary structural repairs. Following repairs, the Sturgis was towed to Fort Belvoir, arriving in March 1977. Fuel was removed from the reactor at Fort Belvoir and shipped to the Savannah River Site, and the plant was put into SAFSTOR (<b>safe</b> <b>storage),</b> with decontamination and physical barriers to prevent release of radioactivity. The Sturgis was then moored in the James River outside Fort Eustis, Virginia and became part of the James River Reserve Fleet.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear power {{involves}} substantial accident risks (e.g., Fukushima nuclear disaster, Chernobyl disaster) and the unsolved {{problem of}} safe long-term {{high-level radioactive waste}} management, and {{carbon capture and storage}} has rather limited <b>safe</b> <b>storage</b> potentials. These constraints have also led to an interest in 100% renewable energy. A well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade, evaluating scenarios for 100% renewable energy for various geographical areas. In recent years, more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources. The incentive to use 100% renewable energy is created by global warming and ecological as well as economic concerns, post peak oil.|$|E
