25|$|Saint Helena has a 10/3.6 Mbit/s Internet link via Intelsat 707 {{provided}} by Sure. Serving {{a population of}} more than 4,000, this single <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> is considered inadequate in terms of bandwidth.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{satellite}} ground stations owned by individuals began appearing, and some found the live feed. Satellite dish owners began to document their sightings in technical journals, giving viewers knowledge {{of things they}} were not meant to see. Carson and his production staff grew concerned about this and pressured NBC into ceasing the satellite transmissions of the live taping in the early 1980s. The <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> was replaced by microwave transmission until the show's editing facilities were moved to Burbank.|$|E
40|$|The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{protocol}} is studied {{from the}} standpoint of determining what limitations, if any, exist in using it over <b>satellite</b> <b>links.</b> It is concluded that, while there is nothing intrinsic about ATM that would generally preclude its use over <b>satellite</b> <b>links,</b> there are, however, several intrinsic characteristics of <b>satellite</b> <b>links,</b> as well as some satellite system configuration-specific issues, that must be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the network architecture of an Asiawide satellite Internet that considers the situations in developing regions. The design considerations for the architecture are costs, {{effective use of}} satellite bandwidth, scalability, and routing strategy when combined with terrestrial links. The architecture includes using one-way shared <b>satellite</b> <b>links</b> to reduce costs, IP multicast to leverage the broadcast nature of <b>satellite</b> <b>links,</b> QoS, audio-video application gateway {{to adapt to the}} limited bandwidth of <b>satellite</b> <b>links.</b> This architecture is implemented in an operational network testbed connecting 13 countries and supporting a distance learning project...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to periodic software upgrades {{and the introduction}} of new radar-absorbent materials across the fleet, the B-2 has had several major upgrades to its avionics and combat systems. For battlefield communications, both Link-16 and a high frequency <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> have been installed, compatibility with various new munitions has been undertaken, and the AN/APQ-181 radar's operational frequency was shifted in order to avoid interference with other operator's equipment. The arrays of the upgraded radar features were entirely replaced to make the AN/APQ-181 into an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrestrial}} carrier is an OFDM QPSK signal, {{cousin to}} WiMax and LTE, with {{the particular feature}} {{that more than one}} transmitter operates on the same frequency, forming a single frequency network. A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> budget for decoding the core audio content.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth C. Griffin {{was born}} in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida. In high school, he excelled academically while also being the {{president}} of his math club. In 1986, Griffin started to invest during his freshman year at Harvard University after reading a Forbes magazine article. During his second year at Harvard, he started a hedge fund focused on convertible bond arbitrage. The fund was capitalized with $265,000 from friends and family, including money from his grandmother. He installed a <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> to his dorm to acquire real-time market data. The investment strategy helped preserve capital during {{the stock market crash}} of 1987. Griffin's early success enabled him to launch a second fund, and between the two funds he was managing just over $1million. Griffin graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a degree in economics.|$|E

30|$|PEP for <b>Satellite</b> <b>Links</b> (PEPsal) [50] is a known {{implementation}} for TCP acceleration {{over high}} latency links, {{but it is}} implemented as a single component.

2500|$|Each Predator air vehicle can be {{disassembled}} {{into six}} main components and loaded into a container nicknamed [...] "the coffin." [...] This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station {{and it is}} designed to roll into a C-130 Hercules. The Predator primary <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The <b>satellite</b> <b>link</b> provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40meters (5,000 by 125ft) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.|$|E

Piers Morgan told Steel, [...] "We have seen a lot of children on our show over the past three series and I have never heard any of them sing as well as you do". [...] Kelly Brook was in tears and called her performance, [...] "beautiful and lovely". Media reports at the time claimed that Steel had referred to Cowell as a bully for critical comments he made after her first appearance on the show; however, a blog at a Lancashire newspaper's web site that was attributed to Steel and her mother denied that she had ever made such a comment. Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series. [...] Over thirteen million viewers watched Steel's performance and, within one day of a video of her performance being posted on YouTube, over a million viewers had seen her worldwide.
