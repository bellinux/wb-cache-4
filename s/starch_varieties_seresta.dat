30|$|The great {{tendency}} to hydrolyse gelatinized starches V 66 and V 69 was {{probably due to}} their higher water solubility {{in agreement with the}} data of Doué et al. (2013).

So, the great hydrolysed starches, reported in this study such as V 66 and V 69 could serve as suitable materials in the above cited industries.

The fact that cassava attained the greatest leap in production and the area harvested and one of the highest yield improvement among the world’s major food crops in the last 30 years suggests the great potential of cassava for future as well. In a worldwide comparison among the three major root crops, i. e. potato, sweet potato and cassava, cassava is now the first in total area harvested, production (calorie basis) and yield (calorie basis). In the last 30 years, the area planted with potato and sweet potato actually decreased and the yield mostly stagnated. In contrast, during the same period, cassava production more than doubled in Africa and Asia, in the former mainly due to the increase in area and in the latter, very dominantly due to the improvement in yield.

The results of light transmittance (%) of pastes of native and acid-thinned pinhão starches was higher (lower tendency to retrogradation) than that obtained for corn starches after similar storage period. Native pinhão starch (NPS) presented lower syneresis than native corn starch (NCS) when submitted to freeze-thaw cycles. The acid hydrolysis increased the syneresis of the two native varieties under storage at 5 ºC and after freezing and thawing cycles. The solubility of NPS was lower than that of native corn starch at 25, 50, and 70 ºC.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Food Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013. Acha starch was {{isolated}} and purified from clean and milled acha grain. Functional, thermal and physicochemical properties of acha starch were analysed using appropriate methods. Wheat starch {{was used as}} the reference standard. Acha bread from acha grain was baked and the consumer sensory acceptability was evaluated and white wheat bread {{was used as the}} reference standard. The effect of baking, boiling, steaming and microwaving on the starch and glycemic properties of the acha starch was evaluated. With regard to thermal properties, gelatinisation temperature of acha and iburu starches typifies that of waxy starch. Acha starch has similar retrogradation temperature profiles as that of wheat. There were however significant differences in some of the functional properties (pasting and turbidity) and physico-chemical properties (in vitro starch digestibility), but {{no significant difference in the}} texture profile analysis (TPA) and water binding capacity (WBC). WBC of both acha varieties was higher than that for wheat starch. Due to its high break down viscosity, white acha starch can be included in foods that are subjected to high temperature processing. This indicates that both acha <b>starch</b> <b>varieties</b> can be used for hot and cold desserts as well as for soft jelly like sweets and confectionery toppings. A prescreening exercise using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), Xanthan gum, yeast and acha starch as the variables was successful in concluding a recipe which rendered acha bread with the optimum specific loaf volume for both white and black acha bread. The optimum recipe consisted 8. 0 % acha starch, 2. 0 % xanthan gum, 2. 0 % CMC and 1. 0 % yeast. The majority of the consumer panellists found the crust colour, taste and aroma to be moderately desirable. This implies that most consumers find acha bread to have the potential to be marketed as wheat free bread. The different processing methods baking, boiling, microwaving and steaming, affected the black and white acha starch hydrolysis. The amount of starch hydrolysed for the different processing methods was in the following order: baking > boiling > microwaving > steaming. It can thus be concluded that different processing methods affects the micro structure and physical properties of the acha and wheat samples which thus influence their starch hydrolysis. The equilibrium percentage of starch hydrolysed after 180 min incubation was affected differently for the various starches, black acha, white acha and wheat starch by the different processing methods and times. In the case of baking black acha starch and wheat bread were affected similarly. However, this was not the case for microwaving, steaming and boiling, where both acha <b>starch</b> <b>varieties</b> and wheat <b>starch</b> were affected in the same way.

The high robustness {{of the native}} starches (V 64 and V 4) and the gelatinized starches (V 4) face to enzymes attack reminds us of {{a new type of}} starches called resistant starch type II (RS II). These kind of starches are, in an uncooked state, naturally resistant to enzymes attack. As far as gelatinized starches are concerned, V 4 could be classified as RS III or IV which are formed through retrogradation of higher amylose <b>starch</b> <b>variety</b> such they are no longer well recognised by alpha-amylases thus less hydrolysed. The relatively high amylose content of V 4 (25.31 %) compared with this of the other starches (amylose content ranged from about 16 to 20 %) as verified by Doué et al. (2014), enable us to corroborate the above assertion. It was previously reported that resistant starches are healthy diets. By providing low water-holding capacity thereby aiding processing, RS which could also be labelled as “dietary fibres” are used to enhance the organoleptic qualities of food as ingredients for the fibre fortification of low-calorie products (Croghan 1998). Also, resistant starch consumption offers a controlled rate of blood glucose as compare to highly-processed carbohydrates. Although research on the benefits of resistant starches are recent, it has been already reported that they have potential physiological benefits for diabetics (Nugent 2005).|$|R

SV 2, a tannin-free variety with white pericarp, gave a white <b>starch.</b> <b>Varieties</b> having red or white pericarp and higher polyphenol levels gave pink starches. Hunter colour values (L, a, b) of starches {{were not correlated with}} grain polyphenol content. Grain appearance in terms of pericarp colour, or presence or absence of pigmented testa, did not relate to the intense pink colouration of sorghum starches. Starch amylose content was significantly negatively correlated (γ = - 0. 88, p < 0. 001) to grain floury endosperm texture. Sorghum starches had higher peak viscosity (PV) in pasting than commercial maize starch. The time taken to reach peak viscosity from the initial viscosity rise was less for sorghum starches than maize starch. However, sorghum starches had a higher rate of shear thinning (Rst) than maize starch. There was a significant positive correlation between grain polyphenol content and starch PV (γ = 0. 75, p < 0. 05). Starch gel hardness was negatively correlated to pasting properties of Rst and paste breakdown (γ = - 0. 78 and - 0. 77 respectively) at p < 0. 01. Peak gelatinisation temperature (Tp) occurred over a narrow range from 66 to 69 °C. Tp was negatively correlated to the floury endosperm portion of the grain (γ = - 0. 77) at p < 0. 01.

The stabilizing capacity of seven different intact starch granules for making oil-in-water emulsions has been the topic of this screening study. The starches were from quinoa; rice; maize; waxy varieties of rice, maize, and barley; and high-amylose maize. The starches were studied in their native state, heat treated, and modified by octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). The effect of varying the continuous phase, both with and without salt in a phosphate buffer, was also studied. Quinoa, which had the smallest granule size, had the best capacity to stabilize oil drops, especially when the granules had been hydrophobically modified by heat treatment or by OSA. The average drop diameter (d 32) in these emulsions varied from 270 to 50 μm, where decreasing drop size and less aggregation was promoted by high starch concentration and absence of salt in the system. Of all the <b>starch</b> <b>varieties</b> studied, quinoa had the best overall emulsifying capacity, and OSA modified quinoa starch in particular. Although {{the size of the}} drops was relatively large, the drops themselves were in many instances extremely stable. In the cases where the system could stabilize droplets, even when they were so large that they were visible to the naked eye, they remained stable and the measured droplet sizes after 2 years of storage were essentially unchanged from the initial droplet size. This somewhat surprising result has been attributed to the thickness of the adsorbed starch layer providing steric stabilization.

The shortcoming of both varieties is their rather low root starch contents compared to the local commercial <b>starch</b> <b>variety,</b> Black Twig. In the pipeline are two new clones: one with potential as a table variety, having low root cyanide content and showing suitability for making oil-fried crisps, a popular snack; the other, having a higher root yield than Black Twig while having a similar starch content. Agronomy research has given attention to: (a) reduction of production costs, (b) maximization of profits, and (c) expansion of cassava production into marginal areas. Strategies to reduce costs include the use of machines in field operations to reduce labor requirements, especially for planting and harvesting; development of a computer software package to diagnose major nutrient insufficiencies and to recommend fertilizer rates instead of using blanket fertilizer rates; decreasing the fertilizer recommendations and frequency of application when growing the early variety MM 92 on drained peat. In order to maximize profits, intercropping with sweet corn and the recycling of starch factory solid wastes as a supplementary fertilizer are advocated.

Several studies have been focused on the description of the RS fractions from different <b>starch</b> <b>varieties,</b> but little {{attention has been paid to}} the digestion process itself that, from the present work, seems to play a key role in the generation of enzyme-RS (ERS), as determined in vitro. High-amylose starch samples, extruded at two different processing conditions, have been characterized at different stages of in vitro digestion using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), infrared spectroscopy (FF-IR), solid state C- 13 NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Control samples kept for 18 h in the digestion solution without starch hydrolyzing enzymes (alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase) were used for comparison purposes. An increase in molecular order was favored by the hydrolytic action of the enzymes, reflected in an increase in double helical order observed by NMR, higher crystallinity measured by XRD, and corresponding changes in FT-IR spectra. An increase in the intensity of the scattering objects was also observed by SAXS as a function of digestion. SAXS from the dry ERS fractions reveals the 001 reflection of crystallites formed during the digestion process, corresponding to a characteristic dimension of the resistant crystalline fraction of similar to 5 nm. The changes found suggest that enzyme resistant starch does not refer to a specific structure present in predigested starches, but may in fact be formed during the digestion process through the rearrangement of amylose chains into enzyme-resistant structures of higher crystallinity. Therefore, the resistance to enzyme digestion of a specific processed starch is the result of a competition between the kinetics of enzyme hydrolysis and the kinetics of amylose retrogradation. © 2008, American Chemical Societ...|$|R

Because all currently available varieties of food barley are of spring growth habit, {{the first phase}} of the research involved agronomic assessment of these varieties under Oregon conditions. Because winter barley usually yields more than spring barley in these environments, the second phase of this research involved development of winter habit food barley germplasm. Grain β-glucan content is the most important attribute for food barley varieties. This trait is important because of the cholesterol-reducing properties of β-glucan. Thirty three cultivars and advanced lines reported to vary in β-glucan content were grown in 2006 and 2007 at two locations in northeastern Oregon under dryland cropping conditions. Seed yield, test weight, percentage of plump kernels, grain β-glucan and grain protein were measured on replicated samples from the four environments. Hulled, waxy <b>starch</b> <b>varieties</b> appear to have the greatest agronomic potential for dryland production as they combine high yield potential and grain β-glucan percentage. Marker assisted selection was used to rapidly develop barley germplasm with novel combinations of alleles at loci controlling starch synthesis and growth habit. The target loci were WAX, VRN-H 1, and VRN-H 2. The goal was to develop waxy starch, high grain β-glucan, and winter habit germplasm. Pre-screening of candidate parental lines identified combinations with target vrn-H 1 (winter) alleles. This allowed for immediate fixation of favorable alleles at this locus. VRN-H 1 is coincident with a major low temperature tolerance QTL (Fr 1). Perfect markers were based on functional domains in GBSSI and ZCCT-H, the genes determining wax and VRN-H 2. Because spring growth habit at VRN-H 2 is due to gene deletion, codominant alleles at a tightly linked locus (HvSNF 2), were also used. Backcross-derived germplasm was genotyped in two stages. Homozygotes at the two loci were identified in one-step screening in the progeny of the double cross. BC 1 F 3 and DCF 3 lines were advanced to field testing in the Fall of 2007.

Results showed that amylose contents (9. 1 % to 44. 7 %) and total phosphorus contents (0. 022 % to 0. 068 %) varied among normal, waxy, and high amylose barley starches. 31 P-NMR analysis showed that phosphorus in barley starches was mainly from phospholipids. All the barley <b>starch</b> <b>varieties</b> had short branch chain lengths and displayed a substantially reduced proportion of chains at DP 18 [...] 21. Waxy barley (W. B. Merlin) amylopectin had the longest detectable chain length of DP 67, whereas normal barley (glacier), high amylose glacier and high amylose hull-less glacier amylopectins had the longest detectable chain length of DP 82, 79, and 78, respectively;Different soy protein isolate samples were used to study the effect of protein conditions on mechanical properties and water absorption property after compression molding process. Results showed that all the soy protein isolate samples {{used in this study}} had good processability by compression molding. But properties of molded soy protein specimens varied among soy protein samples. The specimens made from the protein isolate samples with less denaturation and pH close to isoelectric point gave better dry and wet mechanical properties and low water absorption property. Physical properties of soy protein isolate samples could affect the properties of molded specimen counterparts;Rapid viscosity analysis showed the effect of addition of soy protein on pasting properties of different starches. The viscosity profiles varied among different starches and different soy protein concentrations. Potato starch and the interaction between potato starch and soy proteins were significantly affected by salt in the mixture of starch and protein. Soy protein could form helical complex with amylose through hydrophobic interactions, which retarded the swelling of starch granules. Protein could interact with phospholipids in starch and facilitated granule swelling. Decreased pasting temperature was observed in the mixture of normal maize starch and soy proteins. Pasting temperatures of waxy maize and potato starches were increased after soy proteins were added;The three studies showed that structures of both starch and soy protein affected their properties and applications in food and non-food systems...|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} of granular starch {{has been}} used to study the structure and the physicochemical properties of the granules. It depends, among others, on the starch botanic source, on the enzymatic system used and {{on the size of the}} granules. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of granule size on enzymatic susceptibility and on structural and physicochemical properties of Peruvian Carrot starch. <b>Starches</b> from two <b>varieties</b> (Amarela de Carandaí, AC and Amarela de Senador Amaral, ASA) were isoladed, fractionated by size and classified into whole granules (without separation); large granules (d 20 æm); medium granules (> 10 e < 20 æm) and small granules (£ 10 æm). The whole and fractionated granular starches were hydrolysed with bacterial -amylase and fungal amyloglucosidase. Samples, before and after hydrolysis, were analyzed regarding their structural and physicochemical characteristics. The whole and fractionated native starches shown in optical microscope and scanning electron microscope circular shape for large granules and polygonal shape for small granules. The granular surface was smooth with some had openings, especially for the larges granules, with some depressions and holes. From chromatograms of gel permeation in Sepharose CL- 2 B was not possible to observe differences on the molecular size from both varieties of Peruvian Carrot. The amylose content, that was higher to AC variety, was concentraded mainly in large granules. Both varieties exhibited B-type X-ray diffraction pattern and relative degree of cristallinity (DC) (~ 20 %) was not different for the different starches, despite the intensity of the peaks decrease for small granules. The intrinsic viscosity of <b>starches</b> from both <b>varieties</b> was smallest 24 % and 14 %, respectively, to small granules in relation of large granules.

All current US barley varieties with high β-glucan are spring habit and have waxy <b>starch.</b> Winter <b>varieties</b> have agronomic advantages but require low-temperature tolerance (LTT). Vernalization sensitivity (VS) is associated with higher levels of LTT. To rapidly develop fall-sown varieties with LTT and higher grain β-glucan, we therefore used marker-assisted selection (MAS) at the WX and VRN-H 2 loci. The MAS-derived lines, together with unrelated non-waxy germplasm developed via phenotypic selection (PS), were used for a genome-wide association scan (GWAS). The panel was phenotyped for grain β-glucan, LTT and VS. It was genotyped with 3072 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and allele-specific primers. Marker-assisted selection fixed target alleles at both loci but only one of the target phenotypes (higher β-glucan percentage) was achieved. Variation for VS and LTT is attributable to (i) incomplete information about VRN-H 1 {{at the outset of the}} project and (ii) unexpected allelic variation at VRN-H 3 with a large effect on VS and LTT...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the recent trend in cassava area, production and yield during 1993 - 96 revealed an impressive increase in Tamil Nadu, which is the predominant state where cassava is grown as an industrial crop. Its present yield of 29 t/ha is {{the highest in the}} world. Even though the overall national trend in cassava area and production is declining, India's current average yield of 21 t/ha is also the world's highest. In India, cassava breeding is mainly carried out at CTCRI in Thiruvananthapuram and at its regional centre at Bhubaneswar. The All India Co-ordinated Research Project on Tuber Crops, with eleven centres in the country, is also engaged in cassava improvement in a limited way. The Tamil Nadu centre has recently identified a high yielding short duration variety, H- 1 19, while the Assam centre has identified two varieties, i. e. H- 165 and Sree Prakash, suitable for the region. The co-ordinating centres in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, along with the CTCRI regional centre at Bhubaneswar, have been evaluating the promising exotic germplasm received from the Thai-CIAT program. High root yields of more than 35 t/ha were recorded for some of the CIAT selections, i. e. CMR 33 - 67, CMR 36 - 32, SM 2077 and SM 2090. Attention is currently being given to the development of early maturing, good cooking quality varieties, which can be harvested at sixth months, so that they can effectively be utilized in cassava-rice double cropping systems as practised in Kerala. Three short-duration indigenous clones, i. e. CI- 649, CI- 731 and CI- 732, were identified, which are now in the pre-release stage. These varieties are also included in the initial evaluation trial of the All India Co-ordinated Research Project on Tuber Crops. Breeding efforts are also focused on developing high yielding, high <b>starch</b> <b>varieties</b> for areas like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. A unique approach in this direction is the production of "triploids". The triploids, possessing high yield combined with high starch recovery, hold much promise to become popular in regions like Salem district of Tamil Nadu, where the crop is grown for the starch industry. A triploid, 2 / 14, has already been proposed for release under the name 'Sree Harsha' by the State Varietal Release Committee. Studies are also in progress on the possibility of using sexual seed for the rapid propagation and spread of cassava. Results indicate that even unselected first clonal progenies of promising parents have a comparable root yield and dry matter production capacity as those of the high yielding released varieties of cassava. Cassava mosaic disease is still posing great problems in germplasm conservation. Use of a nursery technique with three noded cuttings coupled with thorough screening and roguing of CMD affected plants in the nursery and field was effective in the recovery and quicker multiplication of symptom-free plants...|$|R
40|$|Starch is {{a mixture}} of two polysaccharides, amylose (AM) and amylopectin, which occurs {{naturally}} in the form of microscopic granules that are abundantly found in tubers, roots, cereal grains and fruits. In order to bring out their functional properties as thickeners and texture enhancers, starch granules are often disrupted by heating in excess water. This process, which is referred to as gelatinisation, causes the granules to swell and exude a fraction of the starch polysaccharides, resulting in a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the starch suspension. Surfactants are known to affect the different aspects of the gelatinisation process and, in particular, the swelling properties of starch. Surfactants are also known to form helical inclusion complexes with AM, the formation of which {{plays an important role in}} many of the instances in which starch and surfactants interact. This work was carried out in order to gain insight into how the surfactant structure (head group and chain length) influences the swelling properties of starch and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. The investigations involved the study of the temperature-induced gelatinisation of starch in the presence of surfactants as well as studies on the association of surfactants to AM in solution and the solubility of the resulting AM-surfactant complexes. Information on the extent of granule swelling upon heating was indirectly obtained by means of viscometry while insight on the molecular events taking place during gelatinisation was sought by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Viscometric studies revealed that, with the exception of the cationic surfactants (alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromides), short-chain (C 10, C 12) surfactants induce an early swelling (swelling at lower temperatures than the control sample) in normal wheat starch granules, whereas their longer chain counterparts (C 14, C 16) have the opposite effect. Contrary to this finding, the effect of surfactants on the swelling of waxy wheat starch granules, an AM-free <b>starch</b> <b>variety,</b> is not influenced by the surfactant chain length but by the head group charge of the surfactant. The enhancing/restricting effect of surfactants on the swelling of normal wheat starch is not correlated to their effect on the early aspects of gelatinisation (onset of the gelatinisation transition) but is, in most cases, associated with the dissociation temperature of AM-surfactant complexes formed simultaneously as the granules gelatinise. CLSM studies revealed that, compared to a longer-chain surfactant (C 16), a short-chain (C 12) surfactant has the ability to penetrate further into the granule matrix during gelatinisation, which may favour its availability for interacting with different starch granule components during gelatinisation. Studies on the interactions between AM and surfactants with different chain length (C 12 vs. C 16) and head group (sodium sulphates vs. maltosides) revealed that the presence of a charged head group favours the water solubility of the resulting AM-surfactant complexes. However, this effect can be counteracted by the effect of the surfactant chain length: an increase in the chain length (C 12 vs. C 16) decreases the solubility of the complex. QC 2010091...|$|R

Evaluation of potential cassava mutants was needed to learn their growth and performance in two different agro ecologies, which were acid upland and optimum upland, in order to select adaptive mutants. Cuttings from sixteen mutants and three parent lines (UJ- 5 (V 3), Adira- 4 (V 4), and Malang- 4 (V 5)) were planted in two different locations which were Technical Implementation Unit Field Tenjo, Bogor (pH 4, 8; 57 m asl) and Cikabayan Experimental field IPB, Dramaga, Bogor (pH 5, 6; 200 m asl).

So, the presence of plasticizer could overcome {{the fragility of the}} film, with a commonly used slurry of 15 - 40 /g of glycerol in 100 g of starch. The properties of starch films can be further improved by producing composite films with incorporation of functional additives. Thus, in this present study, starch-based films have been strengthened with addition of a plasticizer (glycerol), an emulsifier (soy lecithin) and a preservative (potassium sorbate).

This research aims to modify three variety of white cornstarch (Local Canggal, Srikandi, Pulut) through oxidation and acetylation-oxidation, {{in order to improve}} its gelatinization properties. Modification of oxidation process is carried out using sodium hipoclorite. Acetylation-oxidation is a process of oxidation followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride at slightly alkaline conditions. Furthermore, conventional-maize-starch is used to compare the results of these treatments. The results show that Pulut white cornstarch has lower gelatinization temperature than Srikandi and local Cangal varieties. Oxidized and acetylated-oxidized starches have: (1) gelatinization temperature, (2) peak viscosity and (3) retrogradation lower than conventional-maize-starch. Low retrogradation is caused by stabilizer effect that retard syneresis (freeze thaw stability). Oxidized and acetylated-oxidized of maize-starches produce gel that more hardness than conventional-maize-starch, even in waxy and non-waxy starches...|$|R
