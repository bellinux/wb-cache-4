50|$|County Bridge No. 101 is a {{historic}} stone arch bridge located in Valley Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. It spans Brandywine Creek. It has four <b>stilted</b> <b>arch</b> spans, each of which are 40-feet long. The bridge was constructed in 1918.|$|E
50|$|The Johnson County Courthouse is a {{good example}} of the Italianate style of architecture. The <b>stilted</b> <b>arch</b> window {{openings}} with pronounced keystones and the consoles on cornices are characteristics of this style. Bricks for the courthouse were made from clay soil mined from a location just south of the Buffalo City Park. Kilns at the foot of the Big Horn Mountains provided the lime for the mortar.|$|E
50|$|The church {{consists}} of a Romanesque chancel and nave, a Gothic tower and a more recent porch, all built in red brick. The chancel has lesenes on the east corners and a sloping base. The east gable's lower wall is engraved with crosses and emblems. There is a Romanesque window at {{the centre of the}} gable while a <b>stilted</b> <b>arch</b> freize with saw-toothed courses decorates the gable at the lower roof level. A round-arched door {{on the south side of}} the nave is also topped with an arched freize. The door on the north side has been bricked in. Several round-arched windows have survived. In the Late-Gothic period, a six-sectioned vault was added to the chancel while two cross-vaults covered the nave. The tower, also a Late-Gothic addition, is the same width as the nave and has a pyramidal spire. Rather drastic repairs were carried out by Hans Jørgen Holm in 1891-93.|$|E
50|$|Brooks {{tended to}} use <b>stilted</b> <b>arches,</b> and {{employed}} a distinctive type of lierne vault in his chancel, {{in which the}} vaults themselves were brick and the ribs stone.|$|R
50|$|The square Founders' Chapel (Capela do Fundador) {{was built}} between 1426 and 1434 by the {{architect}} Huguet on orders of King John I {{to become the}} first royal pantheon in Portugal. It gives a perfect synthesis between Flamboyant Gothic and the English Perpendicular style, as Philippa of Lancaster had brought along a few English architects. The chapel consists of three notional bays and a central octagon buttressed by eight piers, adorned with crockets, supporting deeply <b>stilted</b> <b>arches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Eidgah for Eid congregating was a {{platform}} measuring 148 feet by 137 feet in size raised {{from the surrounding}} land by 4-6 feet. It was oblong in plan, with thick brick walls enclosing the courtyard on all side except east. The 15-foot high west wall, the only surviving part of it, has a 5-foot deep four -centred and <b>stilted</b> <b>arched</b> semi-octagonal Mihrab with an inscription on top. It was decorated with multi-cusped arch and flanked by shallow subsidiary niches, three on each side.|$|R
50|$|The rectangular, brick City Building stands {{two stories}} tall, {{and is an}} example of eclectic {{influences}} on Victorian architecture. The building is adjacent to the Fox River (to the west) with its main entrance on the east side at 15 N. Riverside Avenue. The roof is hipped and features a bell tower on the southeastern side, capped with a Byzantine roof. Several shed dormer windows break through the main roof. The soffit is decorated with wood brackets. The front is split into three bays; the middle bay extends beyond the roof to create a large pediment. This dormer allows for an attic. The main set of double doors is beneath a <b>stilted</b> <b>arch.</b> Rectangular, double hung windows on the first floor are also beneath stilted arches, with two large windows north of the entrance and a large door (originally for fire engines) on the south. The second floor has symmetrical pairs of windows {{on either side of the}} main bay, with three smaller windows on the center bay. On the interior, a straight staircase leads to the second floor, splitting two large rooms on the first floor. The second floor is similarly split into two rooms, with two small rooms above the entrance.|$|E
50|$|The corner {{building}} is a two storey Federation Filigree style structure. The highly decorative parapet has five large pediments featuring <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> with columns and decorative stucco along with balustrade and columns. The {{corner of the building}} parapet has the remains of a dome inscribed with the name The P&O Hotel in decorative stucco. The top of the dome has been removed. Both storeys feature large multi-paned windows with stucco architraves. The High Street and Mouat Street frontage features a bull nose veranda with extensive iron lacework and a truncated corner main entrance.|$|R
50|$|The Green House has {{first and}} second floor verandahs with narrow timber columns, <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> between the columns, {{decorative}} capitals, and timber balusters. There are also verandahs to both levels on the rear, northern elevation. Windows located on both the {{first and second}} levels are elongated with twelve to sixteen panes of glass in the frame, fairly typical of the Anglo-Dutch elements that are evident {{in the design of the}} building. A staircase is located in the eastern elevation of the building. The Green House is joined to Montpelier, and a door, accessed from the joined ground level verandahs of the buildings, provides an entry to both Montpelier and the Green House.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first floor}} loggia has <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> of {{contrasting}} brickwork with columns, pilasters, keystones and other cement rendered elements. The {{remainder of the}} facade is relieved with contrasting cement rendered dressings, sills, string courses, pilasters, entablature and pediment. The Waghorn Street facade includes a first floor verandah with a balustrade and valance in a sunflower pattern which was common in Victoria on boom era houses and hotels and was registered as pattern no:VIC 444 by J Cochrane & G Scott 17 November 1887. At the rear, the [...] "back of house" [...] functions are expressed on {{the exterior of the}} building to Waghorn Street by a step in the parapet and the change in window treatment.|$|R
25|$|The {{decoration}} {{within the}} palace {{comes from the}} last great period of Andalusian art in Granada, with little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abbasid architecture. Artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed {{over the course of}} the Nasrid Dynasty using elements created and developed during the centuries of Muslim rule on the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of these, as well as innovations such as <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Columns and muqarnas appear in several chambers, and the interiors of numerous palaces are decorated with arabesques and calligraphy. The arabesques of the interior are ascribed to, among other sultans, Yusuf I, Muhammed V, and Ismail I, Sultan of Granada.|$|R
50|$|The {{decoration}} {{within the}} palaces {{comes from the}} last great period of Andalusian art in Granada. With little of the Byzantine influence of contemporary Abassid architecture, artists endlessly reproduced the same forms and trends, creating a new style that developed {{over the course of}} the Nasrid Dynasty. The Nasrids used freely all the stylistic elements that had been created and developed during eight centuries of Muslim rule in the Peninsula, including the Caliphate horseshoe arch, the Almohad sebka (a grid of rhombuses), the Almoravid palm, and unique combinations of them, as well as innovations such as <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> and muqarnas (stalactite ceiling decorations). Structurally, the design is simple and does not evince significant innovation. While artistically pleasing it was until the reconquest structurally ad hoc and reliant on the skills of subject artisans and workers.|$|R
50|$|The {{church of}} St Mary at Mount Naranco (Iglesia de Santa María del Naranco; Ilesia de Santa María'l Narancu) is a Roman Catholic Asturian pre-Romanesque Asturian {{architecture}} {{church on the}} slope of Mount Naranco situated 3 km from Oviedo, northern Spain. Ramiro I of Asturias ordered it to be built as a royal palace {{as part of a}} larger complex that also incorporated the nearby church of San Miguel de Lillo, 100 meters away. It was completed in 848. Its structural features, such as the barrel vault — with transverse ribs corresponding one-to-one with contraforts at the exterior, make it a clear precursor of the Romanesque construction. The exterior decorations, as well as the use of <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> mark the intended verticality of the composition. It was converted into a church at the end of the 13th century.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Design== The {{aqueduct}} {{consists of}} a single <b>stilted</b> segmental <b>arch,</b> mainly constructed of limestone ashlar masonry, although some repairs have been made with engineering bricks. On {{both sides of the}} structure there is a rectangular moulded panel, but no evidence that it ever carried an inscription. It has been a grade II listed structure since 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} is a textbook {{example of the}} Italianate style. [...] The house features rusticated stone quoins, paired elongated brachetted eaves, <b>stilted</b> segmented <b>arched</b> windows, and a square-cut bay on the south side. It originally had a full width front porch, which has subsequently been removed. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Camp Curtin Fire Station is a {{historic}} fire station located at Harrisburg, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1910, and is a two-story, rectangular brick building, measuring 38 by 46 ft. The building exhibits Italianate style design features. It features a square wooden bell tower {{at the center of}} the front facade. The tower has a hipped, shingled roof and four <b>stilted</b> segmental <b>arches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Poppleton {{used part}} of the three-story {{building}} to house his law firm but never actually worked there himself. The rest was leased out as office and commercial space. Over the years it continued to be used primarily for commercial purposes, and today it is still utilized as office space. The building includes heavily bracketed cornices and window openings that featuring a combination of round, segmental and <b>stilted</b> segmental <b>arches.</b> There are cast iron storefronts on the building, as well.|$|R
50|$|The Capt. Sylvester Baxter House is a {{historic}} house at 156 Main Street in Barnstable, Massachusetts. The 2-1/2 story wood frame Italianate house was built c. 1855 by Captain Sylvester Baxter, a politically prominent local ship's captain. The house exterior has been stuccoed, and the roof is a cross-gable style with a square cupola on top. The eaves of the roof and cupola are studded with decorative brackets. The windows are topped by <b>stilted</b> segmented <b>arches.</b> The front entrance is sheltered by a hip-roofed porch supported by clusters of round columns.|$|R
6000|$|... § XXXV. Nor are the {{original}} {{features of the}} rest of the edifice altogether indecipherable; the entire series of shafts marked in the ground plan on each side of the nave, from the western entrance to the apse, are nearly uninjured; and I believe the <b>stilted</b> <b>arches</b> they sustain are those of {{the original}} fabric, though the masonry is covered by the Renaissance stucco mouldings. Their capitals, for a wonder, are left bare, and appear to have sustained no farther injury than has resulted from the insertion of a large brass chandelier into each of their abaci, each chandelier carrying a sublime wax candle two inches thick, fastened with wire to the wall above. The due arrangement of these appendages, previous to festal days, can only be effected from a ladder set against the angle of the abacus; and ten minutes before I wrote this sentence, I had the privilege of watching the candlelighter at his work, knocking his ladder about the heads of the capitals as if they had given him personal offence. He at last succeeded in breaking away one of the lamps altogether, with a bit of the marble of the abacus; the whole falling in ruin to the pavement, and causing much consultation and clamor among a tribe of beggars who were assisting the sacristan with their wisdom respecting the festal arrangements.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the other}} {{considerable}} public building of Washington, called the Smithsonian Institution, I {{have said that}} its style was bastard Gothic; by this I mean that its main attributes are Gothic, but that liberties have been taken with it, which, whether they may injure its beauty or no, certainly are subversive of architectural purity. It is built of red stone, and is not ugly in itself. There is a very nice Norman porch to it, and little bits of Lombard Gothic have been well copied from Cologne. But windows have been fitted in with <b>stilted</b> <b>arches,</b> of which the stilts seem to crack and bend, so narrow are they and so high. And then the towers with high pinnacled roofs are a mistake--unless indeed they be needed {{to give to the}} whole structure that name of Romanesque which it has assumed. The building is used for museums and lectures, and was given to the city by one James Smithsonian, an Englishman. I cannot say that the City of Washington seems to be grateful, for all to whom I spoke on the subject hinted that the Institution was a failure. It is to be remarked that nobody in Washington is proud of Washington, or of anything in it. If the Smithsonian Institution were at New York or at Boston, one would have a different story to tell.|$|R
5000|$|Fondaco dei Turchi {{was built}} as a private palace for the wealthy Pesaro family and, like the other palazzi along the Grand Canal, was {{designed}} to facilitate business, with its long arcade stretching along the main waterway. It {{was one of the}} most imposing buildings in Venice during the late Medieval period, and was used by the Senate to accommodate visiting dignitaries. It was later leased to Turkish traders, hence its name. Although heavily restored during the 19th century, the building demonstrates typical features of Venetian Romanesque: the <b>stilted,</b> round-topped <b>arches</b> of the arcade, the pavilions at each end of the building, the upper gallery, the crenellations and patera, marble roundels or foliate ornaments applied to the exterior walls.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} entrance at {{the corner}} of Limestone and Ellenborough streets is symmetrically framed by identical breakfronts projecting toward the street alignment and between which the stairs to the foyer level are contained. The entrance comprises pairs of five panel timber doors under round arched fanlights accentuated by contrasting brick voussoirs, cement rendered label moulds and imposts and pedimented, bracketed string coursing to each street frontage. The ground floor fenestration comprises <b>stilted</b> round <b>arched</b> windows with five light fanlights and double hung sashes with light coloured brickwork voussoirs and cement rendered label moulds and imposts. The first floor fenestration comprises segmental headed double hung windows with five light sashes accentuated with dichromatic brickwork arches, cement rendered label moulds and imposts and contrasting brick string coursing at sill height The entablature which is punctuated with pairs of cement rendered eaves brackets bears the words DIAMOND 1897 JUBILEE TECHNICAL COLLEGE MEMORIAL in raised lettering to the frieze {{along the length of the}} two facades from the north east corner of the building to the south west.|$|R
