5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow. The frontal bones are slightly rounded and bear a prominent <b>sagittal</b> crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E

The frontal bones are inflated and bear a prominent <b>sagittal</b> crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is poorly developed. The middle part of the palate is flat, not concave as in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis. At the palate's back margin is a short, thick posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior <b>sagittal</b> sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the <b>sagittal</b> crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat has {{a robust}} skull and its rostrum is square with an {{ordinary}} nasal slit. The zygomatic arches are very slender and the braincase is smooth, turned upwards. The <b>sagittal</b> crest is not present, while the lambdoid crest is well developed. Most of the projecting {{point of the}} skull {{is made up of}} exoccipital condyles. The basisphenoid is wide and deep and the tympanic bullae are relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurid skulls {{had many}} unique characteristics, {{including}} fused parietal bones with a prominent <b>sagittal</b> crest, which ran longitudinally along the <b>sagittal</b> suture and separated the two supratemporal fenestrae on the skull roof. Behind these fenestrae, tyrannosaurids had a characteristically tall nuchal crest, which also {{arose from the}} parietals but ran along a transverse plane rather than longitudinally. The nuchal crest was especially well-developed in Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Alioramus. Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus had tall crests {{in front of the}} eyes on the lacrimal bones, while Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus had extremely thickened postorbital bones forming crescent-shaped crests behind the eyes. Alioramus had a row of six bony crests on top of its snout, arising from the nasal bones; lower crests have been reported on some specimens of Daspletosaurus and Tarbosaurus, as well as the more basal tyrannosauroid Appalachiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a <b>sagittal</b> keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed <b>sagittal</b> crest (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed <b>sagittal</b> crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} largerâ€”possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its <b>sagittal</b> crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E
5|$|Sexual dichromatism (different {{coloration}} patterns {{between males}} and females) {{can be seen in}} most brown lemur species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of sexual dimorphism is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger <b>sagittal</b> crest (a ridge of bone {{on the top of the}} skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than 20percent larger than females.|$|E
5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's <b>sagittal</b> crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, {{as shown by the}} larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.|$|E
5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} <b>sagittal</b> crest and short, wide postorbital {{processes}} (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauridae is uncontroversially {{divided into}} two subfamilies. Albertosaurinae {{comprises}} the North American genera Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus, while Tyrannosaurinae includes Daspletosaurus, Teratophoneus, Bistahieversor, Tarbosaurus, Nanuqsaurus, Zhuchengtyrannus, and Tyrannosaurus itself. Some authors include the species Gorgosaurus libratus in the genus Albertosaurus and Tarbosaurus bataar in the genus Tyrannosaurus, while others prefer to retain Gorgosaurus and Tarbosaurus as separate genera. Albertosaurines are characterized by more slender builds, lower skulls, and proportionately longer tibiae than tyrannosaurines. In tyrannosaurines, the <b>sagittal</b> crest on the parietals continues forward onto the frontals. Some authors, such as George Olshevsky and Tracy Ford, have created finer subdivisions or tribes for various combinations of tyrannosaurs within the subfamilies. However, these have not been phylogenetically defined, and usually consisted of genera that are now considered synonymous with other genera or species.|$|E
5|$|Baryonyx had a {{rudimentary}} secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests {{the presence of}} a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a <b>sagittal</b> crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.|$|E
5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the {{morphology}} of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the <b>sagittal</b> crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf. In the Puma lineage, the cheetah's skull morphology {{is similar to that of}} the pumaboth have short, wide skullswhile that of the jaguarundi is different.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} to that of Madagascan Paratriaenops, but the premaxilla is longer. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is {{well-developed}} and contains a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in Paratriaenops; the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow. Compared to other species of Triaenops, the rostrum is relatively narrow and short, similar to T.parvus; T.afer and T.persicus have a broader rostrum. The front margin of the rostrum is cast back between the left and right corners. A transverse line passes over the roof of the rostrum. The infraorbital foramen, an opening in the skull, is oblong in shape. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are not broadened towards the sides, are connected to the maxillaries by broad bones, and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In T.menamena, these crests are rectangular in form and larger than in Paratriaenops. The braincase is lower than in other species of Triaenops. The <b>sagittal</b> crest, which is on the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed. In the mandible, the coronoid process is blunt and rounded, but the angular process (both processes at the back of the bone) is small.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} sinuses {{are frequently}} of unequal size, {{with the one}} formed by the superior <b>sagittal</b> sinus being the larger; they increase in size as they proceed, from back to center.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} sinuses are {{of large}} size and {{begin at the}} internal occipital protuberance; one, generally the right, being the direct continuation of the superior <b>sagittal</b> sinus, the other of the straight sinus.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation. For this purpose, the acetabular inclination and the acetabular anteversion are mesurements of cup angulation in the coronal plane and the <b>sagittal</b> plane, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Ratiu etal. and Van Horn etal. both {{concluded}} that the superior <b>sagittal</b> sinus must have remained intact, both because Harlow does not mention loss of cerebrospinal fluid through the nose, and because otherwise Gage would almost certainly have suffered fatal blood loss or air embolism.|$|E
25|$|Various other diseases, invoked as {{possible}} explanations to his early demise, included Marfan syndrome, Wilson-Turner X-linked mental retardation syndrome, FrÃ¶hlich syndrome (adiposogenital dystrophy), Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase excess syndrome {{in conjunction with}} <b>sagittal</b> craniosynostosis syndrome, Antleyâ€“Bixler syndrome or one of its variants, and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} gait, while walking at a {{constant}} speed of 4km/h {{for a few minutes}} until a steady state is reached, relative to non-scoliotic people, idiopathic scoliotic people have a frontal (i.e. coronal) pelvis, hip, and shoulder, transversal hip and <b>sagittal</b> knee motion restriction. The step length is reduced and the stance phase duration is also reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{traits of}} the Mongoloid skull are: long and broad skulls of {{intermediate}} height, arched <b>sagittal</b> contour, very wide facial contour, high face height, rounded orbital opening, narrow nasal opening, wide, flat nasal bones, sharp lower nasal margin, straight facial profile, moderate and white palate shape, 90%+ shovel-shaped incisors and large, smooth general form.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sagittal</b> {{plane is}} {{the plane that}} divides the body or an organ {{vertically}} into right and left sides. If this vertical plane runs directly {{down the middle of}} the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a parasagittal plane, or less commonly a longitudinal section.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{compounds}} in fish otoliths {{are resistant to}} digestion, they {{are found in the}} digestive tracts and scats of piscivorous marine mammals, such as dolphins, seals, sea lions and walruses. Many fish can be identified to genus and species by their <b>sagittal</b> otoliths. Otoliths can therefore, to some extent, be used to reconstruct the prey composition of marine mammal diets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sagittal</b> {{division}} reveals more morphological distinctions. The raphe nuclei form a ridge in {{the middle}} of the reticular formation, and, directly to its periphery, there is a division called the medial reticular formation. The medial RF is large and has long ascending and descending fibers, and is surrounded by the lateral reticular formation. The lateral RF is close to the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, and mostly mediates their function.|$|E
25|$|Scoliosis {{is defined}} as a {{three-dimensional}} deviation in the axis of a person's spine In the diagnostic sense, it {{is defined as}} a spinal curvature of more than 10 degrees to the right or left as the examiner faces the person, i.e. in the coronal plane. Deformity may also exist to the front or back as the examiner looks at the person from the side, i.e. in the <b>sagittal</b> plane.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. A longitudinal plane is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The coronal plane and the <b>sagittal</b> plane are examples of longitudinal planes.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo was a {{physiologist}} {{as well as}} an anatomist, {{studying the}} function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the human skull and cross-sections of the brain, transversal, <b>sagittal,</b> and frontal. These drawings may be linked to a search for the sensus communis, the locus of the human senses, which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{claim to}} have seen Bigfoot, {{describing}} it as a large, hairy, muscular, bipedal ape-like creature, roughly , covered in hair described as black, dark brown, or dark reddish. Some descriptions include details such as large eyes, a pronounced brow ridge, and a large, low-set forehead. The {{top of the head}} has been described as rounded and crested, similar to the <b>sagittal</b> crest of the male gorilla. The creature has been reported as having a strong, unpleasant smell.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sagittal</b> {{otoliths}} (sagittae) are bilaterally symmetrical, {{with each}} fish having one right and one left. Separating recovered otoliths into right and left, therefore, {{allows one to}} infer a minimum number of prey individuals ingested for a given fish species. Otolith size is also proportional to the length and weight of a fish. They can therefore be used to back-calculate prey size and biomass, useful when trying to estimate marine mammal prey consumption, and potential impacts on fish stocks.|$|E
25|$|Some hip muscles also act {{on either}} the knee joint or on {{vertebral}} joints. Additionally, because the area of origin and insertion {{of many of these}} muscles are very extensive, these muscles are often involved in several very different movements. In the hip joint, lateral and medial rotation occur along the axis of the limb; extension (also called dorsiflexion or retroversion) and flexion (anteflexion or anteversion) occur along a transverse axis; and abduction and adduction occur about a <b>sagittal</b> axis.|$|E
25|$|In CT, an X-ray tube {{opposite}} an X-ray detector (or detectors) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate {{around a}} patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram). CT is {{acquired in the}} axial plane, with coronal and <b>sagittal</b> images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.|$|E
25|$|They {{have a large}} <b>sagittal</b> crest, a bone {{running along}} {{the middle of the}} skull that is {{necessary}} for muscle attachment. They also have unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with the frontal bones elevated, and a retracted nasal incision. All of these modifications to the normal mammal skull are, of course, {{to make room for the}} proboscis. This proboscis caused a retraction of bones and cartilage in the face during the evolution of the tapir, and even caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the nasal chamber.|$|E
25|$|The abelisaurids all possess distinct, vestigial, and {{immobile}} forelimbs, {{with highly}} reduced manual phalanges. Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus {{are closely related}} but distinguish by several skeletal features. Carnotaurus has eleven dorsal vertebrae but Majungasaurus has thirteen. Carnotaurus has short dentary bones and an almost vertical ramus, while that of Majungasaurus curved backward and had notable caudal projections. Majungasaurines also have low, wide antorbital fenestrae, a wide triangular plate posterior to the parietal, two holes for a cerebral vein by the <b>sagittal</b> crest, and a wide groove on the occipital condyle. These differences are important because derived abelisaurids are classed as either majungasaurines or carnotaurines based on their synapomorphies.|$|E
