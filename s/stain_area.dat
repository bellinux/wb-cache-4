40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} effect of a whitening dentifrice (WDF) relative to a regular dentifrice (RDF) on the reduction of natural extrinsic tooth surface discoloration (ETD). The MEDLINE-PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL and EBSCO-Dentistry and Oral Sciences databases were searched, up to April 2017. The inclusion criteria were as follows:(randomized) controlled clinical trials, healthy subjects ≥ 18 years of age, studies comparing WDF with RDF, a follow-up period of at least 6 weeks and studies scoring ETD as the stain area/extent, stain intensity or a composite score. Studies using an induced staining model were excluded. Independent screening of 851 unique papers resulted in 21 eligible publications, which included 32 comparisons. The descriptive analysis illustrated that the majority of comparisons showed a significant effect on ETD, in favour of WDF over RDF. The meta-analysis substantiated this observation and revealed that the difference of means (diffM) comparing WDF and RDF was a reduction for <b>stain</b> <b>area</b> of - 0. 44 [(95 % CI: - 0. 55; - 0. 339) (P <. 00001) ] according to the original Lobene Stain Index; this result is in favour of the WDF. For the modified Lobene Stain Index, the diffM was - 0. 41 [(95 % CI: - 0. 71; - 0. 10) (P=. 009) ]. For overall stain intensity, the diffM was - 0. 35 [(95 % CI: - 0. 44; - 0. 25) (P <. 00001) ], and the composite score was - 0. 39 [(95 % CI: - 0. 57; - 0. 21) (P <. 0001) ] and - 0. 54 [(95 % CI: - 0. 66; - 0. 43) (P <. 00001) ]. Subgroup analysis differentiating between products that contained added chemical antidiscoloration agents showed a similar pattern. In this review, nearly all dentifrices that are specifically formulated for tooth whitening were shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing ETD, irrespective of whether or not a chemical discoloration agent was adde...|$|E
40|$|Expert {{witnesses}} employ bloodstain {{pattern analysis}} (BPA), to provide objective analysis of bloodstain evidence in criminal cases. This thesis {{added to the}} scientific understanding of BPA by generating and analysing a large data set of 785 horse blood experiments. The experiments produced impact velocities, u 0, of 2 : 89 ms- 1 to 6 : 54 ms- 1, with impact angles, [theta]f, 90 °, 72 °, 54 °, 36 °, and 18 °. Different surface roughnesses were investigated: conditioned and unconditioned paper, smooth steel, and three roughened steel substrates with roughness values, Ra, 1 : 6 x 10 - 6 m, 3 : 2 x 10 - 6 m, and 6 : 3 x 10 - 6 m. To analyse the data, two computational tools were developed. The first tool extracted the diameter and velocity of a droplet from high-speed videos. The second tool measured stain properties and counted spines of stains resulting from 90 ° and 72 °. The results of these experiments are investigated, extracting relationships between impact properties of droplets to stain properties. Each of the stain properties were related to some combination of a non-dimensional number (Bond number, Bo, Froude number, Fr, or Reynolds number, Re) and impact angle. It {{was found that the}} <b>stain</b> <b>area</b> and stain perimeter are proportional to Bo(sin[theta]f) - 1. The numberof spines and/or tails on a stain is dependent on Fr(sin[theta]f) 2. The major diameter is proportional to Re(sin[theta]f) 2 and conversely the minor diameter is proportional to Re(sin[theta]f) 2. The full length of the stain is proportional to Bo(sin[theta]f) - 2. The results showed that increased surface roughness, promotes increased variability in the bloodstains, up to a limit of Ra = 6 : 3 x 10 - 6 m. The roughest steel is statistically the same as paper in almost all stain properties. The results proved a need to account for surface roughness in modelling the spreading of a droplet on a substrate. Starting from the laws of conservation of energy, a new model for predicting spread factor was derived which accounts for the impact angle and substrate roughness. This model uses a coefficient based on properties from the stain and is able to predict the experimental spread factors in this thesis more accurately than the spread factor models in literature. Two new equations were derived that calculate the impact velocity and droplet diameter using only stain properties, not experimental fitting constants, making the expressions more robust...|$|E
40|$|Selectins play an {{essential}} role in most inflammatory reactions, mediating the initial leukocyte-rolling event on activated endothelium. Heparin and dermatan sulfate (DS) bind and block P- and L-selectin function in vitro. Recently, we reported that subcutaneous administration of DS inhibits colon inflammation in rats by reducing macrophage and T-cell recruitment and macrophage activation. In the present study, we examined the effect of porcine intestinal mucosa DS on renal inflammation and fibrosis in mice after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Twenty-four adult male Swiss mice weighing 20 - 25 g were divided into 4 groups: group C (N = 6) was not subjected to any surgical manipulation; group SH (N = 6) was subjected to surgical manipulation but without ureter ligation; group UUO (N = 6) was subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction and received no treatment; group UUO plus DS (N = 6) was subjected to UUO and received DS (4 mg/kg) subcutaneously daily for 14 days. An immunoblot study was also performed for TGF-&# 946;. Collagen (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 3700 µm²), MCP- 1 (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 1700 µm²), TGF-&# 946; (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 13 % of total area), macrophage (number of cells ~ 40), and myofibroblast (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 1900 µm²) levels were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in the UUO group compared to control. DS treatment significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced the content of collagen (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 700 µm²), MCP- 1 (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 160 µm²) and TGF-&# 946; (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 5 % of total area), in addition to myofibroblast (<b>stained</b> <b>area</b> ~ 190 µm²) and macrophage (number of cells ~ 32) accumulation in the obstructed kidney.

However, while being a powerful prognostic tool, immunostaining automated analysis on digital images is still not implemented worldwide in routine clinical practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Digitalized biopsy sections from two independent cohorts of patients, immunostained for membrane or nuclear markers, were quantified with two automated methods. The first was based on stained cell counting through tissue segmentation, while the second relied upon <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> proportion within tissue sections. Different steps of image preparation, such as automated tissue detection, folds exclusion and scanning magnification, were also assessed and validated. Quantification of either stained cells or the <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> {{was found to be}} correlated highly for all tested markers. Both methods were also correlated with visual scoring performed by a pathologist. For an equivalent reliability, quantification of the <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> is, however, faster and easier to fine-tune and is therefore more compatible with time constraints for prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides an incentive for the implementation of automated immunostaining analysis with a <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> method in routine laboratory practice...|$|R

40|$|Staining-type hyper{{melanosis}}, {{defined as}} blind-side melanosis occurring {{after completion of}} metamorphosis, reduces commercial value in hatchery-produced flatfishes. Detailed characterization {{was performed on the}} <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> of juvenile Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus to physiologically understand this phenomenon. From 80 to 120 days after hatching, juveniles were reared in sandy and sandless tanks. By classifying the staining degree into 7 levels, about 2 times higher occurrence of middle-level staining was reconfirmed in sandless tank (about 80 %) than in sandy tank (about 40 %). In the <b>stained</b> <b>area,</b> we found 3 types of chromatophores (melanophore, xanthophore, and iridophore) and ctenoid scales, which would be typically observed on the normal ocular side. Detailed examination on the melanophores revealed further similarity between the <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> and the normal ocular side, in terms of the distribution at 2 layers (shallower and deeper than scale), and the densities in both layers (about 1000 cells/mm 2 above scale and 200 cells/mm 2 beneath scale).

Brown rice seeds were cut crosswise near the center with a razor blade and the cut surface was stained with Oil Red O, and then observed under integrated fluorescence microscope (BZ 9000). We found wide variations among varieties in the <b>area</b> <b>stained,</b> but the japonica group contained many varieties with a large <b>stained</b> <b>area.</b> We selected 17 representative varieties covering the whole range of <b>stained</b> <b>areas</b> and confirmed the thickness of aleurone layer using Kawamoto’s film method (micro-thin sections that were created with cryomicrotome). Aleurone traits were examined under a light microscope and measured. We found a strong correlation between the area of the aleurone layer and the <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> (r = 0. 799 ***) and between the thickness of the aleurone layer and the thickness of the stained region (r = 0. 543 *). The <b>area</b> of the <b>stained</b> region therefore provides a fast and effective indicator for selecting varieties for the thickness of the aleurone layer. We also measured the amount (mg per 100 seeds) and proportion of triacylglycerols (TAGs) to 1 g of seed (mg g- 1) in brown rice seeds without embryos. The amount and proportion of TAG to 1 g of seed were both significantly correlated with the area, average thickness and percentage of aleurone layer. This suggests that the aleurone traits will be good indicators for the selection of varieties with high levels of TAG...|$|R

We recorded feed intake, {{feed conversion efficiency}} (FE), growth and survival, and measured the ratios of <b>staining</b> blind-side <b>area</b> (<b>staining</b> <b>area)</b> and ambicolored fish every 30 days. Daily feed intake (DFI), feed conversion efficiency (FE), growth rate, condition factors, and survival rate were calculated {{at the end of}} the experiment. Although the FE was higher in the high-density compared to the control, the two density groups showed similar feed intakes, growth, and survival. The ratio of <b>staining</b> <b>area</b> as well as the ratio of ambicolored fish significantly were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the control from days 30 to 60, but significantly increased and evened out by the end of the experiment (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Studies {{were made}} on {{morphological}} changes of Mycobacterium lepraemurium grown in cultures of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Two types of nonsolid or irregularly stained M. lepraemurium were observed. One type occurred in the growth phase of the organisms during the stage of preparation for bacillary multiplication. The nonsolid bacilli appeared as elongated organisms having pointed ends, isolated acid-fast dots, or faintly <b>stained</b> <b>areas</b> {{at the ends of}} the bacilli. It is possible that this irregularity in staining is due to a very gradual, versus an instantaneous, acquisition of acid-fast material during bacillary multiplication and maturation.

Under these conditions there was an emergence of organisms which showed irregularly <b>stained</b> <b>areas</b> and various forms of deformity unaccompanied by elongation or multiplication. These irregularities were most probably due to the destructive process of digestion of bacillary protoplasm.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} progression of staining-type hypermelanosis spontaneously ceased at a specific time and area in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. To examine whether time is a limiting factor in the spontaneous cessation of staining, we experimentally controlled the initiation and duration of staining by manipulating the bottom substrate condition in the fish tanks. At 151 days post hatching (DPH; 11 weeks), spontaneous cessation of staining was observed in fish reared in tanks without a sandy substrate. However, staining resumed (or was initiated) in tanks where sand was removed from 11 weeks, indicating a strong but temporary effect of bottom sand {{and the absence of}} time limitation in the staining progression by 151 DPH. Extended duration of the inhibitory period of hypermelanosis expansion (9 weeks or more) aided in only a 20 % reduction of the final <b>staining</b> <b>area</b> because of the increased rate of staining expansion.

METHODS: We analyzed the expression of SLPI using immunohistochemistry in submandibular gland samples of 36 AIDS patients [10 with normal histology, 10 with chronic nonspecific sialadenitis, eight with mycobacteriosis, and eight with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection] and 10 HIV-negative controls. The proteinase inhibitor was quantified using image analysis and expressed as % of positively <b>stained</b> <b>area.</b> RESULTS: There was a higher expression of SLPI in AIDS patients with CMV infection (% of <b>stained</b> <b>area,</b> mean +/- SD: 37. 37 +/- 14. 45) when compared with all other groups (P = 0. 009).

METHODS: Thirty patients (21 Billroth II, 9 Billroth 1) for cancer, referred to the Gastroenterology Unit for an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), were enrolled. All endoscopies were performed with a high-resolution videoendoscope with an adjustable image magnification: EG- 485 ZH (Fujinon, Omiya, Japan). During EGD three random biopsies were taken in the stomach and, after staining with MB, three targeted biopsies were taken from every <b>stained</b> <b>area.</b> RESULTS: In 28 patients traditional endoscopy showed hyperemia of the anastomosis, in 2 patients a lesion. After MB in 6 / 30 there were <b>stained</b> <b>area</b> (2 lesions seen with traditional endoscopy and 4 blue areas in other patients). As regards histology: 24 patients showed inflammation, while 2 patients with alterations in traditional endoscopy and with MB showed metaplasia and high grade dysplasia. In 4 / 30 (13. 3 %) patients MB guided biopsies showed significant lesions (3 intestinal metaplasia, 1 low grade dysplasia) while random biopsies showed only inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: After partial gastrectomy, the mucosa of the residual stomach usually undergoes severe changes, and these lesions {{are known to be}} pre-cancerous.

40|$|Objectives:To {{develop an}} in vitro model of human saphenous vein bypass to {{facilitate}} {{study of the}} early adaptive responses of venous endothelium to arterial flow conditions. Design, material and methods:Segments of human saphenous vein (with or without external polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) stents to limit circumferential and radial deformation) were mounted in a bypass circuit and subjected to pulsatile flow with oxygenated Krebs solution to simulate arterial or venous flow conditions {{for a period of}} 90 min. The viability of the vein was assessed by the tissue ATP concentration and vasomotor responses to phenylephrine, sodium nitroprusside and bradykinin (endothelium-dependent). Immunohistochemistry was used to assess both endothelial preservation (CD 31) and the expression of proteins involved in leukocyte adhesion: E-selectin, P-selectin and ICAM- 1. Freshly excised veins were used as controls. Results:The concentration of ATP was 320 ± 11 nmol/g in freshly excised vein (n = 8) and following exposure to the arterial flow circuit increased to 566 ± 60 nmol/g (n = 8, paired t-test, p = 0. 003) in unstented veins and to 421 ± 49 nmol/g (n = 8, paired t-test, p = 0. 002) in externally stented veins (with PTFE). Both endothelium-dependent and sodium nitroprusside-induced vasodilatation responses were preserved after veins were exposed to the arterial flow circuit, but the sensitivity to phenylephrine was increased: EC 50 decreasing from 9 μm to 1 μm, p = 0. 008. There was a 5 – 10 % decrease in <b>staining</b> <b>area</b> for CD 31 after veins, stented or unstented, were exposed to the arterial flow circuit. However, after exposure to the arterial flow circuit, the <b>staining</b> <b>area</b> ratio for ICAM- 1 /CD 31, which remained unchanged in externally stented veins, increased two-fold in unstented veins, p> 0. 01 : there were no changes in the <b>staining</b> <b>area</b> ratio P-selectin/CD 31 and no staining for E-selectin was observed. Conclusion:Vasomotor responses and tissue ATP concentrations indicate that the viability of saphenous vein can be maintained for up to 90 min in an ex vivo flow circuit and the CD 31 staining indicated endothelial preservation. This opens up the possibility of investigating the early changes in saphenous vein endothelium following exposure to arterial pressure, as at bypass surgery. First results suggest that there is rapid upregulation of the leukocyte adhesion molecule ICAM- 1, which can be prevented by limiting the circumferential deformation of the vein with an external PTFE stent...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of chromohysteroscopy in detecting endometrial pathologies in recurrent in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. Materials and methods Sixty-four patients in whom con-ventional hysteroscopy did not show any apparent endo-metrial pathology were included. Five milliliter of 1 % methylene blue dye was introduced through the hystero-scopic inlet. Biopsies were obtained both from dark stained and light <b>stained</b> <b>areas.</b> Results The study group was grouped according to the staining characteristics. Group I included 22 patients in whom focal dark staining was observed. Group II included 41 patients in whom diffuse light blue <b>staining</b> without dark <b>areas</b> was observed. There {{was no significant difference}} between two groups in age, smoking, body mass index, number of IVF failure and time to hysteroscopy after the last failure. But, there was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of endometritis between two groups (p= 0. 007). The power of dark staining for detection of endometritis was calculated as follows: sensitivity 69. 2 %, specificity 74 %, positive predictive value 40. 9 % and negative predictive value 90. 2 %. Conclusion Chromohysteroscopy improves {{the efficacy of}} hysteroscopy in recurrent IVF failure. Observation of diffuse light blue <b>staining</b> without dark <b>areas</b> strongly suggests a normal endometrium free of endometritis...|$|R
40|$|Several nuclear {{activities}} and components {{are concentrated in}} discrete nuclear compartments. To understand the functional significance of nuclear compartmentalization, knowledge on the spatial distribution of transcriptionally active chromatin is essential. We have examined the distribution of sites of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RPII) by labeling nascent RNA with 5 -bromouridine 5 '-triphosphate, in vitro and in vivo. Nascent RPII transcripts were found in over 100 defined areas, scattered throughout the nucleoplasm. No preferential localization was observed in either the nuclear interior or the periphery. Each transcription site may represent the activity of a single gene or, considering the number of active pre-mRNA genes in a cell, of a cluster of active genes. The relation between the distribution of nascent RPII transcripts {{and that of the}} essential splicing factor SC- 35 was investigated in double labeling experiments. Antibodies against SC- 35 recognize a number of well-defined, intensely labeled nuclear domains, in addition to labeling of more diffuse areas between these domains (Spector, D. L., X. -D. Fu, and T. Maniatis. 1991. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 10 : 3467 - 3481). We observe no correlation between intensely labeled SC- 35 domains and sites of pre-mRNA synthesis. However, many sites of RPII synthesis colocalize with weakly <b>stained</b> <b>areas.</b> This implies that contranscriptional splicing takes place in these weakly <b>stained</b> <b>areas.</b> These areas may also be sites where splicing is completed posttranscriptionally. Intensely labeled SC- 35 domains may function as sites for assembly, storage, or regeneration of splicing components, or as compartments for degradation of introns...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of different promoters {{for use in}} Indica rice transformation was compared. Plasmids encoding the Escherichia coli uidA (gus) gene {{under the control of}} CaMV 35 S, Emu, Act 1 or Ubi 1 promoters were delivered into cell suspension cultures by particle bombardment. Transient gene expression, 48 h after delivery, was greatest from plasmids utilising the constitutive promoters, Act 1 and Ubi 1. Gene expression in stably transformed tissue was examined by bombarding embryogenic Indica rice calli with a pUbil-gus plasmid and a plasmid containing either the selectable marker gene, hph, which confers hygromycin resistance, or bar, which confers resistance to the herbicide phosphinothricin (BASTA) each {{under the control of the}} CaMV 35 S, Emu, Act 1 or the Ubi 1 promoters. The bombarded calli were placed on the appropriate selection media and stained for GUS activity at 1 day, 3 weeks and 5 weeks after shooting. Callus bombarded with the pUbi 1 -hph or the pEmu-hph constructs gave a dramatic increase in the size of the GUS <b>staining</b> <b>areas</b> with time. No such increase in the size of GUS <b>staining</b> <b>areas</b> was observed in calli co-bombarded with pUbi 1 -gus and any of the bar containing constructs. Co-bombardment of calli with either the pEmu-hph or pUbi 1 -hph construct and a virus minor coat protein (cp) gene construct resulted in many fertile transgenic Indica rice plants, containing one to eight copies of both the hph and cp genes. These genes were stably inherited by the T 1 generation...|$|R
30|$|A {{significantly}} higher apoptosis rate was detected in treated tumors by immunohistological terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling <b>staining</b> (<b>area</b> fraction: control, 0.023 ± 0.015 %; therapy, 0.387 ± 0.105 %; P < 0.001). However, both 2 D reflectance imaging using Annexin Vivo (control, 13 ± 15 FI/cm 2; therapy, 11 ± 7 FI/cm 2) and gamma counting using 99 mTc-HYNIC-Annexin V (tumor-to-muscle ratio control, 5.66 ± 1.46; therapy, 6.09 ± 1.40) failed in showing higher accumulation in treated tumors. Optical tomography even indicated higher probe accumulation in controls (control, 81.3 ± 73.7 pmol/cm 3; therapy, 27.5 ± 34.7 pmol/cm 3). Vascularization was strongly reduced after therapy, demonstrated by contrast-enhanced ultrasound, optical imaging, and immunohistology.|$|R
