40|$|Background and Purpose—Previous {{studies show}} better {{outcomes}} {{for patients with}} stroke receiving care in stroke units, but many different stroke unit criteria have been published. In this study, we explored whether <b>stroke</b> <b>centers</b> fulfilling standardized Brain Attack Coalition criteria produce better patient outcomes than hospitals without <b>stroke</b> <b>centers.</b> Methods—We did an observational register–linkage study of all patients with ischemic stroke treated in Finland between 1999 and 2006. After exclusion of recurrent strokes and nonanalyzable patients, we included 61 685 consecutive patients treated in 333 hospitals classified in national audits either as Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> <b>Centers,</b> Primary <b>Stroke</b> <b>Centers,</b> or General Hospitals according to Brain Attack Coalition criteria. Primary outcome measures were case-fatality and being in institutional care 1 year after stroke. Results—Care in <b>stroke</b> <b>centers</b> was associated with lower 1 -year case-fatality and reduced institutional care compared with General Hospitals. The number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 death or institutional care at 1 year was 29 for Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> <b>Centers</b> and 40 for Primary <b>Stroke</b> <b>Centers</b> versus General Hospitals. Patients treated in <b>stroke</b> <b>centers</b> had lower mortality during the entire follow-up of up to 9 years and their median survival was increased by 1 year. Conclusions—This study shows a clear association between the level of acute stroke care and patient outcome and supports use of published criteria for primary and comprehensive <b>stroke</b> <b>centers.</b> (<b>Stroke.</b> 2010; 41 : 1102 - 1107.)

40|$|For {{the past}} 10 years, the {{organization}} of acute stroke care in the United States has moved {{in the direction of}} <b>stroke</b> <b>centers.</b> 1, 2 The concept is that <b>stroke</b> <b>centers,</b> by providing vital infrastruc-ture, expertise, protocols, and monitoring care in accordance with nationally recognized guidelines and performance expectations, provide improved care and lead to better outcomes. At present, there are 2 recognized levels of stroke centers: Primary <b>Stroke</b> <b>Centers</b> (PSCs) and Comprehensive <b>Stroke</b> <b>Centers</b> (CSCs). 3, 4 Each provides high levels of care to patients with a variety of strokes in a range of geographic and clinical settings. Several recent studies have affirmed the benefits of PSCs and CSCs in improving outcomes for admitted patients. 5 – 8 The Joint Commission and other national, regional, and state agen-cies have developed and implemented certification programs for PSCs and CSCs.

40|$|Background—Stroke is a {{major cause}} of {{disability}} and death. The Brain Attack Coalition has proposed establishment of primary and comprehensive <b>stroke</b> <b>centers</b> to provide appropriate care to stroke patients who require basic and more advanced interventions, respectively. Primary <b>stroke</b> <b>centers</b> have been designated by The Joint Commission since 2003, as well as by various states. The designation of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> <b>centers</b> (CSCs) is now being considered. To assist in this process, we propose a set of metrics and related data that CSCs should track to monitor the quality of care that they provide and to facilitate quality improvement. Methods and Results—We analyzed available guideline statements, reviews, and other literature to identify the major features that distinguish CSCs from primary <b>stroke</b> <b>centers,</b> drafted a set of metrics and related data elements to measure the key components of these aspects of stroke care, and then revised these through an iterative process to reach a consensus. We propose a set of metrics and related data elements that cover the major aspects of specialized care for patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and nontraumatic subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages at CSCs. Conclusions—The metrics that we propose are intended to provide a framework for standardized data collection at CSCs to facilitate local quality improvement efforts and to allow for analysis of pooled data from different CSCs that may lea...|$|R
