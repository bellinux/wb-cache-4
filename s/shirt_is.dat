5|$|Cooper, Truman and Brennan visit a {{veterinarian}} connected to Gerard; they find twine there {{of the type}} used to bind Laura. They believe that the bird that clawed her body {{is one of the}} animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

50|$|Vegas Vic has {{received}} new paint schemes through the years. Originally, from the '50s through the '60s, his <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> white with yellow checkered stripes. Later during an early restoration in the '70s, his <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> painted solid yellow. When he was restored in 1998 his <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> painted {{a red and}} yellow checkered pattern.|$|R

25|$|In Years 7–11, {{the only}} {{difference}} is that trousers are worn, and in Year 12 a white <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> worn.|$|E
25|$|A dress <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} ironed {{to remove}} any wrinkles and can be treated with starch for added smoothness and stiffness. There are also cotton shirts available in the market which do not require ironing.|$|E
50|$|Wide {{skirts and}} also tight and wide pants existed. Short, to the knee, <b>shirts</b> <b>were</b> worn in Nakhchivan. In Shusha, Shamakhi and other districts <b>shirts</b> <b>were</b> longer.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, a Simko {{designed}} <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> used in {{the film}} Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. The <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> designed for the store Live Fast in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Rugby <b>shirts</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} {{made out}} of cotton, but as synthetic fabrics became cheaper they have become incorporated into rugby shirts. The two most common materials are a mix between cotton and polyester (many of these <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> meant for supporter use, though {{they can be used}} in a rugby game), and pure polyester (these <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> generally designed for game use).|$|R
25|$|Authorized breast {{insignia}} {{are worn}} {{on the left}} breast of all service and dress coats. They may optionally be worn on khaki shirts when the <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> the outermost garment, utility coats or maternity work uniform coats. Miniature versions exist for evening dress jackets.|$|E
25|$|Red Shirt {{was born}} near Fort Fetterman, Wyoming. There are several {{accounts}} of Red Shirt's early life. One account is that Red <b>Shirt</b> <b>is</b> {{the son of}} a white man and a Lakota mother. Another account, by Red <b>Shirt,</b> <b>is</b> that he was {{the son of a}} great warrior chief. Will Rogers reported that Red Shirt was the son of Red Dog, a progressive headman of the Oyuhpe band who settled at Pine Ridge, South Dakota. Red Shirt and Red Dog were Lakota delegates to Washington in 1880, served as Pine Ridge Indian Police and sent their children to the Carlisle Native Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Historians agree that by 1877 Red Shirt had emerged as a leader of the Wagluhe at Pine Ridge.|$|E
25|$|The hem {{is tucked}} into the trousers. For informal- or formalwear, a coat and tie (or bow tie) are compulsory. When a tie is worn, the top button of the <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> fastened, so the tie can fit snugly around the wearer’s neck with a neat appearance.|$|E
50|$|A {{special edition}} {{play-off}} final <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> also released and worn for that match. Produced by Vandanel, the <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> all amber with limited black trim and sponsored by Kershaw.|$|R
5000|$|Some say {{the area}} was named [...] "Burnt Shirt" [...] because an old <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> used to fuel a light, while others believe a {{railroad}} man's <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> burned in an accident.|$|R
50|$|Dress <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{made from}} woven cloth, {{and are often}} accompanied by a jacket, collar sleeve, and tie, for example with a suit or formalwear, but <b>shirts</b> <b>are</b> also worn more casually.|$|R
25|$|The placket of the <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> {{the part}} that holds the buttons and the button holes. This is highly {{regarded}} as {{the focal point of}} the dress shirt when worn casually. Unfortunately due to the lack of reinforcement, the weight of the collar will cripple the placket throughout the day. No amount of starch, ironing, pressing nor does the type of fabric matter when it comes to combating the collapse.|$|E
25|$|In the bespoke (custom-made) {{industry}} where each <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> made from an individually drafted pattern, these sizing problems are avoided, {{though there are}} still different ways of making the shirt fit. While many choose to cut the sleeve long and have the cuff catch on the hand to regulate its length, some prefer the much harder option of using a high armhole and carefully tailored shape, so that the cuff can be loose and still sit in exactly the right place wherever the arm moves.|$|E

25|$|Since {{their first}} match Scotland have always played in royal blue, with a royal blue shirt, shorts and socks. In their two World Cup {{qualifying}} matches in 2007, the Scottish flag, featuring the white cross {{on a blue}} background, was on each shoulder and also on the shirt was a white collar. On {{the left of the}} <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> the Scotland badge, and on the right is the Great Britain badge which is split into four and then has the England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland rugby league badges in a shield. This is to signify Scotland's part in the Great Britain setup.|$|E
25|$|In {{international}} association football, blue is {{a common}} colour on kits, as a majority of nations wear the colours of their national flag. A notable exception is four-time FIFA World Cup winners Italy, who wear a blue kit based on the Azzuro Savoia (Savoy blue) of the royal House of Savoy which unified the Italian states. The team themselves are known as Gli Azzurri (the Blues). Another World Cup winning nation with a blue <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> France, who are known as Les Bleus (the Blues). Two neighbouring countries with two World Cup victories each, Argentina and Uruguay wear a light blue shirt, the former with white stripes. Uruguay are known as the La Celeste, Spanish for 'the sky blue one', while Argentina are known as Los Albicelestes, Spanish for 'the sky blue and whites'.|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{traditional}} shirt has long tails, extending {{almost to the}} knees at the back, and so has seven or eight buttons. The vertical strip of fabric running down the front opening is called the placket, and gives a more symmetrical appearance to the joint between the left side, on top, and the right. This left over right order is also seen in waistcoat and coat fastenings, though women's clothing buttons the other way (right over left). The buttonholes, aligned vertically, are placed on the placket, though the top button and buttons {{at the bottom of}} stiff fronts are aligned horizontally. The buttonholes {{are one of the few}} places where the difference between hand and machine stitching can be observed while the <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> being worn, and fashion designers sometimes use contrasting thread here or on the buttons themselves for extra impact.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 the <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to}} Glasgow, {{and sold to}} Kelvingrove Museum by George C. Crager, a member of Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Traveling Show. The <b>shirt</b> <b>was</b> {{displayed}} at the museum from 1892 until 1999.|$|R

This season, Lyon will have brand-new home, away, Champions League kits, which were revealed to the public on 12 July, despite the shirts leaking on 17 June. The home shirt has a white base color, with the horizontal red and blue stripe in the middle, reverting from the club's red and blue vertical stripe {{that has been used}} in previous years. The logo of Umbro appears on the top-right of the shirt in blue. The away shirt features a black and red design. The top part of the <b>shirt</b> <b>is</b> black and it fades horizontally in the middle into red. The shirt has a partly red collar, and also has red details on the black sleeves. The European kit is midnight blue with the horizontal red and blue stripe locating {{in the middle of the}} shirt.|$|E
25|$|Alston shared studio {{space with}} Henry Bannarn at 306 W. 141st Street, {{which served as}} an open space for artists, photographers, musicians, writers and the like. Other artists held studio space at 306, such as Jacob Lawrence, Addison Bate and his brother Leon. During this time Alston founded the Harlem Artists Guild with Savage and Elba Lightfoot to work towards {{equality}} in WPA art programs in New York. During {{the early years of}} 306, Alston focused on mastering portraiture. Early works such as Portrait of a Man (1929) show Alston's detailed and realistic style depicted through pastels and charcoals, inspired by the style of Winold Reiss. In his Girl in a Red Dress (1934) and The Blue Shirt (1935), he used modern and innovative techniques for his portraits of young individuals in Harlem. Blue <b>Shirt</b> <b>is</b> thought to be a portrait of Jacob Lawrence. During this time he also created Man Seated with Travel Bag (c. 1938–40), showing the seedy and bleak environment, contrasting with work like the racially charged Vaudeville (c. 1930) and its caricature style of a man in blackface.|$|E
