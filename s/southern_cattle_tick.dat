40|$|Mosquitoes and ticks are vectors {{of several}} {{diseases}} that affect both humans and animals. Control of mosquito-borne and tick-borne diseases has primarily been achieved {{with the use}} of chemical insecticides/acaricides. However, an increase in public concern about the safety of conventional synthetic compounds, along with growing insecticide/acaricide resistance, has resulted in a need to find alternatives to control ticks and mosquitoes.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{provides a}} summary of the results presented at a symposium organized to accumulate information on factors that influence the prevalence of acaricide resistance and tick-borne diseases. This symposium was part of the 19 th International Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP), held in New Orleans, LA, USA, during August 10 - 14, 2003. Populations of <b>southern</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks,</b> Boophilus microplus, from Mexico have developed resistance to many classes of acaricide including chlorinated hydrocarbons (DDT), pyrethroids, organ ophosphates, and formamidines (amitraz). Target site mutations are the most common resistance mechanism observed, but there are examples of metabolic mechanisms. In many pyrethroid resistant strains, a single target site mutation on the Na+ channel confers very high resistance (resistance ratios: > 1000 x) to both DDT and all pyrethroid acaricides. Acetylcholine esterase affinity for OPs is changed in resistant tick populations. A second mechanism of OP resistance is linked to cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase activity. A PCR-based assay to detect a specific sodium channel gene mutation that is associated with resistance to permethrin has been developed. This assay can be performed on individual ticks at any life stage with results available in a few hours. A number of Mexican strains of B. microplus with varying profiles of pesticide resistance have been genotyped using this test. Additionally, a specific metabolic esterase with permethrin-hydrolyzing activity, CzEst 9, has been purified and its gene coding region cloned. This esterase has been associated with high resistance to permethrin in one Mexican tick population. Work is continuing to clone specific acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and carboxylesterase genes that appear to be involved in resistance to organophosphates. Our ultimate goal is the design of a battery of DNA- or ELISA-based assays capable of rapidly genotyping individual ticks to obtain a comprehensive profile of their susceptibility to various pesticides. More outbreaks of clinical bovine babesisois and anaplasmosis have been associated with the presence of synthetic pyrethroid (SP) resistance when compared to OP and amidine resistance. This {{may be the result of}} differences in the temporal and geographic patterns of resistance development to the different acaricides. If acaricide resistance develops slowly, herd immunity may not be affected. The use of pesticides for the control of pests of <b>cattle</b> other than <b>ticks</b> can affect the incidence of tick resistance and tick-borne diseases. Simple analytical models of tick- and tsetse-bome diseases suggest that reducing the abundance of <b>ticks,</b> by treating <b>cattle</b> with pyrethroids for example, can have a variety of effects on tick-bome diseases. In the worst-case scenario, the models suggest that treating cattle might not only have no impact on trypanosomosis but could increase the incidence of tick-bome disease. In the best-case, treatment could reduce the incidence of both trypanosomosis and tick-bome diseases Surveys of beef and dairy properties in Queensland for which tick resistance to amitraz was known were intended to provide a clear understanding of the economic and management consequences resistance had on their properties. Farmers continued to use amitraz as the major acaricide for tick control after the diagnosis of resistance, although it was supplemented with moxidectin (dairy farms) or fluazuron, macrocyclic lactones or cypermethrin/ chlorfenvinphos.

The <b>southern</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> {{is a threat}} to the livestock industry in many locations throughout the world. Control methods include the use of chemical acaricides including amitraz, a formamidine insecticide, which is proposed to activate octopamine receptors. Previous studies have identified a putative octopamine receptor from the <b>southern</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> in Australia and the Americas. Furthermore, this putative octopamine receptor could play a role in acaricide resistance to amitraz. Recently, sequence data indicated that this putative octopamine receptor is probably a type- 1 tyramine receptor (TAR 1). In this study, the putative TAR 1 was heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells, and the expressed receptor resulted in a 39 -fold higher potency for tyramine compared to octopamine. Furthermore, the expressed receptor was strongly antagonized by yohimbine and cyproheptadine, and mildly antagonized by mianserin and phentolamine. Tolazoline and naphazoline had agonistic or modulatory activity against the expressed receptor, as did the amitraz metabolite, BTS- 27271; however, this was only observed in the presence of tyramine.

The present study develops a combination of direct and indirect inference methods circumventing such difficulties, and illustrates in particular how such a combination modifies {{our understanding of the}} biology of the <b>southern</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus microplus. To directly assess how females and males pair in natural populations, we sampled 225 mating pairs, genotyped them at six microsatellite loci, and analysed the correlation between mating status and genetic relatedness. This analysis revealed pangamy, i. e. a random association of male and female genotypes. In addition, indirect methods inferred that sib-groups of ticks exploit distinct individual-cows, and hence that ticks probably move among cows during their parasitic lifetime. Altogether, these results negate the expectation of a high frequency of sib-mating, and show the coexistence of genetically diverging stocks within tick cohorts and populations. These results have several consequences for our understanding of R. microplus.

The analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of CDK 1 and CDK 10 from R. microplus showed that both have caspase- 3 / 7 cleavage motifs despite their differences in motif position and length of encoded proteins. CDK 1 has two motifs (DKRGD and SAKDA) located opposite to the ATP binding site while CDK 10 has only one motif (SLLDN) for caspase 3 - 7 near the ATP binding site. Roscovitine (Rosco), a purine derivative that inhibits CDK/cyclin complexes by binding to the catalytic domain of the CDK molecule at the ATP binding site, which prevents the transfer of ATP's γphosphoryl group to the substrate.

RACE-PCR was used to amplify the full length sequence of one CYP; CYP 3006 G 8 which displays a high degree of homology to members of the CYP 6 and 9 subfamilies, known to metabolize pyrethroids. mRNA expression levels of CYP 3006 G 8 were investigated in 11 strains of R. microplus with differing resistance profiles by qPCR, the results of which indicated a correlation with pyrethroid metabolic resistance. In addition to this gene, the sequences for CPR and cytochrome b 5 were also identified and subsequently isolated from R. microplus using PCR. CYP 3006 G 8 is only the third CYP gene isolated from R. microplus and the first to putatively metabolize pesticides. The initial results of expression analysis suggest that CYP 3006 G 8 metabolizes pyrethroids but further biochemical characterization is required to confirm this. Differences in the kinetic parameters of human and mosquito CPR in terms of NADPH binding have been demonstrated and could potentially be used to design species specific pesticides. Similar differences in the tick CPR would confirm that this is a characteristic of heamatophagous arthropods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>southern</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, is an {{economically}} important parasite of cattle and can transmit several pathogenic microorganisms to its cattle host during the feeding process. Understanding the biology and genomics of R. microplus {{is critical to}} developing novel methods for controlling these ticks. Results We present a global comparative genomic analysis of a gene index of R. microplus comprised of 13, 643 unique transcripts assembled from 42, 512 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a significant fraction of the complement of R. microplus genes. The source material for these ESTs consisted of polyA RNA from various tissues, lifestages, and strains of R. microplus, including larvae exposed to heat, cold, host odor, and acaricide. Functional annotation using RPS-Blast analysis identified conserved protein domains in the conceptually translated gene index and assigned GO terms to those database transcripts which had informative BlastX hits. Blast Score Ratio and SimiTri analysis compared the conceptual transcriptome of the R. microplus database to other eukaryotic proteomes and EST databases, including those from 3 ticks. The most abundant protein domains in BmiGI were also analyzed by SimiTri methodology. Conclusion These results indicate that a large fraction of BmiGI entries have no homologs in other sequenced genomes. Analysis with the PartiGene annotation pipeline showed 64 % {{of the members of}} BmiGI could not be assigned GO annotation, thus minimal information is available about a significant fraction of the tick genome. This highlights the important insights in tick biology which are likely to result from a tick genome sequencing project. Global comparative analysis identified some tick genes with unexpected phylogenetic relationships which detailed analysis attributed to gene losses in some members of the animal kingdom. Some tick genes were identified which had close orthologues to mammalian genes. Members of this group would likely be poor choices as targets for development of novel tick control technology. </p...|$|E

40|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is {{responsible}} for great economic losses. It is mainly controlled chemically, with limitations regarding development {{of resistance to the}} chemicals. Vaccines may help control this parasite, thereby reducing tick pesticide use. In this light, we performed subcloning of the gene of the protein Bm 86 -GC, the homologue protein that currently forms the basis of vaccines (GavacTM and TickGardPLUS) that have been developed against <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks.</b> The subcloning was done in the pPIC 9 expression vector, for transformation in the yeast Pichia pastoris. This protein was characterized by expression of the recombinant Mut+ strain, which expressed greater quantities of protein. The expressed protein (rBm 86 -CG) was recognized in the Western-blot assay using anti-Gavac, anti-TickGard, anti-larval extract and anti-rBm 86 -CG polyclonal sera. The serum produced in cattle vaccinated with the antigen CG rBm 86 presented high antibody titers and recognized the native protein. The rBm 86 -GC has potential relevance as an immunogen for vaccine formulation against <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus {{obtained}} from four local populations in Uruguay (2007 - 2008) {{were subjected to}} various bioassay techniques to determine the presence of fipronil resistance within the country. Resistance ratios (RRs) obtained by larval immersion test varied between 3. 3 and 3635 for tick populations subjected to treatment with fipronil for the last 3 - 7 years. The highest RR was observed in the population which received fewer treatments. Using discriminating concentration (8 ppm) for larval immersion test, all field strains were correctly diagnosed as fipronil-resistant. This study presents the first diagnoses of <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> resistance to fipronil in Uruguay`s field populations. It also {{highlights the importance of}} the possible conflict between programs to control agricultural pests and <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks.</b> The findings provide valuable information for selection and adoption of new control alternatives to manage drug resistance exhibited by <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier BM.
