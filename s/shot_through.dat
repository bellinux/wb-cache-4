5|$|A warrant {{was sworn}} out for Waring's arrest, but {{officials}} {{soon learned that}} he was incapacitated, after being <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> both hips the day before Sharp's death. When Darby discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to Simpson County where he met Captain John F. Lowe, who told Darby that Beauchamp had related to him detailed plans for the assassination. He also furnished Darby with a letter that contained damaging admissions against Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, Phillips enlisted in the 20th (Service) Battalion Royal Fusiliers, and after refusing a commission, served as a Sergeant. The 20th Royal Fusiliers was one of four battalions of the {{regiment}} raised in 1914 by the Public Schools and University Men’s Force. Phillips was deployed to France with his unit on 16 November 1915.

During the investigation they find a high-class prostitute hiding in a nearby doghouse. After making unsuccessful advances on Bolander, she admits the drug dealer was killed by his own bodyguard, Newton Stuart (Richard Pelzman). After arresting him, Stuart says the other shooting victim used the drug dealer as a human shield. In a misguided attempt to follow his employer's orders to kill anyone who threatens him, Stuart said he <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the drug dealer to ensure the man threatening him would also be shot.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916, Phillipps was {{deployed}} to France with the 28th Battalion for {{service on the}} Western Front. He participated in a raid against the forts of Armentières {{on the night of}} 6/7June, and saw action during the Battle of Pozières in July. On 5August, he was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to captain on 12August.

He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2March 1917.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot and killed. The Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The warriors followed the retreating unit and entered the camp. Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a bayonet charge that repulsed the warriors.

Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> special lenses {{to make it}} more {{reminiscent}} of the decade. At Peter's funeral, actress Blair Brown wanted her character Nina Sharp to wear sunglasses, because she thought Nina would not share her emotions at the funeral. Unlike Noble, Brown wore a wig. The scenes at Reiden Lake were actually shot on a parking lot, and the crew placed a covering over it to simulate the cracks normally on a lake.|$|E

5|$|The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car {{breaks down}} was added {{digitally}} in post-production. The filmmakers {{had not been}} granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, {{the use of a}} tracking <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.|$|E
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E

Although he was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E

5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable <b>shot</b> <b>through,</b> which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E

Wesley Fuller, a Cowboy {{who had been}} {{at the rear of the}} lot, left as soon as the firing began. Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.|$|E

40|$|Three video search {{systems were}} {{compared}} in the interactive search task at the TRECVID 2003 workshop: a text-only system, which searched video <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> transcripts; a features-only system, which searched video <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> 16 video content features (e. g., airplanes and people); and a combined system, which searched through both transcripts and content features. 36 participants each completed 12 video search tasks. The {{hypothesis that the}} combined system would perform better than both the text-only and the features-only systems was not supported, and large topic effects were found. Further analysis showed that concept-based video retrieval worked best for specific topics, whereas the hybrid retrieval techniques which combine both concept- and content-based video retrieval showed some advantage when searching for generic topics. The results have implications for topic/task analysis for video retrieval research, and also {{for the implementation of}} hybrid video retrieval systems. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station.

Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|In the north, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} into its new landing zone—LZ March— to the south-west. With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on {{foot to the}} line of departure but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company under the command of Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner. In the action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood. Meanwhile, two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, the RhAR was {{withdrawn}} {{for a period}} of rest and recuperation (R). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> the windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called Tartan Rock: the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR were back on regular duty.|$|E
