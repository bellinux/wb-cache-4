Therefore, {{it is important to}} fully recognize any inherent factors which may influence DC function under experimental conditions, especially in laboratory mice since they are used so heavily to study immune responses. Physiological stress is well recognized to impair several arms of immune protection. The goals of this report are to briefly summarize previous work revealing how DCs respond to various forms of physiologically relevant stress and to present new data highlighting the potential for chronic mild cold stress inherent in mice housed at <b>standard</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> required for laboratory mice to influence baseline DCs properties. Since recent data from our group shows that CD 8 + T cell function is altered by mild chronic cold stress and since DC function is crucial for CD 8 + T cell activation, we wondered whether mild cold stress may also be influencing DC properties. We found increased numbers of splenic DCs (CD 11 c+) in cold stressed mice compared to mice housed at a thermoneutral temperature, which significantly reduces cold stress. However, many of the DCs which are expanded in cold stressed mice express an immature phenotype. We also found that antigen presentation and ability of splenocytes to activate T cells were impaired compared to that seen in DCs isolated from mice at thermoneutrality. The new data presented here strongly suggest that the housing temperature of mice can affect fundamental properties of DC function which in turn could be influencing the response of DCs to added experimental stressors or other treatments...|$|R

Consequently, since January 2011 all fuels on the market used for {{transport}} purpose must contain a fraction of 5. 75 % renewable energy sources. Ethanol in gasoline is a promising solution to reach this objective. In addition to decrease the dependence on fossil fuel, ethanol contributes to reducing air pollutant emissions during combustion (carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbons), and has {{a positive effect on}} greenhouse gas emissions. These considerations rely on numerous emission studies performed in standard conditions (20 - 30 °C), however, very few emission data are available for cold <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures,</b> as they prevail in winter times in e. g.

The chassis dynamometer experiments were carried out at the Vehicle Emission Laboratory (VELA) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) Ispra, Italy. Emissions of modern passenger cars complying with the latest European standards (Euro 4 and Euro 5 a) were recorded over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Common Artemis Driving Cycle (CADC). Unregulated compounds such as methane, ammonia, and small chain hydrocarbons were monitored by an online Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectrometer with 1 Hz acquisition frequency. In addition, a number of ozone precursors (carbonyls and volatile organic hydrocarbons) were collected and analyzed offline by liquid and gas chromatography in order to evaluate the ozone formation potential (OFP) of the exhaust. Results showed higher unregulated emissions at - 7 °C than at 22 °C, regardless of the ethanol content in the fuel blend. More carbonyls were associated with oxygenated fuel, and acetaldehyde emissions were found particularly enhanced at - 7 °C with E 75. In addition, elevated methane emission was measured at low <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> when ethanol fuel was used. Moreover, the OFP of the exhaust gas at - 7 °C increased with the amount of ethanol in gasoline when the cold start excess emissions were included.

As noted, heat capacity values far lower than 3 R [...] "per atom" [...] (as is the case with diamond and beryllium) result from “freezing out” of possible vibration modes for light atoms at suitably low temperatures, just as happens in many low-mass-atom gases at room temperatures (where vibrational modes are all frozen out).

Either cooled air using a pad-and-fan sysytem or natural air was sent by electric fan to the back of each steer from distributing hole of vinyl film duct set 1 meter upside from the back of cattle in the shelter.
