It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E

5|$|The shock {{produced}} by the onefin electric ray can be painful, but is not substantially dangerous to humans. Though not utilized economically, this ray is frequently caught as bycatch in bottom trawls in South African waters. Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} negatively affected by water pollution from coastal development. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of <b>specific</b> <b>data,</b> while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
5|$|Though little <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> are available, the Japanese sleeper ray is {{believed}} to be caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and other demersal fishing gear throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, electric rays tend not to survive being caught and discarded, and shrimp trawling is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E

We {{report the}} results of studies on {{resistivity}} and specific heat measurements on LaRhSn and CeRhSn single crystals with strong emphasis on the anisotropic behavior of this ternary intermetalic systems. The resistivity of LaRhSn compound drops to zero value below 2 K. The phase transition to the superconducting state was confirmed by a peak in the <b>specific</b> heat <b>data</b> at 1. 8 K. In the case of CeRhSn the electrical resistivity is strongly anisotropic. Its temperature dependence measure along a- axis exhibits a maximum at 54 K. The <b>specific</b> heat <b>data</b> exhibits a minimum at 6. 6 K. The subsequent upturn can be suppressed by field applied along the c-axis.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} {{reticulate}} whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat preferences, and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980, while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll. Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food.|$|E
5|$|The first Mother was {{released}} for the NES in 1989. Its sequel, Mother 2, or EarthBound, was developed {{over five years}} by Ape (later Creatures) and HAL, and published through Nintendo. The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser Shigesato Itoi, and produced by Satoru Iwata, who became Nintendo's president and CEO. Mother 2 was made with a development team {{different from that of}} the original game, and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project. Mother 2 development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation. Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team. Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on <b>specific</b> <b>data,</b> such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of Mount Fuji.|$|E

5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles.
