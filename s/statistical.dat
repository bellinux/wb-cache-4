25|$|Whereas {{ordinary}} mechanics only {{considers the}} behaviour {{of a single}} state, <b>statistical</b> mechanics introduces the <b>statistical</b> ensemble, which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The <b>statistical</b> ensemble is a probability distribution over all possible states of the system. In classical <b>statistical</b> mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a phase space with canonical coordinates. In quantum <b>statistical</b> mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states, and can be compactly summarized as a density matrix.|$|E

25|$|Applied {{mathematics}} has substantial {{overlap with}} {{the discipline of}} statistics. <b>Statistical</b> theorists study and improve <b>statistical</b> procedures with mathematics, and <b>statistical</b> research often raises mathematical questions. <b>Statistical</b> theory relies on probability and decision theory, and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and optimization; {{for the design of}} experiments, statisticians use algebra and combinatorial design. Applied mathematicians and statisticians often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).|$|E

25|$|<b>Statistical</b> {{learning}} {{is the ability}} for humans and other animals to extract <b>statistical</b> regularities from {{the world around them}} to learn about the environment. Although <b>statistical</b> {{learning is}} now thought to be a generalized learning mechanism, the phenomenon was first identified in human infant language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Statistical</b> {{mechanics}} {{also finds}} use outside equilibrium. An important subbranch known as non-equilibrium <b>statistical</b> mechanics {{deals with the}} issue of microscopically modelling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat. Unlike with equilibrium, there is no exact formalism that applies to non-equilibrium <b>statistical</b> mechanics in general, and so this branch of <b>statistical</b> mechanics remains an active area of theoretical research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Statistical</b> {{mechanics}} {{is commonly}} used to explain the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems. This branch of <b>statistical</b> mechanics, which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as <b>statistical</b> thermodynamics or equilibrium <b>statistical</b> mechanics. Microscopic mechanical laws do not contain concepts such as temperature, heat, or entropy; however, <b>statistical</b> mechanics shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty {{about the state of}} a system when that system is prepared in practice. The benefit of using <b>statistical</b> mechanics is that it provides exact methods to connect thermodynamic quantities (such as heat capacity) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in classical thermodynamics, the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials. <b>Statistical</b> mechanics also makes it possible to extend the laws of thermodynamics to cases which are not considered in classical thermodynamics, such as microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees of freedom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Statistical</b> {{significance}} test : A predecessor to the <b>statistical</b> hypothesis test (see the Origins section). An experimental result {{was said to}} be statistically significant if a sample was sufficiently inconsistent with the (null) hypothesis. This was variously considered common sense, a pragmatic heuristic for identifying meaningful experimental results, a convention establishing a threshold of <b>statistical</b> evidence or a method for drawing conclusions from data. The <b>statistical</b> hypothesis test added mathematical rigor and philosophical consistency to the concept by making the alternative hypothesis explicit. The term is loosely used to describe the modern version which is now part of <b>statistical</b> hypothesis testing.|$|E

25|$|While {{studies of}} single AGN show {{important}} {{deviations from the}} expectations of the unified model, results from <b>statistical</b> tests have been contradictory. The most important short-coming of <b>statistical</b> tests by direct comparisons of <b>statistical</b> samples of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s is the introduction of selection biases due to anisotropic selection criteria.|$|E
25|$|A {{combined}} <b>statistical</b> area (CSA) {{is composed}} of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan <b>statistical</b> areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage.
