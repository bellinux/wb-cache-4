40|$|The {{quality of}} roll formed {{products}} {{is known to}} be highly dependent on the process design. In addition, unavoidable variations of material properties during mass production can have a significant deteriorating effect on the product quality. This study focuses on the question how to <b>compensate</b> for <b>product</b> defects while simultaneously minimizing the sensitivity for variation of material properties. This is achieved by using robust optimization techniques to determine the optimal process settings of adjustable tools in the final roll forming stand. The work covers both numerical analyses as well as experiments. Initial roll forming experiments of an Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) V-section profile showed a significant amount of longitudinal bow and springback in the final product. Finite Element (FE) simulations are subsequently performed to determine the relationship between adjustable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the product defects. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations are subsequently replaced by the best performing metamodel chosen from of a family of metamodels. Using these metamodels, the optimal robust process settings for the adjustable stand are determined and the effect on product quality analyzed. The results show that the effect of scattering material properties on the dimensional quality of the roll formed product is significant. Moreover, it is shown that the adjustment of the tooling in the final roll stand leads to a significantly improved <b>product</b> quality by <b>compensating</b> for <b>product</b> defects and minimizing the deteriorating effects of scattering variables...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{polygyny}} threshold model, {{females are}} {{compensated for the}} cost of sharing a territory with other females by breeding in territories of higher quality than those of monogamously mated females. In the polygynous Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), the variation in territory quality may be associated with nest site characteristics or food supply. In this study, we examined the probability of nest predation in Great Reed Warblers in relation to an indirect measure of territory quality (territory attractiveness rank as indexed by settlement order) and to several variables of nest site structure. Artificial nests with attached soft plasticine model eggs were placed in Great Reed Warbler territories of different attractiveness; Marks in the soft model eggs were compared to marks from possible predator species. Both inter- and intraspecific predators were found to prey upon eggs in artificial nests. Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus) predominantly preyed upon artificial nests located in territories of low attractiveness, in low-density reed beds, and early in the season. Bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) and Water Rails (Rallus aquaticus) showed a preference for artificial nests located inside the reeds. When all types of predators of artificial nests were pooled, the probability of nest predation was lower in more attractive territories. This pattern was corroborated in an analysis of predation on real nests. In general, polygyny occurred in territories with a low rate of nest predation, whereas unmated males held territories where the risk of predation was high. The low rate of nest predation in attractive territories on average <b>compensated</b> <b>secondary</b> females for the cost associated with sharing a male (i. e., reduced male assistance when feeding nestlings).

Methods: In a retrospective study, Testosterone and Luteinizing hormone levels were measured in adult males. The subjects were classified as hypogonadal using a new classification system. Results: The subjects with low testosterone levels turned out to be 41 %. Secondary hypogonadism was most prevalent amongst the adult males.

Discussion: With this study it became easier for us to classify the subjects as Eugonadal or hypogonadal and to determine the class of hypogonadism as Primary, <b>Secondary</b> or <b>Compensated</b> hypogonadism. As maintaining normal testosterone levels is important for overall health of men and it also has role in fertility, therefore, identifying men with androgen deficiency is important.

This rise of resistance may be followed by a fall when chemical control is suspended and resistance alleles carry a fitness cost. Another possibility is that mutations at <b>secondary</b> loci <b>compensate</b> for the cost, usually without loss of resistance. This enables resistant types to withstand invasion by the susceptible wild-type; resistance then persists in the population, which reduces the efficacy of future pesticide or antibiotic use. We examined a two-locus model of a haploid organism that adapts to the cost of resistance by a single compensatory mutation. We addressed the question how different combinations of cost and compensation and different levels of recombination affect the consequences of a single pesticide application. Resistance will become fixed in the population when the fraction of the population exposed to pesticide exceeds the cost of resistance. Compensatory mutations reduce the cost of resistance and therefore this threshold level of pesticide use. In the absence of pesticide, recombination promotes stability of equilibria. In the presence of pesticide, recombination accelerates the fixation of resistance and compensating alleles; recombination may also enable the persistence of compensated resistant types after pesticide us...|$|R

Up to now, {{there is no evidence}} of any physiological mechanism leading to hatching sex ratio deviations. The primary follicles in prophase I are already supplied with considerable amounts of yolk and chromosomal segregation distortion appears to be highly constrained by the mechanism of meiotic division. Also, genetic interests of gametes strongly oppose any maternal attempt at control of the sex ratio. Hence, sex ratio manipulation by preferential ovulation of Z- or W-ova is argued to be implausible. More probably, to avoid any further loss of investment, sex ratio adjustment should take place early after ovulation and fertilisation via sex-specific termination of embryonic development before initiation of egg shell formation. I suggest that the widely reported influence of the position within the egg laying sequence on offspring sex could potentially serve as an explanation for a wide range of sex ratio effects found in birds.

40|$|Subsurface drip {{distribution}} {{is an important}} on-site wastewater treatment technique which is widely used with various soil types and restricted site conditions. It can distribute pretreated wastewater uniformly into soil. Some recent field applications showed low application uniformities, which was reflected in overloading of the field near the supply manifold while low emitter discharge rates occurred {{at the end of}} lateral. Designers are seeking appropriate operation pressures and drip zone configurations to improve system application uniformity. This research was conducted to test some popular wastewater drip products in both lab and field-scale experiments. The first goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of five subsurface drip products under eight operational pressures ranging from 0 to 310 kPa (45 psi). After evaluation of each group of 60 emitters, results showed that Netafim Bioline pressure compensating (PC) emitters exhibited a uniformity coefficient (UC) of 95 % with a coefficient of variance (Cv) of 4. 9 %. The average UC of Geoflow Wasteflow products is 94. 4 % and Cv value is 6. 8 %. Flow rate and pressure relationships (Q-H curves) were developed for each drip emitter tested. By analyzing low and normal operational pressure ranges, Q-H curves were fitted to the data and resulted in R 2 values ranging from 1. 000 to 0. 414. Geoflow pressure <b>compensating</b> <b>products</b> possess the features of non-pressure compensating emitters under low pressure head. Netafim PC products are characterized as pressure compensating over the full range of operational pressures and emit water with nominal uniformity during low pressure range. To evaluate drip zone configurations with respect to distribution uniformity, a field-scale experiment was set up and three drip tubing products were tested in different dosing and operation schemes. Three factors of wastewater drip system design were tested. System operation pressure (138 kPa/ 20 psi and 276 kPa/ 40 psi); different pressure control components (pressure regulator/recirculation valve) and schemes (continuous flushing/intermittent flushing); and supply line length (7. 6 m/ 25 ft, 15. 2 m/ 50 ft, and 30. 4 m/ 100 ft) were evaluated to compare their influence on water application uniformity. It was concluded that, for Geoflow PC and NPC products, among all three factors, system operational pressure has the greatest effect on drip system application uniformity; supply line length has the least influence. For Netafim PC tubing, pressure control scheme has the greatest effect on drip system application uniformity; supply line length has the least influence. The optimal combination of the three factors could save more than 10 minutes of dosing time to meet the required dosing application uniformity.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} for the deep-drawing process is springback. Generally, the deep-drawing tools are directly derived from {{the shape of the}} product. However, when the press is opened after forming, the product will spring back due to internal stresses. In order to produce a geometrically accurate product, the geometry of the tools is compensated. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to perform this task automatically, with the use of FE deep-drawing simulations. In this report the two main compensation algorithms are discussed that are mentioned in literature. Springback compensation is always the last step in the process planning of a deep drawn product. It is not always needed, in some cases the product can be made to fit the assembly by simply pushing it back into the right shape. To make the right decision, springback has to be measured and evaluated properly, which can be hard for complex shaped products. Today, manual springback compensation is applied, based on the measurements on prototype products. This is a time consuming process for which a lot of experience is needed. The use of FE simulations can speed up this process, but to fully use the detailed results of such a simulation, a compensation algorithm has to be used. The first algorithm is called the smooth displacement adjustment (SDA) method. The method is based on a direct comparison of the desired shape and the shape after springback. The idea is to compensate springback by reversing the springback deformation field and applying this to the product geometry. The method can also be applied iteratively by using the shape deviation field between the springback (actual) geometry and the reference (desired) geometry. A smoothing/extrapolation function has been added, so the new toolset can be derived directly from this <b>compensated</b> <b>product</b> geometry. The method has been tested on a real industrial part, a trunk-lid inner frame that has been adopted as a benchmark part for the NUMISHEET 2005 conference. The method was very successful, after compensation the mean shape deviation was lowered by 70 %. However, some large shape deviation was still present in the product flanges, showing that there is still room for improvement. The second algorithm is called the springforward (SF) method. The principle of the SF method is to compensate springback with the internal stresses that cause it, instead of applying direct geometric optimization, such as the DA method. The method was applied to an academic process, the plastic bending of a strip. It is explained that with the current definition of the algorithm, iterative application is not useful. This problem is solved by adding a push-back stage, so the compensation is linked to the desired geometry again. However, the actual calculation of the compensated geometry suffers from large principal and numerical problems, as was demonstrated using a simple industrial product. ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies of}} social {{polygyny}} in birds have examined male provisioning {{on the basis}} of the number of feeding visits. This may be misleading if males compensate for infrequent visits by bringing larger prey at each visit. We investigated nestling provisioning in the socially polygynous great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, in south Central Sweden in 1996 - 1997. We collected data on rare of feeding visits, prey size and the amount of biomass delivered by males and females. Males had lower rates of feeding visits and provided smaller prey to nestlings in secondary than in monogamous and primary nests. Secondary females had higher rates of feeding visits and brought larger prey than monogamous and primary females. These results confirm that secondary females face a potential cost of polygyny through a lower rate of male feeding, and that this cost was reinforced by the significantly lower male provisioning rate (biomass h(- 1)) at secondary nests. <b>Secondary</b> females <b>compensated</b> for the lack of male assistance by increasing their rate of feeding and bringing larger prey. As a result, offspring in nests of secondary females received as much food as did those in nests of primary females. Prey load size increased with the parent's proportion of feeding visits, suggesting that parents use different feeding strategies depending on their amount of responsibility for nestling provisioning. We suggest that parents which take the main responsibility for nestling feeding have to forage further away from the nest, and based on optimal-foraging theory, they should then on average bring larger prey to their nest...|$|R

In an independent cohort of epidemiologically linked transmission pairs, the presence of these substitutions in viruses encoding T 242 N was associated with significantly higher plasma viremia in donors, further suggesting that these <b>secondary</b> mutations <b>compensated</b> for the replication defect of T 242 N. Using NL 4 - 3 constructs, we illustrate the ability of these CypA loop changes to partially restore replication of the T 242 N variant in vitro. Notably, these mutations also enhanced viral resistance to the drug cyclosporine A, indicating a reduced dependence of the compensated virus on CypA that is normally essential for optimal infectivity. Therefore, mutations in TW 10 allow HIV- 1 to evade a dominant early CD 8 + T-cell response, but the benefits of escape are offset by a defect in capsid function. These data suggest that TW 10 escape variants undergo a postentry block that is partially overcome by changes in the CypA-binding loop and identify a mechanism for an HIV- 1 fitness defect that may contribute to the slower disease progression associated with HLA-B 57...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Interrelationships between hormones of the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular (HPT) axis, hypogonadism, vitamin D and {{seasonality}} remain poorly defined. We investigated whether HPT axis {{hormones and}} hypogonadism {{are associated with}} serum levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) in men. Design and methods: Cross-sectional survey of 3369 community-dwelling men aged 40 – 79 years in eight European centres. Testosterone (T), oestradiol (E 2) and dihydrotestosterone were measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry; LH, FSH, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), 25 (OH) D and parathyroid hormone by immunoassay. Free T was calculated from total T, SHBG and albumin. Gonadal status was categorised as eugonadal (normal T/LH), secondary (low T, low/normal LH), primary (low T, elevated LH) and compensated (normal T, elevated LH) hypogonadism. Associations of HPT axis hormones with 25 (OH) D were examined using linear regression and hypogonadism with vitamin D using multinomial logistic regression. Results: In univariate analyses, free T levels were lower (P= 0. 02) and E 2 and LH levels were higher (P&# 60; 0. 05) in men with vitamin D deficiency (25 (OH) D &# 60; 50  nmol/l). 25 (OH) D was positively associated with total and free T and negatively with E 2 and LH in age- and centre-adjusted linear regressions. After adjusting for health and lifestyle factors, no significant associations were observed between 25 (OH) D and individual hormones of the HPT axis. However, vitamin D deficiency {{was significantly associated with}} compensated (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1. 52, P= 0. 03) and secondary hypogonadism (RRR= 1. 16, P= 0. 05). Seasonal variation was only observed for 25 (OH) D (P&# 60; 0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Secondary</b> and <b>compensated</b> hypogonadism were associated with vitamin D deficiency and the clinical significance of this relationship warrants further investigation. </p...|$|R
