40|$|LectureThe shop {{performance}} {{test of a}} hydrogen recycle gas compressor for refinery plant was conducted with the suction pressure of 50 barA based on ASME PTC- 10 Type- 2 test. During testing, a surge phenomenon was observed at a flow rate 15 % higher than the predicted surge flow. From the FFT results of the shaft vibration and the pressure pulsation at the discharge of the compressor, the peaks of sub-synchronous components were observed at two frequencies of 2 Hz and 30 Hz near surge flow. The sub-synchronous vibration at 30 Hz {{was considered to be}} caused by rotating stall, but the 2 Hz was too low to be attributable to rotating stall. As an assumption of the root cause, the acoustic characteristics of <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> loop were checked. The calculated and measured Helmholtz resonance frequency of the <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> loop was in agreement with the sub-synchronous frequency of 2 Hz. For further investigation, additional tests were carried out with a fully instrumented test loop. Many different test cases were carried out by changing the suction pressure and piping size, with and without installing a perforated plate near the compressor. The originating flow points of the surge were different in each case. The originating flow point of the surge was small when the suction pressure was high and/or the perforated plate was installed. From the investigation results, {{it was found that the}} mode of the acoustic characteristics of test loop was related with the originating flow point of surge. In case the compressor discharge is the node of pressure pulsation, it becomes the anti-node of flow fluctuation. In this case, if the flow approaches surge, the flow fluctuation at the compressor discharge is increased. It transmits to the compressor suction, and it would cause the surge of the compressor. In case the perforated plate was installed near the compressor discharge, the pressure pulsation at the compressor discharge was increased. It decreased the flow fluctuation of the compressor discharge, and the surge became suppressed...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 97 - 102 The {{prediction}} of rotating stall {{is one of}} the most important key technologies for compressors, especially high-pressure compressors. The operating ranges of compressors are restricted by rotating stalls because they my cause severe subsynchronous vibration of the rotor. As a consequence, there are many papers that have reported on the subject, including the influence of vaneless diffuser geometry on rotating stalls,m and {{prediction of}} when a rotating stall occurs through experiment and theory. But, so for, there is no way to predict accurately the amplitude of subsynchronous rotor vibration caused by a rotating stall. In this paper, the pressure fluctuation caused by rotating stall and the resulting vibration of the rotor were measured using a test rig. The external force on the impeller during a rotating stall was estimated from the measured pressure fluctuation. The subsynchronous vibration amplitude was then calculated using rotordynamics analysis by adding this external force. Comparing the result of this rotordynamics analysis with the measured subsynchronous vibration, an influence factor of pressure fluctuation to rotor vibration, ?, was calculated. The accuracy of this factor ? was checked by comparison with the result of a <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> on a compressor. Using this factor, the subsynchronous rotor vibration level caused by a rotating stall can then be predicted at the design stage...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 91 - 100 Performance {{verification}} of centrifugal compressor rerates creates a unique challenge to turbomachinery users. It {{is not often}} practical to perform flange-to-flange performance tests on machinery already installed in the field, as the redundant instrumentation necessary to conduct a reliable test is rarely present onsite. In addition, rerated units are typically commissioned during a turnaround where time constraints do not allow the luxury of a test. In some cases, {{it may be possible}} to remove a relatively small compressor body from the site and <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> it. However, in almost all circumstances the cost associated with doing so is prohibitively expensive. This leaves the user faced with the dilemma of being uncertain of a rerated compressor's performance until it is actually run with the new process. A solution is proposed to the problem of performance verification for rerated centrifugal compressors. Single stage scale model testing of the aerodynamic elements that comprise a compressor stage is a proven method used by original equipment manufacturers in the development of new components. This practice may also be used to find the performance of aerodynamic elements intended to be used in compressor rerates. If the test proves successful, the design can be incorporated with a high degree of confidence that the equipment will operate as expected. After the rerate is complete, the performance can be verified through limited field testing. The details a single stage testing program as well as the independent field performance {{verification of}} four very different compressors are presented.

The limited field testing used only the existing instrumentation previously installed on the compressor trains. After the field variables were taken into account, it was found that the predicted performance was in good agreement with actual compressor operations...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the U. S. energy reserves and lower costs for finding and retrieving oil, the USDOE created a solicitation to encourage industry to focus on means to operate in small diameter well-Microhole. Partially {{in response to this}} solicitation and because Western Well Tool's (WWT) corporate objective to develop small diameter coiled tubing drilling tractor, WWT responded to and was awarded a contract to design, prototype, <b>shop</b> <b>test,</b> and field demonstrate a Microhole Drilling Tractor (MDT). The benefit to the oil industry and the US consumer from the project is that with the MDT's ability to facilitate Coiled Tubing drilled wells to be 1000 - 3000 feet longer horizontally, US brown fields can be more efficiently exploited resulting in fewer wells, less environmental impact, greater and faster oil recovery, and lower drilling costs. Shortly after award of the contract, WWT was approached by a major oil company that strongly indicated that the specified size of a tractor of 3. 0 inches diameter was inappropriate and that immediate applications for a 3. 38 -inch diameter tractor would substantially increase the usefulness of the tool to the oil industry. Based on this along with an understanding with the oil company to use the tractor in multiple field applications, WWT applied for and was granted a no-cost change-of-scope contract amendment to design, manufacture, assemble, <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> and field demonstrate a prototype a 3. 38 inch diameter MDT. Utilizing existing WWT tractor technology and conforming to an industry developed specification for the tool, the Microhole Drilling Tractor was designed. Specific features of the MDT that increase it usefulness are: (1) Operation on differential pressure of the drilling fluid, (2) On-Off Capability, (3) Patented unique gripping elements (4) High strength and flexibility, (5) Compatibility to existing Coiled Tubing drilling equipment and operations. The ability to power the MDT with drilling fluid results in a highly efficient tool that both delivers high level of force for the pressure available and inherently increases downhole reliability because parts are less subject to contamination. The On-Off feature is essential to drilling to allow the Driller to turn off the tractor and pull back while circulating in cleanout runs that keep the hole clean of drilling debris. The gripping elements have wide contact surfaces to the formation to allow high loads without damage to the formation. As part of the development materials evaluations were conducted to verify compatibility with anticipated drilling and well bore fluids. Experiments demonstrated that the materials of the tractor are essentially undamaged by exposure to typical drilling fluids used for horizontal coiled tubing drilling. The design for the MDT was completed, qualified vendors identified, parts procured, received, inspected, and a prototype was assembled. As part of the assembly process, WWT prepared Manufacturing instructions (MI) that detail the assembly process and identify quality assurance inspection points. Subsequent to assembly, functional tests were performed. Functional tests consisted of placing the MDT on jack stands, connecting a high pressure source to the tractor, and verifying On-Off functions, walking motion, and operation over a range of pressures. Next, the Shop Demonstration Test was performed. An existing WWT test fixture was modified to accommodate operation of the 3. 38 inch diameter MDT. The fixture simulated the tension applied to a tractor while walking (pulling) inside 4. 0 inch diameter pipe. The MDT demonstrated: (1) On-off function, (2) Pulling forces proportional to available differential pressure up to 4000 lbs, (3) Walking speeds to 1100 ft/hour. A field Demonstration of the MDT was arranged with a major oil company operating in Alaska. A demonstration well with a Measured Depth of approximately 15, 000 ft was selected; however because of problems with the well drilling was stopped before the planned MDT usage. Alternatively, functional and operational tests were run with the MDT inside 4. 5 inch tubing at depths of 800 - 950 ft. The MDT successfully demonstrated On-Off capability, pulled with up to 1465 lbs force, and verified its capability to transmit torque though it from the Orienter. Forces generated by the tractor were limited due to insufficient differential pressure because of the unloaded downhole motor, which is not typical during drilling conditions. Additionally, the Coefficient of Friction between the MDT grippers and the tubing was much less than the anticipated COF of the sandstone formation. Despite these minor limitations, to summarize the MDT operated as expected. Minor modifications to the MDT are being incorporated to improve gripping capability of the tractor. Additional demonstration wells are being arranged to expand on the project's goals of delivering a fully operational utilitarian tool for use throughout the US to improve reserves...|$|E

Measures used by Austrian Lotteries to raise awareness of this topic range from responsible gaming (RG) training for sales partners and the provision of information materials for staff and customers to restrictive procedures like warnings and contract termination when a sales partner is caught repeatedly selling lottery products to minors. A recent study based on 1, 421 mystery <b>shopping</b> <b>tests</b> and on a survey with 4516 respondents of 5, 162 sales partners in 2014 examined whether and to what extent the trainings provided produced the desired behavior.

40|$|TutorialTutorial 18 : Understanding {{the lateral}} rotordynamic {{behavior}} {{is critical in}} determining the reliability/operability of rotating equipment. Whether examining a centrifugal pump or compressor, steam or gas turbine, motor or generator, rotating machinery share the same need to accurately predict and measure dynamic behavior. Industrial specifications determining fit for purpose rely on the accuracy of rotordynamic predictions where direct measurement is impractical or otherwise impossible in an industrial setting. Testing to confirm rotordynamic prediction and behavior provides both the purchaser and vendor the confidence that the design will meet project expectations. Rotordynamic shop testing has several options available to the project during acceptance tests at the vendor?s shop. These options include mechanical run, string and full load/Type 1 testing as well as verification testing to validate unbalance response and stability predictions. Such testing has numerous advantages; the most important being the avoidance of production disruptions involved with testing at the job site. Each test option has associated costs as well as limitations as to what lateral vibration characteristics are revealed. Understanding these factors is vital to efficiently mitigate {{the risks associated with}} the purchased equipment. Applying best practices and an understanding of the industrial (API) test requirements are needed to derive the maximum benefit of each test option. The best practices not only involve the test procedure but also the associated analytical methods used to post process the measurement information. Whether performing a simple mechanical run test or more complex stability verification during ASME Type I testing, ensuring that a logical, repeatable and proven methodology is followed produces reliable evidence to confirm the rotordynamic model and lateral vibration performance. The rationale behind the API test requirements provides an understanding of why that test is being performed and its correct application to the dynamic behavior. Test options can be separated into two categories; tests that reveal portions of the dynamic behavior of the equipment to specific operating conditions and those used to verify the analytical predictions of that behavior. API mechanical, string and Type I (or full load) tests reveal the rotordynamic behavior of the equipment to a given set of conditions. These are used specifically to determine acceptability of the design. Unbalance and stability verification testing is used to confirm (or provide confidence in) the rotordynamic model. Confidence in the model permits extrapolation of the design (vendor) and operation (purchaser) beyond the machine?s asbuilt and specific <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies Kenyan households' use {{of savings}} {{accounts}} and malaria testing and treatment technologies. The first chapter studies {{whether or not}} married couples use savings accounts strategically. In the absence of commitment, {{the availability of a}} "private" savings technology (a device that is only accessible by a single owner) may incite individuals to take costly strategic savings action in order to manipulate the time path of consumption. This chapter presents a model that formalizes this idea and derives several testable theoretical implications. In particular, households where husbands and wives are well matched in terms of time preference should make greater use of joint (public) accounts, less use of individual (private) accounts, and make more efficient investment choices as compared to their poorly matched peers. The model informed the design of a field experiment where married couples in rural Kenya were given the opportunity to open joint and individual bank accounts at randomly assigned interest rates. The behavior of individuals in the experiment is inconsistent with ex-ante Pareto efficiency and a variety of alternative models of intrahousehold resource allocation, but consistent with the proposed model of strategic savings. Savings misallocation due to strategic behavior may be substantial: in the experiment poorly matched couples forgo at least 64 percent more interest than well matched couples. The second chapter studies the impact of reducing bank account transaction costs. Free ATM cards were offered to a randomly selected subset of newly opened formal bank accounts in Western Kenya. The ATM card reduced withdrawal fees by over 50 percent (from $ 0. 78 to $ 0. 38) and enabled account holders to make withdrawals from their accounts at any time of the day. The cards also enabled accounts to be accessed without the in-person verification of a national identity card. Targeting ATM cards to joint accounts and accounts owned by men substantially increased savings rates (by 39 percent) and average daily balances (by 16 percent) in the bank accounts. In contrast, the intervention had a negative impact when targeted to individual accounts owned by women. This gender difference appears to be driven by differences in bargaining power within the household: the positive treatment effect for men is concentrated in households where men have above median bargaining power, whereas the negative treatment effect for women is concentrated in households where women have below median bargaining power. The final chapter (co-authored with Jessica Cohen and Pascaline Dupas) uses data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with over 2, 900 households in rural Kenya to study the tradeoffs between the affordability of effective antimalarials (ACTs) and overuse. We compare a 95 -percent ACT subsidy (currently under consideration by the global health community) to an alternative policy regime that explicitly acknowledges the problem of overuse by providing access to a subsidized rapid diagnostic test for malaria (RDT) in tandem with subsidized ACTs. We find that ACT access increases by 60 percent in the presence of an ACT subsidy of 80 percent of more. Under the proposed 95 -percent ACT subsidy, however, only 56 percent of those buying an ACT at the drug <b>shop</b> <b>test</b> positive for malaria. We show that targeting could be substantially increased (without compromising access) when the ACT subsidy is reduced to 80 percent but accompanied by an RDT subsidy. by Simone Gabrielle Schaner.

The lack of charity by some, {{particularly in the case}} of a dress purchased at the Frugal Fashion challenge, causes a colossal rift in the house and a major blow up between two pampered princesses.|$|R

This non-uniform flow is transmitted to the impeller discharge, but this minor non-uniform flow does not usually cause an adverse effect on the impeller stage performance. However, we found this is amplified at the return channel due to flow separation at reduced flows (depending on return channel geometry), and the amplified non-uniform flow did induce impeller stall by reverse propagation from the return channel to the impeller. These non-uniform flows caused a significant operating range reduction for a large flow coefficient impeller. The aerodynamics issues were mitigated using CFD analysis techniques, and eventually confirmed by the compressor performance during <b>shop</b> performance <b>testing.</b> The OEM conducted the CFD analyses using two (2) return channel geometries with several CFD models to verify {{the effect of the}} return channel geometry on impeller stall and to confirm the most suitable CFD modeling method for stall evaluation. <b>Shop</b> performance <b>tests</b> utilizing both return channel geometries were conducted and compared to the CFD analyses. These studies were conducted while collaborating with the end-user. The steady CFD calculation was conducted with frozen rotor interface between full annulus impeller and stator parts. The modeling of diffuser and return channel was varied as follows: 1) 1 -pitch model for the return channel with mixing plane at diffuser? 2) Full-annulus model for the return channel with a mixing plane at the diffuser? 3) Full-annulus model for the return channel without a mixing plane at the diffuser. From the above studies and the <b>shop</b> performance <b>testing,</b> it was confirmed that the proposed CFD modeling method could simulate the measurements taken during the <b>shop</b> performance <b>tests</b> and that the CFD modeling method utilized was key to properly evaluating stall phenomena...|$|R
50|$|Speedpass is a keychain RFID device {{introduced}} in 1997 by Mobil Oil Corp. (which merged with Exxon to become ExxonMobil in 1999) for electronic payment. It was originally developed by Verifone. As of 2004, {{more than seven}} million people possess Speedpass tags, {{which can be used}} at approximately 10,000 Exxon, Mobil and Esso gas stations worldwide. At one point, Speedpass was deployed experimentally in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in select markets. McDonald's alone deployed Speedpass in over 400 Chicago area restaurants. The test was deemed a failure and McDonald's removed the scanners from all their restaurants in mid-2004. Additionally, the New England grocery chain Stop & <b>Shop</b> <b>tested</b> Speedpass at their Boston area stores; the units were removed in early 2005. Speedpass has also been previously available through a Speedpass Car Tag and a Speedpass-enabled Timex watch.|$|R
