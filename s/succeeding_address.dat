40|$|Management of {{international}} and global environmental {{and natural resources}} are usually subject to likely externalities. Such externalities {{are the result of}} locational, economic, political and technological asymmetries among the states that share them. The international community had developed mechanisms to deal with equity and efficiency aspects of such resources. Yet, those mechanisms known as treaties, fall short of providing sustainable equity measures. This paper examines the fair sharing of water and the distributional impact of climate change, using empirical observations. The paper concludes that both the 1997 Convention on international water and the 1992 Kyoto Protocol to control CO 2 emissions (and its CDM mechanism) have not <b>succeeded</b> <b>addressing</b> equity in handling the negative impacts and the allocation of likely benefits from mechanisms that were designed to address these externalities...|$|R

Second, barring new elements of weakness afflicting other suppliers of financial services on which banks could capitalize, the role of banks {{in the future is}} likely to be reduced further. Third, the extent of this reduction will hinge to a considerable degree on whether new public policies applying to capital and deposit insurance are imposed.

Equally important is drawing attention to our state of preparedness, adaptation, and timeliness of response in ecosystem governance and society, which involve fostering transformations away from rigid and nonintegrated structures of governance.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{responds}} to the Special Issue call by developing the case for enhancing understanding of entrepreneurial marketing by utilising biographical research. This builds on the limited existing research in entrepreneurial marketing using this approach. Design/methodology/approach: Five entrepreneurial marketers are assessed using biographical research.

Biographical techniques <b>succeed</b> in <b>addressing</b> the need for situation specific understanding. Entrepreneurial marketing core competencies help establish competitive advantage through their ability to influence behaviour, market creation and growth activities. Research limitations/implications: Biographical research contributes towards the additional theoretical and practical insight which entrepreneurial marketing requires.

Originality/value: The biographical approach has been underutilised in entrepreneurial marketing research.
