40|$|Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle {{has been}} applied for {{optimization}} of secreted proteins from Pichia pastoris fed-batch fermentation. The objective of this work is to maximize the total accumulated product per unit operation time under different given conditions and system constraints. To obtain optimal solutions, an automated curve-fitting <b>software,</b> <b>Table</b> Curve 2 D, was employed to construct the necessary mathematical models and solve the complicated functions. In the solution processes, {{the end of the}} glycerol batch phase was defined as the initial state of the system, the end of the methanol fed-batch phase as the final state, the cell mass produced along with product accumulated as state variables, and the specific growth rate (í) as the control variable. Initially, a relationship between the specific production rate (F) and í was established. Then, according to Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, the admissible range of í and its trajectories for the optimal operations were determined. Four representative cases with different combinations of the operation time along with the initial and final states were evaluated. A close correlation was obtained between the predicted values of the model equation with the experimental results from the Pichia pastoris fed-batch fermentations producing secreted R-galactosidase. The approaches proposed here greatly simplify the computational processes and validate the optimization strategy as a generalized approach to maximize the yield from fed-batch fermentations...|$|E

40|$|The {{commanding}} of spacecraft is {{a potentially}} hazardous activity {{for the safety}} of the spacecraft. Present day control systems contain safety features in their commanding subsystem and in addition, strict procedures are also followed by operations staff. However, problems have occurred on a number of missions as a result of erroneous commanding leading in some cases to spacecraft contingencies and even to near loss of the spacecraft. The problems of checking commands in advance are increased by the tendency in modern spacecraft to use blocked/time-tagged commands and the increased usage of on-board computers, for which commands changing on-board <b>software</b> <b>tables</b> can radically change spacecraft or subsystem behavior. This paper reports on an on-going study. The study aims to improve the approach to safety of spacecraft commanding. It will show how ensuring 'safe' commanding can be carried out more efficiently, and with greater reliability, with the help of knowledge based systems and/or fast simulators. The whole concept will be developed based on the Object-Oriented approach...|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the move to the COS/FUV third lifetime position (LP 3), focus sweeps were performed in July 2014 at LP 3 with the G 130 M, G 160 M, and G 140 L gratings, using the bright stars Feige 48 and AzV 75 as targets. An auto-correlation technique was used to find the focus settings where the absorption-line widths in each sweep were minimized, yielding the following focus offsets (relative to the LP 2 best-fit foci) : + 62 + 93 − 96 for G 130 M/ 1309,− 211 + 61 − 70 for G 130 M/ 1222,− 146 + 28 − 31 for G 160 M/ 1600, and− 138 + 98 − 183 for G 140 L/ 1105, where the error bars give the 90 % confidence intervals. A compari-son with ray-trace models shows that the G 130 M/ 1309 and G 160 M/ 1600 offsets are in excellent agreement with expectations, and the G 140 L/ 1105 offsets agree with expec-tations within the uncertainties.

40|$|To {{optimize}} the focus {{at the second}} lifetime position a focus sweep was performed with the COS/FUV G 130 M, G 160 M, and G 140 L gratings {{as part of the}} programs executed to enable COS/FUV science at the second lifetime position. We find that at the second lifetime position, the absolute focus should be offset relative to the focus at the original position by + 120, + 160, and- 165 steps for the G 130 M, G 160 M, and G 140 L gratings, respectively. Ray trace models predict that the best focus at the second lifetime position, at + 3. 5 ”, is within 0 to 200 focus steps from the best focus at the original position. Our results for the M gratings agree well with the ray trace prediction, for the L grating there is also good agreement once the history of focus updates is considered. Under this consideration, the focus of the three gratings move together by 120 to 160 focus steps, between the original and second lifetime positions. The newly derived focus offsets were updated in the flight <b>software</b> <b>tables</b> (LV 49 FSW) and are used for routine operations at the second lifetime position...|$|R

The use of a foundational ontology (UFO) as a basis for developing RSMO helped us to identify several of these concepts, by means of disambiguating concepts when they were analyzed in the light of UFO.

40|$|Researchers and {{practitioners}} alike agree that software traceability {{is important to}} software development. Despite its recognized utility, software traceability has largely been infeasible in practice due to the high costs involved and the low benefits obtained. In {{the first part of}} this survey, we identify the difficulties that hinder end-to-end software traceability, and we analyze these difficulties from economic, technical, and social perspectives. We also discuss current approaches that attempt to address the identified difficulties. In the second part of this survey, we highlight striking similarities between software traceability and the concept of data provenance in e-Science. We investigate whether data provenance techniques can potentially address the difficulties of implementing end-to-end software traceability.
