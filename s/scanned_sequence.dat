40|$|Electro-optical {{sensors can be}} used {{to compute}} range to objects in the flight path of a helicopter. The {{computation}} is based on the optical flow/motion at different points in the image. The motion algorithms provide a sparse set of ranges to discrete features in the image sequence as a function of azimuth and elevation. For obstacle avoidance guidance and display purposes, these discrete set of ranges, varying from a few hundreds to several thousands, need to be grouped into sets which correspond to objects in the real world. This paper presents a new method for object segmentation based on clustering the sparse range information provided by motion algorithms together with the spatial relation provided by the static image. The range values are initially grouped into clusters based on depth. Subsequently, the clusters are modified by using the K-means algorithm in the inertial horizontal plane and the minimum spanning tree algorithms in the image plane. The object grouping allows interpolation within a group and enables the creation of dense range maps. Researchers in robotics have used densely <b>scanned</b> <b>sequence</b> of laser range images to build three-dimensional representation of the outside world. Thus, modeling techniques developed for dense range images can be extended to sparse range images. The paper presents object segmentation results for a sequence of flight images...|$|E

However, the popularity of these networks have raised a complex discovery and connection process, i. e., any device has to pass through an expensive scanning process of available Access Points in crowded and chaotic deployments. The scanning process can be modelled by a set of metrics exposing a trade-off between latency and the discovery rate when searching for appropriate Wi-Fi connection. Consequently, in order to improve the connection process, we use a multi-objective optimisation approach for generating optimal <b>scanning</b> <b>sequences.</b> We propose a framework to assist the network discovery within a Community Network, and we have adapted a Cultural Algorithm as an intelligent component for calculating optimal <b>scanning</b> <b>sequences.</b> Results show that we can derive optimal <b>scanning</b> <b>sequences</b> better than standard approaches for scanning in chaotic network deployments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Tissue {{perfusion}} measurement during catheter-guided stroke {{treatment in}} the interventional suite is currently not possible. In this work, we present a novel approach that uses a C-arm angiography system capable of CT-like imaging (C-arm CT) for this purpose. With C-arm CT one reconstructed volume can be obtained every 4 – 6 s which makes it challenging to measure the flow of an injected contrast bolus. We have developed an interleaved scanning (IS) protocol that uses several <b>scan</b> <b>sequences</b> to increase temporal sampling. Using a dedicated 4 -D reconstruction approach based on partial reconstruction interpolation (PRI) we can optimally process our data. We evaluated our combined approach (IS-PRI) with simu-lations and a study in 5 healthy pigs. In our simulations, the cerebral blood flow values (unit: ml/ 100 g/min) were 60 (healthy tissue) and 20 (pathological tissue). For one <b>scan</b> <b>sequence</b> the values were estimated with standard deviations of 14. 3 and 2. 9, respectively. For two interleaved sequences the standard devia-tions decreased to 3. 6 and 1. 5, respectively. We used perfusion CT to validate the in vivo results. With two interleaved sequences we achieved promising correlations ranging from r= 0. 63 to r= 0. 94.

Multicentre studies have great appeal but face problems if {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data from different centres are to be combined. Fourteen healthy volunteers had two brain scans on different days at three scanners. Considerable effort was first made to use similar <b>scanning</b> <b>sequences</b> and standardise task implementation across centres. The n-back cognitive task was used to investigate between- and within-scanner reproducibility and reliability. Both the functional imaging and behavioural results were in good accord with the existing literature. We found no significant differences in the activation/deactivation maps between scanners, or between repeat visits to the same scanners. Between- and within-scanner reproducibility and reliability was very similar. However, the smoothness of images from the scanners differed, suggesting that smoothness equalization might further reduce inter-scanner variability.

40|$|Limb {{measurements}} {{provided by}} the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on the ENVISAT satellite allow retrieving stratospheric profiles of various trace gases on a global scale. Combining measurements of the same air volume from different viewing positions along the orbit, a tomographic approach can be applied and 2 -D distribution fields of stratospheric trace gases can be acquired in one inversion. With this approach, {{it is possible to}} improve the accounting for the effect of horizontal gradients in the trace gas distribution on the profile retrieval. This was shown in a previous study for the retrieval of NO 2 and OClO profiles in the Arctic region near the polar vortex boundary. In this study, the tomographic retrieval is applied on measurements during special limb-only orbits performed on 14 December 2008. For these orbits the distance between consecutive limb <b>scanning</b> <b>sequences</b> was reduced to ~ 3. 3 ° of the orbital circle (i. e. more than two times with respect to the nominal operational mode). Thus, the same air volumes are scanned successively by more than one <b>scanning</b> <b>sequence</b> also for midlatitudes and the tropics. It is found that the profiles obtained by the tomographic 2 -D approach show significant differences to those obtained by the 1 -D approach. In particular, for regions close to stratospheric transport barriers (i. e. near {{to the edge of the}} polar vortex and subtropical transport barrier) up to 50 % larger or smaller NO 2 number densities (depending on the sign of the gradient along the line of sight) for altitudes below the peak of the profile (around 20 km) are obtained. The limb-only measurements allow examining the systematic error if the horizontal gradient is not accounted for, and studying the impact of the gradient strength on the profile retrieval on a global scale. The findings for the actual SCIAMACHY observations are verified by sensitivity studies for simulated data for which the NO 2 distributions to be retrieved are known in advance. In addition, the impact of the horizontal distance between consecutive limb <b>scanning</b> <b>sequences</b> on the quality of the tomographic 2 -D retrieval is investigated and a possibility to take into account the horizontal gradients by an interpolation approach is studied...|$|R

40|$|Presented are {{results from}} trans-limb scans of the 4. 67 -micron (2143 cm- 1) {{fundamental}} rotation-vibration CO lines. The <b>scan</b> <b>sequences</b> {{were used to}} produce 2 -D maps of the CO emission above the solar limb. The data were collected on 08 August 2002 at the McMath-Pierce solar telescope using the infrared spectrometer, a 256 x 256 InSb array detector and an image stabilizing system - the predecessor to the telescope's current prototype adaptive optics system. The spectrograph slit was oriented parallel to the solar limb to minimize scattered photospheric light into the spectrograph for spectra taken above the limb. The image stabilizer was used to accurately step the solar limb in 0. 149 arcsecond increments across the 0. 5 arcsecond slit. Although the image stabilizer canceled image motion in the axis parallel to the solar limb, seeing still distorted and degraded the limb image. <b>Scan</b> <b>sequences</b> were taken at the solar south polar limb to avoid possible active regions in the mid-latitudes.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death in the world. There is thus a need for advanced diagnostic tools that allow for an early detection of such pathologies. In the last decade, volumetric (3 D) cardiac ultrasound has gain clinical interest as it offers several advantages over the traditionally used 2 D echocardiography. However, state-of-the-art 3 D ultrasound scanners currently have a limited frame rate of approximately 20 - 25 Hz despite of the fact that they acquire data over 4 - 6 consecutive cardiac cycles at reduced spatial resolution and despite of the use of excessive parallel beam forming (16 and more). Although these frame rates are typically sufficient to visualize global heart motion in real-time, they only describe cardiac kinematics in a very rough way as some of the cardiac phases are known to be associated with very fast motion and deformation of the cardiac muscle. With the available ultrasound methodologies these cardiac phases can therefore not be studied accurately, while these time periods contain potentially important diagnostic information. It would thus be of both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic benefit to be able to study these short-lived cardiac phases in more detail. An imaging technique with an ultra-high temporal resolution (in the order of several hundreds of Hz) was therefore required. Hence, the aim of this Ph. D. project was to develop novel beamforming methods to enable volumetric ultrasound cardiac imaging at high temporal resolution. More specifically, novel parallelized <b>scan</b> <b>sequences</b> were investigated. Their capability to generate 3 D images with adequate image quality for functional cardiac imaging was demonstrated.
