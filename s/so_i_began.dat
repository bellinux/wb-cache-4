25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
2500|$|En {{route to}} Washington, D.C., {{he stopped at}} the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, Maryland, where a mimeographed {{publication}} titled Army Motors was put together. [...] "Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the G.I.s in their language. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching – or selling – preventive maintenance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good; <b>I</b> will do <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to perceive, nephew, {{that the}} breed of Tregellis {{has not yet}} lost some of the points which have made it famous." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{so he went}} on till {{his breath}} run out, {{and he had to}} stop. I couldn't think of {{anything}} to say just then, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>begun</b> to look over the paper again. [...] "Ay! here's another proclamation, or something like it." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>Begin</b> {{is a song}} by French house group Galleon. It was {{released}} in June 2001 as the lead single from their album, Galleon. The song was a hit in the US on radio and in clubs in 2001. It also reached the top 10 in France and in the Flanders region of Belgium.|$|R
2500|$|Margarita's {{father wanted}} her to become a {{professional}} dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, [...] "From the time I was {{three and a half}} … as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons." [...] She noted [...] "I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood".|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{met with}} more {{success in the}} medium of still photography. Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone {{had asked me to}} take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me." [...] Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Rhino hired Terry Gilliam and {{was granted}} an {{extension}} from Thompson {{but only with}} the stipulation that the director made the film. Rhino {{did not want to}} commit to Gilliam in case he didn't work out. Thompson remembers, [...] "They just kept asking for more [...] I got kind of agitated about it, because I thought they were trying to put off doing it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to charge them more... I wanted to see the movie done, once it got started." [...] The studio threatened to make the film with Cox and without Depp and del Toro. The two actors were upset when producer Laila Nabulsi told them of Rhino's plans. Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute the film and Depp and Gilliam were paid $500,000 each but the director still did not have a firm deal in place. In retaliation, Depp and Gilliam locked Rhino out of the set during filming.|$|E

2500|$|Sandy Stone is {{an elderly}} Australian man, either single or married with a {{daughter}} who died as a child. Humphries is still writing monologues for him, and said in 2016 that slowly the character has deepened, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to understand and appreciate him, and finally feel myself turning into him. [...] He no longer requires makeup for the part, and plays Sandy in his own dressing gown.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream {{and it was as if}} I was standing in front of him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} or three things that I wanted to know. I do not care about a mystery. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to inquire.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> {{and told}} her all. It took {{an hour or more}} to do so, and she listened intently, now and again asking a question.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{propose a}} general {{taxonomy}} of {{different forms of}} eliminativism. In order to do <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> by exploring eliminativism from a broad perspective, providing a comparative picture of eliminativist projects in different domains. This exploration shows that eliminativism is a label used {{for a family of}} related types of eliminativist arguments and claims. The proposed taxonomy is an attempt to systematise those arguments and claims...|$|R
40|$|In Fiji one {{suspects}} {{no one really}} cares about this crucial distinction. On 14 May 1987, Rabuka 19 s rhetoric was racial; since 19 May 2000 George Speight 19 s has been even more <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> my story with race because my Fiji was primarily colonial and racial. By the time I left Fiji for good in 1974 I had seen only {{a year and a}} half of post-colonial Fiji...|$|R
5000|$|One of Sandy's monologues {{was part}} of the {{recording}} 'A Nice Night's Entertainment', which was particularly enjoyed by Humphries' friend, Peter Cook. Humphries is still writing monologues for Sandy Stone Australia’s most boring man. He said in 2016 that slowly the character has deepened, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to understand and appreciate him, and finally feel myself turning into him. He no longer requires makeup for the part, and plays Sandy in his own dressing gown.|$|R
60|$|His manner was {{far from}} {{encouraging}} and his face wore a severe expression. Altogether I felt a little nervous. But {{it had to be}} done, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ada {{would have}} done so willingly, and with a full persuasion that we had brought the {{question}} to a most satisfactory state. But I {{thought it would be}} useless to stop there, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> again.|$|E
60|$|A Devil! yes, Madam, says I, {{without doubt}} a meer DEVIL; {{take it as}} you please, I can't help that: And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to take it ill {{that she should be}} disgusted at opening such a {{well-known}} Truth to her.|$|E

60|$|And then, as I {{saw some}} of the old {{soldiers}} laughing, I began to understand that this man was trying to frighten us; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to laugh also, and the others as well, {{but it was not a}} very hearty laugh either.|$|E
6000|$|When we came back, {{we found}} them both {{waiting to be}} called in; upon which he agreed to examine him alone, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> thus to {{discourse}} him. [...] "Prithee, Will Atkins," [...] said I, [...] "what education have you? What was your father?" ...|$|E
60|$|With that I {{saw what}} {{appeared}} to be another swordfish, deeper down, moving slowly. This one also looked huge to me. He was right under the teasers. It dawned upon me that he must have an eye on them, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to pull them in.|$|E
60|$|After I had tired myself thus with {{walking a}} long way about, and <b>so</b> eagerly, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to {{consider}} and make home to my lodging, where I came about nine o'clock at night.|$|R
6000|$|I {{believe it}} was his {{movement}} that brought me to my senses; for he had no sooner done <b>so</b> than <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to scramble up the hill, crying out, [...] "The murderer! the murderer!" ...|$|R

60|$|Still gazing on the floor, {{with her}} hands folded before her, she asked me what I wished. At first I could not answer her.

60|$|The {{crack of}} the old hunter's rifle made me {{remember}} that I was to hurry back up the other canyon, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to run.

60|$|Now I {{thought of}} {{offering}} her the pearls, but remembering my mother's words, {{also that the}} Princess might not like to see another woman bear off such a prize, did not do so. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to tell my story instead, Bes seated on the ground near {{to me by the}} Prince's wish, that he might tell his.|$|E
