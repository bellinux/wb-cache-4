5|$|The {{free zinc}} ion is a {{powerful}} Lewis acid {{up to the point}} of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the cytotoxicity of cucurbitacin E, a natural product, and busulphan on human ovarian and <b>stomach</b> cell <b>lines</b> was carried out. The cells were exposed to different concentrations of these two compounds and cell viability was determined from day 0 to day 11. It was observed that cucurbitacin E had a marked effect on the ovarian cancer cell line while busulphan showed a similar effect when exposed to the <b>stomach</b> cancer cell <b>line.</b> The drug-cell combinations showed a pronounced cell kill exponential curve, leading {{to the conclusion that}} cucurbitacin E exerts its pinocytic activity on the ovarian cancer cells while busulphan exerts its alkylating effect on the stomach cancer cells. peer-reviewe...|$|R
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining,</b> manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and <b>stomach</b> <b>lining.</b> The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15â€“19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{therapeutic}} effect of herbal materials in inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown. This study investigates {{the effect of}} fig tree latex (Ficus carica) on <b>stomach</b> cancer <b>line.</b> Methods: The in vitro effect of different doses of fig tree latex on <b>stomach</b> cancer cell <b>line</b> and the {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was evaluated after 72 hours. Results: Fig tree latex could inhibit the proliferation of cancer cell line without any cytotoxic effect on human normal cells. Five mg/ml was the optimum concentration in inhibition of cell line growth. Conclusion: Cancer cell line was more sensitive to Ficus carica latex than normal cells. This anticancer activity might be due to presence of its proteolytic enzymes...|$|R
30|$|Juan and {{coworkers}} introduced five human <b>stomach</b> cancer cell <b>lines</b> (SC-M 1, HONE- 1, CC-M 1, OECM 1, GBM 8401) into nude mice separately [140]. After incubation, plasma was collected, analyzed, and compared with plasma from control mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline. In spite of some acute phase proteins {{found in the}} plasma of all mice bearing cancer cells, SAA was found over-expressed only in mice with the <b>stomach</b> cancer cell <b>line,</b> SC-M 1 [140]. The authors suggested that SAA may be a specific diagnostic marker for patients with gastric cancer.|$|R
50|$|In {{some species}} {{the first part}} of the stomach forms a muscular gizzard lined with chitinous teeth that crush armored prey such as diatoms. Wave-like {{peristaltic}} contractions move the food through the stomach for digestion. The final section of the <b>stomach</b> is <b>lined</b> with cilia (minute hairs) that compress undigested solids, which then pass through the intestine and out through the anus.|$|R
25|$|Alcohol's {{effect on}} the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> can account for nausea because alcohol stimulates the {{production}} of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Bilious {{vomiting}} {{syndrome is}} vomiting {{in response to}} bile-induced inflammation of the stomach. Bile salts interfere with the gastric mucosal barrier, allowing acid to irritate the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> and cause gastritis.|$|E
25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} {{is often}} associated with pernicious anemia, as it is the most common cause. Pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce intrinsic factor within the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining,</b> thereby hindering B12 absorption. B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of anemia, such as pale skin, dizziness, and fatigue.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} cobalamin, B12 is an {{essential}} vitamin necessary for normal blood formation. It is also important {{for the maintenance of}} neurological function and psychiatric health. The absorption of B12 into the body requires adequate amounts of intrinsic factor, the glycoprotein produced in the parietal cells of the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining.</b> A functioning small intestine is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin, as absorption occurs within the ileum.|$|E
25|$|Some vegetarians also avoid {{products}} that may use animal ingredients {{not included in}} their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal <b>stomach</b> <b>lining),</b> gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The first genetically {{modified}} plant was produced in 1983, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. Genetically modified microbial enzymes were the first application of {{genetically modified}} organisms in food production and were approved in 1988 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the early 1990s, recombinant chymosin was approved for use in several countries. Cheese had typically been made using the enzyme complex rennet that had been extracted from cows' <b>stomach</b> <b>lining.</b> Scientists modified bacteria to produce chymosin, which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds.|$|E

40|$|Ferula hermonis Boiss (Apiaceae) {{is known}} in the Midleast as 'zallouh'. In the last decade, {{scientists}} paid attention to study chemistry and biological activity of the plant. In this study Ferula hermonis were collected and evaluated for cytotoxic activity. The plant was extracted using different polarity solvents: petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and methanol. The cytotoxic effect of the extracts was examined in-vitro on human cell <b>line</b> (<b>stomach</b> cancer cell <b>line,</b> SCL- 40). The assay was based on incubation of tetrazolium dye (MTT; a yellow water-soluble tetrazolium dye that is reduced by live, but not dead cells) with the cells that pre-incubated with a tested substance. A purple formazan product that produced can be determined spectrophotometrically. The result confirmed that the SCL- 40 cells were much {{more sensitive to the}} petroleum extract than other extracts, which showed the prominent cytotoxicity. The plant showed pronounced cytotoxic activity will be further evaluated for the possible isolation of active antitumour compounds...|$|R

25|$|Zinc, a major {{component}} of mid-1982-and-later U.S. cents, is toxic in large quantities. Swallowing such a coin, which is 97.5% zinc, can cause damage to the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> because of the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach. Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign body in children but generally are allowed to pass spontaneously unless the patient is symptomatic. Zinc toxicity, mostly {{in the form of the}} ingestion of U.S. pennies minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia. It is also highly toxic in pet parrots and can often be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1957, Qasimov {{grew up in}} Nabur of Shamakhi, Azerbaijan, {{a village}} 100km north of the capital Baku. His family worked on a Soviet commune and Qasimov worked {{alongside}} his parents from a young age. He later reflected that growing up in poverty helped him to live modestly later in life and he never attempted to extricate himself from his peasant background. Qasimov's father was an occasional singer with a good voice {{but he was a}} humble man; he never pursued a professional career in singing. Qasimov on the other hand was a keen singer from a young age and his parents noticed his musical desire. Lacking the money to buy him an instrument, his father used a frame and a goat's <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> to make a crude drum for his son.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, {{and as the}} gut fills up, the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from {{anything else in the}} stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the Hemiptera, many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested {{over a period of several}} days. Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into free amino acids. These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.|$|E

You will be dirty enough, sometimes, where you are going, for the country is hot and unhealthy, and not over clean. You will have hardships, hard times, and plenty of hard work, as well as hard beds now and then, and very likely the most of you will never come back again; but you would be unworthy of the name of British soldiers if you allowed such thoughts to trouble your minds. I sincerely express the hope, however, that you will all come home again safe and sound. I have not the slightest doubt that every man of you will do his duty in the field faithfully and well; but I'm not so sure of your wisdom in camp and barracks, so I will give you a word of advice. There is far more danger in getting drunk in hot countries than in England. Let me advise you, then, not to get drunk; and I would warn you particularly against the vile stuff they will offer for sale in Egypt. It is rank poison. If you had <b>stomachs</b> <b>lined</b> with brass you might perhaps stand it--not otherwise. Then I would warn you against the sun. In Egypt the sun is sometimes like a fiery furnace.

5000|$|The sarlacc's <b>stomach</b> is <b>lined</b> with {{vessels that}} attach {{themselves}} to a swallowed victim and maws for quick digestion or breaking apart large prey. The maws close when exposed to bright lights. The stomach also contains neurotoxins, which induce hallucinations in prey which [...] "suggest that the sarlacc somehow absorbs the intelligence of all its victims, who live on in disembodied torment". A sarlacc can communicate with its victims through this stolen consciousness: In one Star Wars short story, an unnamed Jedi explains that [...] "sarlacci do interesting things with messenger RNA: {{over the course of}} millennia, they can attain a sort of group consciousness, built out of the remains of people they've digested.

5000|$|Each nettle tentacle is {{coated with}} {{thousands}} of microscopic nematocysts; in turn, every individual nematocyst has a [...] "trigger" [...] (cnidocil) paired with a capsule containing a coiled stinging filament. Upon contact, the cnidocil will immediately initiate a process which ejects the venom-coated filament from its capsule and into the target. This will inject toxins capable of killing smaller prey or stunning perceived predators. On humans, this will most likely cause a nonlethal, but painful stinging sensation which can last for forty minutes. In addition, the black sea nettles <b>stomach</b> is <b>lined</b> with a fibrous network of vessels that attach themselves to a swallowed victim and darkmaws for quick digestion or breaking apart large prey, though the maws will close when exposed to bright lights, hence their name.|$|R
25|$|Crocodiles {{have the}} most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV {{reported}} that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the <b>stomach</b> <b>lining</b> to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.|$|E

50|$|Juvenile blue tangs eat {{continuously}} {{and feed}} heavily. This heavy feeding requirement {{is due to}} their poor utilization of food resources. The blue tang's <b>stomach</b> and intestinal <b>lining</b> are proficient at absorbing crushed cellular content, but are not very effective at processing cellulose.

60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{membrane}} {{lining the}} oesophagus is unusually thin: it is furnished with the ordinary constrictor muscles, and others radiating from them like spokes of a wheel. The <b>stomach</b> is <b>lined</b> by unusually prominent biliary folds, {{which in the}} duodenum are transverse, sending forth, however, short folds at right angles; and these latter, in the proper stomach, become so much developed that the folds appear longitudinal. The rectum extends inwards, {{about as far as}} the base of the fourth pair of cirri, but is very short, owing to the little development of the three posterior segments of the thorax. The anus is seated in its usual place, at the dorsal basis of the penis, and is hidden by loose folds of skin; but there are no distinct caudal appendages. The stomach, in the specimen examined, was quite empty.|$|R
