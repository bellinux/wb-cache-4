5|$|Basic {{research}} on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> production of detoxifying enzymes during metabolism. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, may have protective effects against colon cancer. Cabbage {{is a source}} of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.|$|E
5|$|Communication in {{the form}} of quorum sensing plays a role in the {{regulation}} of luminescence in many species of bacteria. Small extracellularly secreted molecules <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> bacteria to turn on genes for light production when cell density, measured by concentration of the secreted molecules, is high.|$|E
50|$|By <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamus, {{he could}} induce {{behaviors}} from excitement to apathy; {{depending on the}} region of stimulation. He found that he could induce different types of responses when <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> anterior (lateral) hypothalamus compared to <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> posterior ventromedial hypothalamus. When <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> anterior part, he could induce fall of blood pressure, slowing of respiration and responses such as hunger, thirst, micturition (urination) and defecation. On the other hand, stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defense-like behavior.|$|R

5|$|Having {{been elected}} twice to the presidency, Reagan {{reshaped}} the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political {{dynamic of the}} United States. His 1980 presidential campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> economy, less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{can make}} {{nutrients}} and minerals {{in the soil}} available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses. In general a more diverse set of soil microbes results in fewer plant diseases and higher yield.|$|E
25|$|Transduction {{involves}} chemical messages {{sent from}} the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. Several photoreceptors may send their information to one ganglion cell. There {{are two types}} of ganglion cells: red/green and yellow/blue. These neuron cells constantly fire—even when not <b>stimulated.</b> <b>The</b> brain interprets different colors (and with a lot of information, an image) when the rate of firing of these neurons alters. Red light <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> red cone, which in turn <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> red/green ganglion cell. Likewise, green light <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> green cone, which <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> red/green ganglion cell and blue light <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> blue cone which <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> yellow/blue ganglion cell. The rate of firing of the ganglion cells is increased when it is signaled by one cone and decreased (inhibited) when it is signaled by the other cone. The first color {{in the name of the}} ganglion cell is the color that excites it and the second is the color that inhibits it. i.e.: A red cone would excite the red/green ganglion cell and the green cone would inhibit the red/green ganglion cell. This is an opponent process. If the rate of firing of a red/green ganglion cell is increased, the brain would know that the light was red, if the rate was decreased, the brain would know that the color of the light was green.|$|R

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E

5|$|Fighting beetles {{are used}} for {{entertainment}} and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. In the Chiang Mai district of northern Thailand, male Xylotrupes rhinoceros beetles {{are caught in the}} wild and trained for fighting. Females are held inside a log to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> fighting males with their pheromones. These fights may be competitive and involve gambling both money and property. In South Korea the Dytiscidae species Cybister tripunctatus is used in a roulette-like game.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the {{criterion}} for the award was changed {{in an effort to}} further <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> Dutch film industry. Films released after January 1, 2003 had to reach paying audiences of 100,000 to qualify for the Golden Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film. All films that had received a Golden Film before 2003 would also have received a Golden Film under the new criterion. From 2003 until 2007, the percentage of cinema visitors in the Netherlands who watched a Dutch film was between 9.20% and 13.4%.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E

5|$|Mineralocorticoid {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> release of aldosterone.|$|E
5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and {{increase the size of}} government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|The Finnhorse is also well-suited to riding therapy, being {{calm and}} steady, hard-working, obedient, healthy and enduring. They are {{small enough to}} allow the patient to be {{assisted}} easily, yet large enough to have gaits that <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> muscles, senses, and balance of the rider. Many Finnhorses have also been trained for driving, and therefore are familiar with unusual noises and can be controlled from behind, and ex-trotters are inexpensive. Many Finns also find {{the appearance of the}} Finnhorse comforting.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we reported that nafoxidine (UA) <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of a uterine protein showing the same electrophoretic mobility as the 'estrogen-induced protein' (E 2 -IP) first described by Notides and Gorski. In the present work, we analyzed the IP-containing electrophoretic zone by SDS polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, {{and found that}} estradiol- 17 β (E 2) and nafoxidine <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of different proteins. As expected, estradiol- 17 β <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of the E 2 -IP of 46, 000 M(r). On the other hand, UA <b>stimulated</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of 27, 000 and 30, 000 M(r) proteins (UA-IP). These UA-IP were not precipitated by an antiserum raised against E 2 -IP. Therefore, UA-IP appear to be independent entities and not degradation or precursor products of E 2 -IP. Both UA-IP are constitutively present in the uterus and even in higher relative amounts in rat brain. The present finding, that an 'anti-estrogen', such as nafoxidine, <b>stimulates</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of different proteins than estrogen, provides {{a new approach to}} the study of the molecular mechanism of estrogen action.

5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt to <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were the}} religiously diverse {{part of the}} British Empire, {{with a high degree}} of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a {{favorite}} destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, Amish and Moravians, not to mention Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. The First Great Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and the Amish.|$|E
5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
