Screens may also be left installed year-round with <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing,</b> and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to climb up the exterior of the house to service the windows. It is possible to retrofit <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood frame due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement. Known {{corrosion-resistant}} {{air heaters}} made from glass tubes {{have not received}} wide acceptance because of some defects (low mechanical strength, temperature deformation, complexity and unreliability of assemblies, etc.), whereas the structure of <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> heat exchange devices has some advantages. The aim of present paper is to study heat exchange dynamics of venti-lation emissions in <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> air heater on heat utilization with considera-tion for water vapor condensation. Results and conclusions. The study of heat exchange in channel <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> heat exchanger at heat utilization of corrosion-active ventilation emissions is car-ried out with consideration for water vapour condensation on heat-exchange sur-faces. It is shown {{that the rate of}} heat exchange under longitudinal flow of vertical glass surfaces air heated and steam-and-air cooled is 15 — 20 % lower than the rate of heat exchange at air cooling...|$|R

50|$|Traditional Japanese {{buildings}} {{do not use}} insulation, and insulation {{may even}} be omitted in modern construction, especially in the low-end apartments; nor is <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> traditionally used in windows, with these being generally single-pane. This {{is not the case}} in Hokkaido and the northern part of Honshū, due to the cold winters there. Insulated and centrally heated homes {{in the northern part of}} Japan are warmer than many homes in warmer parts of Japan. This is not the case for the newer buildings as they are insulated and built with <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing.</b>|$|R

40|$|Heat loss {{through the}} windows of {{buildings}} is one of the factors contributing to high energy consumption for space heating resulting in excessive CO 2 emissions which lead to climate change. Replacing standard double air filled glazing, U value of 2. 85 Wm- 2 K- 1, with vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing,</b> U value of approximately 0. 8 Wm- 2 K- 1, reduces the heat loss by more than three times and reduces the frame thickness due to the thinness of vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> (8. 15 mm) as illustrated in Fig. 1. Further reduction of U value less than 0. 5 Wm- 2 K- 1 can be achieved by using triple vacuum glazing; this reduces heat loss through windows to approximately the same level as that through external solid walls. The research on the design and development of energy-efficient vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> at Loughborough University, led by Prof. Philip C. Eames and Saim Memon, forms part of the CALEBRE (Consumer Appealing Low Energy technologies for Building REtrofitting) project aimed to establish a robust refurbishment package for reducing UK domestic CO 2 emissions resulting from solid-wall dwellings...|$|R

40|$|A {{flexible}} {{sound shielding}} curtain contains {{a plurality of}} <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts encased within pockets or otherwise secured on the exterior surfaces of the panels of a curtain. The <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts may be constructed {{of a combination of}} materials selected and configured such that sound impinging upon the curtain is absorbed or alternatively reflected. The sound shielding curtain can be tuned to insulate an area from a select range of frequencies inherent in select environments. Tuning may be accomplished through the selection and installation of <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts configured to reflect or absorb audible acoustical energy. The <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> sheet inserts are readily removable to permit periodic laundering of the curtain fabric and to provide adaptability for a number of applications. Sound shielding curtain(s) can be selected, configured, installed, and extended in such a manner as to provide sound reduction in a localized space.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> {{in comparison}} to the insulating glass unit filled with inert gas. It describes the biggest problem of vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> and presents solution. The first part describes component elements of a vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glazing</b> and <b>insulating</b> glass unit. Presented are all of the modes of energy transition through the glazing unit. Using various of glazing materials, we perform the calculations of construction physical parameters of glazing units in computer program WINDOW 7. 2. With the program we compare coefficient of heat transfer, the transmission of solar radiation and the transmission of light between vacuum insulated glass and insulation glass unit. Second part of the thesis presents the innovative method of flexible edge sealing for vacuum insulating glass. Flexible edge was developed in Swiss Federal Institute EMPA as a part of Winsmart project which was accepted inside the Seventh framework programme or short EP 7. Today's vacuum insulated glass unit on the market contains rigid edge seal. The temperature differences between the inner and outer pane causes the problem of differential expansion of the panes, which with a large temperature differences leads to bending and also breaking vacuum insulated glass unit. Winsmart project overcomes these problems by using the flexible edge seal. The thesis contains results of various tests made by developing the method and also the problems that we encounter by anodic bonding which is crucial to the flexible edge. We made three vacuum insulating glass units containing the innovating flexible edge which are presented including with there problems and weaknesses...|$|R
