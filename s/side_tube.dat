2500|$|Crookes tubes were unreliable. They had {{to contain}} a small {{quantity}} of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However, as time passed, the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate [...] "harder" [...] X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as [...] "softeners". These often {{took the form of}} a small <b>side</b> <b>tube</b> which contained a small piece of mica, a mineral that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica, causing it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency. However, the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was difficult to control.|$|E

5000|$|The hot-blast design, {{also known}} as a [...] "tubular lantern" [...] due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John Irwin and {{patented}} on January 12, 1868.

A small quantity of substance is weighed exactly in a small stoppered bottle and is dropped in the Victor Meyer's tube and sealed immediately.The bottle falls on the asbestos pad and its contents suddenly change into vapour, blows out the stopper and displaces an equal volume of air in graduated tube. The volume of air displaced is measured by taking the graduated tube out, closing its mouth with thumb and dipping in a jar filled with water. When water levels {{inside and outside the}} tube is equal, the volume of air displaced is noted. The atmospheric pressure and laboratory temperature are noted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{work is a}} {{preliminary}} work {{on the development of}} NIR camera photograph as alternative tool for corrosion product identification. Corrosion products were taken from two different carbon steel <b>tubes</b> <b>side,</b> one is from thinning <b>tube</b> <b>side,</b> the other is from normal <b>tube</b> <b>side.</b> From optical microscope data, it was observed that the thinning <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> surface has elongated microstructure while the other has normal microstructure.

From NIR camera photograph on the scale of both <b>tubes</b> <b>side,</b> it was obtained significant differences in the digital image number.

50|$|The cold-blast {{design is}} similar to the hot-blast, except that cold fresh air is drawn in from around the top of the globe and is then fed though the metal <b>side</b> <b>tubes</b> to the flame, making it burn brighter.

50|$|The RPG-30, {{like the}} RPG-27, is a man-portable, {{disposable}} {{anti-tank rocket launcher}} with a single shot capacity. Unlike the RPG-27 however, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a <b>side</b> <b>tube,</b> {{in addition to the}} main round in the main tube. The precursor round is fired shortly before the main round and acts as a decoy, tricking the target's active protection system (APS) into engaging it. The APS is not ready to engage again until 0.2-0.4 seconds later, allowing the main round time to hit the target.|$|E

Unlike the arrangement for Lotus 20 suspension, the halfshafts had Metalastic rubber 'doughnuts' on the inside, carrying no cornering (side) forces.

50|$|Material may be {{separated}} {{by means of}} an elutriator, which consists of a vertical tube up which fluid is passed at a controlled velocity. When the particles are introduced, often through a <b>side</b> <b>tube,</b> the smaller particles are carried over in the fluid stream while the large particles settle against the upward current. If we start with low flow rates small less dense particle attain terminal velocities, and flow with the stream, the particle from the stream is collected in overflow and hence will {{be separated}} from the feed. Flow rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges. Further size fractions may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such tubes can be arranged in series.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} phase of the action against Bismarck, Rodney fired two 24.5 in torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to Ludovic Kennedy, [...] "if true, is the only {{instance}} in history of one battleship torpedoing another". [...] Earlier in this same action the starboard <b>side</b> <b>tube</b> had its sluice door jammed {{as the result of a}} near miss from one of Bismarcks early salvos. On 27 September 1941, Nelsons port torpedo station almost proved to be a liability when an Italian air-launched 18-inch torpedo holed the compartment behind the torpedo body room, allowing 3,750 tons of water to enter the ship. Following this Nelsons torpedo tubes may have been removed although another source suggests the torpedo tubes were retained in both ships into 1945.|$|E
50|$|In 1952 the United States {{military}} {{developed a}} portable solar still for pilots stranded on the ocean, which comprises an inflatable 24-inch plastic ball that floats on the ocean, with a flexible tube coming out the side.

Fresh water is taken out by the pilot using the <b>side</b> <b>tube</b> that leads to bottom of the inflatable ball. It was stated in magazine articles that on a good day 2.5 US quarts (2.4 l) of fresh water could be produced. On an overcast day, 1.5 US quarts (1.4 l) was produced. Similar sea water stills are included in some life raft survival kits, though manual reverse osmosis desalinators have mostly replaced them.|$|E
30|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} simulations {{are carried}} {{for a single}} shell and multiple pass heat exchangers with different tube geometries i.e. circular tubes to elliptical tubes. The experiment was carried out with hot fluid in <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> and cold fluid in shell <b>side</b> with circular <b>tubes</b> at 600 tube orientation and 25 % baffle cut. Heat transfer rates and pressure drops are calculated for various Reynolds numbers from 4000 to 20000. Fluent software is used for numerical investigations. Both circular and elliptical tube geometries with 450, 600 and 900 orientations are used for the numerical studies. In addition to 25 % baffle cut, quarter baffle cut and mirror quarter baffle cut arrangements are used for comparison. The experimental values of heat transfer rates and pressure drops over shell <b>side</b> and <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> {{along the length of}} STHE are compared with those obtained from fluent software.|$|R
