5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to <b>support</b> <b>this</b> view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E

5|$|An {{argument}} has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported {{only by the}} Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas.

5|$|Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, {{near the}} village of Tickenham. It is a {{scheduled}} monument. Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot; however {{there is no evidence to}} <b>support</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{evidence}} {{pointing out}} that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), <b>support</b> <b>this</b> explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E
5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can <b>support</b> <b>this</b> assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance.

5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory.

His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms <b>support</b> <b>this</b> new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E

While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
