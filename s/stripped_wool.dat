5000|$|... 1850 - Parisian chemist Jules Maumené (1818-1898) {{develops}} the first “test strips” when he impregnated a <b>strip</b> of merino <b>wool</b> with “tin protochloride” (stannous chloride). On {{application of a}} drop of urine and heating over a candle the strip immediately turned black if the urine contained sugar.|$|R
5000|$|Fine hooking, in general, uses <b>strips</b> of <b>wool</b> {{measuring}} 1/32 to 5/32 {{of an inch}} wide. Designs of the fine-cut hooking genre {{use more}} fine shading accomplished by overdyeing wool in graduated color swatches. Primitive (or wide-cut) hooking uses <b>wool</b> <b>strips</b> measuring 6/32 up to 1/2-inch wide. The wide-cut hooking accomplishes shading and highlights using textures in wool, such as plaids, checks, herringbones, etc. Wide-cut designs are generally less detailed and mimic the naivety of rug hookers of the past. There are many well-known designers of commercial rug patterns and each exhibit their own distinct style and techniques. Some designers specialize in animals or whimsical subjects, others use specific and identifiable dyeing techniques, while others adapt antique rugs for today's rug hookers or employ various tools to achieve their chosen subject matter within their designs. In addition to the many commercially available patterns, many rug hookers are creating their own design patterns. Today's great Modern Folk Rug Hookers include; Norma Batastini, NJ; Cheryl Bollenbach, CO; Maggie Bonanomi, MO; Barbara Carroll, PA; Gail Dufresne, NJ;Carla Fortney, CA; Jayne Hester, NY; Cynthia Norwood, TX Deanne Fitzpatrick, NS etc.There are many people like Magdalena Briner who made creative and original rugs.|$|R
40|$|Long, narrow <b>strip</b> of woven <b>wool</b> fabric. Two {{very small}} bits of wool in two {{different}} shades of brown have become very loosely adhered {{at one end of}} the strip but have nothing to do with the woven structure or sewing.; Very dirty in a few spots, otherwise fairly clean. Edges a little bit frayed. Some loose warp threads...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wool</b> <b>strips</b> {{ranging in}} size from 3/32 to 10/32 of an inch (2 to 8 mm) in width are often used to create hooked rugs or wall hangings. These {{precision}} strips are usually cut using a mechanical cloth slitter; however, the strips can also be hand-cut or torn. When using the hand-torn technique the rugs are usually done in a primitive motif.|$|R
60|$|There {{is a great}} {{crowd of}} peasants at the little station. And almost every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat <b>strip</b> of coarse-woven <b>wool,</b> with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with purchases. These are almost the only {{carrying}} bags. The men sling them over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one behind.|$|R
50|$|In {{more recent}} decades hookers have {{followed}} quilters in exploring new materials and new techniques. This experimentation, combined with knowledge {{and respect for}} the past, will allow rug hooking to evolve and grow in the 21st century. Rug hooking today has evolved into two genres, which primarily fall into groups based upon the width of the <b>wool</b> <b>strip</b> employed to create a rug: fine hooking and primitive hooking.|$|R
40|$|Long, narrow <b>strip</b> of <b>wool</b> fabric which {{includes}} a selvedge and a very small fragment of a dark blue/purple tapestry band which does not extend {{to the edge of}} the fabric. Two small groups of linen wefts form a decorative section at one end of the purple band. Each section of linen covers three warp yarns and approximately 8 weft picks. Each section is completely separate from the other. Two other very tiny bits of linen yarn occur 2. 8 cm and 3. 4 cm from the woven linen sections. They could indicate tapestry patterning in the blue/purple section. There are several sewing stitches.; Dirty and worn. A tear occurs along the selvedge in one spot. Edges other than the selvedge are frayed...|$|R
40|$|Narrow <b>strip</b> of woven <b>wool</b> fabric which {{includes}} a selvedge. The warp is unevenly blended green and brown/gold, the weft is brown.; The selvedge is torn in several spots. The fabric contains numerous holes and tears. It is somewhat dirty with several small bits of plant material adhering to the surface. Also, on one side, a 3 cm long piece of very worn 2 -ply yellowed natural yarn has begun to felt {{to the surface of}} the woven fabric...|$|R

40|$|Small doll {{made from}} two <b>strips</b> of woven <b>wool</b> fabric with yellowed warp, pale blue/purple weft with {{a section of}} yellowed dove-tail tapestry. There are {{remnants}} of linen weft-wrapping. The two strips were folded over {{a small group of}} red yarns. There is a single yellowed yarn with a knot tangled with the loose warp yarns that may have been the tie that secures the layers.; Dirty and very worn. There are loose warp yarns and some damaged wefts that leave exposed warps. Most of the weft-wrapping is very deteriorated, although some is still very white...|$|R
25|$|Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in {{north-eastern}} Afghanistan, reportedly {{originating from}} {{the province of}} Samangan, have been carbon-14 dated to a time span {{from the turn of}} the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun <b>wool,</b> <b>strips</b> of cloth and leather are woven in. These fragments are now in the Al-Sabah Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah, Kuwait.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of lawn tennis in the early 1870s, the sport was played as the courtly game of real tennis. England banned the importation of tennis balls, playing cards, dice, and other goods in the Act of Parliament Exportation, Importation, Apparel Act 1463. In 1480, Louis XI of France forbade the filling of tennis balls with chalk, sand, sawdust, or earth, and stated {{that they were to}} be made of good leather, well-stuffed with wool. Other early tennis balls were made by Scottish craftsmen from a wool-wrapped stomach of a sheep or goat and tied with rope. Those recovered from the hammer-beam roof of Westminster Hall during a period of restoration in the 1920s were found to have been manufactured from a combination of putty and human hair, and were dated to the reign of Henry VIII. Other versions, using materials such as animal fur, rope made from animal intestines and muscles, and pine wood, were found in Scottish castles dating back to the 16th century. In the 18th century, 3/4 in <b>strips</b> of <b>wool</b> were wound tightly around a nucleus made by rolling a number of strips into a little ball. String was then tied in many directions around the ball and a white cloth covering sewn around the ball.|$|R
40|$|A noncontact {{technique}} is described that uses atomic oxygen generated under low {{pressure in the}} presence of nitrogen to remove soot from the surface of a test watercolor panel and <b>strips</b> of cotton, <b>wool</b> and silk. The process, which involves surface oxidation, permits control of the amount of surface material removed. The effectiveness of soot removal from test panels of six basic watercolors (alizarin crimson, burnt sienna, lemon yellow, yellow ochre, cerulean blue and ultramarine blue) and strips of colored cotton, wool and silk was measured using reflectance spectroscopy. The atomic oxygen removed soot effectively from the treated areas and enabled partial recovery of charred watercolors. However, overexposure can result in removal of sizing, bleaching, and weakening of the structure. With the proper precautions, atomic oxygen treatment appears to have great potential to salvage heavily smoke damaged artworks which were previously considered unrestorable...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{microbial}} contamination {{were carried out}} on a carpet strip (acrilan) installed in a laboratory corridor and on two carpet <b>strips</b> (acrilan and <b>wool)</b> installed in two rooms in a pediatric hospital. A sampling procedure of randomly removing 8 -mm plugs from the carpets was used for subsequent enumeration and identification of contaminating microorganisms. Microbial counts increased with time, reached a “plateau” at about 4 weeks, {{and appeared to be}} related to the amount of activity present in the carpeted area. Vacuuming of carpets showed only a slight reduction in the number of recoverable microorganisms. Qualitative studies on a strip of acrilan carpet installed in a hospital room indicated that Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-positive nonsporeforming rods were the predominating microorganisms. Coagulase-positive S. aureus organisms were isolated during every sampling period, and gram-negative rods were also regularly isolated. Most nitrate-reducing gram-negative rods belonged to the Enterobacter and Escherichia groups. Survival studies conducted on carpet strips after hospital installation showed relatively constant levels of contamination for about 6 weeks, followed by a gradual reduction in numbers; coagulase-positive S. aureus were found for 35 days, whereas the proportions of most organisms remained relatively constant with time...|$|R
6000|$|After first untwisting {{the strings}} from the hooks, Hester rose, {{and held the}} candle so as to light the cavity in the wall. Two more pieces of the fine string were seen here, resting loose upon the uneven surface which marked the lower {{boundary}} of the hollowed space. Lifting these higher strings, Hester lifted the loosened paper in the next room--the lower strings, which had previously held the strip firm and flat against the sound portion of the wall, working in their holes, and allowing the paper to move up freely. As it rose higher and higher, Geoffrey saw thin <b>strips</b> of cotton <b>wool</b> lightly attached, at intervals, {{to the back of}} the paper, so as effectually to prevent it from making a grating sound against the wall. Up and up it came slowly, till it could be pulled through the hollow space, and pinned up out of the way, as the strip previously lifted had been pinned before it. Hester drew back, and made way for Geoffrey to look through. There was Anne's room, visible through the wall! He softly parted the light curtains that hang over the bed. There was the pillow, on which her head would rest at night, within reach of his hands! ...|$|R
