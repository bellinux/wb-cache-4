40|$|For many {{albatross}} <b>species</b> <b>squid</b> {{are important}} prey. Whether albatrosses depend on scavenging (e. g. of vomit from cetaceans, post-spawning die-offs or fishery waste) or on live-capture of squid (e. g. via diel vertical migrations {{in association with}} aggregations of squid prey) is controversial. This review {{of the nature of}} interactions between squid and the four species of albatross breeding at South Georgia uses data on the foraging range, methods and timing of feeding of the albatrosses in relation to the size, distribution, buoyancy characteristics (floaters or sinkers), bioluminescence and prey of the squid and access to fishery waste. We conclude that most evidence for scavenging needs critical re-evaluation; nevertheless, whereas wandering albatrosses and possibly light-mantled sooty albatrosses probably depend significantly on scavenged squid, black-browed and especially grey-headed albatrosses are unlikely to do so...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{function}} of polarization vision, the ability to discern the polarization characteristics of light, is well established in many terrestrial and benthic species, its purpose in pelagic <b>species</b> (<b>squid</b> and certain fish and crustaceans) is poorly understood [1]. A long-held hypothesis is that polarization vision in open water is used to break the mirror camouflage of silvery fish, as biological mirrors can change the polarization of reflected light [2, 3]. Although, the addition of polarization information may increase the conspicuousness of silvery fish at close range, direct evidence that silvery fish — or indeed any pelagic animal — are visible at longer distances using polarization vision rather than using radiance (i. e. brightness) vision is lacking. Here we show, using in situ polarization imagery and a new visual detection model, that polarization vision does not in fact appear to allow viewers to see silvery fish at greater distances...|$|E
40|$|The new dinucleating redox-active ligand (LH 4), bearing two redox-active NNO-binding pockets {{linked by}} a 1, 2, 3 -triazole unit, is {{synthetically}} readily accessible. Coordination to two equivalents of PdII {{resulted in the}} formation of paramagnetic (S=inline image) dinuclear Pd complexes with a κ 2 -N,N′-bridging triazole and a single bridging chlorido or azido ligand. A combined spectroscopic, spectroelectrochemical, and computational study confirmed Robin–Day Class II mixed-valence within the redox-active ligand, with little influence of the secondary bridging anionic ligand. Intervalence charge transfer was observed between the two ligand binding pockets. Selective one-electron oxidation allowed for isolation of the corresponding cationic ligand-based diradical <b>species.</b> <b>SQUID</b> (super-conducting quantum interference device) measurements of these compounds revealed weak anti-ferromagnetic spin coupling between the two ligand-centered radicals and an overall singlet ground state in the solid state, which is supported by DFT calculations.

40|$|Seafood {{consumption}} {{habits of}} a subpopulation of Chinese (People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong) and Koreans at the University of Rhode Island was investigated. One {{goal was to}} find out why consumption of seafood in the United States varied from levels subjects reported in home countries. The other was to study purchasing behavior of two important Rhode Island seafood <b>species,</b> <b>squid</b> and mackerel. A mail survey collected data; a detailed discussion of survey results is provided. ^ Regarding consumption patterns, Chinese from the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China indicated that they eat more seafood, while those from Taiwan/Hong Kong and Korea eat less. All three groups eat more beef here. The Chinese (PRC) eat more poultry, while the other two groups eat the same. Chinese (PRC) eat more pork, the Taiwan/Hong Kong group eats the same amount, and the Koreans eat less. ^ Qualitative response models examined the significance of attitudinal variables, cultural and sociodemographic characteristics and consumption of competing proteins in the following decisions: (1) whether to consume less, the same amount or more seafood; (2) the likelihood of purchasing squid and mackerel at given price levels. ^ Results from the frequency of seafood consumption model showed (1) freshness and/or quality was the most important reason behind the consumption level decision; price was not; (2) alternative protein consumption was significant; (3) distance from the coastline of a respondent 2 ̆ 7 s native city, and the country of origin affected decisions. ^ The likelihood of purchasing squid (model 2) and mackerel (model 3) was influenced by (1) market price, prior squid and mackerel purchase, and number of weekly meals including seafood; (2) alternate protein consumption; (3) two attitudinal variables used in Model 1. One was perceived freshness/quality of seafood. The other was PRICE (the importance of price in the seafood consumption decision) whose negative sign indicated that price is important in purchasing a specific <b>species.</b> <b>Squid</b> purchase was also influenced by perceived ability to buy seafood and seafood forms respondents liked, and distance to seafood outlets.

40|$|Acidification {{of ocean}} surface waters by {{anthropogenic}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions is a currently developing scenario that warrants a broadening of research foci {{in the study}} of acid-base physiology. Recent studies working with environmentally relevant CO 2 levels, indicate that some echinoderms and molluscs reduce metabolic rates, soft tissue growth and calcification during hypercapnic exposure. In contrast to all prior invertebrate species studied so far, growth trials with the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis found no indication of reduced growth or calcification performance during long-term exposure to 0. 6 kPa CO 2. It is hypothesized that the differing sensitivities to elevated seawater pCO 2 could be explained by taxa specific differences in acid-base regulatory capacity. In this study, we examined the acid-base regulatory ability of S. officinalis in vivo, using a specially modified cannulation technique as well as 31 P NMR spectroscopy. During acute exposure to 0. 6 kPa CO 2, S. officinalis rapidly increased its blood [HCO 3] to 10. 4 mM through active ion-transport processes, and partially compensated the hypercapnia induced respiratory acidosis. A minor decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) and stable intracellular phosphagen levels indicated efficient pHi regulation. We conclude that S. officinalis is not only an efficient acid-base regulator, but is also able to do so without disturbing metabolic equilibria in characteristic tissues or compromising aerobic capacities. The cuttlefish did not exhibit acute intolerance to hypercapnia that has been hypothesized for more active cephalopod <b>species</b> (<b>squid).</b> Even though blood pH (pHe) remained 0. 18 pH units below control values, arterial O 2 saturation was not compromised in S. officinalis because of the comparatively lower pH sensitivity of oxygen binding to its blood pigment. This raises questions concerning the potentially broad range of sensitivity to changes in acid-base status amongst invertebrates, {{as well as to the}} underlying mechanistic origins. Further studies are needed to better characterize the connection between acid-base status and animal fitness in various marine species...|$|E
40|$|Minimising {{catches of}} non-target animals in a trawl fishery reduces {{the impact on}} a marine {{community}} and may help to sustain the fishery resource in the long term. Hence the desirability for trawls that minimise impacts on non-target species while maintaining catches of target species. This study resulted from a need to further develop easily handled, semi-pelagic style trawls for Australia's Northern Fish Trawl Fishery. In November 1993 we compared catches from three differently rigged versions of a demersal wing trawl: one fished in a standard demersal configuration with its footrope on the sea bed, and two fished semi-pelagically, with their footropes raised to either 0. 4 - 0. 5 or 0. 8 - 0. 9 m above the sea bed. At two sites in the northeast Gulf of Carpentaria, each trawl type was used on the same combination of sites, grids within sites and times of day. Catches of the main target species (Lutjanus malabaricus and Lutjanus erythropterus) by the three trawl types were not significantly different. However, the mean catches of both these species and of other commercially important snappers, were highest in the semi-pelagic trawl raised 0. 4 - 0. 5 m above the sea bed. This increase {{could be due to}} a larger trawl spread or to the whole rig fishing higher in the water column. Of the 107 species of fishes analysed, 61 were caught in greater abundance in the demersal trawl. Seven species were caught more effectively in the semi-pelagic trawl with the footrope 0. 4 - 0. 5 m above the substrate; none was caught most effectively with the footrope set at 0. 8 - 0. 9 m. Epibenthic byproduct <b>species</b> (<b>squid</b> and Thenus orientalis), fish bycatch, sponges and other epibenthic invertebrates were also caught in lower numbers in the semi-pelagic trawls. The semi-pelagic trawls convincingly caught less (in both numbers and biomass) of the unwanted species which are normally discarded. Semi-pelagic fish trawls of the types tested would be suitable for Australia's Northern Fish Trawl Fishery and probably other demersal trawl fisheries that would benefit from the conservation of non-target epibenthic communities...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about male sperm whale movements, {{distribution}} and foraging ecology subsequent to segregation from their natal groups. Taking the north Atlantic population as its subject, this study attempted to investigate hypotheses that were put forward during whaling times by {{using a combination of}} whaling records of male length, stable isotope (SI) analyses of carbon and nitrogen across whale teeth layers and in potential prey (oceanic squid), and distribution data obtained from five years of acoustic surveys in a high latitude region; Regional differences in male length composition in whale catches confirmed some degree of spatial and temporal segregation in male ontogenetic classes. The expected increase in length with increasing latitude was observed, with larger males found generally in the cooler and most productive regions, particularly in mid-summer. The SI profiles in teeth of males stranded in the UK and Ireland showed a decrease in OBC and an increase in 015 N with age as predicted, as the animals start segregating into BC-depleted higher latitudes and possibly feeding at a higher trophic level as they grow in size. The isotopic age-group clusters were linked to two key biological benchmarks: the segregation from natal groups at around 9 - 10 years and the penetration into high latitudes after the age of 20. Profiles' in teeth from males and females from several regions showed variation reflecting differences in ontogeny and environment inhabited, (confirming the potential of using SI in teeth to compare the life-history and movements of different populations. There was significant regional, inter- and intra-specific variation in SI of oceanic squid. The intra-specific variation was related to mantle length, region, latitude and haul depth, confirming that caution is needed when inferring trophic relationships of higher predators. Putative prey samples analysed for SI should be representative of the main potential sources of variation such as in this study. In the deep waters of the Atlantic Frontier, sperm whales occurred frequently, in high densities, and formed loose aggregations spanning large distances. It was confirmed through the detection of 'creaks' that feeding must occur in. the area. Water depth was the most important factor explaining their local distribution, while temperature also explained some of the variability in the whales' presence, possibly through the effect of meso-scale features (fronts and eddies) on prey organisms, particularly in the Faroe-Shetland Channel.

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of 19 mature sperm whales, 18 males and one female, that stranded on New Zealand beaches between the mid 1990 s and 2004 were examined, identified and measured. Three of the stomachs were empty. All other samples consisted {{almost entirely of}} cephalopod beaks. A total of 23, 223 cephalopod beaks (10, 647 upper and 12, 576 lower), representing at least 36 species in 17 families {{were found in the}} remaining 16 stomachs. Non-cephalopod remains in the stomachs of sperm whales stranded in New Zealand included limited quantities of fish, salps, crustacean exoskeletons, a copepod, some wood and sand. The present investigation represents the most comprehensive study of the diet of sperm whales in New Zealand since the early 1960 s. The results show that oceanic squid of the families Histioteuthidae, Cranchiidae, Onychoteuthidae and Octopoteuthidae are the most common remains found in the stomachs of sperm whales stranded on New Zealand beaches, with the families Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae, Octopoteuthidae and Architeuthidae being the most important by estimated weight in whale diet, and the families Cranchiidae, Pholidoteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae secondarily so. The beaks of three cephalopod species thought to be restricted to Antarctic waters (Kondakovia longimana, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni and Psychroteuthis glacialis) were found in 12 of the stomachs, suggesting these whales had recently migrated into New Zealand from more southern feeding grounds. The amount of local cephalopod beaks in the stomachs suggests some of the stranded sperm whales did not feed much within New Zealand waters in the days prior to stranding. The beaks of Taningia danae, Octopoteuthis megaptera, Octopoteuthis sp. 'Giant' and Lepidoteuthis grimaldii are illustrated and described. Oblique and lateral illustrations of the lower beaks are given, as well as sections of the rostrum, jaw angle, shoulder and lateral wall, to show the major identifying features for each of the <b>species.</b> <b>Squid</b> are an important component of food chains in the Southern Ocean and they act as both high-level predators and prey for apex predators. Therefore, seasonal fluctuations in their abundance must have cascading effects on the diets of apex predators. With increasing global fishing effort, and with cephalopods representing over 4 % of the global annual catch, there are competing interests between the ocean's top teuthophagous predators and the fishing industry. Uncertainty of the effects fisheries have on the marine ecosystem has stimulated numerous research studies in recent years. However, despite the economic and ecological importance of cephalopods, there are few ecological studies on them or their significance in the trophic systems of the deep-sea and their life cycles and distribution patterns are only now beginning to be understood. Additional dietary studies that investigate the cephalopod composition and size-class structure in the diet of predators are needed to assess their importance in deepsea food webs, and the potential impact that deep-sea fisheries might have on associated and dependant species, namely apex oceanic predators. The results of this study provide the first significant insight into the diet of the sperm whale, {{one of the most important}} apex predators in New Zealand waters...|$|E
