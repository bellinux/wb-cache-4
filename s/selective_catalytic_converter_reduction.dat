Various reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the NO-CO reaction on Pt(100), which shows bifurcations, kinetic oscillations and multiple steady states under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions due to complex surface dynamics. Some experiments on supported Pt group catalysts reported in literature show oscillations and bistability under atmospheric conditions as well. Industrially relevant conditions require the modelling and detailed analysis of the system at atmospheric pressure. We have proposed a reaction mechanism for the NO-CO system on Pt group catalysts and coupled it with an isothermal PSR model to obtain solutions at atmospheric conditions with the continuation software CONTENT 1. 5, at different operating conditions.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{size of the}} {{car fleet}} makes it important {{to find ways of}} lowering the amounts of pollutants from each individual diesel or gasoline engine to almost zero levels. The pollutants from these engines predominantly originate from emissions at cold start, in the case when gasoline is utilized, and high NOx emissions and particulates from diesel engines. The cold start emissions from gasoline vehicles are primarily due to a high light-off time for the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter.</b> Another reason is the inability to quickly heat the sensor used for controlling the air-to-fuel ratio in the exhausts, also called the lambda value, which is required to be in a particular range for the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> to work properly.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 Automotive exhaust {{emission}} regulations are becoming stricter due to increasing {{awareness of the}} hazardous effects of {{exhaust emission}}s. The main challenge {{to comply with the}} EPA regulations is to reduce the emissions during cold start, because <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> are ineffective until they reach a 'light-off' temperature - the temperature at which the converter starts reducing 50 % of emissions.

Higher concentrations of CO 2 and lower concentrations of reacting species with increased OEGR created higher ignition delays, and hence, lower PM. Results also showed the importance of <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> in <b>reduction</b> of tail-pipe HC, CO and PM. RCCI has been achieved using fuels with different reactivities.
