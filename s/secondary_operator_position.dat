The economic viability {{of supporting the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> service using an opportunistic access to the spectrum owned by the primary operator is assessed. Against the benchmark of the primary operator operating as a monopolist, we show that the entry of the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> is desirable from an efficiency perspective, since the carried traffic increases. Additionally, {{for a range of}} parameter values, a lump sum payment can be designed so that the incumbent operator has an incentive to let the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> enter. Additionally, the opportunistic access setting has been compared against a leasing-based alternative, and we have concluded that the former outperforms the latter in terms of efficiency and incentive...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the scenario where a <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> leases licensed spectrum from a spectrum owner and then serves its end users with both licensed and unlicensed bands. An end user can decide its traffic segmentation {{in terms of the}} percentage of its total amount of traffic demand transmitted via licensed and unlicensed band respectively. The optimal spectrum investment and pricing decision of the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> is studied considering the user-determined traffic segmentation. We model and analyze the interactions among the spectrum owner, the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> and the end users with Stackelberg game. By deriving optimal strategies for the three types of game players, we show that the end users can increase their utility by determining a proper traffic segmentation on the licensed and unlicensed band considering both the service price and the quality of service (QoS). Also the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> and the spectrum owner can make more profit leveraging dynamic spectrum leasing. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{spectrum}} sharing aims to provide secondary access to under-utilized spectrum in cellular networks. The main {{aim of the}} paper is twofold. Firstly, <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> aims to borrow spectrum bandwidths {{under the assumption that}} more spectrum resources exist considering a merchant mode. Two optimization models are proposed using stochastic and optimization models in which the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> (i) spends the minimal cost to achieve the target grade of service assuming unrestricted budget or (ii) gains the maximal profit to achieve the target grade of service assuming restricted budget. Results obtained from each model are then compared with results derived from algorithms in which spectrum borrowings are random. Comparisons showed that the gain in the results obtained from our proposed stochastic-optimization framework is significantly higher than heuristic counterparts. Secondly, post-optimization performance analysis of the operators in the form of blocking probability in various scenarios is investigated to determine the probable performance gain and degradation of the <b>secondary</b> and primary <b>operators</b> respectively. We mathematically model the sharing agreement scenario and derive the closed form solution of blocking probabilities for each operator. Results show how the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> perform in terms of blocking probability under various offered loads and sharing capacity...|$|R

Here, we investigate the interaction of wild-type Mnt and mutants bearing the Arg 2 [...] Lys, His 6 [...] Ala, Asn 8 [...] Ala and Arg 10 [...] Lys mutations with operator DNA modified by methylation or by symmetric base substitutions. The wild-type pattern of methylation interference is altered in specific ways {{for each of the}} mutant proteins.

40|$|Spectrum {{management}} {{based on}} private commons is argued to be a realistic scenario for cognitive radio deployment within the current mobile market structure. A scenario is proposed where a <b>secondary</b> entrant <b>operator</b> leases spectrum from a primary incumbent <b>operator.</b> The <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> innovates incorporating cognitive radio technology, and it competes in {{quality of service}} and price against the primary operator {{in order to provide}} service to users. We aim to assess which benefit users get from the entry of <b>secondary</b> <b>operators</b> in the market. A game theory-based model for analyzing both the competition between operators and the subscription decision by users is proposed. We conclude that an entrant operator adopting an innovative technology is better off entering the market, and that a regulatory authority should intervene first allowing the entrant operator to enter the market and then setting a maximum amount of spectrum leased. This regulatory intervention is justified in terms of users utility and social welfare...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} wh- questions French and the link betweensyntax and pragmatics in this language. French, contrary to all Germanic and most Romance languages, does not use pitch accent to indicate focus domains, but rather a combination of prosodic phrasing and syntactic reformulation.

A formal analysis is provided, based on the relationship between ground and focus in wh-questions, and the theory of wh-doubling developed for Northern Italian dialects by Poletto & Pollock (2004, 2006). In this analysis two distinct <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> are available in French, as in other Romance languages: a higher, disjunction <b>operator</b> <b>position,</b> and a lower, restriction <b>operator</b> <b>position.</b> French exploits both positions, alternating between syntactic forms depending on how the question fits into the thematic development of the context...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{spectrum}} sharing where competitive operators coexist in the same frequency band. First, we model this problem as a strategic non-cooperative game where operators simultaneously share the spectrum according to the Nash Equilibrium (N. E). Given a set of channel realizations, several Nash equilibria exist which renders the outcome of the game unpredictable. For this reason, the spectrum sharing problem is reformulated as a Stackelberg game where the first operator is already being deployed and the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> follows next. The Stackelberg equilibrium (S. E) is reached where the best response of the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> is taken into account upon maximizing the primary operator’s utility function.

30|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{spectrum}} sharing where competitive operators coexist in the same frequency band. First, we model this problem as a strategic non-cooperative game where operators simultaneously share the spectrum according to the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Given a set of channel realizations, several Nash equilibria exist which renders the outcome of the game unpredictable. Then, in a cognitive context with the presence of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>operators,</b> the inter-operator spectrum sharing problem is reformulated as a Stackelberg game using hierarchy where the primary operator is the leader. The Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) is reached where the best response of the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> is taken into account upon maximizing the primary operator's utility function. Moreover, an extension to the multiple operators spectrum sharing problem is given. It is shown that the Stackelberg approach yields better payoffs for operators compared to the classical water-filling approach. Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed distributed approach by comparing its performance to the centralized approach.|$|R
40|$|Teleoperated {{manipulators}} {{have been}} invaluable tools during space missions. Arm operators work in pairs, {{with the primary}} operator controlling the arm and the <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> assisting by monitoring arm clearance and helping to avoid singularities. Individual ability to manipulate the arm and integrate camera views is believed to correlate with 3 subcomponents of spatial intelligence: spatial visualization (SV), mental rotation (MR) and perspective taking (PT). In particular, PT (the ability to imagine an object from another viewpoint) {{is thought to be}} important for integrating camera views. Two experiments were performed; one on primary operator performance, and one on <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> performance. In Experiment 1, 19 naive subjects were trained to manipulate a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) simulated arm using a pair of hand-controllers. Over 18 trials, the disparity between the arm's control frame and the cameras was varied between low (90 degrees) conditions. We used the Cube Comparisons (CC) test to assess SV, the Vandenberg Mental Rotations Test (MRT) to assess MR, and the Purdue Spatial Visualization of Views Test (PSVT) and a Perspective Taking Ability (PTA) test to assess PT. Subjects with high PSVT scores moved the arm more directly to the target and were better at maintaining the required clearance between the arm and obstacles, even without a direct camera view. The subjects' performance degraded under the high disparity condition. In Experiment 2, 11 naive and 9 returning subjects were trained to manipulate the same simulated arm during 6 trials and then acted as a <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> observing an additional 32 trials. (cont.) The MRT, PSVT, and PTA were used to assess spatial abilities. Though the primary operator task was slightly different, we confirmed many results of Experiment 1. Subjects with high PTA scores took less time, moved the arm more directly to the target, and moved the arm more fluidly, especially under the high disparity condition. High scorers on the PSVT and PTA were better at maintaining required clearance. Low PTA scorers looked from monitor to map more often. Prior experience with the arm didn't significantly improve task performance, and performance as primary operator didn't reliably predict performance as a <b>secondary</b> <b>operator.</b> However, subjects with high PSVT scores had better overall <b>secondary</b> <b>operator</b> performance and high PTA scorers were better at detecting problems before they occurred. The results of these studies could be used to customize initial training for astronauts.
