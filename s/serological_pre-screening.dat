The {{epidemiology}} of varicella {{appears to}} be changing: an unexplained upward age shift in varicella prevalence and a subsequent dramatic rise in morbidity and mortality among ado-lescents and adults have highlighted the importance of effective varicella mass vaccination programs. This age shift is being seen in temperate regions but is particularly marked in tropical and sub-tropical regions. To assess the need for <b>serological</b> <b>pre-screening</b> in mass vaccination programs, we performed an open study to compare the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a varicella vaccine in initially seronegative and seropositive subjects to see whether {{there was an increase}} in reactogenicity among initially seropositive subjects. Two hundred and forty-six seronegative and seropositive male and female subjects, aged 9 months to 60 years, received a single dose of a live attenuated varicella virus (Oka-strain) vaccine, VarilrixTM (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). Subjects were categorized according to antibody status and age group; serum antibodies were measured before and after vaccination (day 42). The study showed that {{there was no difference in}} reactogenicity in initially seropositive vaccinees compared with initially seronegative subjects. The varicella vaccine was found to be safe and well tolerated in all age groups. Ninety-eight percent of initially seropositive and 94. 8 % of initially seronegative subjects reported no clinical signs or symptoms during the 42 -day follow-up period. The vaccine was immunogenic in both groups. The seroconversion rate after 6 weeks in initially seronegative subjects was 94. 3 %. In 53. 0 % of initially seropositive subjects of all age classes, a 4 -fold rise in antibody titer was observed...|$|E
