Smoking is far more common among men than it is among women, however, the number of women smokers is on the rise.

5000|$|Of {{particular}} interest to English-speaking students of Hebrew are two related works, which arrived on modern library shelves through parallel paths. In 1833, Gesenius published a Latin work, the Lexicon Manuale Hebraicum et Chaldaicum in Veteris Testamenti Libros, and in 1834 a corresponding issue of the German work, Hebräisches und Chaldäisches Handwörterbuch über das Alte Testament. The Lexicon Manuale was subsequently translated to English in America by Edward Robinson D.D. in 1836.

5000|$|Local {{governments have}} the {{authority}} to inspect and regulate the businesses that operate in tianguis. [...] Regulations such as Article 52 of the Reglamento Interior de la Administration Publica of the Federal District, are supposed to regulate when and where these events take place as well as inspecting locales and products for sale. Vendors can be removed if they exceed the limits set, but many cities have trouble enforcing this, leading to traffic jams. Regulation, such as the checking of scales, and cooking equipment in food stalls, is scarce. Vendors in tianguis are liable under all consumer protection laws as well. [...] However, many authorities readily admit {{that they do not have}} the manpower to enforce laws and regulations in large, crowded and numerous tianguis, although raids are performed sporadically, especially looking for stolen and counterfeit merchandise. Stolen merchandise, especially electronics, and unauthorized CDs and DVDs is the largest criminal activity found in tianguis, with copying of CDs and DVDS one of the most lucrative businesses. Tianguis sellers can be quite sophisticated. According to Iztalapalpa officials, vendors at the El Salado tianguis set up shop as early as 4 or 5 am in order to receive stolen and other merchandise from trucks behind the Unidad Habitacional Concordia Zaragaza housing complex, and use radios to communicate and watch out for authorities Officials claim there are at least ten places in the market that sell drugs and two that sell guns. Much of the allegedly stolen merchandise consists of computer equipment and handheld gadgets such as iPods. The sale of stolen merchandise such as this is popular because it can cost about half of what it does in legal channels. Counterfeit perfumes are a specialty of the tianguis Del Rosal in Colonia Los Angeles. Empty bottles of the real merchandise are bought by the vendors and then filled with the counterfeit perfume. [...] PROFECO, Mexico’s consumer protection agency, advises strong caution when shopping in tianguis as it is extremely difficult to help those who have been a victim of fraud. Another problem is the sale of vehicles that are stolen or illegally imported from the United States. This problem is serious enough to warrant the vigilance of the Procuraduria General de Justicia of Mexico City and <b>special</b> <b>warnings</b> by PROFECO. [...] Restricted items such as medicines, cigarettes and alcohol are also openly sold. Other available restricted merchandise includes fireworks, blades, knives, pornography, endangered species, and smuggled goods. Other articles inlclude hoods, tear gas, fake guns, and sometimes even real guns. Medicines from the government health service can be found in El Salado, which is held on Wednesdays on Calzada Zaragosa. Patches and uniforms from services such as city police and firemen, as well as the electric company and Telmex can be found as well. [...] Lastly, pickpocketing and assault on both merchants and customers is not unknown.Many tianguis have problems in the neighborhoods they occupy. These events are accused of “devouring” streets as regulated and non/regulated ones grow and multiply. The main problem with tianguis is that merchants spread out their wares over sidewalks and other public spaces beyond where they are authorized, blocking pedestrian and vehicular traffic. These places can measure four by four meters on city streets. [...] Monterrey Street in the Del Valle neighborhood of Mexico City is cut from six lanes to three lanes on tianguis days. [...] Another problem is that they block scarce parking space. [...] Residents complain about noise and odor. Lastly, at the end of the day after the stands are taken down and brought home, tons of garbage is left behind, and in areas where market activity is frequent, infrastructure such as light poles and sidewalks are damaged.|$|E

40|$|Bus Stops {{for school}} busses {{incorporate}} a special risk to school children. Most accidents {{on the way}} to school occur at or close to the school bus stops. Modern ITS telecommunication technology can be applied to make bus stops safer and inform car drivers about dangerous bus stops on their route. In order to raise the acceptance of speed limits at bus stops it can help to reliably inform the drivers if there are actually children close to the bus stop. When no children are using the bus stop the traffic can circulate without special precautions. Modern ITST technology can be used to detect the presence of school children. In a European funded project within FP 7 framework the Amparo Solutions tagbased technology is used to detect nearby children who carry a radio transmitter. A bus stop unit receives this information and can activate <b>special</b> <b>warnings</b> to the surrounding traffic. In the current paper an empirical experimental study is described where 3 warning conditions have been compared in a driving simulator: a school bus stop sign, a school bus stop sign with flashing lights on top of it and a school bus stop sign in combination with an invehicle information design. The experimental design allows comparison of driver behavior at bus stops with and without children under the three different warning conditions. Dependent variables are: speed, lateral distance, reaction time to a child jumping on the street and the number of collisions. Overall 60 drivers participate to the driving simulator study. This number allows statistical evidence on the safety effects of different bus stop warnings. Results show that the two warning strategies are highly effective in terms of speed reduction in comparison to not providing any special warning about the children. The comparison of the two warning strategies (road sign with lightning and in-vehicle information) show no significant differences in driver behavior and very small effect sizes. In conclusion either system can be applied to reduce the speed when passing by bus stops with children, the number of collisions however could not be reduced significantly in this study...|$|E
40|$|Background Dapoxetine {{hydrochloride}} is {{a selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor {{and the first}} drug approved for the on-demand treatment of premature ejaculation (PE). Its safety was established in a thorough clinical development program. Objective To characterize the safety profile of dapoxetine in PE treatment and to report the incidence, severity, and type of adverse events. Design, setting, and participants We conducted a 12 -wk, open-label, observational study with a 4 -wk, postobservational contact. A total of 10 028 patients were enrolled, with 6712 patients (67. 6 %) treated with dapoxetine 30 - 60 mg (group A) and 3316 (32. 4 %) treated with alternative care/nondapoxetine (group B). Interventions Treatment with dapoxetine or alternative care/nondapoxetine. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and concomitant therapy use during the 12 -wk observational and the postobservational period were reported. Results and limitations The mean age for all patients was 40. 5 yr. In group A, 93. 0 % of the patients were initially prescribed dapoxetine 30 mg. Treatment options for group B patients included clomipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, topical drugs, condoms, and behavioral counseling. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. TEAEs were reported by 12. 0 % and 8. 9 % of group A and group B, respectively, with the highest incidence observed in patients aged > 65 yr for group A (21. 4 %) and 30 - 39 yr (9. 8 %) for group B. The most commonly reported TEAEs were nausea, headache, and vertigo, with a higher incidence in group A (3. 1 %, 2. 6 %, and 1. 0 %, respectively) than in group B (oral drugs: 2. 3 %, 1. 3 %, and 0. 9 %, respectively). There were no cases of syncope in group A and one case in group B. A major limitation {{is that this was}} a nonrandomized, open-label, short-term study lacking efficacy data. Conclusions The results of this postmarketing observational study demonstrated that dapoxetine for treatment of PE has a good safety profile and low prevalence of TEAEs. Syncope and major cardiovascular adverse events were not reported. The high level of adherence by healthcare providers to the contraindications, <b>special</b> <b>warnings,</b> and precautions for dapoxetine minimizes the risk for its use in routine clinical practice. The current risk minimization measures for its identified and potential risks are effective. © 2013 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor the {{complexity}} of accidents occurredat the intersections, a temporal-spatial collision warning method was proposed. On the basis of vehicle's passing time of the conflict zone, the algorithm calculated probability of accident was established. Due to the deficiencies of considering time coordinate only, spatial coefficient which represented the relationship between actual distance and safety braking distance was used to correct the algorithm. A two-way and two-lane intersection was taken as an example. The drivers were divided into three categories: normal, negative and positive. Finally, <b>special</b> <b>warning</b> method was used to remind different kinds of drivers to avoid accidents. The results illustrated that the system should warn the negative drivers earlier and a delay warning measure should be taken for positive drivers...|$|R
