50|$|After {{counterfeit}} items {{continued to}} be sold on eBay, Tiffany made 5 different demands on eBay in June 2004 - (1.) Prevent sellers from listing 5 or more Tiffany jewelry items at once, (2.) Ban the sale of silver Tiffany jewelry, (3.) Ban the sale of items advertised as counterfeit Tiffany, (4.) Stop advertising the availability of Tiffany merchandise, and (5.) Remove ‘Tiffany’ <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> advertisements on search engines. Although eBay continued to allow the sale of Tiffany jewelry and buy <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> advertisements through a third party, eBay’s refusal to categorically ban sellers listing more than 5 Tiffany items at a time triggered this lawsuit.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} {{results of an}} {{investigation}} into the effect of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> on ecommerce information seeking on the Web. In this research, 56 participants each engaged in six ecommerce Web searching tasks. We extracted these tasks from the transaction log of a Web search engine, so they represent actual ecommerce searching information needs. Using 60 organic and 30 <b>sponsored</b> Web <b>links,</b> the quality of the Web search engine results was controlled by switching nonsponsored and <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> on half of the tasks for each participant. This allowed for investigating the bias toward <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> while controlling for quality of content. The study also investigated the relationship between searching self-efficacy, searching experience, types of ecommerce information needs, and the order of links on the viewing of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links.</b> Data included 2, 453 interactions with links from result pages and 961 utterances evaluating these links. The results of the study indicate that there is a strong preference for nonsponsored links, with searchers viewing these results first more than 82 % of the time. Searching self-efficacy and experience does not increase the likelihood of viewing <b>sponsored</b> <b>links,</b> and the order of the result listing does not appear to affect searcher evaluation of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links.</b> The implications for <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> as a longterm business model are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Paid {{placements}} on {{search engines}} reached sales of nearly $ 11 {{billion in the}} United States last year and represent the most rapidly growing form of online advertising today. In its classic form, a search engine sets up an auction for each search word in which competing websites bid for their <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> to be displayed next to the search results. We model this advertising market, focusing on two of its key characteristics: (1) {{the interaction between the}} list of search results and the list of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> on the search page and (2) the inherent differences in attractiveness between sites. We find that both of these special aspects of search advertising {{have a significant effect on}} sites' bidding behavior and the equilibrium prices of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links.</b> Often, sites that are not among the most popular ones obtain the <b>sponsored</b> <b>links,</b> especially if the marginal return of sites on clicks is quickly decreasing and if consumers do not trust <b>sponsored</b> <b>links.</b> In three extensions, we also explore (1) heterogeneous valuations across bidding sites, (2) the endogenous choice of the number of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> that the search engine sells, and (3) a dynamic model where websites' bidding behavior is a function of their previous positions on the sponsored list. Our results shed light on the seemingly random order of sites on search engines' list of <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> and their variation over time. They also provide normative insights for both buyers and sellers of search advertising. Internet marketing, position auctions, game theory...|$|R
40|$|Search engines {{stand as}} the first entry point to {{internet}} resources for 70 % of users. The results page is therefore an appealing place for advertising {{in the form of}} <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> also called paid results. Yet little academic knowledge has been developed to understand users’ perceptions and behaviors toward <b>sponsored</b> <b>links.</b> In particular it is of foremost importance to delineate factors that influence click intention and behavior. This paper proposes a hierarchy-of-effects model in order to understand surfers’ click on <b>sponsored</b> <b>links.</b> An empirical study is conducted over 349 participants confronted to three different Search Engine Result Pages (SERP) representing three search situations. Results indicate a significant relationship between attitude toward <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> and behavioral intention. In addition, past satisfaction is found to significantly predict click behavior. The contribution of this study for both researchers and practitioners is discussed...|$|R

Network {{decided to buy}} the keyword [...] "ActiveBatch" [...] so that when users searched for [...] "ActiveBatch", Network's website would be displayed as a <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> in separate sections from search results, including Google Search and Microsoft Bing. Systems {{sent a letter to}} Network saying Network's usage of [...] "ActiveBatch" [...] as a keyword was infringing Systems' trademark rights. As a result, Network filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgement of non-infringement. Subsequently, Systems counterclaimed, and asserted trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114 and therefore sought a preliminary injunction against Network's usage of [...] "ActiveBatch".|$|E

5000|$|Purchase of <b>Sponsored</b> <b>Links.</b> In {{response}} to Tiffany's assertion that eBay's practice of purchasing {{search engine advertising}} links constitutes direct trademark infringement, eBay claimed, under 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.Com, Inc. this conduct is not trademark [...] "use" [...] and thus is not infringing. While the Court found that 1-800 Contacts case is distinguishable from the current case, it concluded that the conduct is protected as a nominative fair use {{even if it was}} actually a use of the trademark. The reason is simply that eBay's use of the TIFFANY Marks in <b>sponsored</b> <b>links</b> is effectively identical to that on its own website, and thus the same conclusions can be made.|$|R

5000|$|On 31 October 2007 Radiohead {{announced}} that they were signing a new deal with XL Recordings and that In Rainbows would be released commercially as a CD release. Very soon after, Parlophone announced {{the release of the}} box set. It was released exactly one week after the discbox was due to ship and the physical version retailed for about the same price as the discbox. Radiohead were not involved in the decision to release the box set and did not promote it. It has been suggested that the release of the box set is an act of retribution for losing the rights to selling the commercially lucrative Radiohead albums. Parlophone have denied this and Radiohead have refused to comment on the release. [...] Early in November 2007, search results for the term Radiohead prominently displayed a <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> reading [...] "Radiohead - New Album 'In Rainbows' now available as boxset". The advert, however, led not to the In Rainbows website, but to the website where Parlophone was selling the box set of the six previously released albums. Parlophone soon corrected this error and Radiohead accepted it as a genuine mistake rather than an attempt to deceive.|$|E
40|$|A <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> is an {{innovative}} advertisement format that simplifies the advertising message with text forms. This study {{seeks to investigate}} the perceptions and attitudes of Internet users toward the <b>sponsored</b> <b>link.</b> The research {{is made up of}} two parts. The first part empirically tests the cause-and-effect model of the advertising values and the advertising attitudes. Four advertising characteristics are used as antecedent constructs: informativeness, entertainment, irritation and credibility. The second part of the study performs a cluster analysis according to the information search degrees of Internet users toward and how those four characteristics affect their values and attitudes vice a <b>sponsored</b> <b>link.</b> Using 711 valid replies from the survey, the Partial Least Square analysis shows that the credibility plays the most important role. The cluster analysis segregates the Internet searchers into four groups: light searchers, middle searchers, heavy searchers yet using only a few websites, and heavy searchers. Entertainment is significant for two groups and informativeness shows no importance. The research results imply that Internet users concern more on credible or trustworthy of sponsored links. Irritation generated negative attitudes so that the advertisers should avoid the possible irritating effects of sponsored links such as negative or threatening words...|$|E
40|$|In 2010 {{sponsored}} search advertisements generated over $ 12 {{billion in}} revenue for search engines in the US market and accounted for 46 % of online advertising revenue. A substantial portion of this revenue was generated by the sale of search keywords using an auction mechanism. We analyze a game-theoretic model to understand the interplay between organic and sponsored links in keyword auctions. Our model allows both {{the relevance of the}} advertising firm as well as the position of its <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> to impact click-through-rates. Our results demonstrate how the presence of organic links (links generated by the search engine algorithm) may lead to either more or less aggressive bidding for <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> positions depending on consumer attitudes toward sponsored links {{and the extent to which}} sponsored and organic links are complements or substitutes. In contrast to equilibrium results in existing literature, the rm with the highest value per click does not necessarily win the first spot in the sponsored search listings. It also may be optimal for a firm to bid an amount greater than the expected value (or sale) from a click. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} {{from a study}} investigating the effect of integrating sponsored and nonsponsored search engine links into a single web listing. The premise underlying this research is that web searchers are chiefly interested in relevant results. Given the reported negative bias that web searchers have concerning <b>sponsored</b> <b>links,</b> separate listings may be a disservice to web searchers as it might not direct them to relevant websites. Some web meta-search engines integrate <b>sponsored</b> and nonsponsored <b>links</b> into a single listing. Using a web search engine log of over 7 million interactions from {{hundreds of thousands of}} users from a major web meta-search engine, we analysed the click-through patterns for both <b>sponsored</b> and nonsponsored <b>links.</b> We also classified web queries as informational, navigational and transactional based on the expected type of content and analysed the click-through patterns of each classification. The findings show that for more than 35 % of queries, there are no clicks on any result. More than 80 % of web queries are informational in nature and approximately 10 % are transactional, and 10 % navigational. <b>Sponsored</b> <b>links</b> account for approximately 15 % of all clicks. Integrating <b>sponsored</b> and nonsponsored <b>links</b> does not appear to increase the clicks on sponsored listings. We discuss how these research results could enhance future sponsored search platforms...|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{shopping}} sites facilitate consumers ’ pre-purchase {{evaluation of}} alternatives, and draw increasing traffic to merchants ’ Web sites. As {{the main source}} of revenue, <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> advertising {{has become one of the}} most important aspects for comparison shopping services. However, little is known about the effectiveness of sponsored links and their effects on consumers ’ information processing behavior. In this study, we develop a research model that tries to explain the influence of information presentation on the main stages of consumers’ information processing. The consumer decision process theory from the marketing literature and the information processing theory from social cognition research are employed to develop our model. We also propose that the attitude towards Web advertising will have direct and interaction effects on consumers ’ information processing behavior. Nine research hypotheses are postulated and will be tested in controlled experiments...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{results of an}} {{investigation}} into the effect of sponsored links on ecommerce information seeking on the Web. In this research, 56 participants each engaged in 6 ecommerce Web searching tasks using 60 organic and 30 sponsored Web links for each task. We extracted these tasks from the transaction log of an actual Web search engine, so these queries represent actual ecommerce searching information needs. In the study, we controlled for quality of the Web search engine results by switching organic and sponsored links on three of the six searching tasks for each participant. We counterbalanced the order of presentation among participants. We investigated the perceptions of sponsored links and the factors that influence this bias. Data included 2, 453 interactions with links from result pages and 961 utterances evaluating these links. Findings include that there is a strong preference for organic links, a bias against sponsored results, and that more than 56 % of the time, the title of the <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> was the determining factor in searcher perceived relevance. We discuss implications for sponsored links and paid search as a long-term business model...|$|E
40|$|In 2009 {{sponsored}} search advertisements generated over $ 11 {{billion in}} revenue for search engines in the US market. Most of these advertisements were sold using an auction mechanism. Several existing papers analyze the auction mechanism currently used {{under the assumption that}} customers are only accessed through sponsored links. We extend this literature to incorporate two important market features. In particular, we consider the impact of a second access channel, organic search listings which appear beneath the sponsored links, and we allow for the possibility that both relevance of the advertising firm as well as its position in the <b>sponsored</b> <b>link</b> listings impact the clickthrough-rate. Our results demonstrate that the existence of an outside alternative leads to less aggressive bidding behavior. The outside alternative also creates an important role for the minimum cost-per-click established by the search engine in maximizing auction revenue. In contrast to equilibrium results in the existing literature, the firm with the highest value per click does not necessarily win the first spot in the sponsored search listings. Moreover, under certain conditions, firms adopt a mixed strategy with regard to participation in the keyword auction, but have a pure bidding stratgey when they do enter the auction...|$|E
