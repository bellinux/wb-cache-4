5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set <b>shifting,</b> cognitive <b>shifting,</b> task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E

5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task <b>shifting</b> {{strategies}} {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task <b>shifting,</b> which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task <b>shifting</b> involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E

In some workplaces, {{in this case is}} Pertamina gas station SPBU 74. 94205 Diponegoro, Palu, there is a circumstance where the distribution of operators’ workload is not equal. It is indicated when there are some operators tend to work more than the other operators. This research is focused on identifying the current workload distribution and revising the work <b>shift</b> (7 -hour Morning <b>Shift,</b> 8 -hour Day <b>Shift,</b> 9 -hour Night <b>Shift),</b> which is one factor that impact workload distribution. Two alternatives of work <b>shift</b> model, based on Miller’s suggestion, are proposed to the company. The expected workload distributions of the proposed models are compared to the current work <b>shift’s</b> workload distribution. The result of analysis shows that the current work <b>shift</b> has unequal workload distribution, indicated by its standard deviation, which is higher than the standard deviation of two alternatives of work <b>shift</b> model that have been adjusted. The adjusted work <b>shift</b> model with the lowest standard deviation indicates that the expected workload assigned is more equally allocated.

5|$|Phase <b>shifting</b> {{interferometry}} overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase <b>shifting</b> technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase <b>shifting</b> techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Shift</b> work is {{associated}} with sleep and health problems. Tolerance to <b>shift</b> work is reported to decrease with age. <b>Shift</b> work tolerance {{should be considered in}} different <b>shift</b> work populations. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between age, <b>shift</b> work exposure, <b>shift</b> type, and morningness and sleep/health problems in oil rig <b>shift</b> workers. Material and methods. A total of 199 workers participated. They worked either two weeks of 12 -h day <b>shifts</b> (n = 96) or two weeks of swing <b>shifts</b> (n = 103) (one week of 12 -h night <b>shifts</b> followed by one week of 12 -h day <b>shifts),</b> followed by four weeks off work. The workers filled out questionnaires on demographics, work, sleep, and health. Results. We found no significant associations between age or years of <b>shift</b> work exposure and any of the sleep, sleepiness, or health parameters. There was a significant association between <b>shift</b> type and sleep duration, showing that swing <b>shift</b> workers had longer sleep duration than day <b>shift</b> workers. In addition, we found a significant association between the interaction age*, <b>shift</b> type, and sleep duration, where sleep duration was negatively associated with age for the swing <b>shift</b> workers and positively associated with age for the day <b>shift</b> workers. There were significant associations between morningness and sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and insomnia. Conclusions. Older workers may tolerate <b>shift</b> work well. Age, <b>shift</b> work exposure time, and <b>shift</b> type seemed not to affect <b>shift</b> work tolerance in this population. However, this may be due to a healthy worker effect and/or selection bias. </p...|$|R
