40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the effect of value-added tax on small to medium-sized developers of residential properties in South Africa. Firstly, the way value-added tax is applied to residential properties in South Africa was established. It was ascertained that no special concessions exist with regard to housing. Secondly, the application of value-added tax to residential properties in the United Kingdom was discussed. It was ascertained that supplies relating to new residential premises are zero-rated. Thirdly, the application {{of goods and services}} tax to residential properties in Canada was discussed. Canadian goods and services tax and harmonious sales tax legislation contains a broad range of special concessions relating to residential property developments. The harmonious sales tax which applies in some provinces, is a combination of goods and services tax and a provincial sales tax. Fourthly, the way goods and services tax is applied to residential property developments in Australia was determined. Australian legislation provides for a margin scheme to be applied to the development of residential properties. In terms of the margin scheme, goods and services tax is payable on the basis of profit rather than turnover. Transfer duty as applied in South Africa was examined {{as an alternative to the}} value-added tax being applied on residential properties developed by developers <b>registered</b> <b>for</b> value-added <b>tax</b> purposes. The legislation with regard to developers of residential properties <b>registered</b> <b>for</b> value-added <b>tax,</b> goods and services tax and harmonious sales tax purposes was measured against the principles of taxation. On the basis of these results, an alternative to the current application of value-added tax relating to developers <b>registered</b> <b>for</b> value-added <b>tax</b> purposes in South Africa was proposed that would be in line with that of the selected countries.

We use a unique, proprietary dataset that has the investments of banks at the security level for 2005 - 2012 in conjunction with the credit register from Germany. Analyzing data at the security level for each bank in each period, we find that during the crisis, banks with higher trading expertise increase their overall investments in securities, especially in those that had a larger price drop. The quantitative effects are largest for trading-expertise banks with higher capital and in securities with lower rating and long-term maturity. In fact, there are no differential effects for triple-A rated securities. Moreover, banks with higher trading expertise reduce their overall supply of credit in crisis times - i. e., for the same borrower at the same time, trading-expertise banks reduce lending relative to other banks. This effect is more pronounced for trading-expertise banks with higher capital, and the credit reduction is binding at the firm level. Finally, these differential effects for trading-expertise banks are not present outside the crisis period...|$|R

Formal sector enterprises are legal entities {{of the form}} listed by the Ministry of Manpower. 1 The legal status of a company/unit of economic activity {{is based on the}} legal document prepared by a solicitor when the company was established. Enterprises that are <b>registered</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> purposes or operating permit but do not have the legal status in the definitions listed by the Ministry of Manpower are considered informal. The share of the informal sector declined from almost 80 % in 1990 to 60 % right before the 1998 Asian economic crisis, and the share of the informal sector has been about 65 % since 2000.2 According to a 2004 ILO report (based on BPS estimates), about 55 million of the 90 million workforce are in the informal economy, with the majority in agriculture. Excluding the agricultural sector, 47 % of the workforce is in the informal sector.

A complex analysis of the relevant current legislation is carried out, with special focus on the Act No. 586 / 1992 Coll., On Income taxes, as amended, and Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., The Value Added Tax, as amended. Tax burden is looked at from a narrower, financial perspective, as well as from a wider perspective by looking at non-financial aspects such as the duties and regulations imposed by the bureaucratic state machinery, complications with <b>registering</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> etc. The financial burdens analysed here include tax duties and contributions to health and social insurance.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} <b>registering</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxes</b> on firm profits in Bolivia, {{the country with the}} highest levels of informality in Latin America. A new survey of micro and small firms enables the authors to control for a rich set of measures of owner ability and business motivations that can affect both profits and the decision to formalize. The paper identifies the impact of tax registration on business profitability using the distance of a firm from the tax office where registration occurs, conditional on the distance to the city center, as an instrument for registration. Proximity to the tax office provides firms with more information about registration, but is argued to not directly affect profits. The findings show that tax registration leads to significantly higher profits for the firms that the instrument affects. However, there is also evidence of heterogeneous effects of tax formality on profits. Tax registration is found to increase profits for the mid-size firms in the sample, but to lower profits for both the smaller and larger firms, in contrast to the standard view that formality increases profits. The analysis shows that owners of large firms who have managed to stay informal have higher entrepreneurial ability than formal firm owners, in contrast to the standard view (correct among smaller firms) that informal firm owners have low ability.

5000|$|Egypt made {{starting}} a business easier {{by establishing a}} single access point with standardized application forms in 2004, a one stop shop. Egypt centralized start-up paperwork in a single building, where company charters were to be submitted electronically and reapproved by the registry on the spot. Improvements continued at the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) one-stop shop in Cairo. The number of procedures was supposed to fall from 10 to 7. The entrepreneur can now <b>register</b> <b>for</b> <b>taxes</b> at {{the chamber of commerce}} directly through the one-stop shop. As a result of the reforms, the start-up time and costs were supposedly cut by more than half. Alexandria and Assiut, followed the model in Cairo, although both cities have to send a fax to the central commercial registry in Cairo to check that the company name has not been used. A computerization project is underway so that one-stop shops outside Cairo can issue the tax registration card locally. [...] Since the reform of the GAFI one stop shop in 2004, the total number of companies registered in Cairo more than doubled: 5,700 were registered in 2005 compared with 2,660 in 2003. [...] However, some observers have suggested that Egypt's one stop shop system has not reduced the amount of procedures as much as initially promised.|$|R
40|$|The authors use firm-level {{survey data}} on 998 small and medium {{enterprises}} <b>registered</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> in South Africa regarding tax compliance costs {{to investigate the}} use of outsourcing to complete tax compliance tasks. Overall, about 43 percent of the enterprises do all their tax compliance work in-house, 11 percent outsource all their tax compliance work, and the remaining 46 percent {{use a combination of}} both ("partial outsourcing"). The data display an inverted-U shape <b>for</b> outsourcing of <b>tax</b> compliance tasks: the smallest firms (those under R 300, 000 turnover or well under US$ 50, 000) tend not to outsource, due to a combination of relatively higher cost-burden and less complexity. Relatively larger firms (those with more than R 14 million turnover or about US$ 2 million) report that they have sufficient in-house capacity and therefore do not need to outsource. Those in the middle are most likely to outsource at least some of their tax compliance work, mostly because tax is a specialist field and they presumably lack sufficient capacity in-house. The survey data show that the costs of tax compliance are clearly the highest for those who engage in partial outsourcing, as it appears there is likely duplication of effort. Most such firms could reduce their tax compliance costs (and probably minimize the incidence of post-filing problems) by moving from partial to full outsourcing of all tax compliance work.
