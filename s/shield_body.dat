50|$|In {{the field}} armies {{there was a}} {{component}} of some 15% of cataphractarii or clibanarii, heavily armoured cavalry who used shock tactics. The light cavalry (including the scutarii and promoti) featured high amongst the limitanei, being very useful troops on patrol. They included horse archers (Equites Sagittarii). The infantry of the comitatenses was organized in regiments (variously named legiones, auxilia or just numeri) of about 500-1,200 men. They were still the heavy infantry of old, with a spear or sword, <b>shield,</b> <b>body</b> armour and a helmet.

His weapon is Lampo's <b>Shield,</b> <b>body</b> armor that can give out a huge electrical burst called Corna Fulmine.

40|$|A multidegree-of-freedom {{coupling}} dynamic model, {{which contains}} a joint cutterhead, an inner ring gear, a support <b>shield</b> <b>body,</b> and pinions, is established, considering the external stochastic excitations, time-varying meshing stiffness, transmission errors, clearance, and so forth. Based on {{the parameters of}} an actual project and the strong impact of external excitations, the modal properties and dynamic responses are analyzed, and the cutterhead joint surface loads are obtained and treated by rain flow count. Numerical {{results indicate that the}} low natural frequencies are 57 [*]Hz and 61 [*]Hz, and natural vibration modes are pinions-motors rotational mode and translational-overturning coupled mode of cutterhead with inner ring gear correspondingly. Besides, the axial and radial amplitude of dynamic responses are 0. 55 [*]mm and 0. 25 [*]mm, respectively. The frequencies of radial, torsional, and overturning vibrations are predominantly concentrated in 112 [*]Hz and 120 [*]Hz, which indicates that the vibration responses of cutterhead are mainly affected by the external excitations. Finally, as the rain-flow counting results have shown, the standard deviation of the cutterhead joint surface loads in each direction increases by 12 – 15 times, compared with that of the external excitations; therefore inertia effect should be considered in cutterhead design. The proposed research lays a foundation for dynamic performance optimization and fatigue crack growth life assessment of cutterhead structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this PhD {{research}} {{is the study of}} the underlying processes of evolutionary changes that lead to biological diversity. Such processes include those operating within and between populations (population divergence), as well as those operating among species (speciation), above the species level (e. g. genera and families) and the mechanisms that promote these divisions. Fundamental to these processes are the effects of genetic, demographic, geographical, ecological, behavioural and environmental factors on diversification. Rails (Aves: Rallidae) are used as an example to address central questions related to how these biological entities originated, when was that biological diversity generated, and why this biodiversity is distributed as it is. This thesis has been divided into four main chapters/papers for convenience to achieve this aim. In the first chapter, complete mitochondrial genomes and fossil data are used to provide a likely estimated time of rail ecology. I estimated that the origin and diversification of crown group Rallidae was during the Eocene about 40. 5 (49 – 33) Mya with evidence of intrafamiliar diversification from Late Eocene to Miocene time. This time is much older than currently available fossils assigned to Rallidae, but more direct evidence of fossils with reasonable taxonomy are likely to emerge. This estimated time implies that rail diversity originated deep in the avian tree supporting an inference of deep ancestry of terrestrial/walking habits among Neoaves. In addition, in the second chapter I used neutral molecular data (nuclear and mitochondrial gene fragments) to reveal the degree of historical biogeographic signal and net diversification in the current lineage distribution using the most complete species-level hypothesis for ralloids. This comprehensive intrafamiliar molecular phylogeny allowed to infer spatial and ecological diversification in Rallidae associated with morphological innovation (frontal <b>shield,</b> <b>body</b> size and flightlessness) and the global retention of diversity in several lineages caused by dispersal, adaptation and exploitation of ecological opportunities. In the third and fourth chapters I explored historical patterns of diversification in a biogeographic context (in spatial and temporal scales) within a clade (Porphyrio but focused on the type species Porphyrio porphyrio) and a highly polymorphic species (Gallirallus philippensis). In the third chapter, a dated phylogeny and the tools of population genetics were used to gain insights into the congeneric relationships, diversification, and the history of expansion {{of one of the most}} peculiar clades within Rallidae. I found that the Porphyrio clade arose during the Mid-Miocene, apparently in Africa, with a single Long-Distance Dispersal (LDD) event occurring into the Americas and several other LDD events to the North-East around 10 Mya. Porphyrio porphyrio was not found to be a natural group with P. melanotus appearing in Australasia during the Pleistocene (600 kya). Dispersal, isolation, adaptation and selective pressure accounted for most of the variation found within this clade. On a finer scale, the fourth chapter explored genetic changes within populations of the supertramp and great speciator Gallirallus philippensis using a mitochondrial DNA marker to recognise the genetic changes caused by founder events and provide important insights into the microevolutionary processes that drove the early stages of diversification. This study found that abrupt genetic changes of founder events are related to dispersal, colonisation, range expansion, gene flow, isolation and strong selection forces. The consequences of such processes for speciation and how they affected the population demography and evolutionary history of Gallirallus philippensis in the south western Pacific are discussed. These independent but linked studies within this thesis yield important clues to the evolutionary history that has shaped the diversity of rails. This research contributes to our understanding of Tertiary vertebrate evolution and establishes a bridge between macro– and micro–evolution.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} {{the degree of}} vacuum of a pressure sensor has been proposed and demonstrated to be applicable for detecting vacuum leakage. The principle of this method {{is based on the}} discharge characteristics of Paschen’s law. The <b>shielding</b> <b>body</b> case and the electrode terminals in the sensor are employed as the electrodes for the discharge. The discharge potential is measured under a linearly increasing voltage supply, and from this value the pressure in the sensor is estimated. The measurable range is between 80 and 200 Pa, leakage in pressure sensors...|$|R
