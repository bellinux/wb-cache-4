500|$|Island Records and U2 {{refused to}} make advance copies of the album {{available}} to the press until {{just a few days}} before the release date, preferring that fans listen to the record before reading reviews. The decision came amid rumours of tensions within the band, and journalist David Browne compared it to the Hollywood practice of withholding pre-release copies of films from reviewers whenever they receive poor word-of-mouth press. Achtung Baby was released on 18November 1991 in the UK and 19November in the US on compact disc, tape cassette, and vinyl record, with an initial shipment of more than 1.4million copies in the US. The album was the first release by a major act to use two so-called [...] "eco-friendly" [...] packagesâ€”the cardboard Digipak, and the <b>shrinkwrapped</b> jewel case without the long cardboard attachment. Island encouraged record stores to order the jewel case packaging by offering a four-percent discount.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews towards Sex {{have become}} more positive. The authors of The Porning of America: The Rise of Porn Culture, What It Means, and Where We Go from Here (2008) have commented that [...] "the book is {{particularly}} interesting in the way that, like many of Madonna's works, it portrays sex in terms of domination and power", whereas Jane Raphaely, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan praised Madonna's [...] "liberated behavior on Sex [...] {{the fact that she}} takes all forms of pornography and systematically demystifies it by putting it under her control", in an article in 1996. Brian McNair, author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire (2002) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had [...] "porno elegance" [...] and that [...] "Sex is a cultural phenomenon of global proportions and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence". Priya Elan from The Guardian, wrote: [...] "That the Sex book came after a record-breaking album and tour felt like a <b>shrinkwrapped</b> curve ball. But Madge was expressing something unique". Elan felt that the book was part of a [...] "slower reveal that began with confessional tracks such as 'Oh Father' (from 1989's Like a Prayer) and continued with the many scenes of narcissism captured in [...] In Bed With Madonna".|$|E

It was sold by the U.S. Postal Service, <b>shrinkwrapped,</b> for $7.95.|$|E
40|$|So what is <b>Shrinkwrap</b> all about? For {{those of}} you who may not know about it, <b>Shrinkwrap</b> is a type of data {{structure}} that can manifest itself as a feature or model. It is cleverly covered up, almost hidden, and doesn't get the press or widespread use of a solid or surface. The <b>shrinkwrap</b> feature is located under the data sharing submenu of the feature menu. The <b>shrinkwrap</b> feature, as described by PTC, is a collection of surfaces and datum features of a model that represents the exterior of the model. The advantages and applications of the <b>shrinkwrap</b> feature are in the creation of minimal memory guzzling representations of assemblies. These can be used to represent subassemblies in parent assemblies, and can handle control of dependency issues, geometry represented, and additional references through the use of the <b>shrinkwrap</b> feature options. The <b>shrinkwrap</b> model is an option available under the save as umbrella. Its function, as described by PTC, is to share data with internal and external design groups and improve performance in large assembly design. Some of the benefits of the <b>shrinkwrap</b> model include being able to represent complex assemblies with a single, lightweight part that protects design intent and parametric data, and the ability to improve performance of large assembly modeling in the area of less load time. The proper-scale models can be saved as IGES, STEP, and VRML (for fly-throughs) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which generates a triangular mesh to approximate an iso-surface. It {{starts with a}} triangulation of a sphere and next applies a series of adjustments to this triangulation to transform it into the required surface. It {{is based on the}} <b>shrinkwrap</b> method ([Overveld 93]), but unlike the original <b>shrinkwrap</b> algorithm, it allows for arbitrary topological genus of the resulting iso-surface. As the original <b>shrinkwrap</b> algorithm, the new {{algorithm is}} adaptive {{in the sense that the}} lengths of the sides of the triangles in the mesh vary with the local curvature of the underlying surface...|$|R

50|$|PC-MOS also figured {{prominently}} in the lawsuit Arizona Retail Systems, Inc. v. The Software Link, Inc., where Arizona Retail Systems claimed The Software Link violated implied warranties on PC-MOS. The case is notable because The Software Link argued that it had disclaimed the implied warranties via a license agreement on the software's <b>shrinkwrap</b> licensing. The result of the case, which Arizona Retail Systems won, helped to establish US legal precedent regarding the enforceability of <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses.|$|R

50|$|Until the 2000s with {{emergence}} of the Internet, retail software represented {{the vast majority of}} all end consumer software used and was referred to as shrinkware because software almost always ships in a <b>shrinkwrapped</b> box.|$|E
50|$|Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology {{was a case}} in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit {{primarily}} concerned with the enforceability of box-top licenses and end user license agreements (EULA) and their place in U.S. contract law. During the relevant period, Step-Saver Data Systems was a value-added reseller, combining hardware and software from different vendors to offer a fully functioning computer system to various end users. Step-Saver's products included software produced by Software Link, Inc (TSL), computer terminals produced by Wyse Technology, and main computers produced by IBM. The fundamental question raised {{in this case was}} whether the <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses accompanying TSL's software were legally binding, given that different terms were negotiated over the phone with Step-Saver prior to receiving physical copies of the software. The case was first heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where the court ruled that the <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses were legally binding. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit subsequently reversed this decision, ruling that the <b>shrinkwrap</b> licenses were not legally binding.|$|R
50|$|UCITA {{focuses on}} {{adapting}} current commercial trade laws {{to the modern}} software era. It is particularly controversial in terms of computer software. The code would automatically make a software maker liable for defects and errors in the program. However, it allows a <b>shrinkwrap</b> license to override any of UCITA's provisions. As a result, commercial software makers can include such a license in the box and not be liable for errors in the software. Free software that is normally distributed through downloads, however, {{would not be able}} to force a <b>shrinkwrap</b> license and would therefore be liable for errors. Small software makers without legal knowledge would also be at risk.|$|R
5000|$|Apple Computer: Apple was a {{very early}} client of the firm; the firm advised Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak on the {{incorporation}} {{of the company and}} also advised Apple on the creation of the first <b>shrinkwrap</b> license agreement in 1976.|$|R

50|$|In 1991 GG {{recorded}} what {{is widely}} regarded to be his masterpiece, an album entitled Murder Junkies, released by New Rose Records, featuring Antiseen as his backing band. This album contained ten musical tracks and ten spoken-word pieces. Other than Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies, Allin considered this album {{to be the one}} that most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the War in My Head - I'm Your Enemy album released on Awareness Records and featuring the band <b>Shrinkwrap.</b> This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a collage of spoken-word pieces which <b>Shrinkwrap</b> put to music.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} vinyl {{release of}} Dirty Work came <b>shrinkwrapped</b> in dark red cellophane. Breaking with Rolling Stones tradition, Dirty Work {{was the first}} of their studio albums to contain a lyric sheet in the US, apparently at the insistence of then-distributor CBS Records. Also included was a comic strip, drawn by Mark Marek, called [...] "Dirty Workout".|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the court did}} not {{consider}} Quanta to have foreclosed the enforcement of the <b>shrinkwrap</b> restrictions under state contract law. The contract law aspects of the case became moot, however, because Lexmark voluntarily dismissed its claims based on Static Control's tortious interference with contract.|$|R

50|$|Xandros Open Circulation Edition (OCE) was a freely redistributable edition for {{non-commercial}} use, with {{a limited}} set of additional software. Soon after the 4.0 version was released as a DVD <b>shrinkwrapped</b> with Linux magazines, the torrent was pulled from Xandros' servers and all references to OCE removed from the Xandros website without explanation. Previous versions of Xandros OCE were generally released about 4 months {{after the release of}} the commercial versions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{enforceability}} of an EULA {{depends on}} several factors, {{one of them}} being the court in which the case is heard. Some courts that have addressed {{the validity of the}} <b>shrinkwrap</b> license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as contracts of adhesion, unconscionable, and/or unacceptable pursuant to the U.C.C.â€”see, for instance, Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.. [...] Other courts have determined that the <b>shrinkwrap</b> license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, Microsoft v. Harmony Computers, Novell v. Network Trade Center, and Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc. may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.|$|R
5000|$|Vault v. Quaid {{established}} that state law {{could not be}} used to preempt copyright law. Dyk agreed that a private agreement could be used to preempt copyright law, however, a <b>shrinkwrap</b> license is similar to a state law because the customer does not have an opportunity to renegotiate the license agreement.|$|R
5000|$|Mules {{are also}} used to conceal styling changes and visible {{telltales}} of performance alterations in near-production vehicles, receiving varying degrees of camouflage to deceive rival makers and thwart a curious automotive press. Such alterations can span from distracting <b>shrinkwrap</b> designs to substituting crude cylindric shapes for taillights, non-standard wheels, or assemblages of plastic and tape to hide a vehicle's shape and design elements.|$|R
