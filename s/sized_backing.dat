5000|$|Some vendor-specific {{external}} drive enclosures (Maxtor) {{are known to}} use HPA to limit the capacity of unknown replacement hard drives installed into the enclosure. When this occurs, the drive {{may appear to be}} limited in size (e.g. 128 GB), which can look like a BIOS or dynamic drive overlay (DDO) problem. In this case, one must use software utilities (see below) that use READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS and SET MAX ADDRESS to change the drive's reported <b>size</b> <b>back</b> to its native size, and avoid using the external enclosure again with the affected drive.|$|R
50|$|Auxospores are {{involved}} in re-establishing the normal size in diatoms because successive mitotic cell divisions leads to a decrease in cell size. This occurs because each daughter cell produced by cell division inherits {{one of the two}} valves that make up the frustule (a silica cell wall), and then grows a smaller valve within it. Consequently, each division cycle decreases the average size of diatom cells in a population. When its size becomes too small, a dividing diatom cell produces an auxospore to expand its cell <b>size</b> <b>back</b> to that which is normal for vegetative cells.|$|R

50|$|Titan has {{the ability}} to {{increase}} his size and mass at will and decrease his <b>size</b> <b>back</b> to normal height. Titan's extra mass is drawn psionically from an extra-dimensional source, to which it returns as he decreases in size. His weight increases as a cube (factor multiplied by itself three times) as he grows in height. As Titan grows in height, his strength, stamina, and durability increase proportionately, even to superhuman levels at large enough sizes. Titan's costume is made of Shi'ar fabrics mimicking the properties of unstable molecules, making them able to expand and contract as Titan changes size.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The p-Ge {{terahertz}} laser {{with flat}} external cavity mirrors exhibits intensity modulations at well-defined nonequidis-tant frequencies in the 8 – 80 -MHz range, resulting from beating of transverse modes. A theoretical {{description of the}} mode structure of this cavity is given. Results compare well with experimental data on beat frequencies and far-field beam profiles obtained using a metal mesh out-coupling window. Based on calculations, a cavity with a reduced <b>size</b> <b>back</b> mirror is proposed to suppress higher order transverse modes. Experiments prove that a reduction of the mirror to about 70 % of the end-face surface leads to an effective suppression of the intensity modulations. Such a cavity exhibits a strongly improved pulse-to-pulse stability of the output and a much better shape of the micro pulse train under mode-locked operation.

50|$|The 2014 {{competition}} {{kicked off}} on 24 February 2014, and concluded {{with the final}} on 10 May 2014. The competition was reduced in <b>size</b> <b>back</b> down to eight teams, and was originally going to feature Linfield, who were inaugural winners of the competition in 2005 and had appeared in all eight competitions to date, and 2012-13 IFA Premiership champions Cliftonville. However, in December 2013 both clubs declined the invitation to take part, citing match scheduling and reduced prize money as their reasons for deciding not to enter. As a result, the fifth and sixth placed sides from the 2012-13 IFA Premiership, Ballinamallard United and Coleraine were invited to take their place, with both clubs accepting the invitation. A prize fund of €73,000 was distributed in the competition. Sligo Rovers defeated Dundalk 1 - 0 in the final in Tallaght.|$|R
5000|$|The Addison Act 1919, and the {{resulting}} wave of mass council housing in the early 1920s {{was among the first}} generation of houses in the country to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. However, some council houses were still being built with outdoor toilets, attached to the house, until well into the 1930s. Some of the earliest council houses did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design which allowed it to double as a work surface. These new houses had two, three, four or five bedrooms, and generously <b>sized</b> <b>back</b> gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at 12 houses per acre. However, later in the 20th century these houses were modernised to feature modern bathrooms and indoor toilets.|$|R

25|$|Competition {{shooters}} {{also often}} sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5mg) increments. The bullet {{is placed in}} the case mouth by hand, and then seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also <b>sized</b> <b>back</b> down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper crimps are used for cases that are held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll crimps may be used for cases that headspace on a rim or on the cartridge neck. Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|R
