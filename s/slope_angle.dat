5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the <b>slope</b> <b>angle</b> reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Background: Slipped capital femoral {{epiphysis}} is {{a condition}} with potentially severe complications. Controversy remains as to when to undertake prophylactic pinning. We aimed to assess {{the utility of the}} posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> as a predictor for contralateral slip in a large, multi-ethnic cohort including Polynesian children with a high incidence of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Methods: All patients presenting to our hospital between 2000 and 2009 were identified and records were reviewed to determine demographic data and determine whether they subsequently developed a contralateral slip. The presenting radiographs were reviewed and the posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> was measured. Patients with bilateral slips at presentation and those without initial radiographs were excluded. Results: Records and radiographs of 132 patients were analyzed for the posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> in the unaffected hip. Forty-two patients who had subsequently developed a contralateral slip had a mean posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> (and standard deviation) of 17. 2 degrees +/- 5. 6 degrees, which was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) than that of 10. 8 degrees +/- 4. 2 degrees for the ninety patients who had had a unilateral slip. Children who had developed a subsequent contralateral slip were significantly younger (11. 1 years) than those who had developed a unilateral slip (12. 2 years) (p < 0. 001). If a posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> of 14 degrees were used as an indication for prophylactic fixation in this population, thirty-five (83. 3 %) of forty-two contralateral slips would have been prevented, and nineteen (21. 1 %) of ninety hips would have been pinned unnecessarily. The number needed to treat to prevent one subsequent contralateral slip is 1. 79. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date that confirms that the posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> is a reliable predictor of contralateral slip and can be used to guide prophylactic pinning. The posterior <b>sloping</b> <b>angle</b> is applicable in the high-risk Polynesian population and could be useful in preventing future slips in populations that are difficult to follow up...|$|R

25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane. The {{angle of internal friction}} is thus closely related to the maximum stable <b>slope</b> <b>angle,</b> often called the angle of repose.|$|E
25|$|Avalanche {{formation}} {{requires a}} slope shallow enough for snow to accumulate but steep {{enough for the}} snow to accelerate once {{set in motion by}} the combination of mechanical failure (of the snowpack) and gravity. The angle of the slope that can hold snow, called the angle of repose, depends on a variety of factors such as crystal form and moisture content. Some forms of drier and colder snow will only stick to shallower slopes, while wet and warm snow can bond to very steep surfaces. In particular, in coastal mountains, such as the Cordillera del Paine region of Patagonia, deep snowpacks collect on vertical and even overhanging rock faces. The <b>slope</b> <b>angle</b> that can allow moving snow to accelerate depends on a variety of factors such as the snow's shear strength (which is itself dependent upon crystal form) and the configuration of layers and inter-layer interfaces.|$|E
25|$|The second {{method used}} was the linear-plus-cubic diffusion, {{which is a}} model of fault scarping. This method uses the {{diffusive}} process on hill slopes, such as rain-splash and wind erosion, that move sediment down hill. t = t’(SO)*2/k (0). The last method used to date the faulting was the morphologic dating without numerical model. Such a technique requires that down slope debris instability is a timedependent function of <b>slope</b> <b>angle,</b> in units of volume per time per length of contour (Nash, 2005). The scarp ages can be determined based on the relationship Ta/Tb = H*-2 b / H-2 b From the first method we can conclude that there were at least five seismic events that did not occur at the same time. From method two we can say than the faulting ages between 57ka to 377ka with surface offset of 11.2m that had a magnitude of 6-7 earthquakes. Finally the third method of dating concludes that the relative ages of the east Potrillo fault scarps ranges form 153,000 to 239,000.|$|E

A similar relationship for experimentally formed fluidization craters has been established by Siegal (1971). This relationship is examined {{in terms of the}} geometry of the crater and the <b>slope</b> <b>angles</b> of loose materials. The parameter varies from 1. 40 to 1. 65 and is found to be dependent on mean interior flat floor radius, exterior and interior rim <b>slope</b> <b>angles,</b> angle of aperture of the crater cone, and the volume fraction of crater void accounted for in the rim.

2500|$|Improperly banked road curves {{increase}} the risk of run-off-road and head-on crashes. A 2% deficiency in superelevation (say, 4% superelevation on a curve that should have 6%) can be expected to increase crash frequency by 6%, and a 5% deficiency will increase it by 15%. Up until now, highway engineers have been without efficient tools to identify improperly banked curves and to design relevant mitigating road actions. A modern profilograph can provide data of both road curvature and cross <b>slope</b> (<b>angle</b> of incline). A practical demonstration of how to evaluate improperly banked turns was developed in the EU Roadex III project. [...] See the linked referenced document below.|$|E
2500|$|Slopes flatter than 25degrees or steeper than 60degrees {{typically}} {{have a lower}} incidence of avalanches. Human-triggered avalanches have the greatest incidence when the snow's angle of repose is between 35 and 45degrees; the critical angle, the angle at which human-triggered avalanches are most frequent, is 38degrees. When the incidence of human triggered avalanches is normalized by the rates of recreational use, however, hazard increases uniformly with <b>slope</b> <b>angle,</b> and {{no significant difference in}} hazard for a given exposure direction can be found. [...] The rule of thumb is: A slope that is flat enough to hold snow but steep enough to ski has the potential to generate an avalanche, regardless of the angle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approximate}} {{age of the}} East Potrillo’s faulting {{is estimated}} to be around 57,000 to 377,000years. The age of the faulting was determined by the utilization of three different processes that show similar results on the dates of the faulting on the east Potrillo mountains that is caused by the Rio Grande rift. [...] The first method to determine age was the scarp heightslope-angle relationship created by Buckman and Anderson in 1979. The maximum scarp angle increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the scarp height. In other terms, plotting the maximum height of a slope versus the maximum <b>slope</b> <b>angle</b> allows the age of the fault to be estimated; since the shallower the angle is the older the fault scarp becomes.|$|E
