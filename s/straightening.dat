5|$|The highway {{commission}} approved another alteration to US-59 in the Poteau area on February 5, 1973. On that date, {{the commission}} approved a realignment of US-59 {{from a point}} south of the intersection with US-270 and US-271, to that junction, and on into Poteau. The realignment was submitted to AASHO on April 10 of that year, received on April 13, and approved on June 26. A section of highway north of Jay was straightened on October 7, 1974. Another <b>straightening</b> was approved the following year, {{this time in the}} vicinity of Heavener; this change was approved by the highway commission on August 19, 1975, and approved by AASHO, now renamed to , on July 13, 1976. On March 7, 1977, the Oklahoma State Transportation Commission (which had replaced the highway commission) approved another <b>straightening</b> in the Howe area. The realignment was approved by AASHTO on July 7, 1977.|$|E
5|$|A painter whose {{creative}} output spanned {{nearly three}} decades, controversy erupted briefly in 1999, when disputed declarations {{were made by}} the artist regarding whether some works under his signature had been painted by some female relatives. Creator of the work <b>Straightening</b> spears at Ilyingaungau (1990), Tolson's paintings are held by several major Australian public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, National Gallery of Victoria and the National Museum of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Major {{exhibitions}} in which Turkey Tolson's work has featured have included Papunya Tula: Out of the Australian desert at the National Museum of Australia in 2010, and Almanac: The gift of Ann Lewis AO at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, also in 2010. The following year, his painting Spear <b>straightening</b> ceremony (1993) {{was included in}} a Newcastle Region Art Gallery exhibition, Speaking in Colour.|$|E

5|$|The first {{change to}} the highway's {{alignment}} occurred on November 1, 1966, when SH-51 was straightened between Stillwater and Yale; SH-108 was realigned to continue to concur with SH-51. Around the same time, the remainder of SH-108 was paved. The final change to SH-108 was made on June 4, 1974, when a <b>straightening</b> of SH-33 resulted in a slight extension of SH-108 to continue to meet the new highway. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and <b>straightening</b> of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{discussion}} {{about how the}} episode should end, the writers decided {{that they did not}} want Barney to return to being drunk {{at the end of the}} episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, <b>straightening</b> his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E

50|$|When {{the knee}} joint {{contains}} excess fluid, {{it may become}} difficult or painful to bend or <b>straighten.</b> Fluid may also show under the knee when <b>straightened.</b> Icing may help to decrease swelling. Heat may help relax {{the muscles of the}} knee.|$|R
5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and <b>straightening</b> their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are {{burrowing}} specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, had invested considerably during the early 19th century in <b>straightening</b> the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways to increase trade to recoup those costs.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform <b>straightening</b> procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E
40|$|It {{is an open}} {{problem to}} {{determined}} whether a polygonal chain can be <b>straightened</b> inside a confi ning region if its links {{are not allowed to}} cross. In this paper we propose a special case: whether a polygonal chain can be <b>straightened</b> inside a circle without allowing its links to cross. We prove that this is possible if the <b>straightened</b> confi guration can fi t within circle. Then we show that these simple chains have just one equivalence class of confi gurations...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as <b>straightening</b> the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of <b>straightening</b> the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while <b>straightening</b> of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E

50|$|Conversely, {{relaxation}} of the puborectalis reduces the {{pull on the}} junction of the rectum and the anal canal, causing the anorectal angle to <b>straighten</b> out.

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for <b>straightening</b> wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E
5|$|NY177 {{continues}} winding {{itself to}} the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in {{to the south and}} east, <b>straightening</b> out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR95. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY177 continues eastward past CR189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY177 crosses the county line into Lewis County, where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY177 intersects with CR21 and CR2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR21 is the former southern terminus of NY194, a designation eliminated in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Bothell Road {{became part}} of the Pacific Highway in 1915, which would {{continue}} north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and <b>straightening</b> of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.|$|E
