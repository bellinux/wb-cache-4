50|$|In {{all cases}} the {{anisotropic}} material, for example, a thermosetting resin containing conductive particles, is first deposited {{on the base}} substrate. This may be done using a lamination process for ACF, or either a dispense or printing process for ACP. The device or <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> is then placed in position over the base substrate and {{the two sides are}} pressed together to mount the <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> or device to the base substrate. In many cases this mounting process is done with no heat or a minimal amount of heat that is just sufficient to cause the anisotropic material to become slightly tacky. In the case of using a thermosetting resin containing conductive particles, the particles are trapped between prominent points, such as electrodes, between the substrate and the component, thereby creating an electrical connection therebetween. Other particles are insulated by the thermosetting resin. In some cases this mounting step is skipped and the two sides go directly to the bonding portion of the process. In high volume manufacturing, however, this would lead to inefficiencies in the manufacturing process, so direct bonding is usually done only in the lab or in small scale manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|Co-metabolism {{is defined}} as the {{simultaneous}} degradation of two compounds, in which the degradation of the second compound (the <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate)</b> depends on the presence of the first compound (the primary substrate). This is in contrast to simultaneous catabolism, where each substrate is catabolized. For example, in the process of metabolizing methane, propane or simple sugars, some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1, can degrade hazardous chlorinated solvents, such as tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene, that they would otherwise be unable to attack. They do this by producing methane monooxygenase, an enzyme which is known to oxidize numerous compounds, including pollutants such as chlorinated solvents, via co-metabolism. Co-metabolism is thus used as an approach to biological degradation of hazardous solvents.|$|E

50|$|Several {{types of}} {{reporter}} genes {{are available for}} use in the construction of bioreporter organisms, and the signals they generate can usually be categorized as either colorimetric, fluorescent, luminescent, chemiluminescent or electrochemical. Although each functions differently, their end product always remains the same - a measurable signal that is proportional to the concentration of the unique chemical or physical agent to which they have been exposed. In some instances, the signal only occurs when a <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> is added to the bioassay (luxAB, Luc, and aequorin). For other bioreporters, the signal must be activated by an external light source (GFP and UMT), and for a select few bioreporters, the signal is completely self-induced, with no exogenous substrate or external activation being required (luxCDABE).

50|$|The {{substrate}} {{plays the}} most important part in determining the rate of the reaction. This is because the nucleophile attacks {{from the back of the}} substrate, thus breaking the carbon-leaving group bond and forming the carbon-nucleophile bond. Therefore, to maximise the rate of the SN2 reaction, the back of the substrate must be as unhindered as possible. Overall, this means that methyl and primary substrates react the fastest, followed by <b>secondary</b> <b>substrates.</b> Tertiary substrates do not participate in SN2 reactions, because of steric hindrance. Structures that can form highly stable cations by simple loss of the leaving group, for example, as a resonance-stabilized carbocation, are especially likely to react via an SN1 pathway in competition with SN2.|$|R

In addition to conventional analytical techniques, solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to follow the cellular distribution of [1 - 13 C]acetate {{in the presence of}} unlabeled phenol. With 5 mM acetate as the primary substrate, Pseudomonas sp. 9 S 8 D 2 removed 1 mM phenol (<b>secondary</b> <b>substrate)</b> at a rate of 2 nmol/mg of total cell protein. Although extensive acetate metabolism was indicated by a significant redistribution of the carboxyl label, this redistribution was not affected by the presence of phenol as a <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate.</b> When the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> roles were reversed, however, the presence of 1 mM phenol altered the metabolism of 0. 1 mM acetate, as evidenced by both the two- to fourfold increases in carboxyl label that appeared in terminal methyl and acyl chain methylene carbon resonances and the decrease in label that occurred in the carbohydrate spectral region. These results suggest that, when phenol is present as the primary substrate, acetate is preferentially shuttled into fatty acyl chain synthesis, whereas phenol carbon is funnelled into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, simultaneous use of a xenobiotic compound and a natural substrate apparently does occur, and the relative concentrations of the two substrates do influence the rate and manner in which the compounds are utilized.

40|$|The {{performance}} of an Evolutionary Algorithm on a search problem is critically effected by the substrate used to encode the candidate solutions of the problem. In {{addition to the}} challenge of designing evolvable genetic substrates, two-population competitive coevolutionary algorithms (coEAs) and developmental Evolutionary Algorithms(devo-EAs) present another substrate-related design problem. Both involve an additional substrate with its own mechanism of change. In coEAs, test-cases are encoded with an independent genetic substrate having its own variation operators. In devo-EAs, phenotypes are composed of a distinct substrate with associated generative mechanisms capable of changing an individual's form and size during development. Though this "secondary" substrate is a distinctive feature of both algorithms, the design problem it poses remains poorly understood. This dissertation proposes novel formal models to characterize how the properties of the <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> influences the performance devo-EAs and coEAs respectively. Firstly, we propose a computational model for devo-EAs which shows that the point in time at which the development of a phenotype halts can introduce selection biases that can cause an empirically measurable retardation in the {{performance of}} a devo-EA. Furthermore, a Genotype-Phenotype map that is bias-free is formally equivalent to a Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative multi-player game, where each genotype is a player, the possible halting points are strategies and the payoffs are related to the fitness function. We show that algorithmic solutions to find this Nash map are expensive without a suitable <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate.</b> Secondly, we propose a novel search space model for Pareto coevolution that formally defines the evolvability properties required of the <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> for pathology-free learning with a mutation-only coEA. With this model, we show that on boolean classification problems (a) the variational properties of the <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> are a property of the problem class rather than tied to individual problems, and (b) the absence of coevolutionary pathologies does not imply success in finding high-quality solutions. Rather than being mysterious dynamical properties of coEAs, these findings are transparently explained using Machine Learning first principles...|$|E

Some printing methods {{that are used}} include lithography, micro-contact printing, and inkjet printing. These methods all require specialized instrumentation, hazardous chemicals, and complicated and tedious steps that increase cost of manufacturing. Nano-contact printing is an alternative solution which relies on the specificity of DNA to direct molecules into precise patterns. This study attempts to find the limitations of nano-contact printing through the printing of oligonucleotide monolayers. Eight pattern transfers were made with one master copy and the oligonucleotide surface coverage was analyzed using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The percent coverage of oligonucleotide was then calculated from the tapping mode AFM phase images. Two general trends were found. The oligonucleotide surface coverage on the master increased slightly, while the surface coverage on the pattern transfers decreased. One {{possible explanation for the}} trends is that the decrease in contact between master and <b>secondary</b> <b>substrate</b> is due to both the accumulation of dirt and the wear and tear of' the master.

40|$|Invasive species {{threaten}} the biodiversity of estuaries worldwide. To examine {{the relationships between}} biodiversity, invasibility, and invasion success, I conducted field surveys and experiments in San Francisco Bay marine fouling communities, including 1) surveys to estimate alpha, gamma, and beta diversity of native, non-native and cryptogenic components of the community; 2) experiments to assess the influence of diversity and resource availability on short-term recruitment of novel non-indigenous species (NIS) into test communities and subsequent community development over time; and 3) an experiment to explore the role of facilitative interactions of NIS in the diversity-invasibility relationship. Surveys (10 - 24 sites) showed that non-native alpha diversity was significantly greater than native or cryptogenic alpha diversity, beta diversity was significantly greater for native and cryptogenic species than for NIS, and gamma diversity was similar for NIS and native species. These results indicate that native species had high turn over from site to site while NIS were spread throughout the Bay. Experiments showed that on short time scales (2 - 4 weeks), the effect of initial diversity on the density of recruitment of NIS was significant and negative, with no effect of resource level (increased open space). Changes in community composition over time (2 - 24 weeks) also indicated significant inverse relationships between percent cover of NIS and diversity of the initial community with {{no evidence of a}} resource effect. Abundant NIS occupied less space in communities with higher initial diversity. However, the same NIS occupied (i. e., had invaded) all experimental communities regardless of starting diversity. Additional experiments revealed that recruitment to <b>secondary</b> <b>substrates</b> did not vary significantly with invasive species diversity or resource availability. When total recruitment to primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>substrates</b> were combined, there was no longer a significant relationship between diversity and recruitment. Analysis of secondary settlement patterns revealed that some NIS, such as Bugula neritina, were facilitating recruitment and settlement of additional NIS. In contrast, other species, such as Clathria prolifera and Botryllus schlosseri, inhibited secondary settlement of NIS. The influence of diversity and primary resource availability on secondary settlement did not appear to affect settlement on facilitative species, but reduced settlement on inhibitive species...|$|R
