In that system, high-pressure cylinders were mounted outside the frame and were connected with the second driving axle, while low-pressure cylinders were connected with the crank axle of the first driving axle.

50|$|Superheater {{operation}} {{is similar to}} that of the coils on an air conditioning unit, although for a different purpose. The steam piping is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace. The temperature in this area is typically between 1300 and 1600 C. Some superheaters are radiant type; that is, they absorb heat by radiation. Others are convection type, absorbing heat from a fluid. Some are a combination of the two types. Through either method, the extreme heat in the flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within. While the temperature of the steam in the superheater rises, the pressure of the steam does not and the pressure remains the same as that of the boiler. Almost all <b>steam</b> <b>superheater</b> system designs remove droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and associated piping.|$|E

A practicable procedure was developed for the welding of this transition joint and {{the properties of the}} weld were evaluated by mechanical testing and metallurgical evaluation. After evaluating the technical aspects of the project and their relation to the fabrication of the generator, it was considered desirable to overlay the welding edge of the 2 1 / 4 % Cr- 1 % Mo steel with a suitable austenitic weld metul which would subsequently be welded to the type 316 stainless steel of the superheater. Austenitic stainless steel and high-nickel alloy weld metals were evaluated for the overlay; whereas only austenitic stainless steel weld metals were evaluated for the final weld joining the components. It was concluded that type 309 stainless steel weld metal deposited automatically by the submergedarc process is completely satisfactory for cladding the 2 1 / 4 % Cr- 1 % Mo base metal and for making the final transition weld joining the <b>steam</b> drum and <b>superheater</b> sections of the generator. Supplementary mechanical tests, metallographic examinations, and hardness surveys further attested to the adequacy {{of the quality of the}} transition joint resulting from the procedures developed by this program. A detailed fabrication and thermal treatment specification is included for the welding of a transition joint betwee...|$|R
