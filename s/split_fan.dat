50|$|Professional American football, {{especially}} its established top level, the National Football League (NFL), {{has had a}} long and complicated history in Los Angeles, which is the center of the second-largest media market in the United States. Los Angeles was the first city on the West Coast of the United States to host an NFL team of its own, when the former Cleveland Rams relocated to Los Angeles in 1946 and played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum ("The Coliseum") from 1946 until 1979. The Rams, after moving to suburban Anaheim, California in 1980, were joined in the Los Angeles metropolitan area by the Los Angeles Raiders when that team moved into the Coliseum in 1982. A combination of a <b>split</b> <b>fan</b> base and earthquake damage to the Coliseum prompted both teams to leave Los Angeles simultaneously prior to the 1995 season: the Raiders returned to their original home of Oakland, California, while the Rams began a 21-year tenure in St. Louis, Missouri.|$|E

One important device relevant for {{this study is the}} notion of tilting sheaf. This thesis is concerned with the existence of tilting sheaves on some smooth projective varieties. The main technique we use in this thesis is Galois descent theory. We first construct tilting bundles on general Brauer-Severi varieties. Our main result shows the existence of tilting bundles on some Brauer-Severi schemes. As an application, we prove that there are tilting bundles on an arithmetic toric variety whose toric variety has a <b>splitting</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|R

50|$|When {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia began to unfold in the early 1990s, the {{political}} situation was reflected on football pitches. On 13 May 1990 an infamous riot occurred at Maksimir in Zagreb and interrupted the Dinamo Zagreb - Red Star league fixture. On 3 June 1990 the pre-scheduled Yugoslavia-Netherlands friendly {{was held at the}} same stadium, and some 20,000 Croatian fans booed the Yugoslav national anthem and cheered for the Dutch team instead. On 26 September 1990 Hajduk <b>Split</b> <b>fans</b> staged a violent pitch invasion at Poljud during a league fixture against Partizan. On 17 October 1990 the first match of the newly established Croatia national football team was held, a friendly against the United States, and following the end of the 1990-91 season Croatian clubs decided to abandon Yugoslav competitions.|$|R
50|$|The move to daytime was short-lived, and for 2016, {{the event}} was revamped once again.

The race was moved to Friday night of Memorial Day weekend, once again held under-the-lights, and renamed the Carb Night Classic...The Race Before the 500. The name derived from Carb Day at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the {{traditional}} final day of practice for the Indianapolis 500, which was earlier in the afternoon. The move made for four events over four consecutive nights, leading up to the Indy 500 on Sunday. The Hulman Classic would be scheduled for Wednesday night, the Hoosier Hundred Thursday night, the Carb Night Classic Friday night, and the Little 500 on Saturday night.|$|R

In a review in the Gerry Anderson-related fanzine Andersonic, Richard Farrell interprets the plot as a philosophical discussion of the difference between knowledge and wisdom: “the Tritonians merely seek knowledge, whereas the Alphans use the facts they have learned (about Triton in this case) as a means to an end, i.e. saving Helena and escaping.” [...] He concludes [...] "The writer’s point is alluded to in the epilogue when Victor muses on the Triton probe, ‘All that knowledge and yet... perhaps knowledge isn’t the answer after all’. Di Lorenzo’s answer, perhaps, is being able to accumulate the wisdom to put that knowledge to some use." ...|$|R
50|$|This led {{not only}} to a rapid and sharp {{deterioration}} of the CPA’s relations with the CPSU but to a deep split among the CPA’s membership.

During that time, the Knicks {{generally}} received more media coverage regardless of team records, despite both teams playing in the New York market. When the Knicks traveled to New Jersey to play the Nets, the arena was often evenly <b>split</b> between <b>fan</b> bases. This was partly because the two teams were separated by only the Hudson River; however, a contributing factor was that tickets in New Jersey were comparatively cheaper than those sold at Madison Square Garden. The atmosphere was often tense amongst fan bases trying to establish control of home court advantage.|$|R
