40|$|A better {{understanding}} of protein adsorption onto surfaces of materials is required to control biocompatibility and bioactivity. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) {{is known to have}} excellent biocompatibility. Various samples of a-C:H and silicon-doped a-C:H thin films (Si-DLC) were deposited onto silicon substrates using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). Subsequently, the adsorption of the simplest amino acid glycine onto the surfaces of the thin films was investigated to elucidate the mechanisms involved in protein adhesion. The physicochemical characteristics of the surfaces, before and after adsorption of glycine, were investigated using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The Raman study highlighted a slight decrease in the I D/I G ratio with increasing the <b>silicon</b> <b>dopant</b> levels. Following exposure to glycine solutions, the presence of bands at ~ 1735 and ~ 1200 cm− 1 indicates that the adsorption of glycine onto the surfaces has taken place. Glycine was bound to the surfaces via both deprotonated carboxyl and protonated amino groups whilst, as the silicon content in the DLC film increased the adsorption of glycine decreased. AFM analysis showed that the surface roughness increased following exposure to glycine.

Over 7000 calibrated charge measurements {{have been made}} on 14 - and 21 -Å-thick oxide layers. Photoexcited electrons tunnel across the oxide into the silicon, and multiple charges can build up on individual nanocrystals at intensities of only 0. 1 - 0. 01 W/cm 2. The <b>silicon</b> <b>dopant</b> type influences the net nanocrystal charging via the interfacial band bending; P-type subtrates show a faster nanocrystal reneutralization rate due to their higher interfacial electron concentration. There is a huge range of photoionzation behavior for individual nanocrystals. This behavior is different for 395 - and 532 -nm excitation in the same nanocrystal. This individuality seems in part to reflect tunneling through spatially localized defect states in the oxide. The line widths of spatial charge images {{of individual}} nanocrystals and the semicontinuous rate of charge re-neutralization after excitation suggest that we observe trapped electron motion in the adjacent oxide and/or on the nanocrystal surface, {{in addition to the}} ionized nanocrystal. On average, tunneling of the excited P electron is faster by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude than that of the S electron; the data show direct photoionization from the excited P state. A kinetic model is developed, including the effect of charging energy on tunneling rate, and applied to ensemble average behavior. There is no quantitative agreement of the tunneling-rate dependence on oxide thickness and excitation energy with the simple 1 D effective mass tunneling model. However, overall observed trends are rationalized in light of current thin-oxide tunneling literature. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a systematic study of <b>silicon</b> <b>dopant</b> incorporation on various GaAs surfaces and the characterisation of lateral p-n junction structures formed by single-step growth on patterned substrates. Silicon is amphoteric in GaAs, doping the material n- or p-type dependant {{on the surface}} configuration and growth conditions. Lateral p-n junctions were therefore formed between suitable combinations of surfaces, grown under the correct conditions. Molecular Beam Epitaxy was the chosen growth method and the devices were fabricated on patterned (100) and (110) GaAs substrates. Studies of silicon doping behaviour on the (100), (110) and (N 11) A (N= 1, 3, 4) GaAs surfaces {{have shown that the}} conductivity type depends on growth conditions, and carrier saturation at high doping levels has been observed. Our results concur with published data and a Si incorporation picture is presented in terms of chemical bond energy considerations and the ratio between vacancy types on the growth surface. Lateral junctions were formed at the upper and lower boundaries between n-type (100) flat surfaces and p-type (311) A facets and p-type (110) flat surfaces and n-type (100) facets. Ga adatom migration between facets, as witnessed by the generation of new surfaces at the sidewall-flat boundaries has implications for dopant incorporation and defect generation in the junction regions. Electrical measurements revealed two main current mechanisms, dominant over different sections of the voltage characteristic. Under low bias, a tunnel current was observed and this was ascribed to indirect electron tunnelling into band-tail states, followed by recombination via phonon emission. Recombination and diffusion current were dominant under high bias conditions. The value of the calculated ideality factor was found to be dependant on the relative magnitudes of the majority carrier densities {{on each side of the}} depletion region. Electrical results are discussed in terms of dopant incorporation and compensation.

The diffusion length of holes in the films ranges between 0. 3 and 15. 9 mu m, and the estimated lifetime of holes for doped samples varies between 0. 2 ns and 16 mu s. Different effects contribute to the observed increase in the diffusion length with increasing aluminum content. Among others, dislocations seem to be active as nonradiative recombination sites, and phase separation and decomposition as observed by TEM in Al-rich alloys lead {{to the formation of}} a spatially indirect recombination path due to the piezoelectric field in the films. Potential fluctuations associated with these phase irregularities could also give rise to electron induced persistent conductivity contributing to the increase of the diffusion length.

40|$|For the {{fabrication}} of ULSI circuits, the silicon surface {{should be free}} of metallic and particulate contamination and be atomically smooth. Heavy metal contaminants have {{detrimental effects on the}} yield of microelectronic processing and reliability of solid state devices by increasing the junction leakage current, degrading the integrity of gate oxide and reducing the oxide breakdown voltage. It has been demonstrated that the contamination level for most metals has to be controlled below 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm² for sub-quarter micron processing. Some transition and noble metal ions such as copper, silver and gold are known to deposit on silicon surfaces in acidic fluoride based solutions. Among them, copper {{has been the focus of}} most research due to the widespread use of copper in microelectronic industry. To investigate the mechanisms by which copper deposits on silicon surfaces in HF and BHF solutions, different electrochemical techniques were used, including dc polarization and ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results of electrochemical measurements, in conjunction with various surface characterization techniques, such as TXRF, AFM and TEM, reveal the rates of reactions that occur at silicon/solution interface can be affected by many factors, such as <b>silicon</b> <b>dopant</b> type and doping levels, ionic strength of electrolytes, illumination conditions and the use of additives. For example, under darkness, the amount of copper deposition is nearly one order of magnitude less than that under illumination for p-type silicon in both HF and BHF solutions and n-type silicon in HF solutions. In BHF solutions, n-type silicon is very close to its flat band condition where illumination plays little role. The addition of copper ions in BHF solutions not only causes metal contamination, but also generates severe surface roughness due to the masking effect of copper on the anisotropic etching of silicon in BHF solutions. Local etching rate of 1 nm/min was measured on the silicon sample prepared in 100 ppb Cu²⁻ BHF solutions. Some additives such as surfactants and hydrochloric acid can effectively reduce the reaction rates of silicon corrosion and copper deposition by either blocking the active reaction sites or form copper ion complexes...|$|E
40|$|Two {{dimensional}} electron systems {{based on}} GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures are extremely useful in various scientific investigations of recent times including {{the search for}} quantum computational schemes. Although significant strides have been made {{over the past few}} years to realize solid state qubits on GaAs/AlGaAs 2 DEGs, there are numerous factors limiting the progress. We attempt to identify factors that have material and design-specific origin and develop ways to overcome them. The thesis is divided in two broad segments. ^ In the first segment we describe the realization of a new field-effect induced two dimensional electron system on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure where the novel device-design is expected to suppress the level of charge noise present in the device. ^ Modulation-doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures are utilized extensively in the study of quantum transport in nanostructures, but charge fluctuations associated with remote ionized dopants often produce deleterious effects. Electric field-induced carrier systems offer an attractive alternative if certain challenges can be overcome. We demonstrate a field-effect transistor in which the active channel is locally devoid of modulation-doping, but <b>silicon</b> <b>dopant</b> atoms are retained in the ohmic contact region to facilitate low-resistance contacts. A high quality two-dimensional electron gas is induced by a field-effect that is tunable over a density range of 6. 5 × 10 10 cm- 2 to 2. 6 × 1011 cm- 2. Device design, fabrication, and low temperature (T= 0. 3 K) characterization results are discussed. The demonstrated device-design overcomes several existing limitations in the fabrication of field-induced 2 DEGs and might find utility in hosting nanostructures required for making spin qubits. ^ The second broad segment describes our effort to correlate transport parameters measured at T= 0. 3 K to the strength of the fractional quantum Hall state observed at ν= 5 / 2 in the second Landau level of high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs two dimensional electron systems. ^ In an ultrapure two dimensional electron system (2 DES) subjected to high magnetic field and very low temperatures, a large number of many-body ground states can emerge in a purely quantum phenomenon called the Fractional quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). The fractional state at ν= 5 / 2 has drawn significant interest in recent times because of its predicted non-abelian excitations that can be utilized in constructing topologically protected quantum bits. In spite of having made significant advances in this direction, progress is hindered due to the fragility of this exotic state characterized by a small energy gap which puts very stringent requirements on the sample quality and the temperature scale. It is believed that the ν= 5 / 2 activation gap is masked by disorders present in the sample which causes the experimentally observed gap to appear much smaller than the theoretically predicted intrinsic gap originating from purely electron-electron interactions in the clean-limit. Hence categorization of samples based on the strength of the ν= 5 / 2 state hinges on the efficient quantification of disorder which is not a directly measurable quantity. Historically the zero-field transport mobility has been identified as the measure of disorder present in the sample. However careful comparison of data originating in our measurements with existing literature reveals that mobility is rather a weak indicator of the quality of FQHE in the 2 nd Landau level and fails to reliably predict the ν= 5 / 2 activation gap in a sample. In the absence of a single reliable indicator of sample quality in the 2 nd Landau level, we propose a resistivity measured at ν= 5 / 2 at T= 0. 3 K as an alternative metric to characterize samples. Preliminary measurements involving a limited number of samples indicate that a resistivity measured at ν= 5 / 2 might be better correlated with the ν= 5 / 2 gap than mobility. Results also call for a more holistic approach in sample characterization by taking into consideration the heterostructure design while predicting sample quality. ^ The possibility of quantum scattering time being an indicator of the strength of the ν= 5 / 2 gap was investigated. The existing method of extracting quantum lifetime from the low-field Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations leads to unreliable extraction of quantum lifetime in high-mobility two dimensional electron samples potentially because an underlying assumption in the method that the amplitude of the density of states oscillations at low magnetic fields is negligible compared to the zero-field density of states might not hold true in case of high-mobility 2 DES. A modified method was developed by relaxing the assumption which resulted in meaningful extraction of quantum lifetimes in all the high-mobility samples probed in the study. A correlation between the extracted quantum lifetime and the ν= 5 / 2 activation gap was not discovered within the limited set of samples probed. ...|$|E
40|$|The high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN, x > 0. 70, is the {{principal}} wide-band-gap alloy system to enable the development of light-emitting diodes operating at the short wavelengths in the deep-ultraviolet, λ < 280 nm. The development of the deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) {{is driven by the}} social and market impact expected from their implementation in portable units for water disinfection and based on the damaging effect of the deep-ultraviolet radiation on the DNA of various microorganisms. Internationally, intense research and technology developments occur in the past few years, yet, the external quantum efficiency of the DUV LEDs is typically below 1 %. One of the main material issues {{in the development of the}} DUV LEDs is the achievement of n- and ptype doped layers of high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN with low resistivity, which is required for the electrical pumping of the diodes. The doping process, however, becomes significantly more complex with increasing the Al content and the resistivity value can be as high as 101 - 102  Ω cm for n-type AlN doped by silicon, and 107 - 108  Ω cm for p-type AlN doped by magnesium. The present study is therefore focused on gaining a better understanding of the constraints in the doping process of the high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN alloys, involving mainly the <b>silicon</b> <b>dopant.</b> For this purpose, the epitaxial growth of the high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN and AlN by the implementation of the distinct hot-wall MOCVD is developed in order to achieve layers of good structural and morphological properties, and with low content of residual impurities, particularly oxygen and carbon. Substitutional point defects such as ON and CN may have a profound impact on the doping by their involvement in effects of n-type carrier compensation. The process temperature can be set from 1000 °C and up to 1400 °C in the present study, which is a principal advantage in order to optimize the material properties of the high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN and AlN. The epitaxial growth of the high-Alcontent AlxGa 1 -xN and AlN is largely performed on 4 H-SiC substrates motivated by (i) the lattice mismatch of ~ 1 % along the basal plane (the smallest among other available substrates including Si and sapphire), (ii) the good thermal conductivity of 3. 7 W cm- 1 K- 1, which is essential to minimize the self-heating during the operation of any light-emitting diode, and (iii) the limited access to true-bulk AlN wafers. The Si doping is investigated over a large range of [Si] ~ 1 × 1017 cm- 3 - 1 × 1020 cm- 3. Only the high doping range of [Mg] ~ (1 - 3) × 1019 cm- 3 is targeted motivated by the large thermal ionization energy of this common acceptor (from 200 meV in GaN to about 630 meV in AlN). The material characterization involves extensive implementation of atomic force microscopy (AFM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), cathodoluminescence (CL), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), capacitancevoltage measurements, as well as measurements of the conductivity of the layers by contactless microwave-based technique. The possibility to perform electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements on the Si-doped high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN is essential in order to establish any effect of self-compensation of the shallow donor state of silicon through the related so-called DX state. The EPR measurements corroborate the study of the incorporation kinetics of silicon and oxygen at various process temperatures and growth rates. The outcome of this study is accordingly summarized and presents our understanding for (i) the complex impact of silicon and oxygen on the n-type conductivity of Al 0. 77 Ga 0. 23 N, which is the alloy composition at which a drastic reduction of the n-type conductivity of high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN is commonly reported (paper 1); (ii) the strain and morphology compliance during the intentional doping by silicon and magnesium, and its correlation with the resistivity in the highly doped layers of Al 0. 82 Ga 0. 18 N alloy composition (paper 2); (iii) the n-type conductivity of highly-Si-doped Al 0. 72 Ga 0. 28 N layers as bound by the process temperature (paper 3); and (iv) the shallow donor or DX behavior of the Si dopant in conductive AlxGa 1 -xN layers, 0. 63  ≤ x ≤ 1 (paper 4). It is noted that the measured n-type conductivity in reference layers of Al 0. 77 Ga 0. 23 N, alternatively Al 0. 72 Ga 0. 28 N, alloy composition is on par with the state-of-the-art values, i. e.  ≤ 0. 05  Ω cm, and 0. 012  Ω cm, respectively. A room-temperature resistivity of 7 kΩ cm is measured in Mg-doped layers of Al 0. 85 Ga 0. 15 N alloy composition, which is superior to the state-of-art values (paper 5). The performance of the transport properties of the high-Al-content AlxGa 1 -xN layers is expected to improve with improvement of their material quality. This can be achieved by improvement of the crystalline quality of the AlN-on-SiC template and by the implementation of true-bulk AlN substrates. The AlN heteroepitaxial growth at the process temperatures of 1100 - 1200 °C is therefore investigated (paper 6). The lattice constants, structural and optical properties of true-bulk, homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial AlN material grown at high process temperatures of up to 1400 °C is further reported (paper 7) ...|$|E

PACS: 68. 55, 68. 35 2 INTRODUCTION The motivation for this study is the need to understand the enhanced diffusion of dopant atoms in ion implanted and annealed <b>silicon.</b> The <b>dopant</b> diffusion due to defects introduced by ion implantation can be orders of magnitude greater than bulk diffusion and limits the ability to fabricate shallow junctions for current and especially future ultra large scale integrated circuit transistors. A thorough understanding and characterization o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In <b>silicon</b> {{nanoscale}} transistors, <b>dopant</b> (impurity) atoms {{can significantly}} affect transport characteristics, in particular at low temperatures. Coupling of neighboring dopants in such devices {{is essential in}} defining the properties for transport. In this work, we briefly present a comparison of different regimes of inter-dopant coupling, controlled by doping concentration and, to some extent, by selective, local doping. Tunneling-transport spectroscopy can reveal the energy spectrum of isolated dopants and of strongly-coupled dopant atoms. Interactions of multiple-dopants quantum dots (QDs) and satellite individual dopant-traps, as observed in some devices, can provide further information to bridge such inter-dopant coupling regimes for more advanced applications...|$|R
40|$|Active pixel sensors for a {{high quality}} imager are {{fabricated}} using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process by integrating the photodetectors on the SOI substrate and forming pixel readout transistors on the SOI thin-film. The technique can include forming silicon islands on a buried insulator layer disposed on a silicon substrate and selectively etching away the buried insulator layer over a region of the substrate to define a photodetector area. Dopants of a first conductivity type are implanted to form a signal node in the photodetector area and to form simultaneously drain/source regions for a first transistor {{in at least a}} first one of the <b>silicon</b> islands. <b>Dopants</b> of a second conductivity type are implanted to form drain/source regions for a second transistor in at least a second one of the silicon islands. Isolation rings around the photodetector also can be formed when dopants of the second conductivity type are implanted. Interconnections among the transistors and the photodetector are provided to allow signals sensed by the photodetector to be read out via the transistors formed on the silicon islands...|$|R
40|$|Low cost {{polycrystalline}} silicon solar cells supported on substrates were prepared by depositing successive layers of polycrystalline <b>silicon</b> containing appropriate <b>dopants</b> over supporting substrates {{of a member}} selected from the group consisting of metallurgical grade {{polycrystalline silicon}}, graphite and steel coated with a diffusion barrier of silica, borosilicate, phosphosilicate, or mixtures thereof such that p-n junction devices were formed which effectively convert solar energy to electrical energy. To improve the conversion efficiency of the polycrystalline silicon solar cells, the crystallite size in the silicon was substantially increased by melting and solidifying a base layer of polycrystalline silicon before depositing the layers which form the p-n junction...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic idea}} of a dry solar cell process is to {{minimize}} the application of wet chemical process steps. By using plasma-enhanced chemical processes, many steps can be converted from wet chemical to dry plasma processes. In previous studies it could be demonstrated, {{that it is possible}} to deposit a phosphorus silicate glass (PSG) via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) processes and to use these layers for emitter diffusion in a high-temperature furnace. In order to enable the removal of the dopant source combined with an etch back of the highly phosphorus containing top layer of the emitter (so called 9 ̆ 3 dead layer 9 ̆ 4) within a single plasma etch step, the use of doped amorphous <b>silicon</b> as <b>dopant</b> source has been investigated throughout this study. To the knowledge of the authors, the application of a-Si as dopant source prior to high temperature diffusion is almost unexplored; therefore the paper investigates the suitability of this approach for industrial solar cell processing. As shown, doped a-Si layers offer a diffusion of phosphorus as well as boron, but an oxidation of the layer while the high temperature diffusion could not be avoided straightforwardly...|$|R
40|$|Using hybrid quantum {{mechanical}}/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) embedded cluster calculations, {{we investigate}} the stabilization of <b>silicon</b> and oxygen <b>dopants</b> in GaN. Formation energies of Si on a Ga site and O on an N site are calculated at {{two levels of}} theory using conventional thermochemical and kinetic exchange and correlation density functionals (B 97 - 2 and BB 1 k). We confirm the shallow donor nature of these substitutional defects. We find that the 0 / 1 + transition levels for both Si and O species lie well above {{the bottom of the}} conduction band, in agreement with previous supercell-based simulations. The origin of this artifact is discussed in the context of relevant experimental results and we show how correct in-gap shallow levels can be ascertained in good agreement with experiment...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{silicon carbide}} is {{fabricated}} according to techniques which {{result in a}} significant portion of nanocrystallites within the material in a sub 10 nanometer regime. There is described techniques for passivating porous silicon carbide which result in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices which exhibit brighter blue luminescence and exhibit improved qualities. Based on certain of the techniques described porous silicon carbide is used as a sacrificial layer for the patterning of silicon carbide. Porous silicon carbide is then removed from the bulk substrate by oxidation and other methods. The techniques described employ a two-step process which is used to pattern bulk silicon carbide where selected areas of the wafer are then made porous and then the porous layer is subsequently removed. The process to form porous <b>silicon</b> carbide exhibits <b>dopant</b> selectivity and a two-step etching procedure is implemented for silicon carbide multilayers...|$|R
