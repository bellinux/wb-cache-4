5000|$|Among {{the damage}} {{discovered}} after the accident, investigators found the #7 slat {{missing from the}} leading edge of the right wing. NTSB investigators requested the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, inspect the remainder of the <b>slat</b> <b>assembly,</b> including a portion of the slat actuator cylinder (the motor that moves the slat and holds it in position). Boeing determined that the #7 slat had failed because the slats had been extended while the aircraft was flying at cruising speed. They also determined that it was [...] "impossible" [...] for the flaps to extend without manipulating the controls.|$|E
