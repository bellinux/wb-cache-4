50|$|A close solar passage {{can be used}} to {{increase}} a craft's energy. The increased radiation pressure combines with the efficacy of being deep in the Sun's gravity well to substantially increase the energy for runs to the outer Solar System. The optimal approach to the Sun is done by increasing the orbital eccentricity while keeping the energy level as high as practical. The minimum approach distance is a function of sail angle, thermal properties of the sail and other <b>structure,</b> <b>load</b> effects on structure, and sail optical characteristics (reflectivity and emissivity). A close passage can result in substantial optical degradation. Required turn rates can increase substantially for a close passage. A sail craft arriving at a star can use a close passage to reduce energy, which also applies to a sail craft on a return trip from the outer Solar System.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{computer}} programs {{has been developed}} in order to analyze complicated structures. As the number of functions in their programs increase, it becomes difficult to manage them. The fundamental problem {{lies in the fact}} that they are designed in a computer-oriented manner which is totally different from our intuition. Therefore the object-oriented approach is efficient to overcome the above mentioned problems. In this study, the three-module model for the structural analysis system is proposed. The system is characterized by the <b>structure,</b> <b>load</b> and analysis modules passing messages each other. This model is more flexible and more useful than the conventionally used structure-based model for the earthquake response analysis problem as well as the structure analysis problem.

In this paper we use finite element methods (FEM) {{to investigate the}} suitability of these two load cell designs {{for use in a}} force plate and compare the sensitivity of these two force plates to that of the Heglund’s force plate. Each force plate is also sensitive to two moments with axis in the same plane as the force plate. If the force plate is {{to be used as a}} two component force-moment sensor, we determine which moment axis is best to use. Finally, a novel six-axis load cell is modelled by assembling three force plates together with rotational symmetry. The sensitivity of the six-axis load cell is calculated using FEM. Analysis of the six axis load cell predicts good measurement sensitivity and isotropy while maintaining low interference between measurement axes. Further benefits of the load cell design are discussed...|$|E

This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization method to perform a trade-off analysis between the reduction of damage equivalent fatigue loads at the monopile support structure and the collateral effects of the different controller concepts. The optimization is performed considering the baseline controller, plus tower fore-aft controller to reduce the tower fore-aft bending moment and the active generator torque controller to reduce the side-to-side load. These two concepts increase the pitch activity and drive train torque variability as collateral effect, respectively. With the optimization methodology presented, it is possible to identify the most efficient operation time to activate different control concepts under each load case, utilizing their advantageous load reduction while limiting their penalty in collateral effects...|$|E
