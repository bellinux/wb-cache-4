The idea of using the molecular patterns revealed in x-ray crystallography in surface patterns was first suggested by Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge University crystallographer. [...] After hearing a presentation by Dorothy Hodgkin to the Society of Industrial Artists, Mark Hartland Thomas, chief industrial officer of the CoID, took up the idea and formed the Festival Pattern Group.

[...] Designs were based on the crystal structure of haemoglobin, insulin, wareite, china clay, mica and other molecules. [...] The work of the Festival Pattern Group fitted in well with displays in the Dome of Discovery about the structure of matter.|$|E

[...] It was to take 30 years before all horse motive-power was replaced by steam, but whilst there were engines on the line, water wagons had to be carried up the inclines from the wharf, for use by the stationary engines, and later by the locomotives, and for supply at isolated properties. There were over 20 rail tanks in total, many converted LNWR tenders, despatched from the wharf {{at a rate of about}} 100 a month and left in sidings along the route.
