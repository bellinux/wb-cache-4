40|$|A thermal-mechanical {{model is}} {{presented}} for calculating <b>softening</b> and failure <b>of</b> flammable sandwich composites under combined tension loading and one-sided unsteady-state heating by fire. The thermal model calculates {{the temperature rise}} of the sandwich composite when exposed to fire. The mechanical model computes the reduction to the tensile modulus and strength of the laminate face skins caused by thermal <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fibre</b> reinforcement and polymer matrix and weakening of the core. The numerical accuracy of the model was assessed using data obtained from fire structural tests performed on a combustible sandwich composite consisting of thin woven glass-vinyl ester laminate skins and a thick core of balsa wood. Tests were performed at different tension stress levels and heat fluxes. The model can determine the temperature rise, tensile failure stress and failure mechanism of the sandwich composite in fire. The experimental results presented in the paper also provide {{new insights into the}} structural survivability of tension-loaded sandwich composites in fire...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of fibre-matrix interactions in basalt fibre reinforced geopolymer matrix composites after heating to 600, 800 and 1000 °C was investigated {{by means of}} SEM, EDS and XRD analyses. The basalt fibres showed no significant interfacial interaction up to 600 °C. The appearance of the fracture surfaces also remained largely unchanged. At higher temperatures, crystallisation reactions within the fibres and the Na-geopolymer matrix, respectively, could be observed along with an increasing embrittlement <b>of</b> the composite. <b>Softening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> {{and the development of}} several distinct reaction zones within the fibres was clearly evident after heating to 800 °C and 1000 °C. The formation of an iron-rich outer reaction zone within the fibre was observed above 800 °C. The interaction between fibre and matrix resulted in the formation of a crystalline albite phase after heating to 1000 °C. It is suggested that basalt fibres have great potential as reinforcements for the development of cost-efficient geopolymer matrix composites and may be used for applications up to 600 °C...|$|R
40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> {{orientation}} on the tensile load-bearing {{performance of}} sandwich composite materials in fire is investigated experimentally and analytically. The orientation <b>of</b> the glass <b>fibres</b> in the laminate skins {{was set at}} 0 ° (perfectly aligned in the load direction), or offset at angles of 9 °, 15 °, 30 ° or 45 °. The influence <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> orientation on the time-to-failure and failure mechanism during fire exposure is investigated. Experimental testing reveals that the structural performance of the sandwich composite deteriorates rapidly with increasing fibre offset angle due to glass transition <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the polymer matrix becoming more dominant, and the fibre properties being less important as the laminate skins thermally soften and decompose. A thermal-mechanical model is presented to analyse the deterioration to the tension load-bearing performance with increasing fibre offset angle, and the analysis reveals that even small fibre offset angles have a substantial adverse impact on the fire performance of sandwich composites...|$|R

In this study, the fire structural resistance <b>of</b> a basalt <b>fibre</b> composite is determined experimentally and analytically, and it is compared against an equivalent laminate reinforced with E-glass fibres. When exposed to the same radiant heat flux, the basalt fibre composite heated up more rapidly and reached higher temperatures than the glass fibre laminate due to its higher thermal emissivity. The tensile structural survivability <b>of</b> the basalt <b>fibre</b> composite was inferior to the glass fibre laminate when exposed to the same radiant heat flux. Tensile <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> both materials occurred by thermal <b>softening</b> and decomposition <b>of</b> the polymer matrix and weakening <b>of</b> the <b>fibre</b> reinforcement, which occur at similar rates. The inferior fire resistance <b>of</b> the basalt <b>fibre</b> composite is due mainly to higher emissivity, which causes it to become hotter in fire...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on {{the influence of}} fiber volume reinforcement on various aspects of machining. Drilling experiments were conducted to study the tool wear, surface finish, delamination factor and hole quality on GFRP composites. The work reports the variation of tool wear, surface roughness, hole quality, chip characteristics, delamination factor with the variation <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> volume reinforcement. Results revealed that the increase in fiber percentage increased the tool wear, delamination factor, surface roughness value and decreased hole quality. Minimum surface roughness, tool wear and better hole quality was obtained for 30 % fibre content composites. 70 % Fibre content composites produced hazardous surface roughness. Pull out <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> and fibril formation are significant in decreasing the hole quality and increased surface roughness. Increased tool – fibre interaction and thermal <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the tool causes increased tool wear. In higher fibre content composites, extensive plasticity was absent consequently brittle ceramic fibres were fractured easily. Hence small segment type chips were obtained. The fibre pull out and fibrils present near the hole exit forms the remainder of the laminate causes increased damage zone near the hole exit. Hence high delamination factor was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Although {{concrete}} is {{the most}} utilised building material nowdays, this material has a large shortcoming: it has a good resistance against compressive stresses, but a very low resistance against tensile stresses. Usual way {{to solve this problem}} is the application of steel reinforcement in concrete structures. Other possibility is the application of different types <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in concrete, for example steel or synthetic fibres: this material is then called "fibre concrete". In the past, many types <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> concrete were developed. For many of them, the added value <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> was rather low: almost no improvement of tensile strength could be achieved. In this research project, an innovative type <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> concrete is developed, with improved both the tensile strength and the ductility: the Hybrid-Fibre Concrete (HFC). The expression "Hybrid" is here applied to point out to the hybridisation of fibres: short and long steel fibres were combined together in one concrete mixture. This is opposite to the conventional steel fibre concretes, which contain only one type <b>of</b> <b>fibre.</b> Within this research project, all important aspects needed for successful development and applications of Hybrid-Fibre Concrete have been considered. In total 15 mixtures, with different types and amounts <b>of</b> steel <b>fibres</b> were developed and tested in the fresh state (workability, with the self-compactability as a main goal) {{as well as in the}} hardened state (uniaxial tensile tests, flexural tests, pullout tests on single fibres and compressive tests). A new analytical model for bridging <b>of</b> cracks by <b>fibres</b> was developed and successfully implemented for tensile <b>softening</b> response <b>of</b> HFC. At the end, the utilisation of HFC in the engineering practice was discussed, including a case-study on light precast prestressed beams made of HFC, without conventional reinforcement. There many other possibilities for the applications of this material in building engineering, civil infrastructure, geotechnical and tunnelling engineering. It is also expected that the durability of the Hybrid-Fibre Concrete is better compared to conventional concrete, which could be its another big advantage. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
