5|$|Legendary {{stories of}} pig-faced women {{originated}} roughly simultaneously in Holland, England and France {{in the late}} 1630s. The <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> of a wealthy woman whose body was of normal human appearance, but whose face {{was that of a}} pig.|$|E
5|$|Few {{months after}} his birth, al-Jamri family {{traveled}} to Najaf, Iraq where his father continued his religious studies. At the time, al-Jamri's family was composed of his parents and his 2-year-old brother Mohammed Jameel. He studied for five years at the Talibiya primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami, the elder son of Isa Qassim. Having no TV at home, al-Jamri and his siblings {{spent most of their}} time listening to <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> by their mother or playing with kites outside. At the age of 9, he began practicing Islamic prayers and fasting in Ramadan.|$|E

5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|Their service {{records have}} added to their fame, ranging from their work as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, {{as well as their}} service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
5|$|War {{film is a}} film genre {{concerned}} with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.|$|E

5|$|The Story of Sinuhe, {{written in}} Middle Egyptian, {{might be the}} classic of Egyptian literature. Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus, a set of <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> to Khufu by his sons {{relating}} the marvels performed by priests. The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature. Towards {{the end of the}} New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any. The former {{tells the story of a}} noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Greco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.|$|E
5|$|The emu has a {{prominent}} place in Australian Aboriginal mythology, including a creation myth of the Yuwaalaraay and other groups in New South Wales {{who say that the}} sun was made by throwing an emu's egg into the sky; the bird features in numerous aetiological <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> across a number of Aboriginal groups. One story from Western Australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird, who responded by throwing a boomerang, severing the arms of the man and transforming him into a flightless emu. The Kurdaitcha man of Central Australia is said to wear sandals made of emu feathers to mask his footprints. Many Aboriginal language groups throughout Australia have a tradition that the dark dust lanes in the Milky Way represent a giant emu in the sky. Several of the Sydney rock engravings depict emus, and the birds are mimicked in indigenous dances.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> in the Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted {{it was a}} giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

25|$|Cyberpunk's {{ideas have}} spread in other directions, though. Space opera writers have written work {{featuring}} cyberpunk motifs, including David Brin's Kiln People and Ken MacLeod's Fall Revolution series. This merging {{of the two}} disparate threads of science fiction in the 1980s has produced an extrapolational literature in contrast to those technological <b>stories</b> <b>told</b> in the present.|$|E
25|$|Gitlow {{followed}} his 1940 memoir with a steamier retelling of old tales called The Whole of Their Lives: Communism in America.
