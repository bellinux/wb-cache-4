60|$|So {{the wicked}} old hag babbled on, after her hideous fashion, while the Abbot <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was a pause, {{and still}} the unseeing eyes <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Then a twitch passed over the face.|$|E
60|$|There {{was very}} little applause when she finished. The women were looking for their handkerchiefs, {{and many of the}} men <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with shiny eyes.|$|E
60|$|Swithin Forsyte {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> He thought: 'A poor thing, James! a selfish beggar! Must {{be worth a}} couple of hundred thousand!' He wheezed, meditating on life....|$|R
6000|$|Now all <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Bes who {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and I rose to say something, I know not what, when suddenly the doors opened and through them appeared heralds, crying, ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a case of}} life imitating art, Proof {{himself was}} shot and killed on April 11, 2006 after an altercation broke out at a nightclub in Detroit, Michigan. [...] "In the year after he (Proof) died, I would <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and think about that video (Like Toy Soldiers). Did karma cause that to happen in real life? Did I? You always want to point <b>the</b> finger <b>at</b> {{somebody}} else when something like that happens, you know?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{struck a}} light {{and looked at the}} bed. Haldin was lying on his back as before, only both his hands were under his head. His eyes were open. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Major Mallard saluted and departed. Peter Blood {{sat back}} in his chair and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> frowning. Time moved on. Came a tap at the door, and an elderly negro slave {{presented}} himself. Would his excellency receive Miss Bishop? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} are really clear of it, I am going for them," [...] she said {{presently}} when the wiping process was finished. [...] "I have only restrained myself for your sake," [...] and leaning {{back in her chair}} she <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> lost in meditation.|$|E
60|$|At {{this sudden}} {{announcement}} his partner became exceedingly interested. Leaning back in <b>the</b> chair he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> decorated <b>ceiling,</b> and uttered his favourite wind-in-the-wires whistle.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Medliker gasped {{again and}} <b>stared</b> hopelessly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Yet she was {{conscious}} of a certain relief. After all, it was POSSIBLE {{that he had found}} it--liar as he undoubtedly was.|$|R
60|$|Barbara reopened {{her brown}} eyes and <b>stared</b> amiably <b>at</b> <b>the</b> painted <b>ceiling,</b> and Mr. Haswell whistled.|$|R
6000|$|The {{cautious}} parlour-maid {{declined to}} offer advice. Maria's well-balanced mind was so completely unhinged, {{that she looked}} with languid curiosity at her sister. Zo still <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and still rolled slowly {{from one side to}} the other. The dog on her breast, lulled by the regular motion, slept profoundly--not even troubled by a dream of fleas! ...|$|E
60|$|The brandy {{must have}} {{affected}} Dirkovitch, for he lay {{back in his}} chair and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> There was nothing special in the ceiling beyond a shadow as of a huge black coffin. Owing to some peculiarity in the construction of the mess-room this shadow was always thrown when the candles were lighted. It never disturbed the digestion of the White Hussars. They were in fact rather proud of it.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning that}} cherubical {{creature}} opened its eyes {{at a much}} earlier hour than usual, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of its father's cottage. The sun was rising, and sent its unobstructed rays {{through the window of}} Maggot's cottage, where it danced on the ceiling as if its sole purpose in rising had been to amuse the Maggot baby. If so, it was pre-eminently successful in its attempts, for the baby lay and smiled {{for a long time in}} silent ecstasy.|$|E
60|$|Daniel Quilp of Tower Hill, and Sampson Brass of Bevis Marks in {{the city}} of London, Gentleman, one of her Majesty's attornies of the Courts of the King's Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster and a {{solicitor}} of the High Court of Chancery, slumbered on, unconscious and unsuspicious of any mischance, until a knocking on the street door, often repeated and gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery of knocks, fired in long discharges with a very short interval between, caused the said Daniel Quilp to struggle into a horizontal position, and to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with a drowsy indifference, betokening that he heard the noise and rather wondered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same, and couldn't be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject.|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} {{comes to an}} end, Molly ends her {{engagement}} with Greg, who moves out and back to his hometown. Molly then visits Bridget to report Greg leaving her and both women lie in bed side by side, staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Bridget tells Molly that she's totally keeping her interested and that she's {{trying to be the}} one Molly wants. Then she questions the look on Molly's face, to which Molly responds with the look indicates love. Bridget cries a little of not able to say anything back. The final shot shows both of them continuing to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> each speculating their next move. However, their facial expressions tell more than words ever will. Bridget's expression is one of entering unexplored territory (i.e., that of love). Molly's expression is one of self-doubting as she has fully committed to living a full-on lesbian life very different from that she has ever experienced.|$|R
500|$|Vikings coach Dennis Green {{has been}} criticized for his {{decision}} to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. Radio host Bob Sansevere, author of The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments, called it [...] "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport." [...] Of Green's play call, Peter King of Sports Illustrated wrote, [...] "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up and <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> in <b>the</b> next few days and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." [...] Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper Star Tribune has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.|$|R
60|$|Installed in a {{position}} of temporary authority, the parlour-maid sat silently at her needlework. Maria stood by the window, in the new character of an idle girl--with her handkerchief in her hand, and her everlasting book dropped unnoticed on the floor. Zo lay flat on her back, on the hearth-rug, hugging the dog in her arms. At intervals, she rolled herself over slowly from side to side, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with wondering eyes. Miss Minerva's departure had struck the parlour-maid dumb, and had demoralized the pupils.|$|E
6000|$|He {{faced the}} future calmly, with open eyes. It would be rough going at first, very rough going. It meant hard work, incessant work. No more vague masterpieces which {{might or might}} not turn into [...] "Carmen" [...] or [...] "The Spanish Maiden." [...] No more {{delightful}} idle days to be loafed through in the studio or the shops. No more dreams, seen hazily through the smoke of a cigar, as he lay on the couch and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> of what he would do to-morrow. To-morrow must look after itself. His business was with the present and the work of the present.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} {{down on his}} bed all dressed, and lay still for a whole quarter of an hour. Then he sat up suddenly, drawing up his knees, and {{clasping}} his legs. The first dawn found him open-eyed, in that same posture. This man who could walk so long, so far, so aimlessly, without showing a sign of fatigue, could also remain sitting still for hours without stirring a limb or an eyelid. But when the late sun sent its rays into the room he unclasped his hands, and fell back on the pillow. His eyes <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> And suddenly they closed. Comrade Ossipon slept in the sunlight.|$|E
6000|$|She moved away. The {{door closed}} softly behind her. Jimmy {{scarcely}} {{knew that she}} had gone. He sat down in that deep chair which was Mr. Pett's favourite, and <b>stared</b> sightlessly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> And then, how many minutes or hours later he did not know, the sharp click of the door-handle roused him. He sprang from the chair. Was it Ann, come back? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} the typical bedroom {{of the typical}} boarding-house, {{furnished}}, insofar {{as it could be}} said to be furnished at all, with a severe simplicity. It contained two beds, a pine chest of drawers, a strip of faded carpet, and a wash basin. But there was that on the floor which set this room apart from a thousand rooms of the same kind. Flat on his back, with his hands tightly clenched and one leg twisted oddly under him and with his teeth gleaming through his grey beard in a horrible grin, Captain John Gunner <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with eyes that saw nothing.|$|R
60|$|Noel {{stayed up}} until her father went to bed, then went upstairs at once. She had evidently {{determined}} {{that they should}} not talk about her. Gratian sat on alone, waiting for her husband! It was nearly midnight when he came, and she did not tell him the family news till next morning. He received it with a curious little grunt. Gratian saw his eyes contract, as they might have, perhaps, looking at some bad and complicated wound, and then <b>stare</b> steadily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Though they had been married over a year, she did not yet know what he thought about many things, and she waited with a queer sinking at her heart. This skeleton in the family cupboard was a test of his affection for herself, a test {{of the quality of the}} man she had married. He did not speak for a little, and her anxiety grew. Then his hand sought hers, and gave it a hard squeeze.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, in {{the midst}} of his conversation, Sir John became silent and his lips turned pale and trembled; then, {{remarking}} abruptly that he could waste no more time on this miserable business, he rose and left the court. Evidently the barrister to whom he was talking had observed to what this change of demeanour was due, for he looked first at me in the dock and next at Sir John Bell as, recovering his pomposity, he made his way through the crowd. Then he grew reflective, and pushing his wig back from his forehead he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and whistled to himself softly.|$|E
60|$|Old Grammont as he {{appeared}} upon the pillow {{of his bed}} {{by the light of}} a rose-shaded bedside lamp, was a small-headed, grey-haired gentleman with a wrinkled face and sunken brown eyes. Years of business experience, mitigated only by such exercise as the game of poker affords, had intensified an instinctive inexpressiveness. Under the most solitary circumstances old Grammont was still inexpressive, and the face that <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of his cabin and the problem of his daughter might have been the face of a pickled head in a museum, for any indication it betrayed of the flow of thought within. He lay on his back and his bent knees lifted the bed-clothes into a sharp mountain. He was not even trying to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The last of {{our three}} friends to awake on this {{particular}} morning, between nine and ten o'clock, indeed, when Dirk had been already two hours at his factory and Lysbeth was buying provisions in the market place, was that accomplished and excellent officer, Captain the Count Juan de Montalvo. For a few seconds after his dark eyes opened he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> collecting his thoughts. Then, sitting up in bed, he burst into a prolonged roar of laughter. Really {{the whole thing was}} too funny for any man of humour to contemplate without being moved to merriment. That gaby, Dirk van Goorl; the furiously indignant but helpless Lysbeth; the solemn, fat-headed fools of Netherlanders at the supper, and the fashion in which he had played his own tune on the whole pack of them as though they were the strings of a fiddle--oh! it was delicious.|$|E
60|$|For {{it was by}} {{the time}} that he had reached these that the priest began a little to allow his {{thoughts}} to wander and his animal senses, which were commonly keen, to awaken. The time of darkness and dinner was drawing on; his own forgotten little room was without a light, and perhaps the gathering gloom, as occasionally happens, sharpened the sense of sound. As Father Brown wrote the last and least essential part of his document, he caught himself writing to the rhythm of a recurrent noise outside, just as one sometimes thinks to the tune of a railway train. When he became conscious of the thing he found what it was: only the ordinary patter of feet passing the door, which in an hotel was no very unlikely matter. Nevertheless, he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> darkened <b>ceiling,</b> and listened to the sound. After he had listened for a few seconds dreamily, {{he got to his feet}} and listened intently, with his head a little on one side. Then he sat down again and buried his brow in his hands, now not merely listening, but listening and thinking also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she again returned, [...] "don't {{put it all}} on me! Maggie {{would have}} given herself to his child, I'm sure, {{scarcely}} less than he gives himself to yours. It would have taken more than any child of mine," [...] she explained--"it would have taken more than ten children of mine, could I have had them--to keep our sposi apart." [...] She smiled as for {{the breadth of the}} image, but, as he seemed to take it, in spite of this, for important, she then spoke gravely enough. [...] "It's as strange as you like, but we're immensely alone." [...] He kept vaguely moving, but there were moments when, again, with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets, he was more directly before her. He stood there at these last words, which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and, as thinking something out, <b>stare</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> [...] "What will you say," [...] she meanwhile asked, [...] "that you've been doing?" [...] This brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her, and she pointed her question. [...] "I mean when she comes in--for I suppose she WILL, some time, come in. It seems to me we must say the same thing." ...|$|R
60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. He returned; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead {{rhinoceros}} and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hole in its throat; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me; he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> still smoking rifle.|$|R
50|$|Wise was {{executed}} by the method he had chosen, lethal injection, at the Broad River Correctional Institution on Friday, November 4, 2005. He chose to make no final statement but did order a last meal of lobster back, french fries, coleslaw, banana pudding and milk. During the execution process, he just <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> He was pronounced dead at 6:18 p.m. EST.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 November 1925 Neumann took {{to her bed}} again, and on 13 November {{claimed to}} have been {{diagnosed}} with appendicitis. According to her account, while prepared for surgery she convulsed violently and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> finally saying, [...] "Yes." [...] She asked her family {{to take her to the}} church to pray immediately. She then announced that she had been cured of all traces of appendicitis.|$|E
5000|$|Kelly Kissel, The Associated Press' Arkansas news editor, was one {{of three}} media {{witnesses}} to the execution. He said that within 20 seconds of the injection, Noel's chest heaved [...] "fairly violently." [...] Kissel added that Noel's reaction to the injection was probably the most intense of the seven executions he has witnessed. [...] "Within the first 20 seconds, it was clear that something was happening," [...] Kissel said. Kissel said Noel <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> without blinking. [...] "(He) died with his eyes open," [...] Kissel said.|$|E
60|$|He {{came to a}} full stop. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> notice-plate, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> glass door, {{and turning}} round, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> over-pathetic dead soldier {{on the arm of}} his over-heroic pistol-firing comrade; Mentana--and the date! Aaron {{wondered}} what and where Mentana was. Then at last he summoned his energy, opened the glass door, and mounted the first stairs.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they all}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me, {{and then they}} all <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ship lying <b>at</b> anchor.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{produced}} a sealed packet, which Captain Cuttle <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{as he had}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> keys.|$|R
