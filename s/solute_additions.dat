A quasichemical model will be presented which is able to predict the site preferences of dilute <b>solute</b> <b>additions</b> to triple defect B 2 compounds. The only parameters required are enthalpies of formation at the stoichiometric composition. General equations are developed which can be used to determine site occupations and defect concentrations for dilute as well as non-dilute <b>solute</b> <b>additions.</b> These equations use atom pair bond enthalpies as the parameters. It is found that the site preferences of dilute additions are not always in agreement with predictions based on the solubility lobes in ternary Gibbs isotherms, Predictions for dilute additions to NiAl and FeAl are compared to experimental results found in the literature. Satisfactory correlation is found between the model and the experimental results. In addition, the predictions from the model on vacancy concentrations in Fe doped NiAl are compared to recent experimental results by the authors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{have shown}} a {{connection}} among the three important properties of interfaces, namely, the free energy, diffusion and solute segregation through the conjecture that the interface free energy {{is the difference between}} those responsible for diffusion in the lattice and the interface itself. The interface energy is known to decrease upon <b>solute</b> <b>additions.</b> We discuss the methodology and the thermodynamical analysis of the diffusion parameters which enable extraction of the interfacial energies and illustrate them by results obtained {{in a wide variety of}} materials. Investigations carried out in pure polycrystalline metals have yielded grain boundary energies comparable to those directly measured. Furthermore, we discuss the role of solute segregation at grain boundaries in alloys in altering diffusion. From the perturbations caused, the solute segregation parameters—the enthalpy and the entropy of binding—have been extracted and levels of solute concentrations estimated. It is shown that similar analyses when applied to complex materials, e. g. the Pb–Sn eutectic alloy, several intermetallic compounds, and oxide systems, also result in acceptable values of interface energies and segregation factors. Finally, some ad-hoc guidelines are provided to alter diffusion in interfaces through <b>solute</b> <b>additions</b> in order to achieve some end use engineering objectives...|$|E

They also are unable to predict reaction rates in complex solute systems. A quasi-native kinetic model was developed that predicts enzyme activity by examining the effect of <b>solute</b> <b>addition</b> on the overall protein structure. The theory was tested using the enzyme urease (urea aminohydrolase EC 3. 5. 1. 5). The quasi-native model was found to accurately predict both the activation and inhibition phenomena observed with urease and could also predict enzymatic activity in complex solute systems. The quasi-native isomerization constant was shown to be a function of hydrophobic effects characterized by the Sechenov theory and electrostatic effects characterized by the DeBye-Huckel theory. The Sechenov constant was found to be independent of temperature and pH. The urease denaturation rate constant displayed a response to <b>solute</b> <b>addition</b> similar to that observed with the quasi-native isomerization equilibrium constant. However, the effect of pH on urease kinetics was a complex function of the ionization of active-site ligands and enzyme surface charge interactions...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} both analytically and numerically short-range forces between spatially diffuse interfaces in multi-phase-field {{models of}} polycrystalline materials. During late-stage solidification, crystal-melt interfaces may attract or repel each other {{depending on the}} degree of misorientation between impinging grains, temperature, composition, and stress. To characterize this interaction, we map the multi-phase-field equations for stationary interfaces to a multi-dimensional classical mechanical scattering problem. From the solution of this problem, we derive asymptotic forms for short-range forces between interfaces for distances larger than the interface thickness. The results show that forces are always attractive for traditional models where each phase-field represents the phase fraction of a given grain. Those predictions are validated by numerical computations of forces for all distances. Based on insights from the scattering problem, we propose a new multi-phase-field formulation that can describe both attractive and repulsive forces in real systems. This model is then used to investigate the influence of <b>solute</b> <b>addition</b> and a uniaxial stress perpendicular to the interface. <b>Solute</b> <b>addition</b> leads to bistability of different interfacial equilibrium states, with the temperature range of bistability increasing with strength of partitioning. Stress in turn, is shown to be equivalent to a temperature change through a standard Clausius-Clapeyron relation.

Hot compression tests were performed and the microstructure was characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy. <b>Solute</b> <b>additions</b> tend to broaden the peak in the flow stress curve and increase the peak stress, peak strain and steady-state stress. A reduction in the DRX grain size and a retardation of the kinetics of recrystallization are observed with <b>solute</b> <b>additions,</b> although the effect saturates at 2 Sn. A recently published, physically based model for DDRX of pure Cu has been extended to include the effect of solute. The effect on the plastic response of the material and the mobility of high-angle grain boundaries was incorporated and, through comparisons between experiment and simulated DRX phenomena, it is concluded that solute must also significantly affect the nucleation stage of DDRX. A model is developed for the effect of solute on the nucleation of DDRX in Cu-Sn alloys and comparisons with experiment indicate that the principal effects are well captured.

In this paper, we use atomic resolution high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-HAADF) in conjunction with electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping to elucidate the mechanisms by which these minor <b>solute</b> <b>additions</b> modify the precipitation path. The results show that the presence of Mg profoundly changes the nature of the precipitates formed, as early as the nucleation stage.

40|$|The {{micrograph}} shows Al-Mg-Fe-Si containing < 1 wt. % of each <b>solute.</b> <b>Addition</b> of TiB 2 particles {{facilitates the}} formation of a fine, equiaxed grain structure (grain refinement). This micrograph illustrates one of the possible growth morphologies that a solidifying metal can adopt (c. f. micrograph 711). The grains in this structure exhibit no dendritic branching, i. e. the solid-liquid interfaces of the growing grains are smooth. When a solid grain is growing from the liquid phase, it will initially exhibit a smooth interface; such an interface can become unstable as the grain becomes larger due to rejection of solute into the liquid phase. Hence, smooth grain boundaries are associated with fine grain structures and low solute contents. The Barker's etch and applied electrical field produce a thick oxide layer on the grains of aluminium (anodising). When viewed in cross-polarised light, interference in the oxide layer produces colours which depend on grain orientation; hence the grain structure is imaged. ...|$|R

Plane-strain machining is used to study microstructure changes {{as a function of}} strain, temperature, and <b>solute</b> <b>additions</b> in a model material system - substitutional solid solutions of copper. The solid solutions incorporate three different <b>solute</b> <b>additions</b> specifically selected for their differing influences on stacking fault energy (SFE) : Ni (increases SFE), Mn (negligible influence on SFE) and Al (decreases SFE). It is shown that a variety of ultra-fine grained (UFG) and nanostructured grains can be created by varying the conditions of strain and temperature. The effect of solutes on the microstructure developed by the large strain deformation is elucidated. The mechanical properties (hardness and yield strength) and thermal stability of the microstructures are characterized. ^ The observations indicate that the SFE plays a negligible role in the microstructure refinement during large strain deformation. The solutes stabilize the nanostructured grains to higher strains and temperatures. Furthermore, the solutes enable a greater refinement of the microstructure, with sub- 100 mn grain sizes resulting at the higher strains. It has also been shown that the nanostructured materials continue to undergo further plastic deformation, after their formation; by twinning; a result independent of the SFE of the material.

However, one factor that has not been considered is whether different solutes have differing effects on the thermodynamic driving force for solidification. This paper reveals that <b>addition</b> of <b>solute</b> reduces the driving force for solidification for a given undercooling, and that for a particular Q value, it is reduced more substantially when adding eutectic-forming solutes than peritectic-forming elements.

As subsequent nucleation can occur at smaller constitutional supercoolings for peritectic-forming elements, a smaller grain size is thus produced. The very small constitutional supercooling required to trigger subsequent nucleation in alloys containing Ti is considered as a major contributor to its extraordinary grain refining efficiency in cast Al alloys even without the deliberate addition of inoculants...|$|R

Dissolved hydrocarbon concentrations including benzene decreased to non-detect in 84 days but experienced important rebounds after ending circulation. Nitrite accumulated temporarily but was consumed entirely when solute injection stopped. The mass balance calculations revealed that about 83 % of the nitrate was used for hydrocarbon degradation, with the remaining being used for oxidation of reduced sulfur. A reactive transport model was used for the delineation of the treated zone. This model suggested that denitrification influenced flow and transport in the dipole. It is concluded that successful promotion of denitrifying hydrocarbon degradation is easily obtained in this aquifer and enables to abate dissolved concentrations, and that dipole configuration is a good option.

Methods. We devised an iteration method to compute glucose appearance (GA) within the extracellular space, to obtain the PNa (plasma sodium concentration) expected by glucose addition only (PNaG). The difference between this and the actual measurement (PNa 1) was used to compute the attending Na and/or volume depletion, and the PNa expected during correction. The equations were validated on compu-ter-built models, where the electrolyte derangements were simulated, generating true values of plasma glucose (PG) and Na concentrations, from which surfeit and deficits were back-calculated with our formulas. We also computed GA and PNaG on 43 patients who were stratified into a group with normal hydration (PNa 1 PNaG), one with prevalent Na depletion (PNa 1 PNaG). The volume conditions established by our computations were compared by logistic regression analysis with those assessed from clinical laboratory data. Results. The computer simulations demonstrated that the method gave exact results when only one variable changed, clinically useful estimates {{in the presence of}} mixed volume and sodium deficits.

When viewed in cross-polarised light, interference in the oxide layer produces colours which depend on grain orientation and oxide thickness; hence the grain structure is imaged. ...|$|R
40|$|Drying {{is one of}} {{the main}} unit {{operations}} employed within the food industry as a method of preservation and extended shelf life. Rehydration is a process aimed at the restoration of the raw material properties, where the degree of rehydration may be considered as a measure of the physical degradation of the material caused by drying. A need has been recognised by the food industry for a thorough knowledge of the rehydration process in order to produce better quality products that are acceptable from a safety perspective, whilst conserving energy. The influence of processing variables on the rehydration characteristics were quantified using moisture diffusivity coefficients, evaluated by Fick's second law of diffusion. Processing parameters which improved rehydration characteristics included temperature, microwave drying, blanching and pretreatment with ionic surfactants. Microwave power and mixing had a limited effect on rehydration kinetics. <b>Solute</b> <b>addition</b> reduced the effective diffusion coefficient, with the extent of the decrease being dependent on concentration. Empirical models were utilised in order to predict the process. of water sorption as a function of temperature and time. Product quality was assessed by examining the texture degradation and volumetric changes which occurred during the rehydration process. Parameters, which influenced moisture content and morphological properties of the dried material, were recognised as key determinants that have an affect on the quality ofthe product during reconstitution. The thermal resistance of bacterial spores associated with this class of food were evaluated at various levels of moisture content. Thermal resistance decreased with increasing moisture content and, therefore, if complete rehydration is not achieved, the severity of the intended thermal process may be reduced.

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} on {{the regulation of}} the mitochondrial cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition pore (MTP). Energized, coupled rat liver mitochondria incubated in sucrose medium {{in the presence of}} phosphate maintain a high proton electrochemical gradient (delta microH) and a low permeability to <b>solutes.</b> <b>Addition</b> of a small (10 - 20 microM) Ca 2 + pulse leads to a transient membrane depolarization. After Ca 2 + accumulation, a high delta microH is recovered, and mitochondria remain coupled indefinitely. Yet, addition of fully uncoupling concentrations of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP) brings about MTP opening within seconds. This finding confirms that MTP opening is the consequence rather than the cause of membrane depolarization, and allowed us to study the operation of the MTP in a synchronized population of mitochondria, since pore opening can be triggered by the addition of uncoupler under a series of experimental conditions. We find that three regulatory sites can be defined: (i) an internal Me 2 + binding site: when this site is occupied by Ca 2 +, the pore "open" probability increases, while other Me 2 + ions (Sr 2 +, Mn 2 +) have an inhibitory effect; (ii) an external Me 2 + binding site: when this site is occupied by Me 2 + ions, including Ca 2 +, the pore open probability decreases; (iii) an independent cyclosporin A binding site: when this site is occupied by cyclosporin A the pore open probability decreases. We show that at variance from the case of cyclosporin A, MTP inhibition by the phospholipase A 2 inhibitors nupercaine and trifluoperazine is Ca(2 +) -competitive and is presumably related to interference by these drugs with Ca 2 + binding to the internal regulatory site...|$|R
