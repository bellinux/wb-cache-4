25|$|This {{method of}} {{detonation}} produces energies over 100keV (~109 K temperatures), suitable {{not only for}} nuclear fusion, but other higher-order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D–D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved {{to be in a}} predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small <b>spherical</b> <b>cavity</b> that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a hemispherical shell (3–6mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter hemispherical cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the detonation wave at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The detonation wave in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity, reflects, and implodes on the preheated burnt gases, focuses {{at the center of the}} hemisphere (50microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1mm) of extremely high-temperature, high-pressure and high-density plasma.|$|E

Here, the formation of <b>spherical</b> <b>cavities,</b> or ‘breath figures’—made by the condensation of micrometre-sized water droplets on the surface of a polymer solution—that self-assemble into a well-ordered hexagonal array, is combined with the self-assembly of CdSe nanoparticles at the polymer solution–water droplet interface. Complete evaporation of the solvent and water confines the particle assembly to an array of <b>spherical</b> <b>cavities</b> and allows for ex situ investigation. Fluorescence confocal, transmission electron and scanning electron microscope images show the preferential segregation of the CdSe nanoparticles to the polymer solution–water interface where they form a 5 – 7 -nm-thick layer, thus functionalizing the walls of the holes.

40|$|We {{study the}} conformations of a semiflexible chain, {{confined}} in nano-scaled <b>spherical</b> <b>cavities,</b> under two distinct processes of confinement. Radial contraction and packaging are employed as two confining procedures. The former method is performed by gradually decreasing {{the diameter of}} a spherical shell which envelopes a confined chain. The latter procedure is carried out by injecting the chain inside a spherical shell through a hole on the shell surface. The chain is modeled with a rigid body molecular dynamics simulation and its parameters are adjusted to DNA base-pair elasticity. Directional order parameter is employed to analyze and compare the confined chain and the conformations of the chain for two different sizes of the spheres are studied in both procedures. It is shown that for the confined chains in the sphere sizes of our study, they appear in spiral or tennis-ball structures, and the tennis-ball structure {{is more likely to}} be observed in more compact confinements.

50|$|An {{integrating}} sphere (also {{known as an}} Ulbricht sphere) is an optical component consisting of a hollow <b>spherical</b> <b>cavity</b> with its interior covered with a diffuse white reflective coating, with small holes for entrance and exit ports.

If the fuel is dense enough and hot enough, the fusion reaction rate will be high enough to burn a significant fraction of the fuel before it has dissipated.

Inertial confinement is also attempted in [...] "controlled" [...] nuclear fusion, where the driver is a laser, ion, or electron beam, or a Z-pinch.

50|$|At 10:00 a.m. on October 22, 1964, the United States Atomic Energy Commission detonated an {{underground}} nuclear device inside the Tatum Salt Dome, near Baxterville (Project Salmon). The {{plan was to}} detonate a single nuclear bomb about 2,700 feet down within solid salt. Two miles from the test site the blast shook pecans off the pecan trees, and homes, barns, and other buildings near the test site saw major to severe damage. About 400 residents were evacuated from around the test site for the day. At the test site, creeks ran black with silt-laden water, and seven days after the blast, more than 400 nearby residents had filed damage claims with the government, reporting that their homes had been damaged or that their water wells had gone dry. Project Salmon was considered a success, with the bomb delivering the same force as 5,000 tons of TNT, approximately one-third as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. The shock wave was felt in downtown Hattiesburg, almost 30 miles away. The bomb blasted a <b>spherical</b> <b>cavity</b> about 110 feet in diameter inside the salt dome, creating a cavern. This cavern was used for a second nuclear test within the salt dome on December 3, 1966 (Project Sterling) which had the force of 350 tons of TNT. These two underground nuclear explosions {{were the only ones}} executed on U.S. soil east of the Rocky Mountains. The Tatum Salt Dome site saw two additional tests by the Atomic Energy Commission as a part of Project Miracle Play. Project Miracle Play was similar to Project Dribble in that it too was designed to detect underground testing, but this time the two blasts were conventional bombs instead of nuclear. Mississippi’s two explosions in Project Miracle Play in 1969 and 1970 were fueled by a mixture of oxygen and methane.|$|E

40|$|Density {{fluctuations}} in liquid water {{are at the}} heart of numerous phenomena associated with hydrophobic effects such as protein folding and the interaction between biomolecules. One of the most fundamental processes in this regard is the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water. The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies examine density fluctuations at the short length scale focusing exclusively on <b>spherical</b> <b>cavities.</b> In this work, we use both first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that density {{fluctuations in}} liquid water can deviate significantly from the canonical spherical shapes. We show that regions of empty space are frequently characterized by exotic, highly asymmetric shapes that can be quite delocalized over the hydrogen bond network. Interestingly, density fluctuations of these shapes are characterized by Gaussian statistics with larger fluctuations. An important consequence of this is that the work required to create non <b>spherical</b> <b>cavities</b> can be substantially smaller than that of spheres. This feature is also qualitatively captured by the Lum-Chandler-Weeks theory. The scaling behavior of the free energy as a function of the volume at short length scales is qualitatively different for the nonspherical entities. We also demonstrate that nonspherical density fluctuations are important for accommodating the hydrophobic amino acid alanine and are thus likely to have significant implications when it comes to solvating highly asymmetrical species such as alkanes, polymers, or biomolecules...|$|R
