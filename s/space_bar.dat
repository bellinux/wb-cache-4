25|$|The <b>Space</b> <b>bar</b> is a {{horizontal}} {{bar in the}} lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses {{in addition to its}} normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> is used for pausing and resuming the playback.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{pressing}} the <b>space</b> <b>bar,</b> the only control {{available to the}} player is to press the Esc key and quit the game.|$|E
25|$|The startup {{process for}} Windows Vista has changed {{completely}} {{in comparison to}} earlier versions of Windows. The NTLDR boot loader {{has been replaced by}} a more flexible system, with NTLDR's functionality split between two new components: winload.exe and Windows Boot Manager. A notable change is that the Windows Boot Manager is invoked by pressing the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> instead of the F8 function key. The F8 key still remains assigned for advanced boot options once the Windows Boot Manager menu appears.|$|E

30|$|When {{concrete}} slabs {{are subjected to}} loads, bearing stresses and deflection are mainly affected by the <b>spacing</b> of dowel <b>bars.</b> Decreased dowel <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> results in the reduction in bearing stresses and deflection. However, if dowel <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> decreases to less than 203  mm (8  in), a horizontal plane of weakness in the concrete slab at the joint face will occur. On the contrary, the increased dowel <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> leads to excessive bearing stresses and deflection at the joint. Currently, most highway agencies have adopted a 305  mm (12  in) spacing requirement, which also depends on the slab thickness and subgrade conditions.|$|R
25|$|In GNU/Linux, under recent {{versions}} of GTK+, {{there are various}} methods of producing these dashes. For em dashes, one may use the compose key followed by three presses of the hyphen character. For en dashes, one may press the compose key followed by two hyphens and a period. For all dashes, one may press and hold ctrl and shift and then press u (and release them all) after which an underlined u appears. Then, type the Unicode number (i.e., 2015) for the appropriate dash and press enter or the <b>space</b> <b>bar.</b> Also, other keys may be remapped to create dashes.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay in Myst III: Exile {{is similar}} to that of its predecessors. The player explores immersive, pre-rendered environments known as Ages by using either mouse clicks or the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> for {{movement}} from set nodes across each Age. Unlike previous games, which employed a series of still images, Exile uses a [...] "free look" [...] system which gives the player a 360-degree field of view. The game also has an optional Zip mode, like Myst and Riven, to cross explored terrain quickly by skipping several nodes. Clicking allows the player to manipulate objects and pick up items. The on-screen cursor changes in context to show possible actions.|$|E
500|$|Pellets also spawn {{from other}} snake avatars. By either {{pressing}} the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> or {{clicking on the}} mouse or trackpad, the player can activate [...] "boost mode", which causes the avatar to speed up. When a player uses [...] "boost mode", the snake loses some mass, causing the snake's size to shrink slightly, with the mass that is lost from the boost appearing as a line of dots where the boost was used. This feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents. Another strategy that players use to defeat opponents is coiling around them in a loop until the opponent, trapped in the loop, crashes into the player.|$|E
50|$|Cocoon was a Techno club in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It had a {{space for}} 1.500 visitors. It {{consisted}} of two restaurants, multiple lounge <b>spaces,</b> <b>bars</b> and little Cocoons made out of sofas which were placed inside the walls. The club was unique by architecture and design also by the dancing floors. It was closed on 30 November 2012. It {{was replaced by the}} club moon13 on the same location.|$|R

500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} as a contractor for Legend Entertainment, Meretzky started the company Boffo Games {{with two of his}} friends in 1994. The operation was bankrolled by Media Vision, an American electronics manufacturer. Hodj 'n' Podj was Boffo's first project, and the highest-budget production of Meretzky's career at that time, although it was surpassed by The <b>Space</b> <b>Bar.</b> The game was published by Media Vision, and was the first project on which Meretzky acted only as a designer, rather than as a designer and programmer. However, after two months of production, the game's development was interrupted by a $100 million securities fraud scandal at Media Vision. Meretzky later called it [...] "kind of a mini-Enron". Media Vision sought bankruptcy protection, and Hodj 'n' Podj was purchased at auction by Virgin Interactive, alongside the games The Daedalus Encounter and Rivers of Dawn.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical type systems {{introduced}} {{near the}} end of the 19th century, such as the Linotype and Monotype machines, allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition. [...] Just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text, the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents. [...] But the typewriters' mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing—typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the <b>space</b> <b>bar.</b> [...] Typists in some English-speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing, but later settled on two spaces, a practice that continued throughout the 20th century. [...] This became known as English spacing, and marked a divergence from French typists, who continued to use French spacing.|$|E
500|$|The player's {{left and}} right arrow keys and <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> control a bumper that moves around a purple circle. Kanye West, {{represented}} by his head, attempts to enter the circle while repeatedly rapping [...] "Don't let me into my zone", and the player must hit him with the bumper—this causes him to disappear {{in a burst of}} dollar signs, and the player is rewarded with cash, added to a total displayed on the webpage. A silhouette of Kanye's head shows where he will next spawn, and an arrow inside it indicates what direction he will travel in. Play continues this way, with Kanye getting faster and the zone getting bigger, until the player fails to prevent Kanye from entering the zone, when they are presented with a message declaring they have lost; an image of rapper Jay-Z's head joins that of West, and the lyric [...] "I'm definitely in my zone" [...] is heard. If the player's cash score is high enough, it is added to a leaderboard on the right of the page.|$|E
25|$|Fringe venues come in {{all shapes}} and sizes, with use being made of nearly any viable space that is available, from regular theatres (e.g. the Traverse or Bedlam Theatre), {{function}} rooms (e.g. the Assembly Rooms), churches and church halls (e.g. the Quaker Meeting House, Paradise in Augustines), lecture theatres (including the notable George Square Theatre), conference centres, other university rooms and <b>spaces,</b> <b>bars</b> and pubs, temporary structures (The Famous Spiegeltent and the Udderbelly), schools, a public toilet, the back of a taxi, a double-decker bus and even in the audience's own homes.|$|R

Apple Keyboards do not have the two extra keys.|$|E
40|$|In impact {{resistance}} of reinforced concrete (RC) panels against projectiles {{the contribution of}} the orthogonal mesh reinforcement has been ignored. In this study the contribution of mesh reinforcement to {{impact resistance}} and itseffect on the nature of local damage caused by impact of non-deformable projectiles are investigated. The investigation included a combination of 53 experiments and series of finite-element based numerical simulations. Three levels of local damage modes were investegated based on the severity of the degree of damage in the impacted panels. Mesh reinforcement ratio within the range of reinforcement ratio considered, namely 0. 19 % to 0. 48 %, was irrelevant to the impact behavior of RC panels under different impact velocities, while <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was to be a controlling parameter for the degree of damage. RC panels reinforced with <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 1. 5 times the panel thickness have a tendency to spall concrete from the back face more than RC panels with closely <b>spaced</b> <b>bars.</b> RC panels reinforced with <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 1. 5 time the panel thickness formed punching shear crater, while panels reinforced with less than that limit distributed the damage over a wider area without forming the punching shear crater on the back face. Orthogonal mesh reinforcement with <b>bars</b> <b>spaced</b> no wider than one-third of the projectile diameter were able to prevent the projectiles from perforating the panels. Offseting the reinforcing meshes did not improve the impact resistance of RC panels. An equation was developed to estimate the perforation resistance of an RC panel under impact of non- deformable projectile with given mass, diameter, and impact velocity. ...|$|R

2500|$|... {{dead key}} – {{describes}} a key that when typed, does not advance the typing position, thus allowing another character to be overstruck {{on top of}} the original character. [...] This was typically used to combine diacritical marks with letters they modified (e.g. è can be generated by first pressing ` and then e). The dead key feature was often implemented mechanically by having the typist press and hold the <b>space</b> <b>bar</b> while typing the characters to be superimposed.|$|E
