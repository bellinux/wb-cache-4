40|$|Architecture in its mere {{perception}} is 'something' {{to do with}} mass and space, beyond and above that it is initially responsible for the genius of locus with the gentle discipline of the mass- space paradox. Yet present urban settings experience a destruction of spirit of place (namely anti spaces and lost spaces within the city) for we could hardly find this discipline within our cities. An analysis of this implication shows that the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> (i. e. voids among solids) make a virtual impact on this regard. <b>Spaces</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> may either well thought, designed or vice verse. Historical and contemporary example trace evidences of both situations in terms Background of success and failure. Also in domestic context the design of cities/towns indicate these extremes and varying stages where the later ended up with paralyzed urban setting...|$|R

5000|$|The {{structure}} of the school {{is divided into three}} main buildings. The 200 building to the east specializes in world languages, social sciences, English, business and mathematics. The 300 building to the west features classes in the science, mathematics, fine arts, and special education. The 400 building to the south houses weight rooms and classrooms for miscellaneous subjects, such as art, music, French and computer graphics. The 500 buildings, which are seven portable rooms to the south of the 400 building, house social science classrooms.

50|$|Void {{metabolism}} is {{an urban}} formula {{which focuses on}} void spaces which develop between buildings when they are rebuilt.In Tokyo small houses cover the land with greenery inserted in the gaps between. This is a highly sustainable urban form which regenerates itself; with privately owned properties. It {{can be considered a}} type of metabolism, though quite different in content than the 1960s architectural thought. At that time concepts focussed on the composition of the vertical core. We can see that architects believed that the construction of the city would be carried out effectively through a concentration of power and capital. However, the regeneration of houses revolve not around a core, but a void- the gap <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings.</b> This would be determined by the initiatives of individual families, rather than the accumulation of central capital.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with this}} {{pamphlet}} was {{a description of}} the Tullgren Plan Residence Apartment. The plan was seven apartment buildings within the same area. Each apartment was placed so each family would receive maximum sunlight and air. The buildings would’ve also occupied 22% less land, creating more open space around each building. More space meant more things to do with the landscaping. Tullgren’s plan for the outside included a sunken garden cour, pool, flower garden, shaded lawn, and promenade. There would have also been a playground area for small children between the buildings, and facilities for larger children. The playground would’ve included the usual playground equipment like swings, sand pits, shallow wading pools, and a camp-fire space. With the open <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings,</b> it also allotted space for laundry drying yards. Tullgren saw the possibilities to do the project in a plot of 206,965 square feet, offering maximum housing at a minimum cost. Herbert’s ideal was with careful planning and some government assistance would amount to a great deal of affordable housing at a reasonable profit.|$|E
5000|$|The Tenement House Act of 1867, {{the state}} legislature's first {{comprehensive}} legislation on housing conditions, prohibited cellar apartments unless {{the ceiling was}} 1 foot above street level; required one water closet per 20 residents {{and the provision of}} fire escapes; and paid some attention to <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings.</b> This was amended by the Tenement House Act of 1879, known as the Old Law, which required lot coverage of no more than 65 percent. As of 1869, New York State law defined a “tenement house” as “any house or building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied as the home or residence of three families or more living independently of each other, and doing their cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon any floor, so living and cooking, but having a right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets or privies, or some of them.” L 1867, ch 908. The New York City Board of Health, empowered to enforce the regulations, declined to do so. As a compromise, the Old Law tenement became the standard: this had a [...] "dumbbell" [...] shape, with air and light shafts on either side in the center (usually fitted to the shafts in the adjacent buildings), and typically covered 80 percent of the lot. James Ware is credited with the design; he had won a contest the previous year held by Plumber and Sanitary Engineer magazine to find the most practical improved tenement design, in which profitability was the most important factor to the jury.|$|E

40|$|In China, a {{standard}} of "relatively comfortable housing conditions" is set for the nation, {{but there is still}} a need for a parallel goal for outdoor spaces.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> in Beijing's new housing developments. The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> has been chosen as a starting point for this research because it covers largest amount of land and due to its close proximity to homes, it is closely related to people's daily lives. The quality of outdoor space is defined by a combination of factors. This study uses eight criteria to address the notion of quality: spatial hierarchy; usable space; safety and defense; health and comfort; privacy and territoriality; social contact; aesthetic appeal; and maintenance and administration. These correlated aspects are set as evaluation criteria for the six case studies included in this research. Data and analysis of case studies is used to arrive at conclusions for policy-making and further study...|$|E

By leaving wide <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings,</b> designers created large green spaces and parks, which are lacking in many prewar Czech neighbourhoods.
