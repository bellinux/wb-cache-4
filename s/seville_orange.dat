2500|$|The {{benchmark}} {{citrus fruit}} for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish <b>Seville</b> <b>orange,</b> Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high pectin content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the preserve. [...] In America, marmalade is sweet.|$|E
50|$|According to the Beefeater website, Beefeater Gin {{contains}} {{nine different}} botanicals: juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, <b>seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> and lemon peel. Unique to Beefeater’s production is the steeping of the peel of lemons and <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> whole juniper berries {{and other natural}} botanicals for a full 24 hours prior to distillation. This long process allows for a full extraction of flavour from the botanicals, capturing {{a wide range of}} volatile oils. The distillation itself takes around eight hours to complete, overseen by master distiller Desmond Payne - with the spirit then taken to Scotland where it is blended and bottled at 40% ABV.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{information}} given on the consent forms, it seems brexpiprazole is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, like its predecessor aripiprazole. Participants {{in the clinical}} trials are advised to avoid grapefruit, <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges</b> and related citruses.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{different}} varieties of a tea known as Lady Grey; {{the two most}} common kinds (Cornflower Lady Grey and Citrus Lady Grey), which combine Earl Grey tea with Cornflower and <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> respectively. [...] "Lady Grey" [...] is a trademark of Twinings.|$|R
60|$|As, {{whenever}} the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother {{took it to}} be an infallible sign that he ‘wanted support,’ the blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit. It was a most wonderful closet, worthy of Cloisterham and of Minor Canon Corner. Above it, a portrait of Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at the spectator, with a knowing air of being up to the contents of the closet, and a musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in one delicious fugue. No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges, openable all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by degrees, this rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two perpendicular slides met; the one falling down, and the other pushing up. The upper slide, on being pulled down (leaving the lower a double mystery), revealed deep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and agreeably outlandish vessels of blue and white, the luscious lodgings of preserved tamarinds and ginger. Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name inscribed upon his stomach. The pickles, in a uniform of rich brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or sombre drab continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed capitals, as Walnut, Gherkin, Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and other members of that noble family. The jams, as being of a less masculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced themselves in feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be Raspberry, Gooseberry, Apricot, Plum, Damson, Apple, and Peach. The scene closing on these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, oranges were revealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to temper their acerbity if unripe. Home-made biscuits waited at the Court of these Powers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-cake, and various slender ladies’ fingers, to be dipped into sweet wine and kissed. Lowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined the sweet wine and a stock of cordials: whence issued whispers of <b>Seville</b> <b>Orange,</b> Lemon, Almond, and Caraway-seed. There was a crowning air upon this closet of closets, of having been for ages hummed through by the Cathedral bell and organ, until those venerable bees had made sublimated honey of everything in store; and it was always observed that every dipper among the shelves (deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head, shoulders, and elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to have undergone a saccharine transfiguration.|$|E

50|$|Imatinib (Gleevec): Although {{no formal}} studies with imatinib and {{grapefruit}} juice have been conducted, {{the fact that}} grapefruit juice is a known inhibitor of the CYP 3A4 suggests that co-administration may lead to increased imatinib plasma concentrations. Likewise, although no formal studies were conducted, co-administration of imatinib with another specific type of citrus juice called <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice (SOJ) may lead to increased imatinib plasma concentrations via inhibition of the CYP3A isoenzymes. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice is not usually consumed as a juice because of its sour taste, but it is found in marmalade and other jams. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice {{has been reported to}} be a possible inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes without affecting MDR1 when taken concomitantly with ciclosporin.|$|E
50|$|Pique is a Puerto Rican {{hot sauce}} made by {{steeping}} hot peppers in vinegar. One popular variant is habanero peppers with <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges.</b> Different types of Island ajíes picantes (hot peppers) will have varying amounts of heat, the hottest {{of all is}} the ají caballero.|$|R
25|$|A broadly popular {{style of}} bitters {{that emerged from}} the period is orange bitters, the flavor of which ranges from dryly {{aromatic}} to fruity, and is most commonly made from the rinds of <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges</b> and various spices. Orange bitters are commonly called for in older cocktail recipes.|$|R
25|$|Marmalade {{usually is}} made with <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges.</b> All parts of the fruit are used: the pith and pips (separated {{and placed in a}} muslin bag) are boiled in a mixture of juice, slivered peel, sliced-up flesh, sugar, and water to extract their pectin, which helps the {{conserve}} to set.|$|R

50|$|Moscatel Naranja or Orange Moscatel is a sweet wine {{produced}} in Málaga. Bitter <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> peels, once dried, are macerated in alcohol distilled from wine {{and this is}} added to sweet moscatel wine. Orange Wine from Málaga is almost clear in appearance.|$|E
5000|$|CTV infects {{several species}} of the plant genus, Citrus, {{including}} Hassaku orange (Citrus hassaku), sour orange (Citrus aurantium), and any Citrus species grafted onto sour orange rootstock, sweet orange (C. sinensis), grapefruit (C. paradisi), lime and <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> (C. aurantifolia), and mandarin (C. reticulata).|$|E
50|$|After {{the almost}} instant {{success of the}} gin, it was soon made the James Burrough Company’s {{flagship}} product. The original Beefeater recipe book dated 1895, specifies that nine botanicals are essential (juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, <b>seville</b> <b>oranges</b> and lemon peel) to create the full-bodied and robust flavour so distinct in this gin.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sweet oranges}} and bitter oranges {{appear to be}} mandarin-pomelo hybrids,. Bitter oranges (such as the <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges</b> often used in marmalade) can {{interfere}} with drugs including etoposide, a chemotherapy drug, some beta blocker drugs used to treat high blood pressure, and cyclosporine, taken by transplant patients to prevent rejection of their new organs. Evidence on sweet oranges is more mixed.|$|R
2500|$|Synephrine {{has been}} found in {{marmalade}} made from Citrus unshiu (Satsuma mandarin) obtained in Japan, at a concentration of ~0.12mg/g (or about 2.4mg/20g serving). Most of the orange marmalades made in the US are produced using [...] "sweet" [...] oranges (C. sinensis), whereas [...] "bitter" [...] or <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges</b> (C. aurantium) are used for making the more traditional, bitterer marmalades in the United Kingdom.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a hybrid}} between Citrus maxima (pomelo) and Citrus reticulata (mandarin).

50|$|Laver can {{be eaten}} cold as a salad with lamb or mutton. A simple {{preparation}} is {{to heat the}} laver and to add butter and the juice of a lemon or <b>Seville</b> <b>orange.</b> Laver can be heated and served with boiled bacon. It is {{used to make the}} Welsh dish known as laverbread.|$|E
50|$|Grapefruit, <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> bergamot, and {{possibly}} other citrus also contain {{large amounts of}} naringin. It {{can take up to}} 72 hours before the effects of the naringin on the CYP3A4 enzyme are seen. This is problematic as a 4 oz portion of grapefruit contains enough naringin to inhibit the metabolism of substrates of CYP3A4. Nagarin is a flavonoid which contributes to the bitter flavour of grapefruit.|$|R
50|$|Under the Kalbid dynasty, Sicily, and {{especially}} Palermo, {{was an important}} economic centre of the Mediterranean. The Muslims introduced lemons, <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges</b> and sugar cane, as well as cotton and mulberries for sericulture, and built irrigation systems for agriculture. Sicily was also an important hub for trade between the Near East, North Africa and the Italian maritime republics such as Amalfi, Pisa and Genoa.|$|R
50|$|This can be {{a problem}} for those who can eat only some citrus varieties. Drug {{interactions}} with chemicals found in some citrus, including grapefruit and <b>Seville</b> <b>oranges,</b> make the ancestry of citrus fruit of interest; many commonly sold citrus varieties are grapefruit hybrids or pummello-descended grapefruit relatives. One medical review has advised patients on medication to avoid all citrus juice, although some citrus fruits contain no furanocoumarins.|$|R
50|$|Chase Distillery is also {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} Williams Gin, which uses Chase Vodka as its base spirit. The alcohol is then infused with botanicals using a traditional carter head style still to create a range of products including Williams Elegant Gin, Williams Sloe and Mulberry Gin, Chase Eureka Citrus Gin and Williams <b>Seville</b> <b>Orange</b> Gin.|$|E
5000|$|For {{many decades}} now, the {{preferred}} citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain {{has been the}} Spanish <b>Seville</b> <b>orange,</b> Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high pectin content, which [...] "gives a good set" [...] -- that is, it readily attains the thick consistency expected of marmalade. The peel imparts a lively bitter taste to the marmalade.|$|E
50|$|Calisaya (liqueur) is an herbal liqueur {{produced}} by infusing cinchona calisaya, and other barks, roots and flowers in grain neutral spirit and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> extract.
