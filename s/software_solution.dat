500|$|The {{need for}} such {{software}} was first recognized in 1989 at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, resulting {{in the creation of}} IMDUMP (by Michael White) and in 1990, SafeBack (developed by Sydex). Similar software was developed in other countries; DIBS (a hardware and <b>software</b> <b>solution)</b> was released commercially in the UK in 1991, and Rob McKemmish released Fixed Disk Image free to Australian law enforcement. [...] These tools allowed examiners to create an exact copy of a piece of digital media to work on, leaving the original disk intact for verification.
