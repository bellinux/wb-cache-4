40|$|The viewgraphs and {{discussion}} of the NASA High-Speed Research (HSR) Program being conducted to develop the technologies essential for the successful U. S. development of a <b>commercial</b> <b>supersonic</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> in the 2005 timeframe are provided. The HSR program is being conducted in two phases, with the first phase stressing technology to ensure environmental acceptability and the second phase stressing technology to make the vehicle economically viable (in contrast to the current Concorde design). During Phase 1 of the program, {{a key element of}} the environmental emphases is minimization of community noise through effective engine nozzle noise suppression technology and through improving the performance of high-lift systems. An overview of the current Phase 1 High-Lift Program, directed at technology for community noise reduction, is presented. The total target for takeoff engine noise reduction to meet expected regulations is believed to be about 20 EPNdB. The high-lift research is stressing the exploration of innovative high-lift concepts and advanced flight operations procedures to achieve a substantial (approximately 6 EPNdB) reduction in community noise to supplement the reductions expected from engine nozzle noise suppression concepts; primary concern is focused on the takeoff and climbout operations where very high engine power settings are used. Significant reductions in aerodynamic drag in this regime will allow substantial reductions in the required engine thrust levels and therefore reductions in the noise generated...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this accident, the AAIB issued safety {{recommendation}} 2006-101 (regarding shoulder harnesses) and a copy of their earlier study to the JAA and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which would take over from the JAA as the primary European regulatory body {{over a period of several}} years, beginning before the accident. While considering this recommendation, the EASA took the interim step of issuing its own Safety Information Bulletin (SIB 2008-24), which advised the <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> community of the CAA's earlier study and of the benefits of shoulder harnesses. In 2011, the EASA published its opinion that the requirement recommended by the AAIB following the Loganair accident that shoulder harnesses should be mandatory for each passenger seat in all <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft weighing less than 5,700kg, regardless of when the aircraft was first registered.
