5|$|Before {{the episode}} was broadcast, it was {{announced}} that Rupert Penry-Jones would leave the series after playing Adam Carter for four years, while afterwards, another announcement was made introducing a new lead character, Lucas North. Inspiration towards the plot for the episode, and the remainder of the series, came from the resurgence of Russia, which the producers felt would in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> threaten the security of the West. The episode was partially filmed on location in Moscow, the first time in series history where filming took place outside the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffmanâ€™s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by head writer Neil Cross. It was also {{additionally}} written by Ben Richards. The plot of the episode {{was influenced by the}} resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> is threatening the security of the West. The producers also included scenes that would show Lucas adjusting to the outside world following eight years of imprisonment, to show how emotionally damaged the character is, and make the audience realise he is struggling. One of the scenes include Lucas struggling to sleep on a bed, and soon resorts to lying on the floor instead.|$|E

5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888. Indifferent to the new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued to be thought of as a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians demonstrated their feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways,</b> such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
5|$|Penry-Jones {{announced}} {{his intention to}} leave the series in December 2007, while it was later announced Armitage would join. Norris and Raison were both asked to return after their characters were left open for return {{after the end of}} the last series. In developing the series, the producers wanted to repeat the serialised style from series six, and settled on using the resurgence of Russia as the primary storyline, as they felt that at the time, the resurgence is in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> threatening the security of the west. The producers also participated in several meetings with the writers to discuss the purpose of Sugarhorse. Filming started in London in March 2008, and later finished on August in the same year, in Moscow, the first time in series history where Spooks was filmed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together {{to think about what}} is to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in twelve to eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways,</b> is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5|$|The {{second is}} the {{circular}} bodied plucked lute, the yueqin. Percussion instruments include the daluo, xiaoluo, and naobo. The player of the gu and ban, a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, Xipi and Erhuang, originally differed in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways.</b> In the Xipi style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In Erhuang, on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including manban (a slow tempo), yuanban (a standard, medium-fast tempo), kuai sanyan ("leading beat"), daoban ("leading beat"), sanban ("rubato beat"), and yaoban ("shaking beat"). The xipi style also uses several unique tempos, including erliu ("two-six"), and kuaiban (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, yuanban, manban, and kuaiban are most commonly seen. The tempo {{at any given time}} is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational, and Xipi as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.|$|E

25|$|Several {{critics have}} written that the reboot films downplay the {{original}} series' theme of race, generally arguing {{that this is}} to their detriment. Others, however, write that the films incorporate racial themes in <b>subtler</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{of these}} terms are from a jargon used for {{technical}} Go writing {{and to some extent}} specially developed for Go journalism. Some authors of English-language Go materials avoid use of Japanese technical terms, and the way they are applied can differ in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> from the original meanings.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{suffered}} a hearing impairment in his youth, leaving {{him with a}} slight speech impediment, and he continues to wear a hearing aid.

25|$|Legislation {{passed to}} {{implement}} the Constitution, or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, broadens and, in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways,</b> changes the meanings given {{to the words of}} the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect. If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged, however, it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution.|$|E

Copper deficiency alters {{the role of}} other cellular constituents involved in antioxidant activities, such as iron, selenium, and glutathione, and therefore {{plays an important role}} in diseases in which oxidant stress is elevated. A marginal, i.e., 'mild' copper deficiency, believed to be more widespread than previously thought, can impair human health in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E
25|$|Living Space â€“ Created by Johanna Inman and Anna Norton, Living Space {{consists}} of five videos containing time-lapse {{photographs of the}} ways Eastern State Penitentiary is altered by the changes of weather and light. The artists put their cameras in places that make Eastern State Penitentiary unique to capture the <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> nature plays upon {{the structure of the}} building. The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.|$|E
25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways,</b> and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E

25|$|Opening a Word Document file in {{a version}} of Word {{other than the one}} with which it was created can cause {{incorrect}} display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not so <b>subtle</b> <b>ways</b> (such as changing the font, or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version. Rich Text Format (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging formatted text between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.|$|E
25|$|Four {{billion years}} in Earth's past, {{a group of}} Salaxalans attempt to {{populate}} the Earth; however, a mistake caused by their engineer â€“ who used an Electric Monk to irrationally believe the proposed fix would work â€“ causes their landing craft to explode, killing the Salaxalans and generating the spark of energy needed to start the process of life on Earth. The ghost of the Salaxalan engineer roams the earth waiting to undo his mistake, watching human life develop and waiting to find a soul that it can possess. The ghost finds it can only possess individuals that fundamentally {{want to do the}} same task it is trying to accomplish itself.

25|$|The more {{domestic}} {{rooms of}} No. 13 {{are at the}} front of the house, many of them highly unusual, but often in <b>subtle</b> <b>ways.</b> The domed ceiling of the Breakfast Room, inset with convex mirrors, has influenced architects from around the world. The Library-Dining Room reflects the influence of Etruscan tombs and perhaps even gothic design in its repertoire of small pendants like those in fan vaulting. It is decorated in a rich 'Pompeian' red. The Study contains a collection of Roman architectural fragments and the two external courtyards, the Monument Court and Monk's Yard contain an array of architectural fragments, Classical in the Monument Court with its central column or 'pasticcio' representing Architecture and Gothic in the Monk's Yard, filled with medieval stonework from the Palace of Westminster.|$|E
