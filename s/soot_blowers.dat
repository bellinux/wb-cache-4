50|$|Sonic <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> offer a {{cost-effective}} and non-destructive means of preventing ash and particulate build-up within the power generation industry. They use high energy - low frequency sound waves that provide 360° particulate de-bonding {{and at a}} speed in excess of 344 metres per second. Because they employ non-destructive sound waves, unlike steam <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> they eliminate any concerns over corrosion, erosion or mechanical damage and do not produce an effluent stream.|$|E
50|$|Sonic <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> {{create a}} rapid series of very {{powerful}} sound induced pressure fluctuations which when transmitted into the ash or particulate, {{cause them to}} de-bond from other particles and from the heat transfer surface {{to which they are}} bonded and so carried away in the gas stream. This prevents the ash from building up and sintering onto the boiler tubes thus significantly reducing thermal efficiency. This is in contrast to the operating principles of steam <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> which are usually only employed at most once every eight hours by which time the ash has built up and baked hard onto the heat transfer surfaces. The steam soot blower then tries to blast away his hard deposit, usually only from {{the leading edge of the}} steam tubes.|$|E

Steam flows through the lance tube and is discharged at the free end to blow off soot. The lance tube, rotating slowly about its axis at about 12 rpm, is supported at an intermediate position by a support bearing, that is, a lance bearing. Vibrations and noises occurred in operation while a lance tube is being put into a gas heater slowly.

50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E

30|$|There are no {{permanent}} solutions for fouling, {{but there are}} certain technologies which can help in minimizing the deposition problems in boilers. Some of these processes are pulse detonation wave technology, intelligent soot blower, chemical treatment technology, anti-fouling coatings, etc [35]. These technologies can help in reducing the fouling problem to some extent in boiler tubes depending upon their efficiency. Finishing remarks and recommendations can be drawn according to the results shown. <b>Soot</b> <b>blowers</b> can be used to clean the heated plane of boilers during operations, with blowing medium as water and steam. Water or steam is directed at the deposit through a nozzle which causes the deposit to fracture and corrode away. There are some ash actions prediction tools such as AshProSM used to review the slagging and fouling situation in coal-fired boilers. Integrated boiler with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations with ash actions models is used to determine ash development, transport, deposition, deposit growth and strength development [36]. Some of the other methods, which are used for prevention from fouling in boilers, are wet pretreatment of brown coal-fired power utility boiler, using mineral additives in coal-fired utility boiler, monitoring of fouling tendencies, chemical treatment technology: targeted in furnace injection (TIFI) technology, etc. [44].|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{different}} methods involved in ash deposit over the heating surface, two types of ash deposition are observed, i.e. slagging and the fouling. Boiler slagging and fouling are two main factors that adversely affect the efficiency of boilers [34, 35]. Fireside of the boiler is mainly affected by these problems. These two processes lead to frequent non-operation of <b>soot</b> <b>blowers.</b> Slag is the molten ash and incombustible by-product that remains as residue after coal combustion. Slagging is the deposition of partially fused residues on furnace walls or surfaces exposed to radiant heat. It {{takes place in the}} hottest parts of the boiler. Slag is formed when molten softened ash particles are not cooled to solid state when they reach with the hot surface [36, 37]. It reduces the heat absorption in the furnace, increases furnace exit gas temperature, decreases boiler efficiency and availability due to unplanned shutdowns leading to losses in the operation [37]. It has been found, that serious slagging mainly occurs {{on the walls of the}} furnace. Flue gases in the center of the furnace make it to deflect on other two sides of the walls; thus leading to the impingement of the pulverized-coal flame on to the side walls of the furnace. Due to this process, slagging on side walls takes place. It leads to slight slagging on the arch burner regions and to the front and rear wall regions of the lower furnace [38].|$|E
40|$|Boiler {{slagging}} and fouling as {{a result}} of inorganic impurities in combustion gases being deposited on heat transfer tubes have caused severe problems in coal-fired power plant operation. These problems are fuel, system design, and operating condition dependent. Conventional slag and ash removal methods include the use of in situ blowing or jet-type devices such as air or steam <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> and water lances. Pulse detonation technology for the purpose of removing slag and fouling deposits in coal-fired utility power plant boilers offers great potential. The detonation wave technique based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock on the slag deposited on gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. These detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits. Several tests have been performed with single shot detonation wave at University of Texas at Arlington to remove the slag deposit. To hold the slag deposit samples at the exit of detonation tube, two types of fixture was designed and fabricated. They are axial arrangement and triangular arrangement. The slag deposits from the utility boilers have been used to prepare the slag samples for the test. The experimental results show that the single shot detonation wave is capable of removing the entire slag (types of slag deposited on economizer, and air-heater, i. e., relatively softer slags) and 30 % of the reheater slag (which is harder) even at a distance of 6 in. from the exit of a detonation engine tube. Wave strength and slag orientation also have different effects on the chipping off of the slag. The annual report discusses about the results obtained in effectively removing the slag...|$|E
40|$|Pulse {{detonation}} {{technology for}} the purpose of removing slag and fouling deposits in coal-fired utility power plant boilers offers great potential. Conventional slag removal methods including <b>soot</b> <b>blowers</b> and water lances have great difficulties in removing slags especially from the down stream areas of utility power plant boilers. The detonation wave technique, based on high impact velocity with sufficient energy and thermal shock on the slag deposited on gas contact surfaces offers a convenient, inexpensive, yet efficient and effective way to supplement existing slag removal methods. A slight increase in the boiler efficiency, due to more effective ash/deposit removal and corresponding reduction in plant maintenance downtime and increased heat transfer efficiency, will save millions of dollars in operational costs. Reductions in toxic emissions will also be accomplished due to reduction in coal usage. Detonation waves have been demonstrated experimentally to have exceptionally high shearing capability, important to the task of removing slag and fouling deposits. The experimental results describe the parametric study of the input parameters in removing the different types of slag and operating condition. The experimental results show that both the single and multi shot detonation waves have high potential in effectively removing slag deposit from boiler heat transfer surfaces. The results obtained are encouraging and satisfactory. A good indication has also been obtained from the agreement with the preliminary computational fluid dynamics analysis that the wave impacts are more effective in removing slag deposits from tube bundles rather than single tube. This report presents results obtained in effectively removing three different types of slag (economizer, reheater, and air-heater) t a distance of up to 20 cm from the exit of the detonation tube. The experimental results show that the softer slags can be removed more easily. Also closer the slag to the exit of the detonation tube, the better are their removals. Side facing slags are found to shear off without breaking. Wave strength and slag orientation also has different effects on the chipping off of the slag. One of the most important results from this study is the observation that the pressure of the waves plays a vital role in removing slag. The wave frequency is also important after a threshold pressure level is attained...|$|E
