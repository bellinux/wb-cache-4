500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E
500|$|By October, the Foundation's {{financial}} affairs {{had reached}} a crisis point. According to his public relations assistant, Barbara Klowden, Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to [...] "political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power." [...] He began an affair with the twenty-year-old Klowden, much to the annoyance of Northrup, who was clearly aware of the liaison. Klowden recalled that Northrup [...] "was very hostile to me. We were talking about guns and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I was the type to use a Saturday night special" [...] (a very cheap [...] "junk gun"). One evening he arranged a double-date {{with his wife and}} Klowden, who was accompanied by Hollister, an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation. The dinner party backfired drastically; Northrup began an affair with Hollister, a handsome 22-year-old who was college-educated and a noted sportsman.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that she would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No {{travelling}} for mine,' <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> 'Seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it's just cussedness {{that makes}} people go away from Broadway when they've got plunks enough to stay there and enjoy themselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can {{sit down}} again," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> sharply <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I don't want you. Now, sir," [...] she continued, turning to Uncle Beamish, [...] "please come with me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and I {{told her that she}} had a big career in comedy, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing. Imagine how stupid I felt about four months later, I’m in London driving around and I hear, ‘And now, the Top of the Pops, Tracey Ullman with ‘They Don’t Know About Us.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|The then {{president}} of MSF, James Orbinski, gave the Nobel Peace Prize speech {{on behalf of the}} organization. [...] In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients: “There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there. [...] The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood. [...] The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated. [...] Her ears had been cut off. [...] And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. [...] She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering. [...] We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures. [...] We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others. [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha' — 'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruz {{described}} the song as an [...] "absolute club banger". The song features an uncredited rap by Cruz, which was originally not present. Cheryl {{said it was}} [...] "one of those instant tracks {{that make you feel}} good." [...] "Stand Up" [...] references the [...] "bop bop" [...] sung melody from Duran Duran's [...] "Planet Earth". [...] "Don't Talk About This Love" [...] was written by songwriter/producer Chris Braide and Nikola Bedingfield, the younger sister of singers Daniel and Natasha Bedingfield. It was originally recorded by Nikola Bedingfield as the title track for her debut EP. Cheryl's A at Polydor had remembered the track and suggested she record it with Braide at his studio. Cheryl was attracted to the song for its lyrics and vibe, saying it [...] "felt right." [...] In an interview with HitQuarters Braide said, [...] " [...] very emotional song. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'I really relate to this.' And I don't know if {{it had something to do}} with her personal situation at the time, but …" [...] "Boy Like You", featuring and produced by will.i.am, samples Fleetwood Mac's 1987 single [...] "Little Lies", which initially attracted Cheryl to the song. Cheryl wanted to take the Fleetwood Mac sample and create something current and modern with it. The album also features the clean single version of will.i.am's [...] "Heartbreaker", for which Cheryl provides the female vocals.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{turned her}} back on <b>me,</b> and went <b>to</b> the toilet-table. I think she looked at herself in the glass. 'Well,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at last, 'what else?' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{heard her}} breath quickening--I felt her hand growing cold. In {{spite of what}} <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when we were alone, I began {{to be afraid of}} her. I was wrong.|$|R
60|$|I at once {{related the}} {{circumstances}} under which I had met the woman in white, exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about Mrs. Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Yeobright. O, what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that day! I cannot {{understand}} this visit--what does she mean? And she suspects that past time of ours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; it was {{something}} that <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about you. But it's the same thing. It makes no difference. I ask you not to go for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was still}} on her mind when I bade her adieu; and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in her pretty coaxing way--as if I were a doll, I used to think: ...|$|E

6000|$|Sometimes I read to {{my sister}} alone, and she assured me {{that she could not}} see my mother among the women this time. This <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> humour <b>me.</b> Presently <b>she</b> would slip upstairs to {{announce}} triumphantly, ‘You are in again!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{ought to}} be here," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "The wretches in this {{neighborhood}} are wicked {{enough to say that}} his absence is a confession of his guilt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot tell, father,' replied Beranger; 'we played {{more than}} we talked. Yet, Monsieur, {{you will not be}} angry with Eustacie if I tell you what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Your Royal Highness,' {{said the}} Adherent, {{approaching}} with a bow, 'I {{think it is}} only right {{to inform you that}} the Dowager, when <b>she</b> left, <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> would return early in the afternoon to superintend the removal of her parrots.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Miss Trelawny {{from the}} first came with me, and looked with growing {{interest}} at everything. After having examined some cabinets of exquisite amulets <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in quite a naive way: ...|$|E

60|$|I joined Laura at {{the foot}} of the stairs. The thought in her mind was the same as the thought in mine, which Count Fosco had surprised, and when she spoke her words were almost the echo of his. <b>She,</b> too, <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{secretly}} that <b>she</b> was afraid something had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} that, and several things <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> corroborate your analysis of her feeling. But tell me--you have attended these sittings--what takes place--what does the girl profess to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{left the}} three of us all the more confronted with the {{conundrum}} launched by Obert, and Mrs. Server's curiosity remained. [...] "Do name," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "the flattered individual." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's sheer nonsense," [...] said Beam, {{turning away}} from the window and {{throwing}} himself into a chair; [...] "why should an old fellow like Tippengray take up all the spare time of that girl? She doesn't need to learn anything. From what <b>she</b> has <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I judge that she knows too much already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that, your Highness, I {{can recall}} nothing, or very little," [...] then, doubtless remembering what <b>she</b> had just <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> made obeisance and {{passed from the}} chamber.|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{her eyes}} glistening with tears of merriment, [...] "this is {{the funniest thing}} I ever saw.
