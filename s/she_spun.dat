5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging her front wing, and then Bertrand Baguette spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, Power set the fastest time of the day with a lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas was filmed between August 20 and August 21, 2012 in Los Angeles. A cut from the video premiered on NBC's The Voice on September 17. A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking {{with each other and}} she heard 'Your Body,' <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> {{it in a way that}} you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may be a little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, that's {{the sentimental}} part; {{now comes the}} merry part, and that will suit the boys," [...] said the old lady, briskly, as <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> away,--and went on in a lively tone:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Over {{and over}} she rolled. Around and around <b>she</b> <b>spun.</b> She turned somersaults. She {{lay on her}} back and kicked her heels in the air. Never in his life had he known any one to act like that. There must be {{something}} the matter with her.|$|E

5000|$|When Ms. Pac-Man makes {{contact with}} a ghost and dies, <b>she</b> <b>spins</b> around, or as {{the back of the}} flier says, [...] "she {{dramatically}} swoons and falls" [...] rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did.|$|R
5000|$|In 1814, Franz Schubert {{composed}} [...] "Gretchen am Spinnrade", a lied for {{piano and}} voice {{based on a}} poem from Goethe's Faust. the piano part depicts Gretchen's restlessness as <b>she</b> <b>spins</b> on a spinning wheel while waiting by a window for her love to return.|$|R

60|$|So {{they went}} in, {{and saw him}} sitting, like Poseidon, on his throne, with his golden sceptre by him, in {{garments}} stiff with gold, and in his hand a sculptured goblet, as he pledged the merchant kings; and beside him stood Arete, his wise and lovely queen, and leaned against a pillar as <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> her golden threads.|$|E
60|$|The fish {{broke the}} surface and went down again, and a flush of crimson crept into Ida's face as she stood quivering while the line went round the pool.

50|$|Spinner (Sasāruka) {{loves to}} spin around and play outside. She became a bird-like {{gyroscope}} with wings. <b>She</b> <b>spins</b> around everywhere on her stage.

6000|$|All day <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> in her poor dwelling, [...] And {{then her}} three hours' work at night! [...] Alas! 'twas hardly worth the telling, [...] It would {{not pay for}} candle-light.

6000|$|She sate upon {{a broken}} corner-stone in {{the angle of}} a paved apartment, part of which she had swept clean to afford a smooth space for the {{evolutions}} of her spindle. A strong sunbeam through a lofty and narrow window fell upon her wild dress and features, and afforded her light for her occupation; {{the rest of the}} apartment was very gloomy. Equipt in a habit which mingled the national dress of the Scottish common people with something of an Eastern costume, <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> a thread drawn from wool of three different colours, black, white, and grey, by assistance of those ancient implements of housewifery now almost banished from the land, the distaff and spindle. As <b>she</b> <b>spun,</b> she sung {{what seemed to be a}} charm. Mannering, after in vain attempting to make himself master of the exact words of her song, afterwards attempted the following paraphrase of what, from a few intelligible phrases, he concluded to be its purport:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|All day <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> in her poor dwelling: [...] 25 [...] And {{then her}} three hours' work at night, [...] Alas!

5000|$|Snowdrop"...is pure as newly driven snow.

60|$|He {{walked on}} down the road, and Nancy went indoors and went about her {{household}} work. She cleaned the dishes and trimmed the hearth; <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> the flax which tufted her wheel; then she took the rags of some garments past repair, and in the afternoon shadow of her threshold she cut them into ribbons and sewed them end to end and wound them into balls, for weaving into carpets.|$|E
6000|$|But no one {{recognised}} her, {{as she had}} disguised {{herself as}} an old woman, and had wound a shawl round her head. Great preparations were {{going on in the}} palace for the wedding, which was to take place next day. Then the princess, still disguised as an old woman, took out her spinning-wheel, and began to spin moss into silk. And as <b>she</b> <b>spun</b> the new bride passed by, and seeing the moss turn into silk, she said to the old woman: 'Little mother, I wish you would give me that spinning-wheel.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seems that}} in the village {{there was an old}} woman frightfully {{disfigured}} by fire, and not quite sane as the people thought. She was harmless, but never showed herself by day, and only came out at night to work in her garden or take the air. Many of the ignorant peasants feared her, however; for the country abounds in fairy legends, and strange tales of ghosts and goblins. But the more charitable left bread at her door, and took in return the hose she knit or the thread <b>she</b> <b>spun.</b>|$|E

Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.|$|R
