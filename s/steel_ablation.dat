In accidents with oxidizing atmosphere above the melt surface, a low melting point UO 2 +x–ZrO 2 –FeOy corium pool can form. In this case ablation of the RPV steel interacting with the molten corium is a corrosion process. Experiments carried out within the International Scientific and Technology Center's (ISTC) METCOR Project {{have shown that the}} corrosion rate can vary and depends on both surface temperature of the RPV steel and oxygen potential of the melt. If the oxygen potential is low, the corrosion rate is controlled by the solid phase diffusion of Fe ions in the corrosion layer. At high oxygen potential and steel surface layer temperature of 1050 °C and higher, the corrosion rate intensifies because of corrosion layer liquefaction and liquid phase diffusion of Fe ions.

40|$|LIBS {{can be used}} as {{an online}} method of characterizing {{galvanized}} coatings on sheet steel moving through a production line. The traversing sheet steel is irradiated with a series of single laser bursts, each at a different position on the sheet <b>steel.</b> An <b>ablation</b> depth in the same range as the coating thickness (about 10 µm) is achieved by using a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double-pulse mode. The coating thickness is determined from the ratio of the intensities of an iron line and a zinc line measured at a burst energy high enough to penetrate the coating with a single burst. Experiments at different burst energies were carried out to optimize the thickness resolution, and a method of systematically selecting iron and zinc lines was deduced, which is based on multivariate data analysis (MVDA) of the intensity ratios calculated for a set of 6 zinc lines and 21 iron lines. A temperature correction was applied, because the parameters of the plasma change with burst energy, and the influence of this on the thickness resolution is discussed. The ambient atmosphere present (air, Ar, N 2) as well as self-absorption of spectral lines both have an influence on the thickness resolution. At optimum conditions, a thickness measurement accuracy of better than 150 nm was obtained for a set of electrolytic galvanized sheet steels with coating thicknesses in the range 4. 1 - 11. 2 µm...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a new {{approach}} to the online monitoring of the Al depth profile of hot-dip galvanised sheet steel is presented, based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The coating composition is measured by irradiating the traversing sheet steel with a series of single laser bursts, each at a different sheet <b>steel</b> position. An <b>ablation</b> depth in the same range as the coating thickness (about 10 µm) is achieved by applying a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double-pulse and triple-pulse mode. The ablation depth is controlled by adjusting the burst energy with an external electro-optical attenuator. A fingerprint of the depth profile is gained by measuring the LIBS signals from zinc, aluminium and iron {{as a function of the}} burst energy, and by post-processing the data obtained. Up to three depths can be sampled simultaneously with a single laser burst by measuring the LIBS signals after each pulse within the laser burst. A concept for continuously monitoring the Al depth profile during the galvanising process is presented and applied to different hot-dip galvanised coatings. The method was tested on rotating sheet steel disks moving at a speed of up to 1 m/s. The potential and limitations of the new method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Tomographic imaging has {{dramatically}} changed science, {{most notably in}} the fields of medicine and biology, by producing 3 D views of structures which are too complex to understand in any other way. Current tomographic techniques require extensive time both for post-processing and data collection. Femtosecond laser based tomographic techniques have been developed in both standard atmosphere (femtosecond laser-based serial sectioning technique - FSLSS) and in vacuum (Tri-Beam System) for the fast collection (10 ^ 5 μm^ 3 /s) of mm^ 3 sized 3 D datasets. Both techniques use femtosecond laser pulses to selectively remove layer-by-layer areas of material with low collateral damage and a negligible heat affected zone. To the authors knowledge, femtosecond lasers have never been used to serial section and these techniques have been entirely and uniquely developed by the author and his collaborators at the University of Michigan and University of California Santa Barbara. The FSLSS was applied to measure the 3 D distribution of TiN particles in a 4330 <b>steel.</b> Single pulse <b>ablation</b> morphologies and rates were measured and collected from literature. Simultaneous two-phase ablation of TiN and steel matrix was shown to occur at fluences of 0. 9 - 2 J/cm^ 2. Laser scanning protocols were developed minimizing surface roughness to 0. 1 - 0. 4 μm for laser-based sectioning. The FSLSS technique was used to section and 3 D reconstruct titanium nitride(TiN) containing 4330 steel. Statistical analysis of 3 D TiN particle sizes, distribution parameters, and particle density were measured. A methodology was developed to use the 3 D datasets to produce statistical volume elements (SVEs) for toughness modeling. Six FSLSS TiN datasets were sub-sampled into 48 SVEs for statistical analysis and toughness modeling using the Rice-Tracey and Garrison-Moody models. A two-parameter Weibull analysis was performed and variability in the toughness data agreed well with Ruggieri et al. bulk toughness measurements. The Tri-Beam system combines the benefits of laser based material removal (speed, low-damage, automated) with detectors that collect chemical, structural, and topological information. Multi-modal sectioning information was collected after many laser scanning passes demonstrating the capability of the Tri-Beam system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the event}} of a {{hypothetical}} severe accident in a Light Water Reactor (LWR) {{it is possible that the}} core melts and relocates to the lower head of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). If the severe accident management measures are not successful, the RPV can fail and the core melt is discharged onto the basement of the containment. To prevent a significant release of radioactivity to the environment due to the melt-through of the basement, LWR's might incorporate the ability to retain and cool the core melt on the basement of the containment (core catcher concept). Before the melt arrives on the cooling device on the basement, the melt has to penetrate the reactor cavity. The reactor cavity may be equipped with a metallic plate at its bottom, covered by a layer of sacrificial concrete, to collect the melt over a certain time period. To achieve a complete and homogeneous spreading of the melt over the total area of the cooling device a fast and sufficiently wide melt-through of the metallic plate is required. To investigate the important processes concerning the melt-through of a metallic plate by a simulated core melt, a series of transient KAPOOL experiments has been performed in the years 1998 to 2000. The corium melt in the KAPOOL tests is simulated by an alumina/iron melt, produced by a thermite reaction. Therefore it was possible to investigate the interaction of both parts of the corium melt (metallic and oxidic) with a metal plate. The experiments show that metallic melts in contact with a steel plate that simulates the melt gate between the reactor cavity and the core catcher compartment lead to fast melting of the steel plate (KAPOOL 9). Oxide melts in contact with a steel or an aluminium plate lead to oxide crust formation at the steel or aluminium interface, and subsequent formation of gaps between the crust and the metal plate. In case of a <b>steel</b> plate no <b>ablation</b> of the plate by the oxide melt could be observed (KAPOOL 11 and 12). Due to the lower melting temperature of the aluminium one could detect and analyse failure modes of the plate due to high thermal loadings (KAPOOL 13 and 15 to 17). (orig.)
