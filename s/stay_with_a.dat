5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort}} to find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E

25|$|The {{students}} have different teachers for different subjects, {{and it is}} normal that these teachers <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> class for an entire course. A teacher usually holds a combined master's degree in two different subjects which are the only subjects which that teacher is qualified to teach. In addition to their university studies, newly employed teachers take a pædagogicum which since August 2009 is a one-year part-time course in pedagogy, having previously been a two-year course.|$|E

At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the House of Commons demanding that milk be sent to Germany, where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> local family for two years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s {{streamlined}} trains were in transition. While fixed consists {{such as the}} Union Pacific Railroad's M-10000 were out (the last, the Illinois Central 121, had been built in 1936), railroads still ordered sets of equipment with the intention that those sets <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> particular train. In 1937–1938 the Santa Fe embarked on a massive program to upgrade its passenger fleet, introducing new sets on the Super Chief, Chief, and El Capitan; and three new trains: the Chicagoan, Kansas Cityan, and the San Diegan.|$|E

25|$|Corvettes had {{adequate}} endurance for MOEF assignments, but {{the fuel}} economy of destroyers was poor at the speeds that convoys operated. The escort group leaders were modern destroyers with adequate endurance but, {{of the older}} destroyers allocated to trade convoy escort, only the Clemson subgroup of the Town-class destroyers proved suitable for MOEF assignments. Wickes-class destroyers were useful for the Canadian WLEF and the American Iceland shuttle; but lacked endurance to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> trade convoy for the full distance covered by the MOEF Escort Groups. The Admiralty converted some V and W-class destroyers to long range escorts by removing the forward boiler and using the space for additional fuel tanks.|$|E

She was unaware that her family had some Jewish ancestry, but later both her parents were taken to concentration camps where they died. With assistance from the Society of Friends, Hochsinger arrived in England in 1938 and went to Devon to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brigadier and his wife.

25|$|Mays had {{remained}} popular in New York {{long after the}} Giants had left for San Francisco, and the trade {{was seen as a}} public relations coup for the Mets. Mets owner Joan Payson, who was a minority shareholder of the Giants when the team was in New York, had long desired to bring Mays back to his baseball roots and was instrumental in making the trade. In his Mets debut on a rainy Sunday afternoon at Shea Stadium on May 14, 1972, Mays put New York ahead to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fifth-inning home run against Don Carrithers and his former team, the Giants. On August 16, 1973 of the following season, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds with Don Gullett on the mound, Mays hit a fourth inning solo home run over the right-center field fence. It was the 660th, and last, home run of his major league career.|$|E
25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, {{the best}} friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park {{to see some of}} its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mule ride.|$|E
25|$|Test flights {{revealed}} problems initially {{believed to}} be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot {{no option but to}} bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim. Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In late June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers finally {{returned}} home on June 11 only to lose 3–2 to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, led by rookie outfielder Mike Trout, who was 2 for 4 {{with a home}} run and two RBI in the game. The Dodgers struggled against Angels starter Jerome Williams the next night, trailing 2–1 heading {{into the bottom of}} the eighth. However they battled back as Ethier hit a game-tying single and then Juan Rivera put the Dodgers ahead to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> three-run home run. Kenley Jansen picked up his 10th save in the 5–2 victory. The Angels took the final game of the series as Erick Aybar hit a tie-breaking home run off Jansen in the top of the ninth to give them the 2-1 win over the Dodgers. In the next game, on June 15 against the Chicago White Sox, Kershaw struggled, giving up 5 runs in his 6 innings of work but the Dodgers came back and won the game 7-6 thanks to a wild pitch by reliever Matt Thornton that pushed across the eventual winning run. The Dodgers again fell behind early the next day, then came back to tie the game. However, this time they lost 5-4. Chris Capuano struck out 12 in 8 innings of the series finale on Father's Day but left the game down 1–0. The Dodgers ralied to tie the game in the bottom of the 9th and won in the 10th after a triple by Tony Gwynn, Jr. and a walk off single by Dee Gordon.|$|E
