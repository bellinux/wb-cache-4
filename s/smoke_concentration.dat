Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. Other studies in rats conclude that mosquito coils are not a significant health risk, although some organisms may experience temporary sensory irritation like that caused by smoke from the combustion of organic materials such as logs. In one study, rats were directly exposed to a coil's smoke for six hours a day, five days a week for thirteen weeks. They showed signs of sensory irritation from the high <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration,</b> but there were no adverse effects on other parts of the body. The study concluded that, with normal use, mosquito coils are unlikely to be a health risk.|$|E

40|$|The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) {{produces}} a daily satellite based smoke and fire {{analysis for the}} US. The capability to specify <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> levels and to identify the start time, duration and areal extent of a particular fire which is producing smoke emissions has recently been added. <b>Smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> values are obtained from visual inspection of animated Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible band imagery in conjunction with output from the automated GOES Aerosol and Smoke Product (GASP). There are three categories of <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> utilized: 5, 16 and 27 µg/m 3, which correspond to light, medium, and dense smoke respectively. The <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> values are available for air quality managers and other users to download and/or view as GIS shapefiles. The initial time and duration of smoke emissions are also obtained through inspection of animated GOES visible imagery by an analyst. This information is incorporated into the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model which {{produces a}} 48 hour forecast of smoke dispersion and transport. In addition to approximating smoke emissions and the diurnal variations observed in wildfires the specification of emission duration allows for the representation of short duration agricultural and prescribed burns as well.

40|$|Historical smoke {{concentrations}} at monthly resolution for {{the early}} twentieth century are found for Kew Observatory, London, using the atmospheric electricity proxy technique. Smoke particles modify the electrical properties of urban air: an increase in <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> reduces air's electrical conductivity and increases the Potential Gradient (PG). Calibrated PG data are available from Kew since 1898, and air conductivity was measured routinely between 1909 and 1979 using the technique developed by C. T. R. Wilson. Automated smoke observations at the same site overlap with the atmospheric electrical measurements from 1921, providing an absolute calibration to <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration.</b> This shows that the late nineteenth century winter smoke concentrations at Kew were approximately 100 times greater than contemporary winter smoke concentrations. Following smoke emission regulations reducing the <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration,</b> the electrical parameters of the urban air did not change dramatically. This is suggested to be due to a composition change, with an increase in the abundance of small aerosol compensating for the decrease in smoke. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Fire {{disaster}} {{is a great}} threat to lives and property. Automatic fire alarm system provides real-time surveillance, monitoring and automatic alarm. It sends early alarm when the fire occurs and helps to reduce the fire damage. Wireless sensor network {{has become the most}} important technology in environmental monitoring and home or factory automation in recent years. In this paper, an automatic fire alarm system based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. In order to provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors which periodically measure <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> or temperature are deployed in buildings. Those scattered detectors report their monitoring information to the surveillance center via the self-organizing hierarchical wireless sensor networks.

To promote com-parisons of results among such tests, a standard method for quantifying ex-posure intensity as an estimate of dosage was developed. <b>Smoke</b> <b>concentrations</b> (C) were calculated from sample weight-loss data and integrated over the animal exposure time (t), such that Ct products were obtained in units of "mg/L &middot; minutes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the effect of black smoke on cardiorespiratory mortality is modified by cold temperatures. Poisson regression models were used to investigate the relationship between lagged black <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> and daily mortality, and whether the effect of black smoke on mortality was modified by cold temperature for three Scottish cities from January 1981 to December 2001. For all-cause respiratory and non-cardiorespiratory mortality, there was a significant association between mortality and lagged black <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration.</b> Generally the maximum black smoke effect occurred at lag 0, although these estimates were not statistically significant. A 10 mgm 23 increase in the daily mean black <b>smoke</b> <b>concentration</b> on any given day was associated with a 1. 68 % (95 % CI 0. 72 to 2. 65) increase in all-cause mortality and a 0. 43 % (95 % CI 20. 97 to 1. 86), 5. 36 % (95 % CI 2. 93 to 7. 84) and 2. 13 % (95 % CI 0. 82 to 3. 47) increase in cardiovascular, respiratory and non-cardiorespiratory mortality, respectively, over the ensuing 30 -day period. The effect of black smoke on mortality did not vary significantly between seasons (cool and warm periods). For all-cause, cardiovascular and non-cardiorespiratory mortality the inclusion of interaction terms did not improve the models, although for all-cause and non-cardiorespiratory mortality there was a suggestion for interaction between temperature and recent black smoke exposure. The results of this study suggested a greater effect of black smoke on mortality at low temperatures.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Associations between {{cardiovascular}} {{mortality and}} air pollution and noise together were investigated. METHODS: Data from the ongoing Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer (120, 852 subjects; follow-up 1987 - 1996) were used. Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted for the association between cardiovascular mortality and exposure to black smoke, traffic intensity on the nearest road and road traffic noise at the home address. RESULTS: The correlations between traffic noise and background black smoke, and traffic intensity on the nearest road were moderate at 0. 24 and 0. 30, respectively. Traffic intensity was associated with cardiovascular mortality, with highest relative risk (95 % confidence interval) for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality being 1. 11 (1. 03 to 1. 20) (increment 10, 000 motor vehicles/ 24 h). Relative risks for black <b>smoke</b> <b>concentrations</b> were elevated for cerebrovascular (1. 39 (0. 99 to 1. 94)) and heart failure mortality (1. 75 (1. 00 to 3. 05)) (increment 10 microg/m(3)). These associations were insensitive to adjustment for traffic noise. There was an excess of cardiovascular mortality in the highest noise category (> 65 dB(A)), with elevated risks for IHD (1. 15 (0. 86 to 1. 53)) and heart failure mortality (1. 99 (1. 05 to 3. 79)). After adjustment for black smoke and traffic intensity, noise risk reduced to unity for IHD mortality and was slightly reduced for heart failure mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between black <b>smoke</b> <b>concentrations</b> and traffic intensity on the nearest road with specific cardiovascular causes of death were not explained by traffic noise in this study...|$|R

Recent results with Daysmoke regarding multiple-core updrafts have confirmed our suspicions that the dynamics of smoke plumes from prescribed burns are more complex than the dynamics of plumes from point sources such as industrial stacks. Therefore, simple plume rise algorithms and models designed to simulate plume rise from point sources cannot be expected to correctly place smoke vertically in the atmosphere – a critical factor for the accurate prediction of downwind <b>smoke</b> <b>concentrations</b> at ground level. Although Daysmoke has identified the multiple-core updraft smoke plume as a significant contributor to uncertainty in predictions of <b>smoke</b> <b>concentrations</b> at the ground, the model has not offered any pathways to solve the problem. To date we cannot offer substantive explanations of why some burns develop single-core updrafts while other burns develop multiple-core updrafts.

The experimental rule-driven fire spread model (Rabbit Rules) shows promise for identifying updraft core numbers. Rabbit Rules can simulate complex fire behavior including some phenomena associated with coupled fire-atmosphere interactions. Rabbit Rules may provide updraft core data in three ways – the number of discrete low pressure centers generated by heat released from the fire on the scale of 10 ’s to 100 ’s of meters, the number of independent ground-level wind circulations generated by heat released from the fire on the scale of 10 ’s to 100 ’s of meters, and the number of heat centers contained by the burn on the scale of 1 ’s to 10 ’s of meters...|$|R
