But everything {{is about the}} setting... We experiment a lot with vocal sounds. For example, the pitch-down vocal at the end was initially much longer. The mix of this one was very hard — like almost all tracks — because there was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> going on. This is why maybe the final version is so simple." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> it just gets lost".|$|E

500|$|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo {{were formed}} in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, as a musical theatre troupe. As Richard's {{interest}} shifted to filmmaking, he passed {{leadership of the}} band to younger brother Danny Elfman, who had begun to lose interest in musical theatre, and had gained interest in other musical styles such as ska, and had become [...] "sick of lugging around <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> with the theatre troupe. Towards the end", Elfman remembers, [...] "it was a big production... there was, like a semi full of stuff. And that was becoming burdensome. So, for me, {{the idea of being}} a band that can fit all their gear into a van and set up in a club, and an hour later be playing, became a goal." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{commenced}} {{in early}} November and concluded on November 27, 2007. The strike suspended {{the script for}} the next episode and freed {{the cast and crew}} from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] than the average Lost episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes, although it was produced simultaneously with the [...] mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins. Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew [...] "busted [...] butts doing this one. It felt like we were making a movie because there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> that happens in this episode". Lilly called it [...] "one of the best episodes of the first eight." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm {{happy to say}} that the much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff,</b> and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open." ...|$|E
2500|$|The climax to {{the film}} differs {{significantly}} from the comics, {{with the use of}} the jetpack and rocket launcher: Millar called this [...] "necessary" [...] as [...] "we're building up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> that we needed some Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star moment". Comic writer Stephen Grant argued that the film [...] "cheated" [...] on its premise of a [...] "real life" [...] superhero by having these increasingly fantastic events and that this was [...] "why it works. That's where much of the humor comes from... when the film finally makes the notion [...] explicit we're already so deep into the magician's act that our instinct is to play along".|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Sobieski {{confirmed}} [...] "I don't do movie stuff anymore". Commenting on {{the reasons}} for her early retirement to Us Weekly, Sobieski said [...] "I am just focused on my kids.

5000|$|Chris Leonard {{also left}} the band in October 2007, saying [...] "I've left {{but to be}} honest there wasn't really {{anything}} to leave.

5000|$|Interest in Saroyan's novels {{declined}} {{after the}} war, {{when he was}} criticized for sentimentality. Freedom, brotherly love, and universal benevolence were for him basic values, but his idealism was considered {{out of step with}} the times.

5000|$|On her eponymous 1993 release, Ashton {{was quoted}} during the {{recording}} of the album track [...] "Heart Like a Rock, [...] "I was messing around doing vocals and singing along trying to sound like an electric guitar.

60|$|And {{then the}} wind came, smack {{out of the}} blackness, with the abruptness of thunder and {{accompanied}} by the most diabolical thunder. And with the rain and thunder came the blackness.

Why, d----e, if I think you'd lie-to, at all, with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> aloft to knock you off to leeward.

But such a bridal-party as this morning's--why, it's as sad as funerals. And brave Master Pierre Glendinning is the groom! Well, well, wonders is all the go. I thought I had done with wondering when I passed fifty; but I keep wondering still. Ah, somehow, now, I feel as though I had just come from lowering some old friend beneath the sod, and yet felt the grating cord-marks in my palms.--'Tis early, but I'll drink. Let's see; cider,--a mug of cider;--'tis sharp, and pricks like a game-cock's spur,--cider's the drink for grief. Oh, Lord! that fat men should be so thin-skinned, and suffer in pure sympathy on others' account.

5000|$|We are {{instantly}} {{fascinated by}} the suggestion of conspiracies and cover-ups; this has become <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the <b>stuff</b> of our imagination these days {{that it is only}} natural, it seems, to expect it when we turn to ancient texts, especially biblical texts.

60|$|You greatly {{surprise}} me by such objections. It is objected to 'new lights,' {{as far as}} I know, that we are apt to be too metaphysical, self-conscious, subjective, everything for which there are hard German words. The reproaches made against myself have been often of this nature, as you must be well aware. 'Beyond human sympathies' is a phrase in use among critics of a certain school. But that, in any school, any critic should consider the occasions of great tragic movements (such as a war {{for the life of}} a nation) unfit occasions for poetry, improper arguments, fills me with an astonishment which I can scarcely express adequately, and, pardon me, I can only understand your objection by a sad return on the English persistency in its mode of looking at the Italian war. You have looked at it always too much as a mere table for throwing dice--so much for France's ambition, so much for Piedmont's, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>stuff</b> for intrigue in an English Parliament for ousting Whigs, or inning Conservatives. You have not realised to yourselves the dreadful struggle for national life, you who, thank God, have your life as a nation safe. A calm scholastic Italian friend of ours said to my husband at the peace, 'It's sad to think how the madhouses will fill after this.' You do not conceive clearly the agony of a whole people with their house on fire, though Lord Brougham used that very figure to recommend your international neutrality. No, if you conceived of it, if you did not dispose of it lightly in your thoughts as of a Roccabella conspiracy, full half vanity, and only half serious--a Mazzini explosion, not a quarter justified, and taking place often on an affair of métier--you, a thoughtful and feeling man, would cry aloud that if poets represent the deepest things, the most tragic things in human life, they need not go further for an argument. And I say, my dear Mr. Chorley, that if, while such things are done and suffered, the poet's business is to rhyme the stars and walk apart, I say that Mr. Carlyle is right, and that the world requires more earnest workers than such dreamers can be.|$|E
