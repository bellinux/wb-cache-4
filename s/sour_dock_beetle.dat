50|$|Gastrophysa viridula, {{known as}} the green <b>dock</b> <b>beetle,</b> green <b>dock</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> or green sorrel beetle, is a species of beetle native to Europe.|$|R
50|$|The green <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> feeds {{mainly on}} dock and green sorrel, rarely feeding on other {{plants in the}} {{families}} Polygonaceae, Brassicaceae, Violaceae, and Boraginaceae. The larvae can only completely develop on Rumex species.|$|R

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] sorrel (Rumex acetosella) also is known as sheep, horse, field, mountain, and cow sorrel or <b>sour</b> <b>dock.</b> This European weed grows throughout the Pacific Northwest under various soil and climate conditions...|$|R
50|$|The green <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{commonly}} found in central Europe. Its range extends eastward into western Siberia and the Caucasus Mountains. They are found in heathlands, forests, meadows, and gardens {{with the presence of}} plant dock (Rumex), the beetles' food plant.|$|R
25|$|Most {{plants were}} {{available}} {{in a variety of}} locales and their harvest did not dictate moving the family to specific camps. Plants that grew in abundance in specific terrain, such as several varieties of cliff greens, usually offered other resources that could be harvested at the same time (e.g., fish, Sandhill cranes). Greens such as Rumex arcticus (<b>sour</b> <b>dock)</b> could be found throughout the island and all old camp sites are said to contain buried cache pits once used for plant storage.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{placing the}} [...] "wild spinach" [...] or <b>sour</b> <b>dock</b> in the caches, the cooked leaves would be drained of juice and the pit lined with woven grass mats. Berries were stored {{in much the}} same way, except that these pits would be lined with rocks. The berries would have no juice when removed, since they would have dried out while being stored underground. In the fall, people would return to their {{seasonal}} caches and transport their stored berries and greens to their winter village.|$|R
40|$|The {{broad-leaved}} dock (Rumex obtusifolius) {{is a widely}} distributed weed of cultivated grasslands. Since the <b>dock</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> (Gastrophysa viridula) can defoliate docks extensively, if occurring in sufficient high densities, it {{is considered to be}} a potential part of a biocontrol strategy against R. obtusifolius. Our study aimed at investigating the influence of precipitation on the distribution of G. viridula. For that, 635 questionnaires were sent out to organic farmers and surveys were conducted on 39 farms in Lower Austria. The results showed G. viridula preferring regions with sufficient precipitation. These observations confirmed laboratory results reported in literature and should be considered in a concept for the enhancement of <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> populations as part of an organic dock regulation strategy...|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the green <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> varies between sexes, with the males being 4 mm and the females being 7 mm. During the mating season, females have {{enlarged}} abdomens. Both sexes are green with a metallic shimmer, which, depending on the light, can be gold green, blue, purple, violet, or red. The legs of this species also shimmer a metallic green, and are strongly built. The antennae are serrated and are medium in length.|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} frontier agriculture {{there was}} much gathering of wild [...] "greens" [...] and other vegetation to supplement the diet. One area where this practice is still significant is the gathering of wild North American ginseng, often for the Asian market. Wild gathered ginseng contributed about $2 million in 2000 to the West Virginia economy, a figure larger than many conventional cultivated vegetable and fruit crops. Other wild greens, such as <b>sour</b> <b>dock,</b> lambs quarters, and wild leek (or [...] "ramps") are also still gathered by many for table use, although today more {{on the basis of}} avocation or keeping up traditions than out of necessity.|$|R
50|$|Allocation cost {{is related}} to the {{channelling}} of a large quantity fitness-limited resources to from resistance traits in plants. Such resources might not be quickly recycled and thus, are unavailable for fitness-relevant process such as growth and reproduction. For instance, herbivory on the broadleaf dock (Rumex obtusifolius) by the green <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> (Gastrophysa viridula) induces an increased activity in cell wall-bound peroxidase. The allocation of resources to this increased activity results in reduced leaf growth and expansion in R. obtusifolius. In the absence of herbivory, inducing such a defence would be ultimately costly to the plant in terms of development.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{knowledge}} is already known about dock management in organic systems. Despite this docks are still a troublesome weed and necessitate a large input of management time, labour and external inputs. Biological control programmes {{have the potential to}} reduce some of these inputs. Three biological control agents (livestock, <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> and rust) would seem to show the most promise for long-term biological control of docks in organic systems. We propose a mixture of information gathering, information collation and simple experiments to begin addressing some of the questions surrounding biological control of docks in organic systems, with the long term aim of evaluating their suitability and feasibility for these systems...|$|R
40|$|The feet of many {{insects are}} covered with dense arrays of hair-like {{structures}} called setae. Liquid capillary bridges {{at the tip of}} these micrometric structures are responsible for the controlled adhesion of the insect on a large variety of substrates. The resulting adhesion force can exceed several times the body weight of the insect. The high aspect-ratio of setae suggests that flexibility is a key ingredient in this capillary-based adhesion mechanism. There is indeed a strong coupling between their elastic deformation and the shape of the liquid meniscus. In this experimental work, we observe and quantify the local deflection of <b>dock</b> <b>beetle</b> seta tips under perpendicular loading using interference microscopy. Our results are then interpreted in the light of an analytic model of elastocapillarity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The green <b>dock</b> <b>beetle's</b> {{breeding}} season is from March to October. There are 2 to 4 broods per year, {{with the last}} brood hibernating as an adult. The female lays over 1,000 eggs, laying them in clusters of 20 to 45 {{on the underside of}} the food plant's leaves. The eggs are oval in shape, and are cream to yellow, turning orange prior to hatching. After about 3 to 6 days, the larva hatches from the egg. It varies in color from greenish gray to dark brown. Its body is segmented, and will reach a length of 8 mm. Young larvae will drop to the ground if disturbed while feeding, while older larvae secrete a substance which repels competitors from eating the food plant leaves. After three instars, the larva pupates in a burrow about 2 cm underground. The adult emerges 6 to 9 days later.|$|R
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), <b>sour</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex arcticus), wild celery (Angelica lucida), wild lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|R
40|$|The {{manipulation}} of microscopic objects is challenging {{because of high}} adhesion forces, which render macroscopic gripping strategies unsuitable. Adhesive footpads of climbing insects could reveal principles relevant for micro-grippers, as {{they are able to}} attach and detach rapidly during locomotion. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this work, we characterize the geometry and contact formation of the adhesive setae of <b>dock</b> <b>beetles</b> (Gastrophysa viridula) by interference reflection microscopy. We compare our experimental results to the model of an elastic beam loaded with capillary forces. Fitting the model to experimental data yielded not only estimates for seta adhesion and compliance in agreement with previous direct measurements, but also previously unknown parameters such as the volume of the fluid meniscus and the bending stiffness of the tip. In addition to confirming the primary role of surface tension for insect adhesion, our investigation reveals marked differences in geometry and compliance between the three main kinds of seta tips in leaf beetles.

40|$|By {{providing}} a rapid and cost {{effective means of}} generating sequencing resources for almost any organism, â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Next generation sequencing technologiesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 (NGS) have great potential to help address numerous gene and genome level questions in molecular biology. Progress in NGS is exponentially increasing sequence throughput and large scale studies in the genomics/transcriptomics of non-model organisms are becoming a reality. Therefore {{the main focus of}} the work presented in this thesis is on the analysis of the large scale non-model insect datasets generated by NGS technologies and their potential to develop functional genomics tools for these species. Four different NGS datasets from four very different insects the Greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) the Passionvine butterfly (Heliconius melopmene), the blowfly (Lucilia sericata) and the Green <b>Dock</b> <b>beetle</b> (Gastrophysa viridula) were analysed and annotated. Molecular research in these insects has been hindered in the past due to limited nucleotide sequence information. Transcriptome data generated by 454 pyrosequencing was used as a starting point to study the genomics of these ecologically and economically important non-model insect species. The resulting transcriptomes were annotated for gene families involved in xenobiotic metabolism, namely the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), cytochrome P 450 s (P 450 s) and the carboxylesterases (CCEs). In each case the number and diversity of gene family members is discussed with those documented in other insects. In the case of H. melpomone, the transcriptome data was also used to complement the genomic research by identifying and validating cytochrome P 450 gene models in the recently sequenced genome. Furthermore, Illumina generated RNA-seq data was used for SNP characterisation in L. sericata. Transcriptome sequencing is shown to be a useful and cost effective technique to enhance the resources available for non-model organisms as well as for gene discovery {{in the absence of the}} reference genomic resources. By focusing on genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism this thesis has isolated numerous candidate genes potentially involved in important processes such as insecticide resistance (Lucilia and Trialeurodes) and host plant exploitation (Gastrophysa and Heliconius). NGS technologies and bioinformatics can thus open up avenues to develop functional genomics resources for diverse species of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} weed Rumex confertus Willd. (mossy sorrel) is fed {{upon and}} severely defoliated by Gastrophysa viridula Deg. (<b>dock</b> leaf <b>beetle).</b> We report {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) induction when one leaf on R. confertus was damaged by G. viridula adults to better understand plant responses to herbivory. The R. confertus volatile blend induced by G. viridula feeding included three green leaf volatiles (GLVs; (Z) - 3 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate) and terpenes (linalool, ß-caryophyllene, ß-farnesene).  Overall, R. confertus that had been damaged by G. viridula released far greater concentrations of these six VOCs than control plants.  Male and female of G. viridula had no significant attraction or repulsion to (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol or ß-caryophyllene. A significantly greater proportion of female and male beetles were attracted to (Z) - 3 -hexenal (5 ng×min - 1 = 300 ng×hr - 1) and (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate (5 and 25 ng×min - 1), {{in the range of}} induced concentrations emitted by a single injured leaf. </p...|$|R
40|$|Structural colours {{in living}} organisms have been {{observed}} and analysed in {{a large number of}} species, however the study of how the micro- and nano-scopic natural structures responsible of such colourations develop has been largely ignored. Understanding the interplay between chemical composition, structural morphology on multiple length scales, and mechanical constraints requires a range of investigation tools able to capture the different aspects of natural hierarchical architectures. Here, we report a developmental study of the most widespread strategy for structural colouration in nature: the cuticular multilayer. In particular, we focus on the exoskeletal growth of the <b>dock</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Gastrophysa viridula, capturing all aspects of its formation: the macroscopic growth is tracked via synchrotron microtomography, while the submicron features are revealed by electron microscopy and light spectroscopy combined with numerical modelling. In particular, we observe that the two main factors driving the formation of the colour-producing multilayers are the polymerization of melanin during the ecdysis and the change in the layer spacing during the sclerotisation of the cuticle. Our understanding of the exoskeleton formation provides a unique insight into the different processes involved during metamorphosis.

40|$|Eucolaspis Sharp 1886 {{includes}} {{a group of}} native beetle species, {{one or more of}} which infest exotic fruit crops. Economic losses suffered by organic apple orchards in Hawke’s Bay prompt a revisit to ecological basics of the beetle. Taxonomic, behavioural and ecological knowledge gaps are addressed in the current research project. Phylogenetic analysis, based on cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 region of mitochondrial DNA, revealed that only one genetic lineage infests apples in Hawke’s Bay and that there are only three putative species in mainland New Zealand with another separate species on Three Kings Islands. These findings are well supported by differences in male genitalia shape. Morphometric analyses also supported the phylogeny to some extent. The current findings on host location show that Eucolaspis sp. “Hawke’s Bay” beetles use plant odours to detect and discriminate host and non-host plants. The beetles were attracted to fresh leaf / fruit odour of apple and blackberry, but not to either clover or broad-leaved <b>dock.</b> The <b>beetles</b> were not able to distinguish between damaged and undamaged host plants and between closely related species of host plants just by olfaction. Irrespective of the geographical origin and ancestral host plant, beetles preferred to feed on blackberry over apple. Emergence sex ratio in Eucolaspis sp. “Hawke’s Bay” is found to be female-biased (0. 35), whereas adult sex ratio in the active population on foliage was slightly male-biased (0. 55) in organic apple orchards in Hawke’s Bay. No evidence for a short-range sex pheromone was found through olfactometer bioassays. All the mating attempts in mating bioassays proceeded only after either antennal contact or licking of female’s elytra by the male. Ablating antennae didn’t impair mating, but significant delay was observed in locating the female. Males attempted to mate with intact and washed female cadavers, 45 % and 35 % respectively of the tested males, whereas no mating attempts were initiated towards male cadavers. Males of Eucolaspis sp. “Hawke’s Bay” appear to utilize both contact sex pheromones and vision in locating potential female mates. It was found in the current study that endogeic macro-invertebrates were more abundant in orchards that historically had high bronze beetle incidence, whereas epigeic macro-invertebrates were more abundant in orchards that had historically low bronze beetle incidence. It may be that abundant surface-dwelling generalist predators in low bronze beetle orchards control bronze beetle from establishing in these orchards. However, this could only be confirmed by further research on specific predation of spiders and other generalist predators on bronze beetle. A phenology model for adult emergence is proposed based on threshold temperature (4. 69 ± 0. 89 0 C), degree-days (237 ± 22 0 C days) and biofix date of September 11 th. The model predicted adult emergence with a precision of ± 4 days when tested with field data...|$|R
