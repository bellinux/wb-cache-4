50|$|X-ray spectrometers are the foundation-stones of X-ray crystallography. The X-ray spectrometers as Moseley {{knew them}} worked as follows. A glass-bulb {{electron}} tube was used, {{similar to that}} held by Moseley in the photo {{at the top of}} this article. Inside the evacuated tube, electrons were fired at a metallic substance (i.e. a sample of pure element in Moseley's work), causing the ionization of electrons from the inner electron shells of the element. The rebound of electrons into these holes in the inner shells next causes the emission of X-rays photons that were led out of the tube in a <b>semi-beam,</b> through an opening in the external X-ray shielding. These are next diffracted by a standardized salt crystal, with angular results read out as photographic lines by the exposure of an X-ray film fixed at the outside the vacuum tube at a known distance. Application of Bragg's law (after some initial guesswork of the mean distances between atoms in the metallic crystal, based on its density) next allowed the wavelength of the emitted -rays to be calculated.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research examines the effect of lateral pressures on the bond characteristics of both plain and deformed reinforcing bars in lightweight aggregate (Lytag) concrete. Two common bond tests, the cube pull-out and the <b>semi-beam</b> test, were modified in order that lateral pressures {{could be applied to}} the bond specimens. The major variables studied were the magnitude of the lateral pressure, the bar diameter, the length of embedment and the concrete strength. The results of over 200 bond tests show that for round bars the application of a lateral pressure close to the cube-strength of the concrete can result in an increase in pull-out load of as much as 260...|$|E
40|$|The {{periodic}} {{assessment of}} our existing concrete infrastructure {{is a crucial}} part of maintaining appropriate levels of public safety over long periods of time. It is important that realistic predictions of the capacity of existing structures can be made in order to avoid unnecessary and expensive intervention work. Assessment is currently undertaken using codified models that are generally readily applied to infrastructure with simple geometric and reinforcement details that conform to design methods for new structures. This approach presents two significant challenges for prestressed structures: 1) design and construction practice has changed significantly in the past 50 years, and modern codified approaches can be incompatible with historic structures; and 2) deterioration of exposed soffits can lead to reduced cover to internal prestressing strand. Unless appropriate reductions are used in assessment of a structure with such problems, unnecessary load restrictions, or major strengthening or reconstruction work may be required, despite having carried a full service load since its construction. There are currently no widely accepted methods for the prediction of peak and residual capacities in prestressed concrete beams with inadequately detailed 7 -wire strand. This paper presents a completely new prediction methodology, validated against new experimental results from 31 novel <b>semi-beam</b> tests. The proposed models for peak load, residual load, and bond stress-slip modelling provide reliable, accurate, and conservative results. Their results demonstrate feasible and appropriate capacity reduction factors for use in the assessment of existing concrete infrastructure...|$|E
