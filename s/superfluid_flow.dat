40|$|In {{addition}} to mass, energy, and momentum, classical dissipationless flows conserve helicity, {{a measure of}} the topology of the flow. Helicity has far-reaching consequences for classical flows from Newtonian fluids to plasmas. Since <b>superfluids</b> <b>flow</b> without dissipation, a fundamental question is whether such a conserved quantity exists for <b>superfluid</b> <b>flows.</b> We address the existence of a "superfluid helicity" using an analytical approach based on the the symmetry underlying classical helicity conservation: the particle relabeling symmetry. Furthermore, we use numerical simulations to study whether bundles of superfluid vortices which approximate the structure of a classical vortex recover the conservation of classical helicity, and find dynamics consistent with classical vortices in a viscous fluid...|$|R
40|$|The {{superfluid}} drag effect, in hydrodynamics of pulsating neutron stars, is conventionally described {{with the}} aid of the entrainment matrix relating the mass currents with the velocities of <b>superfluid</b> <b>flows</b> in the system. Equations for the entrainment matrix of a superfluid mixture of neutrons and protons are derived with allowance for the strong dependence of the energy gaps on the velocities of <b>superfluid</b> <b>flows.</b> The calculations are carried out in the frame of the Fermi-liquid theory. The equations obtained are highly nonlinear. Numerical solutions to the equations for some typical cases demonstrate that the components of the entrainment matrix possess a highly nonlinear dependence on the velocities of the two superflows simultaneously. This effect, previously ignored, can greatly influence the dynamics of neutron stars. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|We study {{dynamical}} {{and energetic}} instabilities in the transport properties of Bloch waves for atomic multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices in the tight-binding limit. We obtain stability criteria analytically, {{as a function}} of superfluid velocities and interaction parameters, in several cases for two-component and spinor condensates. In the two-species case we find that the presence of the other condensate component can stabilize the <b>superfluid</b> <b>flow</b> of an otherwise unstable condensate and that the free space dynamical miscibility condition of the two species can be reversed by tuning the <b>superfluid</b> <b>flow</b> velocities. In spin- 1 condensates, we find the steady-state Bloch wave solutions and characterize their stability criteria. We find generally more regions of dynamical instability arise for the polar than for the ferromagnetic solutions. In the presence of magnetic Zeeman shifts, we find a richer variety of condensate solutions and find that the linear Zeeman shift can stabilize the <b>superfluid</b> <b>flow</b> in several cases of interest.

40|$|We study a {{stability}} criterion hypothesis for superfluids {{in terms}} of the the local density spectral function I_n (r, ω) applicable both to homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. We evaluate the local density spectral function {{in the presence of a}} one-dimensional repulsive/attractive external potential within the Bogoliubov theory using solutions of the tunneling problem. We also evaluate the local density spectral function using an orthogonal basis, and calculate the autocorrelation function C_n (r,t). When <b>superfluids</b> <b>flow</b> below a threshold, we find that in the d-dimensional system, I_n (r, ω) ∝ω^d in the low-energy regime and C_n (r, t) ∝ 1 /t^d+ 1 in the long-time regime hold.

40|$|We {{present a}} scheme for {{creating}} macroscopic superpositions {{of the direction}} of <b>superfluid</b> <b>flow</b> around a loop. Using the Bose-Hubbard model we study an array of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in optical potentials and coupled to one another to form a ring. By rotating the ring so that each particle acquires on average half a quantum of <b>superfluid</b> <b>flow,</b> {{it is possible to}} create a multiparticle superposition of all the particles rotating and all the particles stationary. Under certain conditions it is possible to scale up the number of particles to form a macroscopic superposition. The simplicity of the model has allowed us to study macroscopic superpositions at an atomic level for different variables. Here we concentrate on the tunnelling strength between the potentials. Further investigation remains important, because it could lead us to making an ultra-precise quantum-limited gyroscope. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of stable persistent currents {{is central to}} the studies of superfluidity in a range of physical systems. While all of the previous theoretical studies of <b>superfluid</b> <b>flows</b> in annular geometries concentrated on conservative systems, here we extend the stability analysis of persistent currents to open-dissipative exciton-polariton superfluids. By considering an exciton-polariton condensate in an optically-induced annular trap, we determine stability conditions for an initially imposed flow with a non-zero orbital angular momentum. We show, theoretically and numerically, that the system can sustain metastable persistent currents in a large parameter region, and describe scenarios of the supercurrent decay due to the dynamical instability.
