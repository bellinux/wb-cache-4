5000|$|The {{competition}} for selling exact time necessitated developing a reliable master clock and auxiliary clocks. Connecting multiple clocks via electrical wires {{in a system}} had proved feasible. Two slightly different master clock-slave clock concepts emerged. The first entailed {{the use of an}} electro-mechanical [...] "synchronizer" [...] to forcibly bring the minute hand to the 12 position exactly on the hour. Each of the clocks in this system used a complete clock mechanism {{with the addition of a}} synchronizer. A central clock (master clock) sent the <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> along telegraph lines to each clock, thereby assuring that all clocks displayed exactly the same time. The individual clocks in this system had self-contained batteries and required three volts direct current (DC) to operate. The batteries for the synchronizing system transmission were located in a central office. The use of the mechanical synchronizer was the design of Chester H. Pond and his associates as they formed the SWCC in 1886. A second approach to synchronized time transmitted along wires was to connect a master clock to relatively simple secondary clocks (slave clocks). The slave clocks did not have complete clockworks but simply a mechanism that, when energized electrically from the master clock, would advance the clock hands one unit of time. The slave clock would display exactly the same time as the master clock. Slave clocks were much less complicated to manufacture and required little or no servicing. Initially they were more prone to failure. Each of the slave clocks had wires that connected to the master clock. The master clock in this system required 24 volts DC to both wind the master clock and as a source of current to advance the hands of the slave clock. These master-slave systems were more suited for individual buildings such as schools or factories, rather than locations that were great distances apart. A master-slave clock system was developed and marketed in 1886 by Charles D. Warner and operated as the Standard Electric Time Company. The accuracy of the master-slave system was dictated by the accuracy of the master clock and reliability of the slave clocks. Over the years, correction systems were developed for the master-slave systems that rendered the systems very reliable and accurate. In the first three decades of the 20th century, many more companies entered the time-selling business. When one considers the entire country, the number of synchronized clock systems installed in learning institutions, factories, businesses, government installations, transportation facilities, and other buildings, was enormous. Many hundreds of thousands of slave clocks and probably tens of thousands of master clocks were manufactured, sold, installed and serviced by people involved in the exact-time-for-sale business.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues in an {{interconnected}} power system is the low damping of inter-area oscillations which significantly reduces the power transfer capability. Advances in Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) {{makes it possible to}} use the information from geographical distant location to improve power system dynamics and performances. A speed deviation based Wide-Area Power System Stabilizer (WAPSS) is known to be effective in damping inter-area modes. However, the involvement of wide-area signals gives rise to the problem of time-delay, which may degrade the system performance. In general, time-stamped <b>synchronized</b> <b>signals</b> from Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) are used for WAPSS, in which delays are introduced in both local and remote signals. One can opt for a feedback of remote signal only from PDC and uses the local signal as it is available, without time synchronization. This paper utilizes configurations of time-matched synchronized and nonsychronized feedback and provides the guidelines to design the controller. The controllers are synthesized using H_∞ control with regional pole placement for ensuring adequate dynamic performance. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two power system models have been used for the simulations.

40|$|Different {{types of}} network {{oscillations}} occur in different behavioral, cognitive, or vigilance states. The rodent hippocampus expresses prominentoscillations atfrequencies between 4 and 12 Hz,which are superimposed by phase-coupledoscillations (30 – 100 Hz). These patterns entrain multineuronal activity over large distances {{and have been}} implicated in sensory information processing and memory formation. Here we report {{a new type of}} oscillation at near- frequencies (2 – 4 Hz) in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized mice. The rhythm is highly coherent with nasal respiration and with rhythmic field potentials in the olfactory bulb: hence, we called it hippocampal respiration-induced oscillations. Despite the similarity in frequency range, several features distinguish this pattern from locally generatedoscillations: hippocampal respiration-induced oscillations have a unique laminar amplitude profile, are resistant to atropine, couple differentlytooscillations, and are abolished when nasal airflow is bypassed bytracheotomy. Hippocampal neurons are entrained by both the respiration-induced rhythm and concurrent oscillations, suggesting a direct interaction between endogenous activity in the hippocampus and nasal respiratory inputs. Our results demonstrate that nasal respiration strongly modulates hippocampal network activity in mice, providing a long-range <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> between olfactory and hippocampal networks...|$|E

This means that any disturbances or faults may cause power oscillations and lead to cascade outages. Many efforts, therefore, {{have been on the}} way to build new, smart grids. These will be the grids that use the most advance monitoring, controlling, networking, and measurement technologies. One of those technologies is a device known as Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU). PMUs are devices which produce synchronized phasor, frequency and rate of change of frequency estimates from voltage and/or current and a time <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> [1].

This technology is expected to preserve the differences in time and intensity between the two ears by co-ordinating the bilateral DSP features such as multichannel compression, noise reduction, and adaptive directionality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the benefits of wireless communication as implemented in two commercially available hearing aids. More specifically, this study measured speech intelligibility and sound localization abilities of normal hearing and hearing impaired listeners using bilateral hearing aids with wireless synchronization of multichannel Wide Dynamic Range Compression (WDRC). Twenty subjects participated; 8 had normal hearing and 12 had bilaterally symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. Each individual completed the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) and a sound localization test with two types of stimuli. No specific benefit from wireless WDRC synchronization was observed for the HINT; however, hearing impaired listeners had better localization with the wireless synchronization. Binaural wireless technology in hearing aids may improve localization abilities although the possible effect appears to be small at the initial fitting.

Circadian pacemaker neurons offer an unusual opportunity to study synchrony as their molecular clocks oscillate in phase over an extended timeframe (24 h). To identify where, when, and how synchronizing signals are perceived, we first studied the minimal clock neural circuit in Drosophila larvae, manipulating either the four master pacemaker neurons (LNvs) or two dorsal clock neurons (DN 1 s). Unexpectedly, {{we found that the}} PDF Receptor (PdfR) is required in both LNvs and DN 1 s to maintain synchronized LNv clocks. We also found that glutamate is a second <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> that is released from DN 1 s and perceived in LNvs via the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluRA). Because simultaneously reducing Pdfr and mGluRA expression in LNvs severely dampened Timeless clock protein oscillations, we conclude that the master pacemaker LNvs require extracellular signals to function normally. These two synchronizing signals are released at opposite times of day and drive cAMP oscillations in LNvs. Finally we found that PdfR and mGluRA also help synchronize Timeless oscillations in adult s-LNvs. We propose that differentially timed signals that drive cAMP oscillations and synchronize pacemaker neurons in circadian neural circuits will be conserve...|$|E
40|$|Four updated video {{guidance}} sensor (VGS) {{systems have}} been proposed. As described in a previous NASA Tech Briefs article, a VGS system is an optoelectronic system that provides guidance for automated docking of two vehicles. The VGS provides relative position and attitude (6 -DOF) information between the VGS and its target. In the original intended application, the two vehicles would be spacecraft, but {{the basic principles of}} design and operation of the system are applicable to aircraft, robots, objects maneuvered by cranes, or other objects that may be required to be aligned and brought together automatically or under remote control. In the first two of the four VGS systems as now proposed, the tracked vehicle would include active targets that would light up on command from the tracking vehicle, and a video camera on the tracking vehicle would be synchronized with, and would acquire images of, the active targets. The video camera would also acquire background images during the periods between target illuminations. The images would be digitized and the background images would be subtracted from the illuminated-target images. Then the position and orientation of the tracked vehicle relative to the tracking vehicle would be computed from the known geometric relationships among the positions of the targets in the image, the positions of the targets relative {{to each other and to}} the rest of the tracked vehicle, and the position and orientation of the video camera relative to the rest of the tracking vehicle. The major difference between the first two proposed systems and prior active-target VGS systems lies in the techniques for synchronizing the flashing of the active targets with the digitization and processing of image data. In the prior active-target VGS systems, synchronization was effected, variously, by use of either a wire connection or the Global Positioning System (GPS). In three of the proposed VGS systems, the <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> would be generated on, and transmitted from, the tracking vehicle. In the first proposed VGS system, the tracking vehicle would transmit a pulse of light. Upon reception of the pulse, circuitry on the tracked vehicle would activate the target lights. During the pulse, the target image acquired by the camera would be digitized. When the pulse was turned off, the target lights would be turned off and the background video image would be digitized. The second proposed system would function similarly to the first proposed system, except that the transmitted <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> would be a radio pulse instead of a light pulse. In this system, the signal receptor would be a rectifying antenna. If the signal contained sufficient power, the output of the rectifying antenna could be used to activate the target lights, making it unnecessary to include a battery or other power supply for the targets on the tracked vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} {{day-night cycle}} provides the principal <b>synchronizing</b> <b>signal</b> for behavioral activity in most mammals. Light information is relayed {{to the master}} circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via synaptic transmission from the retina directly to the SCN, where a predominately glutamate-driven cellular signaling pathway is able to reset biochemical, physiological, and behavioral activities. In the present study, we aimed to decipher the key roles played by protein kinase C (PKC) in regulating light-induced behavioral resetting under both a temporal and intensity-dependent manner; in addition, we also investigate PKC contributions to advancing and delaying re-entrainment paradigms. Our findings show that during the early night PKC acts in a temporal manner, where PKC inhibition selectively attenuates light-induced behavioral resetting in response to subsaturating and saturating light intensities. Declines in light response were also evident upon PKC inhibition during the late night, but restricted to bright light stimuli. The positive regulatory actions of PKC were further demonstrated {{in response to an}} 8 -h delayed re-entrainment paradigm where inhibition of PKC resulted in slower re-entrainment. Further, analysis of both classic and novel PKC isozymes present within the SCN showed significant circadian variation in the mRNA expression of PKCα, indicating possible isozyme-specific mediators in photic signaling.
