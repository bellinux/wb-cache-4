5000|$|The chengila is a {{percussion}} {{instrument that}} maintains a steady beat and provides musical background. The thick bell metal disc, which hangs by a <b>strap</b> <b>looped</b> around one wrist, {{is struck by}} a short wand held in the other hand. A ringing sound is produced when the chengila is struck when hanging freely; a flat tone is produced when it is struck while held against the forearm.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To compare {{time and}} {{movement}} characteristics of four different brands of football facemask <b>loop</b> <b>straps</b> during a cutting task. Methods: Ten certified athletic trainers, age 24. 8 ± 3. 4, {{years of experience}} 2. 4 ± 2. 5, cut four different brands of football helmet <b>loop</b> <b>straps</b> (ShockblockerTM, ASI (Athletic Specialty), SchuttTM AG (Armourguard) Elite, and RiddellTM) with an anvil pruner. Task completion time was measured with a time code generator. Helmet movement was measured in the lateral flexion plane using 2 -dimensional motion analysis. Results:Measureable but non-significant differences were observed between <b>loop</b> <b>strap</b> types (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) for dependent variables (time, range movement, and mean movement). Conclusions: Emergency personnel can effectively cut through various brands of football helmet <b>loop</b> <b>straps</b> using an anvil pruner and do not need brand-specific tools for facemask removal. Similar movement characteristics were observed while cutting all four brands of <b>loop</b> <b>straps.</b> Movement occurring during facemask removal may increase cervical displacement and increase injury severity. Measureable differences in cutting time warrant further investigation...|$|R

50|$|The {{flagship}} line of adjustable outdoor sandals are {{distinguished by}} the fact that they use a single <b>strap</b> which <b>loops</b> around the foot through the sole, and so can be adjusted to fit without any extra fastenings. They are available with a range of sole types and strap configurations, to suit various environments, and the company offers a repair service.|$|R

50|$|In general, 'quick release' face-mask {{attachments}} {{appear to}} make face-mask removal quicker and cause less unwanted {{movement of the}} athlete's head or neck. The opposite {{is the case in}} cutting <b>loop</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mounting <b>straps</b> or <b>loops</b> (de: Aufziehschlaufen) are in {{principle}} absolutely {{identical to the}} design of the shoulder straps, depicted above. From this point of view it might be sufficient to demonstrate exemplarily the different versions of design, instead to show a complete list. Official procured mounting straps are weaved. The field uniform type of mounting straps, used most, shows black or golden emblems on stone-grey/ olive-colour basic textile.|$|R
50|$|Since then, {{the company}} has {{significantly}} expanded its range of travel gear ranging from uncomplicated, single-volume holdalls to two and even four-wheeled trolleys with single or dual compartments, {{in a range of}} sizes from strict carry-on to standard carry-on and larger. Most styles integrate other design features such as adjustable shoulder straps, organizer pouches, laptop and multimedia sleeves, expansion zips and <b>straps,</b> “add-a-bag” <b>loops</b> and security lock rings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>straps,</b> {{like their}} name implies, are {{a single piece}} of webbing that is looped around the item to be {{protected}} and the two endpoints are brought together at the tie down fastener for fastening and providing tension.|$|R
50|$|During this period, pottery was {{distinguished}} by thinner walls than preceding Woodland pottery. Common shapes are large plain cooking jars with <b>strap</b> or <b>loop</b> handles. A hallmark of Fort Ancient pottery is engraved decorations {{on the rim}} and neck of the vessels, consisting {{of a series of}} interlocking lines, called guilloché. As this design emerged with the beginning of the Fort Ancient culture in the region, scholars use it as a characteristic to identify the culture.|$|R
50|$|A {{wristlet}} {{is often}} the first item used to actually perform the rescue, {{as opposed to the}} ventilator which is used to prepare the environment for a rescue. A wristlet is a cloth strap that is used to cinch tightly around the wrist or ankle of an incapacitated person. Once the <b>strap</b> is <b>looped</b> around a hand or foot, its attached rope is pulled by rescuers, tightening around the arm or leg and pulling the victim out of the confined space.|$|R
5000|$|When necessary, a {{night vision}} goggle mount is issued. The mount {{consists}} of a green metal bracket that hooks over {{the front of the}} helmet and the mount which is screwed into it. There is a <b>strap</b> that <b>loops</b> through the mount and connects to a large ring which is usually {{on the top of the}} helmet and two more straps secure the mount to the back of the helmet. [...] The mount is compatible with AN/PVS-7 and AN/PVS-14 night vision systems.|$|R
50|$|Troops from Ohio or New York were {{equipped}} with dark blue shell jackets with shoulder straps and 9 brass buttons {{down the front}} and colored tape around edges denoting their branch of service. Depending on the unit, there are variations of this pattern jacket. The Veteran Reserve Corps were issued a similar pattern but in sky blue with navy blue tape. The number of buttons on these jackets varied between 12 and 8. Some had shoulder <b>straps,</b> belt <b>loops</b> and piping while others did not.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} sort of endpin stopper uses the musician's chair as an anchor. T-shaped wooden stoppers are anchored by placing {{the top of the}} T behind the chair legs. Straight plank stoppers use one or two <b>straps</b> with <b>loops</b> at the end which are anchored around the chair legs. Since in this case the distance from the stopper to the chair is usually fixed, such stoppers typically have a line of dents running down the plank, allowing the instrument's angle to be adjusted by placing the endpin in a different dent.|$|R
50|$|Line ferrods {{were also}} {{provided}} in pairs, {{of which the}} even numbered one had contacts brought out {{to the front of}} the package in lugs suitable for wire wrap so the windings could be <b>strapped</b> for <b>loop</b> start or ground start signaling. The original 1ESS packaging had all the ferrods of an LSF together, and separate from the line switches, while the later 1AESS had each ferrod at the front of the steel box containing its line switch. Odd numbered line equipment could not be made ground start, their ferrods being inaccessible.|$|R
50|$|A {{horse blanket}} or rug is a blanket or animal coat {{intended}} for keeping a horse or other equine warm or otherwise protected from wind or other elements. They are tailored to fit around a horse's body from chest to rump, with straps crossing underneath the belly {{to secure the}} blanket yet allowing the horse to move about freely. Most {{have one or two}} straps that buckle in front, but a few designs have a closed front and must be slipped over a horse's head. Some designs also have small <b>straps</b> that <b>loop</b> lightly around the horse's hind legs to prevent the blanket from slipping sideways.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1862, the Type I was {{phased out}} for the Type II. Due to scarce supplies, {{they were made of}} jeans (a mixture of wool and cotton) or satinette and cassimere. There are several extant {{examples}} of Type IIs throughout out the United States, including in the American Civil War Museum. [...] The Richmond Depot Type II jacket is characterized by a nine-button front, no buttons on the cuffs, top-stitched edges, shoulder <b>straps,</b> belt <b>loops</b> on each hip, an unbleached cotton osnaburg lining and interior pockets. It has a six piece body and two piece sleeves. Generally, it has no trim, although examples with partial trim do exist.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a low-cost process for insulating walls comprising: (a) stacking bags filled with insulating material {{next to the}} exterior surface of a wall until the wall is covered, the stack of bags thus formed having fasteners to attach to a wire mesh (e. g., <b>straps</b> <b>looped</b> between the bags and fastened to the wall); (b) stretching a wire mesh (e. g., chicken wire or stucco netting) over the stack of bags, covering {{the side of the}} bags which is not adjacent to the wall; (c) fastening the wire mesh to stationary objects; (d) attaching the wire mesh to said fasteners on said stack of bags; and (e) applying a cemetitious material (e. g., stucco) to the wire mesh and allowing it to harden. Stacking the bags against the wall is preferably preceded by laying a base on the ground {{at the foot of the}} wall using a material such as cement or crushed stone wrapped in a non-woven fabric (e. g., geosynthetic felt). It is also preferred to erect stationary corner posts at the ends of the wall to be insulated, the top ends of the posts being tied to each other and/or tied or otherwise anchored to the wall. The invention also includes the structure made by this process. The structure comprises a stack of bags of insulating material next to the exterior wall of a building, said stack of bags of insulating material being attached to said wall and having a covering of cementitious material on the side not adjacent to said wall...|$|R
40|$|Background: Researchers have {{investigated}} the performance of face mask removal tools for spine injury management in football but not the effects of football equipment design. Hypotheses: Various styles or designs of football helmet equipment (helmets, face masks, <b>loop</b> <b>straps)</b> affect face mask removal efficiency. A cordless screwdriver performs more efficiently than do cutting tools. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Nineteen certified athletic trainers {{were randomly assigned to}} group 1 (cordless screwdriver and the FM Extractor) or group 2 (cordless screwdriver and the Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel). Subjects randomly performed face mask removal for 6 conditions composed of helmet (3), face mask (3), and <b>loop</b> <b>strap</b> (5) combinations. Time, head movement, perceived difficulty, and success rates were measured. Results: Multiple significant differences were found in time, movement, and perceived difficulty between the 6 helmet equipment conditions. The Shockblocker <b>loop</b> <b>strap</b> was consistently superior in all variables regardless of the tool used or the helmet it was attached to. The cordless screwdriver created less movement (mean range from any one plane, 2. 8 degrees- 13. 3 degrees), was faster (mean range, 42. 1 - 68. 8 seconds), and was less difficult (mean rating of perceived exertion range, 1. 4 - 2. 9) compared to cutting tools (ranges, 4. 4 degrees- 18. 4 degrees in any one plane, 71 - 174 seconds, rating of perceived exertion, 2. 8 - 7. 7). Trial failure was more common with cutting tools than with the screwdriver. Conclusion: Differences in football helmet equipment affect face mask removal. The cordless screwdriver is more efficient than the FM Extractor and Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel. Clinical Relevance: Professionals responsible for the care of football athletes must be knowledgeable in the types of equipment used and the best option available for effective airway access...|$|R
5000|$|Military attire {{was simply}} regular {{clothing}} {{with the addition}} of adornments depending on the number of “marks” a soldier had. These additions consisted of a spear, axe, sword, bow, shield, steel cap, helmet, an iron coat, or a linen or cloth tunic. During this era, soldiers carried either round or crescent shaped shields usually painted red. Higher-ranking officials decorated their swords with various colours and insignias. [...] In the middle half of the century, armor began to be made of leather and weapons were made light-weight. Previous mail tunics, found to be too heavy preventing the soldier from properly fighting, were replaced by the new leather armor, which consisted of overlapping flaps, cut like scales or leaves and each dyed a different colour. [...] In {{the latter half of the}} century, warriors shaved their heads to resemble the clergy in order to confuse foreign spies. The cowl, which was covered in rings, emerged during this time and was worn under the helmet, which also had a new addition, the nose piece. The ringed knee-length tunic was slit in the front and back to allow for more comfortable riding. The length of the trousers became shorter. “Mascled armor” began to replace the traditional ringed armory. These new iron pieces were assembled to look like mesh or nets but a combination of the two patterns have been found to be used. Another variation included covering the body in rings and removing the sleeves from the tunic. Planché mentions that a “square pectoral” was added to the breast of the armor as added protection and were “quilted or covered with rings”. [...] A yellow border was added to the pectorals, sleeves, and skirts. Shields had two new adjustments: one <b>strap</b> <b>looped</b> around the arm while a second strap circled around the neck, allowing the soldier the use of both his hands.|$|R
50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{finding in}} Fujinoki was {{the remnants of}} a saddle, which were not often found in their entirety in other tombs. This saddle was adorned with gilt-bronze, arc-shaped ornaments that were attached to the wooden cantles. The saddle mainly consisted of two bows, in the front and the rear, which would have had <b>straps</b> that <b>looped</b> under the accompanying part of the horse for stability. These bows had a section dedicated to decoration that was reinforced by a thick, heavy outer frame and a thick, lower arc for buckles. Only the rear bow had a special middle piece that was completely missing from the front bow. The rear bow appeared to be less extravagant and lacked decoration, indicating this was an afterthought, while the front bow’s ornamentation was full and complete.|$|R
5000|$|Ponies {{are usually}} given western saddles for {{children}}'s rides {{because they are}} less likely to slip and children can hang onto the saddle horn. <b>Straps</b> or <b>loops</b> should not be added to the saddle because children's hands can be caught in them. [...] Saddles need to be properly fitted to the pony for its welfare and comfort. [...] Stirrups, when used, should be wider than for regular riding to help prevent children's feet from getting caught, particularly because many children who take pony rides are wearing sneakers instead of boots. Tapaderos over the stirrups can help prevent a foot from going all the say through the stirrup and getting trapped, but only if properly designed so a child's foot doesn't get wedged between the tapadero and the front of the stirrup.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dramatic}} {{curvature of}} the bows makes stringing them very different from straighter bows found in Europe. There is an old saying in Turkey that there are [...] "120 ways to string a bow," [...] though the most common methods involve sitting on ground with one's feet pressed against the grip. Heavier bows usually {{require the use of}} a long, <b>looped</b> <b>strap</b> called a [...] "kemend" [...] to pull the limbs back and hold them while the string is seated.|$|R
50|$|The {{shafts of}} a {{carriage}} were called limbers in English dialect. Lancewood, a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A holdback, consisting of an iron catch {{on the shaft}} with a <b>looped</b> <b>strap,</b> enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the yoke. At {{the end of a}} trace, a loop called a cockeye attaches to the carriage.|$|R
5000|$|Barcoo bridle - an Australian stock horse bridle {{that usually}} {{does not have}} a noseband and is used at work and in competition. The crownpiece, browband and throatlatch are all sewn onto a ring near the horse’s ears {{on each side of the}} head. The cheek strap is single <b>strap</b> that <b>loops</b> through the bit and through the ring to a buckle on the outside of the cheek. Thus the cheek strap is doubled. Variations of this bridle include an [...] "extended head" [...] with the throatlatch further back than usual) to prevent horses rubbing the bridle off. Other {{variations}} include a noseband and these styles may be used as a headcollar. A lighter variety used for racing has cheek strap billets sewn to the ring, and the attached cheek straps are similar to those of an English bridle. Most bits can be used with these bridles with various snaffles the most commonly used.|$|R

5000|$|Tail {{setting is}} a {{controversial}} subject. This is primarily because a common way {{of creating the}} set look is a tail [...] "nicking" [...] operation, in which the retractor muscles {{on the underside of}} the dock are partially cut (the tail is not broken, as some people believe). The tail is then placed into a tail set so that when the muscles and ligaments heal they are longer than they were initially. A tail set is a harness-like device with <b>straps</b> that <b>loop</b> from the chest of the horse to the back of the tail to support a spoon crupper that actually holds the tail itself. A tail set holds the tail up and stretches the muscles and ligaments of the tail, preventing it from gradually sinking down. Once healed, the tail will still retain most of its movement and function, such as swatting flies, but can no longer be clamped down hard against the buttocks. In the show ring, the tailsetting harness is removed, but the tail is often tied or put into a tail brace to hold it in place.|$|R
