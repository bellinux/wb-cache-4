40|$|AbstractComparison of drying {{characteristics}} of Thompson seedless grapes using combined microwave oven and <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer was investigated. The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen when increasing drying time from 30 to 120 min when grapes drying started in <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer and finished in microwave oven for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated. The average total soluble solids was 90. 4 ° Brix when drying was achieved by microwave oven followed <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer, meanwhile, it was 90. 2 ° Brix when drying was achieved <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven. The total soluble solid was 92 ° Brix when drying process started and finished in <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer alone. The average drying ratio was 4. 21 when drying was achieved by microwave oven followed <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer; meanwhile, it was 4. 19 when drying was achieved <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven. The <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet drying method had higher drying constant ‘k’ compared to the other two methods. The microwave oven followed <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer as a drying method achieved 78 % of the optimum selection percentage.

30|$|Because when green lumber was {{heat-treated}} <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> at atmospheric pressure, some severe drying checks {{occurred in}} the wood, the lumber dried to approximately 12 % of the moisture content {{was used in the}} conventional <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> heat treatment [15].

Unlike the combined treatment, the reactor was not made airtight. It was possible to exhaust the air in the reactor and the vapor removed from the lumber. The operation time of heater was 18  h.

After dehulling, different parameters including dehulling efficiency and {{quality and quantity of}} oil extracted from dehhulled seeds were evaluated. The results indicated that the highest dehulling efficiency (86. 5 %) was obtained by soaking of seeds in distilled water for 100 min followed <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> drying at 65 °C. The seeds dehulled after soaking in distilled water for 70 and 100 min followed <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> drying either in 55 or 65 °C showed higher oil content compare to dehulled seeds pretreated by other methods. The crude fiber content of dehulled seeds was decreased as a result of increasing the dehulling efficiency. The highest acidity value (0. 81 %) was obtained from soaking pre-treatments for 100 min followed by sun drying. There was significant differences (P< 0. 05) between acidity values of oil extracted from dehulled seeds dried <b>by</b> sun and <b>hot</b> <b>air.</b> However, the results showed {{no significant difference between the}} acidity value of oil extracted from dehulled seeds dried by two different temperatures.

40|$|High {{velocity}} oxy-fuel (HVOF) sprayed, functionally graded polyimide/WC-Co composite coatings on {{polymer matrix}} composites (PMC's) are being investigated for applications in turbine engine technologies. This {{requires that the}} polyimide, used as the matrix material, be fully crosslinked during deposition {{in order to maximize}} its engineering properties. The rapid heating and cooling nature of the HVOF spray process and the high heat flux through the coating into the substrate typically do not allow sufficient time at temperature for curing of the thermoset. It was hypothesized that external substrate preheating might enhance the deposition behavior and curing reaction during the thermal spraying of polyimide thermosets. A simple analytical process model for the deposition of thermosetting polyimide onto polymer matrix composites by HVOF thermal spray technology has been developed. The model incorporates various heat transfer mechanisms and enables surface temperature profiles of the coating to be simulated, primarily as a function of substrate preheating temperature. Four cases were modeled: (i) no substrate preheating; (ii) substrates electrically preheated from the rear; (iii) substrates preheated <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> from the front face; and (iv) substrates electrically preheated from the rear and <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> from the front...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the dehydration of skim cheese through different methods, in particular <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air,</b> microwave and freeze-drying, {{in order to assess}} which of these methods would be more suitable {{for the development of a}} new product (cheese snack). For the three processes of dehydration, several temperatures, powers and times were used, respectively. The drying time was optimized to allow the water activity of the final product to be between 0. 3 and 0. 4. The color and texture of the product obtained by the three processes were evaluated, and the nutritional analysis (protein, lipids, ash) of the product dried <b>by</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> at 52 ºC and by microwave at 750 W and 850 W was performed. The sensory analysis of the microwave dehydrated products was also carried out. The results obtained revealed that the temperature played a relevant role in the drying time and the hardness of the product. In the dehydration by microwave, the power of 850 W resulted in a lower drying time and a better color preservation, but in a high hardness of the samples.
