An extensive study of factors affecting color usage is performed and based on this study a final model is implemented. The focus is towards physiological and psychological factors, which govern color perception.

500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average, {{claiming}} that while it was not bad, it was not great either. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more clever than painful. Adam Buckman of the New York Post commented on the crude language used by the characters, and found there was nothing new that could have surprised him with watching the episode.

500|$|Prior to {{the season}} premieres of most {{television}} series in September, a common practice by television networks would be to send <b>screeners</b> of pilots of new shows to critics.

We're not hiding anything... simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9.02, riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night, and letting all our constituents see it at the same time." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV speculated that the decision was an indication of the low quality of the episodes, but pointed out that the pilot may not have been finished in time for a screener release, which was later confirmed to be the case. Despite not having watched the episode, the Parents Television Council said in a statement that [...] "if Gossip Girl is any indication of what 90210 will look like, advertisers have plenty of reason to steer clear of the show...

40|$|AbstractThe {{passenger}} and baggage {{security in}} airport screening system {{is one of}} the most important factors that determine air transport safety and security. It prevents objects and materials that could be used to commit an act of unlawful interference from being placed on board an aircraft. The security screening system consists of x-ray screening devices, walk-through metal detectors and specialised software. However, a key element of the security screening system is the human – the security screener (SSc). The equipment and software helps the screener to find prohibited items, but also detects and records his/her errors. The whole security control point (SCP) can be regarded as a complex socio-technical system. It's effectiveness is dependent, inter alia, on the type of x-ray devices used, a variant of SCP organisation or the technical condition of the equipment, but mainly on the quality of the security screeners’ work. Special attention is paid to the types of errors and their frequency. We analyze the quantitative relationships between types of errors and also between the frequency of errors and the frequency of virtual threat images projection (TIP). This last technology is a kind of intelligent support system and at the same time verifies the <b>screener's</b> work. The study was based on measurements under real conditions at the Katowice-Pyrzowice International Airport. In the framework of this research two basic types of errors made by SSc were identified. The results show that the number of errors is dependent from the frequency of the stimulus, represented by TIP images. As a result, it was possible to determine the recommended frequency of threat images projections. The study is supplemented by a comparison of the screeners’ effectiveness in laboratory conditions against real conditions, while working at the security control point...|$|R

As you will see after reviewing the guide, there are certain limitations to the use of focus groups. You will also discover the richness of information provided through focus group research about women's attitudes and behaviors regarding breast and cervical cancer screening. The hope is that you will come away with not only a greater understanding of this qualitative research methodology, but also with a heightened sensitivity to the importance of involving your program's intended audience in its development, from conceptualization through to implementation and evaluation. This guide was developed primarily for staff of state health departments who are developing breast and cervical cancer public education programs with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These staff are being challenged to design programs to reach women not traditionally served by public education efforts in cancer control. These underserved groups include a diverse population of women, such as low income Native American, Hispanic, African American, and Asian American women. In addition, the needs of women who have limited or no reading skills are being addressed in these programs. In addition to staff of state breast and cervical cancer programs, we hope that this guide is also helpful to others who are interested in using focus groups in designing health education programs and communication efforts.

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} season hypotheses was that of Slender Man, the 2009 phenomenon, {{a man with a}} blank face, tractable arms, and killer of children. However, sources working on the show confirmed to Entertainment Weekly, in January 2016, that the myth would not be appearing, and that a theme had already been established for the season, and would be revealed in March. Though, this did not come to pass. Based on the teaser trailers and several interviews given by Murphy, media reported the plot of the season as dealing with cult, farm, orphanage, colony, or the storyline of the Antichrist, which has already been touched on by the series in season one (Vivien and Tate's child, Michael, that Constance took as her own, was considered to be the titular figure). Deadline's Ross A. Lincoln posited the theory that the cycle will revolve around the Bloody Benders family. They owned an inn and general store in rural 1800s Kansas and were {{responsible for the deaths of}} 11 passersby, later disappearing. Photos from the set released by TMZ confirmed the season to incorporate colonial aspects. Vulture Jordan Crucchiola theorized it to be about the Roanoke Colony, with Murphy likely to adapt the historical explanation of the settlers disappearance. The Huffington Post added that another story avenue Murphy might venture on is the colloquial belief that the colonist vanished under supernatural circumstances. <b>Screener's</b> Aaron Pruner noted that the colony was mentioned by Billie Dean Howard in Murder House, thus alluding to the possible Antichrist or supernatural presence in the sixth season. Pruner also mentioned that the history of the word [...] "Croatoan" [...] is vast and unnerving. Days before the death of author Edgar Allan Poe, he is said to have muttered the cryptic word as his final. Furthermore, in 1937, the word was found scribbled in fated pilot Amelia Earhart's journal. Kate Feldman from New York Daily News has speculated that the season will revolve around the Manson family; she cited iconography in a teaser, Charles Manson's fascination with spiders (i.e. official poster for season), Evan Peters' appearance resembling Manson, and Murphy's previous comments stating that the series had considered the theme for the third year, which ultimately shifted to Coven. However, Sarah Paulson has rejected the Manson theme, saying, [...] "Wrong! You can look me dead in the eyes. You are wrong, dead wrong. And you will see that I am not lying to you. I'm not pulling a little Jedi mind trick." [...] After the release of the revealing [...] "Anthology" [...] trailer, The Huffington Post Bill Bradley suggested, after taking into account several factors, that the season would feature a discarded Murder House menace that slays his victims with hedge trimmers. TV Guide suggested a major connection to Asylum concerning the spider shown travelling under the skin of a person in one of the teasers for the season.|$|R
