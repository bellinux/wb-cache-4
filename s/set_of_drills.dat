Relationships between overall tackling form and concussion likelihood will be tested {{to determine whether or not}} the utilization of football helmets and shoulder pads have an effect on concussion rates. Using a qualitative design, 18 male rugby players (18 - 35 years of age) were used as subjects for tackling drills where overall tackling form was analyzed. Surveys determining perceived likelihood of getting hurt or injured, and pain levels, were administered before and after each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drills</b> respectively. Content analysis was conducted to determine whether the use of helmets and shoulder pads impacted overall tackling form, perceived likelihood of getting hurt or injured, and pain. There was a significant difference in the scores for overall tackling form for pads (M= 5. 001, SD= 1. 099) and without pads (M= 2. 516, SD= 0. 433) conditions; t(17) = 6. 314, p=. 0001. Specifically, the results suggest that when an athlete wears padding, their overall tackling form decreases. With regards to mindset, there was not statistical significance in the participants 2 ̆ 7 perceived likelihood on getting hurt or injured and their tackling form. A Spearman Rank Test determined there was a positive correlation (. 754 and. 708) in head pain experienced in both the padded/non-padded tackles respectively meaning that for both padded/non-padded tackles, as form decreased, pain experienced in the head increased. This study provides an insight into the negative relationship between the use of shoulder pads and helmets, overall tackling form, and pain experienced in participants 2 ̆ 7 heads for contact sport athletes.

30|$|Two main types <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> {{technologies}} {{have been used}} with CSG: conventional vertical well technology and multi-branch horizontal well technology (Wang et al. 2004; Shen 2005). Vertical wells are the more mature technology and are widely used in China (Qiao et al. 2008); they {{account for more than}} 95 % of all CSG wells (Luo et al. 2009).

40|$|Safety {{and cost}} control are {{critical}} success {{factors in the}} realm <b>of</b> <b>drilling.</b> Actual well costs frequently exceed planned costs due to unexpected drilling incidents related to potentially avoidable geohazards. It is estimated that - in the Netherlands on average - around 20 % <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> time is spent recovering from such unexpected incidents. A significant part of this non-productive time (NPT) can be avoided if geohazards are identified upfront. The risk assessment for a well trajectory is largely based on the experience from offset wells: boreholes in the neighbourhood that have been drilled earlier or holes drilled through similar geological settings. Easy access to relevant historic drilling data and the records of geohazards encountered in offset wells is essential for effective de-risking <b>of</b> future <b>drilling</b> programs. Currently operators typically have their own databases containing this type of information. However, their databases are often incomplete and lack data from competitor wells.

The problematic frequency is 2400 Hz, the rotor blade exhibiting a 5 - diametric mode order of vibration. The asymmetry is introduced by <b>drilling</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> radial holes into the disc rim. Modal analysis is carried out over a range of frequencies using added masses applied magnetically to the rim of the rotor. This shows the amplitudes at set frequencies to reduce considerably when asymmetry is introduced. When a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 5 masses is added to the rotor the vibration amplitude at the troublesome frequency is seen to be considerably reduced. Finite element analysis complements the experimental results. The analysis of a plain disc initially shows the two normal modes at very close frequencies but when asymmetry is introduced, by drilling holes in the rim of the disc, there is a noticeable frequency decoupling of the 2 normal modes. This is also accompanied by a distinct positioning of the antinodes with the antinodes of one mode positioning at the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilled</b> holes, the other mode antinodes being between the holes.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a novel measure called Modulated Specific Energy (SEM) {{which has been}} developed for the purpose <b>of</b> characterizing <b>drilled</b> material in open-pit coal mining. In Monitor-While-Drilling (MWD), the information available for coal detection are limited to a small <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters that can be measured on a rotary drill rig. Despite this constraint, our analysis shows that MWD can still detect {{the top of the}} coal seam consistently without relying on geophysical data — such as bulk density and natural gamma — by using the SEM measure. The proposal utilizes a hypothesized link between a derived drill performance indicator (the rotation-to-thrust power ratio) and geomechanical properties of sedimentary rock strata (shear and compressive strengths) to increase the coal discriminative power of SEM relative to Teale׳s specific energy measure. Its efficacy is demonstrated using mutual information, a simple threshold strategy and an artificial neural network. The results show the SEM can detect the coal seam interface consistently with a greater margin for error, and overcome the problems of low specificity and high variability observed in existing MWD approaches. By reducing the detection uncertainty, the SEM is able to provide consistent feedback while drilling and eliminate trial-and-error. This makes coal mining processes more integrated and reliable, which in turn improves operational effectiveness and efficiency in coal recovery...|$|R

Most of the sports scheduling problems that have been tackled in the literature refer to competitions in which a venue is associated to each competitor. In these cases, selecting the venue in which each tie will be played {{is not an issue}} because this is defined by the status, home or away, of the competitors.

The dynamical model governing the 3 D kinematics <b>of</b> a <b>drill</b> bit is constructed for rotary drilling applications {{for which the}} bit is guided by a push-the-bit rotary steerable system. The evolution of the bit trajectory, and thus of the borehole geometry, {{is a consequence of}} the interaction between the borehole, a geometric object, and the drilling structure, a mechanical object. In this respect, the model describing this evolution consists of the association between (i) a model of the near-bit region of the drillstring, (ii) a model of the bit/rock interaction, and (iii) kinematic relationships relating the motion of the bit into the rock to geometric variables for the borehole evolution. The mathematical formulation of these three elements yields a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> functional differential equations with secular terms accounting for a delayed influence of the borehole geometry on the bit trajectory. The parameters entering these relations account for the loads and properties <b>of</b> the <b>drilling</b> structure and for the properties of the bit and rock formation. Three length scales are identified in the response <b>of</b> the directional <b>drilling</b> system; they correspond to short-, intermediate-, and long-range behaviors. The short-range response is associated with the dimensions of the bit, the small scale of the problem. It corresponds to fast variations of the bit orientation. On the intermediate-range, the wellbore trajectory converges to a quasi-constant curvature solution, if it is stable. On the long-range, the borehole curvature slowly varies and for appropriate <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters the borehole converges toward a stationary helical path.

Drilling efficiently with the highest attainable rate of penetration is one <b>of</b> the ways <b>drilling</b> time could be reduced. Real-time monitoring of Mechanical Specific Energy will enable drilling engineers to detect when the optimum drilling rate for a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters is not being achieved. Numerous works have been done on air hammers and rock Mechanical Specific Energy. Previous research has shown that Mechanical Specific Energy, which is a ratio that quantifies the input energy and Rate of Penetration (ROP) <b>of</b> a <b>drilling</b> system, is directly proportional to the rock compressive strength being drilled. The Mechanical Specific Energy model utilizes drilling parameters such as ROP, Weight on bit (WOB), RPM, torque, flow-rate, bottom-hole pressure, and bottom-hole temperature to show how effectively energy being put into the drill string is being converted to ROP at the bit. This research effort proposes a new model to calculate the Mechanical Specific Energy for air hammer drilling systems. A thermodynamic model for the air hammer from which the piston impact velocity and kinetic energy is obtained is presented. To be able to estimate the effective energy delivered to the rock by the hammer, the stress wave propagation model is used and factored into the Mechanical Specific Energy model. The Mechanical Specific Energy values obtained from the application of this model provide a qualitative indicator of formation pressure changes and a means for drilling engineers to detect when optimum drilling rate is not being achieved. It can be deduced from the model that the impact energy of the hammer is greatly affected by the pressure drop across the hammer and since the hammer accounts for about sixty percent of the energy required for destroying the rock, the ROP can be varied by varying the pressure drop across the hammer...|$|R

An exploratory analysis and geostatistical modelling of the grades assayed on a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> hole samples is performed, which allows constructing a grade model on a dense grid by means of a conditional simulation. The grades are then averaged to greater selective mining unit supports in order to proceed with the study and methodology. First, the metal-tonnage curves are used to analyse the loss of selectivity on the in situ resources caused by a change of support. Concerning the ore reserves and their mining sequence, defined in the pit optimization and analysis process, the same curves prove that the loss of selectivity is more accentuated. Second, the importance of the block boundary dilution produced during mining operations is assessed. its value depends on the amount of ore in contact with waste, on the loading error of the equipment and on the ore loss/waste dilution criterion assumed by the planner. The dilution percentage and the differences between waste and ore grades become higher when the block size decreases. For these reasons, considering the dilution in the production plans makes mining a small support more constraining. An adequate delimitation of the orebody can improve the mining selectivity, leading to greater income.

40|$|During {{drilling}} operations the mud pit volume varies quite a lot. These variations are unavoidable due {{to different}} short term {{factors such as}} tripping {{in and out of}} the hole and pump rate changes, and different long term factors such as heat exchange in the well and removal of cuttings. The mud pit can also operate as kick indicator on the rig, but due to the constant variations in the pit level, this is challenging. By a better understanding of the factors controlling the changes in the mud pit level, it might be possible to make a reliable model to spot kick at an early stage. This report has briefly discussed some of the different factors that affect the mud level in short term and long term. These factors include mud pump, viscous flow, ballooning, drilling fluid, cuttings and tripping. A model was also presented for the estimation of the mud pit level during various drilling operations. The model uses a logarithmic equation for the estimation of the mud pump shut off period, and mud pump flow rate along with rate of penetration and block position for the other estimations. The model was tested for one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> data from a land rig. Since data were missing, it was run 7 times for different hole size, initial cuttings concentration and mud pump factors. The outcome from the model showed the different drilling operations in a fair manner, and especially the drilling phase showed accurate behavior. A larger hole size resulted in larger reductions in the mud pit volume. Higher initial cuttings concentration resulted in bigger changes in the mud pit. And higher mud pump shut off factor resulted in higher estimated values for the calculation of the mud pump shut off period. The model still got severe limitations, and especially the mud pump shut off estimation has room for improvements. Another limitation of the model is the absent <b>of</b> <b>drilling</b> data from different wells in different environments. The model is also based on a vertical well, which is insufficient since most wells are deviated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cognitive deficits are {{routinely}} evident in schizophrenia, and are of sufficient magnitude to influence functional outcomes in work, social functioning and illness management. Cognitive remediation is an evidenced-based non-pharmacological {{treatment for the}} neurocognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. Narrowly defined, cognitive remediation is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> cognitive <b>drills</b> or compensatory interventions designed to enhance cognitive functioning, but from the vantage of the psychiatric rehabilitation field, cognitive remediation is a therapy which engages the patient in learning activities that enhance the neurocognitive skills relevant to their chosen recovery goals. Cognitive remediation programs vary in {{the extent to which}} they reflect these narrow or broader perspectives but six meta-analytic studies report moderate range effect sizes on cognitive test performance, and daily functioning. Reciprocal interactions between baseline ability level, the type of instructional techniques used, and motivation provide some explanatory power for the heterogeneity in patient response to cognitive remediation...|$|R
40|$|The current {{clinical}} {{approach for}} otologic surgery is largely invasive. Recently, a multi-port {{approach has been}} investigated {{in order to reduce}} the amount of traumatization. Here, three canals are drilled from the skull surface to the surgical site. Due to the minimal invasiveness of the new approach, the surgeon is not able to directly control the process visually anymore. Hence, a precise patient-specific planning based on image data is crucial. In my thesis, I focus on planning the course <b>of</b> the <b>drill</b> canals based on patient-specific models for this new multi-port approach. In order to generate those patient-specific models I first developed methods to segment the risk structures for otologic surgery in computed tomography data. The main challenges here are the small size of the structures, lacking contrast to neighboring structures as well as the varying shape and image intensities. To cope with these challenges, I adapted a generic model based approach - the Probabilistic Active Shape Model - to the risk structures for otologic surgery. I intensively evaluated the approach and showed that the segmentation accuracy is within the range of manual segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, I developed methods to automatically plan the course <b>of</b> the <b>drill</b> canals based on the extracted patient-specific models. The challenge here is that the multi-port approach is not yet in clinical practice and hence, there is a total lack of experience with this new procedure. As a first step, I developed a planning tool to compute the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> feasible <b>drill</b> canals that allows the manual choice of a combination <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> canals. Then, two clinicians conducted a feasibility analysis using this planning tool. I formalized the gathered expert data and derived a model for automatically determining the best combination <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> canals. The experiments show that the automatically computed drill canals are comparable to the manual choice of the clinicians. This enables the computer-assisted planning of the new multi-port strategy for otologic surgery...|$|R
40|$|First online: 13 January 2016 Rock {{drilling}} Penetration Rate (PR) {{is influenced}} by many parameters including rock properties, machine parameters of the chosen rig and the working process. Five datasets were utilized to quantitatively assess the effect of various rock properties on PR. The datasets consisted <b>of</b> two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> diamond and percussive <b>drilling</b> and one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> rotary <b>drilling</b> data. A new rating system called Rock Drillability Characterization index (RDCi) is proposed to predict PR for different drilling methods. This drillability model incorporates {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} of intact rock, the P-wave velocity and the density of rock. The RDCi system is further applied to predict PR in the diamond rotary drilling, non-coring rotary drilling and percussive drilling. Strong correlations between PR and RDCi values were observed indicating that the developed drillability rating model is relevant and can be utilized to effectively predict the rock drillability in any operating environment. A practical procedure for predicting PR using the RDCi was established. The drilling engineers can follow this procedure to use RDCi as an effective method to estimate drillability.

2500|$|As {{uncertain}} as {{the exact}} dating {{of the lower}} jaw of Mauer was until recently, so is the assignment of other fossils to its layer. Such contextual fossils are the only direct evidence for an accurate reconstruction of the habitat of a find. Not until 1991 two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> core <b>drilling</b> were conducted in the defunct sand mine of Grafenrain [...] and - beginning in 1995, several dozen cubic meters of sand were screened in search of fossil fragments that could shed light on accompanying species. However, mice teeth that were found proved to be not suitable for a more precise dating of the layer, since these mice lived anatomically virtually unchanged over too long a period. At least palynological findings of similar vegetation areas of the Cromer interglacial period can help {{with a description of}} the habitat.: [...] "across alluvial forests in the river valleys, forests on the slopes and open forests on the heights; these were rather dry locations, regarding the hydro-geology of the crevasses (...) of the Buntsandstein - and Muschelkalk mountains, bare of any Loess sediments." ...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{resources}} {{are subject to}} increasing pressure from a local to global scale. For {{many parts of the}} world groundwater is central to increasing water and food security. This is especially the case in regions such as the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania with highly variable or seasonal climates resulting in irregular access to surface water. With the background of scarce and deficient data on groundwater resources and the essential need of such information for wise management, this study aims at estimating the groundwater availability and variability in the Kilombero River Basin, Tanzania. A data <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>drill</b> logs provided information on soil types and related values of specific yield; depth of water tables; and depth to bedrock. These data enabled estimations of drainable water and (together with aquifer area) also quantification of the total groundwater volume. The latter was estimated to range between 48 km 3 and 357 km 3. The values are reasonable as an order of magnitude compared to previous quantifications and the annual water cycle in the valley. The spatial variability in drainable water was less than expected likely due to a high concentration of data points around the floodplain such that they have a similar physical setting. That mainly the valley bottom was covered by the data set indicates that findings reported here might be more appropriate for this specific area instead of the entire catchment. The methods applied give more uncertain results in high elevation areas with less aquifer depths, which could also be part of the explanation for the low spatial variability. However, a low variability indicates a homogenous access to groundwater on a regional level that should be positive in terms of mitigating competition over water. Due to uncertainties with the groundwater estimations, these results should not be overly interpreted but preferably used to indicate potential pathways forward for improvements of quantification approaches. Despite the wide uncertainty ranges the groundwater volumes that are easily accessible in the Kilombero Valley are not unlimited. In order to avoid inappropriate use of the groundwater resources, aquifer data must be considered in land-water management. Otherwise, conflicts are likely to increase due to competition over land and water resources...|$|R
30|$|Extended reach wells (ERWs), {{especially}} horizontal extended reach {{well with}} a high HD (horizontal displacement) to TVD (true vertical depth) ratio, represent a frontier technology and challenge the drilling limitations. Oil and gas reservoir in beaches or lakes and offshore can be effectively exploited by using extended reach drilling (ERD) technology. This paper focuses on the difficult technological problems encountered during exploiting the Liuhua 11 - 1 oil field in the South China Sea, China. Emphasis is on investigating the key subjects including prediction and control of open hole limit extension in offshore ERD, prediction of casing wear and its prevention and torque reduction, ϕ 244.5 mm casing running with floating collars to control drag force, and steerable drilling modes. The basic concept of limit extension in ERD is presented and the prediction method for open hole limit extension is given in this paper. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> advanced <b>drilling</b> mechanics and control technology has been established and its practical results are verified by field cases. All those efforts may be significant for further investigating and practicing ERD limit theory and control technology in the future.|$|R
