5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales).

50|$|Horkeliella {{is a small}} genus of {{two species}} of {{flowering}} plants in the rose family known as false horkelias. They are both endemic to California.

50|$|Aetiocetus is a <b>small,</b> <b>toothed</b> whale with no {{more than}} three small denticles on the {{anterior}} and posterior margins of the posterior upper teeth. Their postcanine teeth are somewhat heterodont. The base of the rostrum, or snout, of the whale, is greater than 170% of the width of the occipital condyles where the skull meets the neck. These features are synapomorphies, or shared derived traits, of Aetiocetus. There is a distinct notch by the internal nostrils formed of the palatine, pterygoid, and vomer bones; this is a synapomorphy of Aetiocetus + Chonecetus. Synapomorphies of the aetiocetids present in Aetiocetus are: the coronoid process of the dentary, or lower jaw, is well developed; the zygomatic arch is expanded anteriorly and posteriorly but is narrow at the middle. Aetiocetus also shares several traits with all mysticetes. The mandibular symphysis, or the connection between both lower jaw bones, is not fused. The descending process of the maxilla becomes a toothless plate below the orbit. They possess a wide rostrum. All these features are functionally related to filter-feeding with baleen and is a hallmark of the Mysticeti. The presence of teeth, as Barnes et al. remark, seems paradoxical.|$|R
40|$|Cetaceans rely {{critically}} {{on sound}} for navigation, foraging and communication {{and are therefore}} potentially affected by increasing noise levels from human activities at sea. Shipping is the main contributor of anthropogenic noise underwater, but studies of shipping noise effects have primarily considered baleen whales due to their good hearing at low frequencies, where ships produce most noise power. Conversely, the possible effects of vessel noise on <b>small</b> <b>toothed</b> whales have been largely ignored due to their poor low-frequency hearing. Prompted by recent findings of energy at medium- to high-frequencies in vessel noise, we conducted an exposure study where the behaviour of four porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in a net-pen was logged while they were exposed to 133 vessel passages. Using a multivariate generalised linear mixed-effects model, we show that low levels of high frequency components in vessel noise elicit strong, stereotyped behavioural responses in porpoises. Such low levels will routinely be experienced by porpoises in the wild at ranges of more than 1000 [*]meters from vessels, suggesting that vessel noise is a, so far, largely overlooked, but substantial source of disturbance in shallow water areas with high densities of both porpoises and vessels...|$|R
40|$|The Symposium on Marine Mammals of the Indian Ocean {{was held}} at Colombo, Sri Lanka, 1983. At this {{symposium}} it was recommended that the Indian Ocean Sanctuary of Whales, which was established by the International Whaling Commission in 1979,should be extended as far as Antarctica over 55 °S. Under such circumstances, the author has re-examined the distribution {{of all kinds of}} marine mammals. The baleen whales are distributed over 55 °S, while most of <b>smaller</b> <b>toothed</b> whales are distributed in the waters north of 55 °S. Pinnipeds like the baleen whales are found in the waters on both sides of 55 °S, and sirenians never appear in colder waters. Therefore, the only groups which are substantially affected by the new expanded sanctuary are the baleen whales, sperm whales, medium-sized toothed whales and pinnipeds. Concerning these animals, some conservation agents such as the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the International Convention for Conservation of Antarctic Seals, have taken some measures for their conservation which are already working effectively. If the requirement for the expanded sanctuary increases, the conservation measures ought to be systematized...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe research {{described in this}} thesis {{is a continuation of}} work started by the Applied Research Laboratories of the University of Texas at Austin into the analysis of biosonar signals. Experiments conducted in 1997 on two species of <b>small</b> <b>toothed</b> whales found these species to emit significant high frequency signal components, extending to as high as 400 to 500 kHz. To assess the importance of these high frequencies in dolphin echolocation and target identification, experiments were performed in which an acoustic filter, used to suppress the high frequencies, was placed between a dolphin and a target. Insertion Loss and Reflection Loss measurements performed on 1 / 4 " thick and 1 / 2 " thick Sound Absorbing Filters (SOAB) demonstrated their effectiveness at absorbing high frequencies above 150 kHz, with little reflectivity. The results from one echolocation experiment, with one dolphin, showed the animal's ability to classify targets was essentially unaffected by the insertion of the filters. Analysis of the dolphin's echolocation signals showed the animal definitely compensating for the filters, by increasing its sound energy output, especially at frequencies above 100 kHz. It is anticipated that this initial experiment will lead to future research in explaining the existence of these high frequency echolocation components. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEarly hominins formed {{large and}} thick-enamelled cheek-teeth within {{relatively}} short growth periods {{as compared with}} modern humans. To understand better the developmental basis of this process, we measured daily enamel increments, or cross striations, in 17 molars of Plio-Pleistocene hominins representing seven different species, including specimens attributed to early Homo. Our results show considerable variation across species, although all specimens conformed to the known pattern characterised by greater values in outer than inner enamel, and greater cuspal than cervical values. We then compared our results with the megadontia index, which represents tooth size in relation to body mass, for each species to assess the effect of daily growth rates on tooth size. Our results indicate that larger toothed (megadont) taxa display higher rates or faster forming enamel than <b>smaller</b> <b>toothed</b> hominins. By forming enamel quickly, large tooth crowns were able to develop within the constraints of shorter growth periods. Besides daily increments, many animals express long-period markings (striae of Retzius) in their enamel. We report periodicity values (number of cross striations between adjacent striae) in 14 new specimens of Australopithecus afarensis, Paranthropus aethiopicus, Paranthropus boisei, Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus, and show that long-period striae express a strong association with male and average male-female body mass. Our results for Plio-Pleistocene hominins show that the biological rhythms {{that give rise to}} long-period striae are encompassed within the range of variation known for modern humans, but show a lower mean and modal value of 7 days in australopithecines. In our sample of early Homo, mean and modal periodicity values were 8 days, and therefore similar to modern humans. These new data on daily rates of enamel formation and periodicity provide a better framework to interpret surface manifestations of internal growth markings on fossil hominin tooth crowns. Importantly, our data on early hominin cross striation variation may now contribute towards solving difficult taxonomic diagnoses where much may depend on fragmentary molar remains and enamel structure...|$|R
