40|$|This paper aims to help {{supply chain}} {{managers}} {{to determine the}} value of retailer-supplier partnership initiatives beyond information sharing (IS) according to their specific business environment under time-varying demand conditions. For this purpose, we use integer linear programming models to quantify the benefits that can be accrued by a retailer, a supplier and {{system as a whole}} from <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> inventory ownership and <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power with that of IS. The results of a detailed numerical study pertaining to static time horizon reveal that the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> inventory ownership provides system-wide cost benefits in specific settings. Particularly, when it induces the retailer to order larger quantities and the supplier also prefers such orders due to significantly high setup and shipment costs. We observe that the relative benefits of <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power are always higher than the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> inventory ownership under all the conditions. The value of the <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power is greater than IS particularly when the variability of underlying demand is low and time-dependent variation in production cost is high. However, when the shipment cost is negligible and order issuing efficiency of the supplier is low, the cost benefits of <b>shift</b> <b>in</b> decision-making power beyond IS are not significant...|$|R
5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> economic activity.

5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate <b>shifts</b> <b>in</b> the past, including four major ice ages.

Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period.

This research used descriptive qualitative method. The data used is the Detective Conan Comics Vol 84 and 85 created by Gosho Aoyama and its translations in Indonesian named Detective Conan vol 84 and 85 by PT Elex Media Komputindo. The theory used include translation theory by Nida and Taber and Miyagawa and Takaoka, shifting form and meaning by Catford and Simatupang and translation techniques according to Molina and Albir.
