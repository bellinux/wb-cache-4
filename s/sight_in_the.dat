5|$|The {{concrete}} bunkers of Albania are a ubiquitous <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, with {{an average}} of 5.7 bunkers for every square kilometre.

5|$|Gregorson Campbell's health {{deteriorated}} in {{the last}} years of his life, especially after the death of his mother Helen at the Tiree manse in 1890; he died on 22 November 1891 before seeing the final printed edition of The Fians. Alfred Nutt, fellow folklorist and publisher, chronicled details of Gregorson Campbell's life as an introduction to the second compilation of Gregorson Campbell's collection of myths, Clan Traditions and Popular Tales of the Western Highlands and Islands, published in 1895. Two other books were published posthumously: Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland in 1900, and Witchcraft and Second <b>Sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Highlands the following year.|$|E
5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find Snow White {{seemingly}} dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and {{fallen in love with}} Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E

25|$|LGV {{may begin}} as a self-limited painless genital ulcer that {{occurs at the}} contact site 3–12 days after {{infection}}. Women rarely notice a primary infection because the initial ulceration where the organism penetrates the mucosal layer is often located out of <b>sight,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vaginal wall. In men fewer than 1/3 of those infected notice {{the first signs of}} LGV. This primary stage heals in a few days. Erythema nodosum occurs in 10% of cases.|$|E

The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks Greece among the top 30 countries with a highly developed information and communications infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, the {{eucalyptus}} only {{arrived at}} the turn of the 19th century and large scale plantations were started at the beginning of the 20th century with the aim of drying up swampy ground to defeat malaria. This, their rapid growth in the Italian climate and excellent function as windbreaks, has made them a common <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south of the country, including the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. They are also valued for the characteristic smelling and tasting honey that is produced from them. The variety of eucalyptus most commonly found in Italy is E. camaldulensis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people in}} the dress circle, {{familiar}} with the theatre, tried to avail themselves of the other exit leading into Flood's Alley, near the corner of Johnson Street. Patrons in the first rush down the stairs found the door locked; no usher was in <b>sight.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> brief time it took them {{to discover that the}} door was locked and return to the dress circle, the stage had become engulfed and they had no recourse but to attempt to work their way down the main dress circle stairs to the lobby, adding their numbers to the crush on those stairs. Fire Marshall Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.|$|E

25|$|The {{landscape}} is rocky moorland with a covering of coarse grass and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls {{and are not}} accessible to the public. There {{are a number of}} magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse – the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as yellowhammer, reed bunting, skylark and meadow pipit are a common <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open areas of the park. Deadly nightshade is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic's School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.|$|E
25|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1901 Spengler {{attended}} several universities (Munich, Berlin, and Halle) {{as a private}} scholar, taking courses {{in a wide range}} of subjects. His private studies were undirected. In 1903, he failed his doctoral thesis on Heraclitus (titled Der metaphysische Grundgedanke der Heraklitischen Philosophie, The Metaphysical Fundamental Thought in Heraclitean Philosophy, and conducted under the direction of Alois Riehl) because of insufficient references, which effectively ended his chances of an academic career. He eventually received his Ph.D. from Halle on 6 April 1904. In December 1904, he set to write the secondary dissertation (Staatsexamensarbeit) necessary to qualify as a high school teacher. This became The Development of the Organ of <b>Sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Higher Realms of the Animal Kingdom (Die Entwicklung des Sehorgans bei den Hauptstufen des Tierreiches). It was approved and he received his teaching certificate. In 1905 Spengler suffered a nervous breakdown.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's Law {{is relevant to}} the old conundrum known as Olbers' paradox: if the Universe were infinite, static, and filled with a uniform distribution of stars, then every line of <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as bright as {{the surface of a}} star. However, the night sky is largely dark. Since the 17th century, astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox, but the currently accepted resolution depends in part on the Big Bang theory and in part on the Hubble expansion. In a universe that exists for a finite amount of time, only the light of a finite number of stars has had a chance to reach us yet, and the paradox is resolved. Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects recede from us, which causes the light emanating from them to be redshifted and diminished in brightness.|$|E
50|$|Around 330 {{species of}} birds have been <b>sighted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, notably the Arabian bustard, black crowned crane, Abyssinian ground {{hornbill}} (Bucorvus abyssinicus), martial eagle, bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), and white-faced duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|R
