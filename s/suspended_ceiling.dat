5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and the fabric of the building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None of the ideas for developing the building came to fruition, and worship in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a private individual in 1987, but the plan to convert it into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E
25|$|The Exhibition Building is a two-storey, {{concrete}} block building, with steel framed windows with large panes of glass. The main entrance {{is located at}} the corner of Gregory Terrace and Costin Street. The ground floor is a large, open space with concrete floors and concrete piers supporting the concrete floor above. The first floor has a two-storey volume space and numerous skylights. The building has a <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> which houses a ducted air-conditioning system.|$|E
25|$|The church {{found the}} {{building}} needing more care and attention than its worshippers and {{they pulled out}} within a year. It was then bought by an Indian businessman, Jitu Rivall who refurbished it as a 498 seat cinema. It was decided that the pock-marked ceiling was beyond economic repair and a new <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> was fitted. The premises were also equipped with a new sound system and huge new screen, brought forward of the original proscenium. The cinema re-opened on 31 October 1997 as the New Curzon Cinema, screening Indian Bollywood films.|$|E

25|$|From {{the ground}} level {{entrance}} {{door on the}} western side of the tower, a spiral concrete staircase with steel tubular handrail winds around a central service duct before arriving in the near-centre of the observation room. Apart from an enclosed toilet in the north-west corner, the observation room is an open space with a central pillar that contains cavities for services that link to the roof level. Fixed angled glazing wraps around the north, east and south sides. A set of recent laminated cabinetry sits below the observation windows along the north-east. Original metal window frames on the western wall are a mixture of mid-point pivoting and fixed panes, while more recent aluminium-framed windows are found in the toilet. Floors are lined with linoleum and a system of <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> panels conceals the underside of the concrete roof slab. A recent sink and cupboard sits up against the southern wall of the toilet. All original communications equipment has been removed. Access to the external balcony, which wraps around all sides except the straight, western edge, is through a single door in the south-west corner. This timber door retains the original separate screen door. The narrow balcony has a concrete floor and a balustrade made from two tubular steel rails and widely separated balusters covered in asbestos cement sheeting rendered with pebble-dash on the exterior face. The steel balusters pierce the concrete floor slab and are fixed on the underside.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{after five}} years of reconstruction, the Rotes Rathaus was fully {{operational}} and departments were able to move back into it from both administration buildings and from other more remote locations. Early in the same year, it was announced that Altes Stadthaus was to be transferred from the Magistrat (now of East Berlin, West Berlin having established the separate Berlin Senate) to the Council of Ministers of the GDR, which had been established in 1949, to house the significantly increased workforce. Altes Stadthaus was planned to be only an interim solution to this problem. Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl moved his offices into the building later that year, after renovation work to create appropriate accommodations that included furnishings for various official rooms, the planned expansion onto the fourth floor, upgrading of the stairways, ventilation equipment, and electrical work had been completed. Red carpets were laid in hallways and stair landings, and eventually paper shredders were placed in all offices. Between 1958–61, the building was extensively altered. The inner courtyard was covered [...] and the [...] "Bear Hall" [...] was converted into the chamber of the Council of Ministers. The hall capacity was reduced from 1,500 to 300 people, the windows and arcades on the long sides were closed off, wood wall moldings and a <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> installed to create a modern room within the space. The candelabra, bronze door grilles, and marble flooring were removed. In 1959, the bear statue was also removed and installed in the newly opened East Berlin zoo in Friedrichsfelde. A security zone was created {{at the front of the}} building. The public entrance to what was now the [...] "Building of the Council of Ministers" [...] was now on Klosterstraße. The main entrance facing Jüdenstraße, over which the GDR national emblem, the hammer and compass, was installed in place of the arms of the City of Berlin, was only opened on special occasions. The alterations demonstrated the negative opinion in the GDR of Wilhelmine architecture, and cost 2million marks.|$|E

40|$|The {{building}} codes have prescriptive construction and installation requirements for <b>suspended</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Alternatively, ASCE-SEI 7 allows seismic qualification of nonstructural components by shake table testing. Such {{approach has been}} used extensively by the major manufacturers {{in recent years in}} the United States for the purpose of qualification of their products. The tests to date have followed mainly the protocol of ICC-ES AC- 156, developed for a wide array of nonstructural components. However, to date, {{there has not been a}} consensus on the specific test standard for <b>suspended</b> <b>ceilings</b> that is acceptable to the manufacturers, engineers, and evaluation authorities. Such standard must address the pertinent parameters specific to the <b>suspended</b> <b>ceilings</b> such as the regularly spaced attachment points at specimen top (vs. bottom for other components), provide test results that correlate with earthquake surveys, and are applicable for a wide range of building framing and footprints...|$|R
2500|$|In 1932 {{the cathedral}} nave was {{converted}} to a cinema, frivolously named New Star (in English, transliterated in Cyrillic) but soon renamed to more appropriate Maxim Gorky; in 1939 the cinema was upgraded to a House of the Officers (akin to a community center) of Kronshtadt garrison. During World War II it closed; the dome received three direct artillery hits. Post-war [...] "reconstruction" [...] of 1953—54 finally converted the cathedral to a functioning concert hall. This time, the builders added a <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> that isolated the nave from the dome; it remained in place as of end of 2007. Reduction of military personnel in the 1960s made the concert hall redundant; in 1980 the cathedral reopened as {{a branch of the}} Central Museum of Navy.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 August 2008, 10% of {{the ceiling}} of the plenary chamber {{collapsed}}.

A first part {{of the ceiling}} collapsed at 18.00 CET followed by a second part at 22.36 CET. No extreme weather conditions were reported and the structure was new, so it was assumed that the false ceiling had a defect. The President's office stated that a third of the ceiling had been affected and that [...] "The preliminary results have revealed that the partial collapse of the ceiling resulted from the breakage of parts holding the <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> that connects it with the actual structure of the ceiling." ...|$|E

The ship was caught in [...] waves and a [...] {{apparent}} wind. Passengers were advised {{to stay in their}} cabins, as the rocking of the ship overturned furniture and caused damage in public areas and cabins, including collapsing part of a <b>suspended</b> <b>ceiling</b> and rendering one of the ship's two azipod propulsion units inoperable. Royal Caribbean reported that only four passengers suffered minor injuries, but many aboard the ship told a different story. One man described the storm as [...] "The scariest, most horrible experience of my life." [...] The ship resumed sailing on the 8 February, returning to port in the New York area to avoid further bad weather that had been forecast. Passengers were refunded their full cruise fare, and received a credit for 50% of their fare toward a future cruise within the next year.|$|E
