40|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> in {{football}} are less common than lower limb injuries, but {{are often more}} serious than many other injuries and result in a longer time off play. No study has looked at the types of injuries and their interventions in professional footballers thus far. The aim was to review the serious <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> sustained in professional football {{over a period of}} four competitive seasons. Anonymous data was collected on all <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> claimed for from all English Premiership Football teams over four seasons. This data only applied to injuries that were claimed on health insurance from professional football clubs in the United Kingdom. It excluded minor injuries that did not require investigations or interventional treatment. There were 40 466 injury claims of which 3. 3 % were <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> (1335). This was equivalent to an average of 445 serious <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> per year. The percentage of <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> (injuries per year / total <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries)</b> increased from 35 % in the 2006 – 2007 season to 89 % in the 2009 – 2010 season. There was also a steady {{increase in the number of}} MRI scans and injections, but not with MR arthrograms. There was an increase in the number of surgical interventions during the same time period. The vast majority of surgical procedures were arthroscopic stabilisations (26 %) and labral repairs (23 %). Stabilisations increased from 15 % in 07 – 08 to 39 % in 09 – 10 whereas the percentage of labral repairs has remained unchanged throughout. The incidences of significant <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> and surgery have increased in professional football. The majority of the surgery has been labral and stabilisation surgery. Further investigation is required to examine the causes for these trends and possible injury reduction...|$|R

5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>injury,</b> for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>injury,</b> and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E

40|$|Background: Handball is a {{physical}} contact sport that includes frequent overhead throwing, and this combination leads to {{a high rate of}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries.</b> Several factors have been associated with <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> in overhead athletes, but strong scientific evidence is lacking for most suggested risk factors. We therefore designed the Karolinska Handball Study (KHAST) with the aim to identify risk factors for <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> in adolescent male and female elite handball players studying at handball-profiled secondary schools in Sweden. Secondary objectives are to investigate whether shoulder function changes during the competition season and whether the physical profile of the players changes during their time in secondary school. Methods: Players aged 15 to 19 years were included during the pre-season period of the 2014 - 2015 and the 2015 - 2016 seasons. At inclusion, players signed informed consent and filled in a questionnaire regarding playing position, playing level, previous handball experience, history of shoulder problems and athletic identity. Players also completed a detailed test battery at baseline evaluating the shoulder, neck and trunk. Players were then prospectively monitored weekly during the 2014 - 2015 and/or 2015 - 2016 competitive seasons regarding injuries and training/match workload. Results from the annual routine physical tests in the secondary school curriculum including bench press, deep squat, hand grip strength, clean lifts, squat jumps, counter movement jumps, amp;lt; 30 m sprints, chins, dips and Coopers test will be collected {{until the end of the}} competitive season 2017 - 2018. The primary outcome is the incidence of <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> and <b>shoulder</b> problems. The secondary outcome is the prevalence of <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> and <b>shoulder</b> problems. Discussion: Shoulder problems are frequent among handball players and a reduction of these injuries is therefore warranted. However, in order to introduce appropriate preventive measures, a detailed understanding of the underlying risk factors is needed. Our study has a high potential to identify important risk factors for <b>shoulder</b> <b>injuries</b> in adolescent elite handball players owing to a large study sample, a high response rate, data collection during consecutive seasons, and recording of potential confounding factors.
