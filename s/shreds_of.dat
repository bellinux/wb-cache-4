5|$|Kanafeh, a {{well-known}} dessert in the Arab World and Turkey. Made of several fine <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center, {{the top layer}} of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Nablus, to the present day is famed for its kanafeh, partly due to its use of a white-brined cheese called Nabulsi after the city. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.|$|E
5|$|Juan Pablo Montoya {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race {{was marked by}} an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> carbon fibre and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions {{at the end of}} the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya extended a considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher. Montoya lost the lead on lap 24 when an issue with a refulling rig caused him to be stationary for more than 20 seconds. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead and held it to win his third victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar {{is used as a}} syrup for kanafeh.|$|E

5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines {{takes place}} in four areas of 21st-century Los Angeles: Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown. Set in the World of Darkness, the game depicts {{a world in which}} vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to {{maintain}} their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> humanity). The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.|$|E

Boy Scout, Cliff Elliot, stirs the pot as he tries to cling to the last <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> patriotism and earn his Eagle Scout Award.

25|$|Many {{standard}} {{shop and}} woodworking tools {{may be used}} in the process of creating or maintaining deadwood on bonsai. Pliers are used to grip and break off branches for jin, and are also useful for ripping off strips of bark for jin or shari. Manual tools like graving chisels, burins, and blades can carve detail into the surface of the jins or shari, since real or simulated woodgrain is an important characteristic of deadwood on a bonsai. Recent years have seen bonsai practitioners adopt powered tools for deadwood work, particularly small rotary tools for carving and grinding. When shaping is completed, a gas torch burns off remaining small <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> wood fiber and helps raise the grain in a newly exposed piece of wood. Finally, wire brushes and sanding aids remove toolmarks and simulate weathering.|$|E
25|$|The first bishop {{appointed}} to Saint Thomas of Mylapur on {{the conclusion of}} the new concordat was the princely Dom Henrique José Reed da Silva, who was at the time coadjutor to the Archbishop of Goa, and who took possession of his see in 1886. He was the first to sign himself for the sake of brevity, Bishop of Mylapur, a practice which his successors have adopted. Hence the diocese became better known in India as the Diocese of Mylapur. His was the arduous task of putting the broken <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> the old historic diocese together and rendering it once again the thing of beauty it was. His first care was to reform the diocesan seminary, and in order to have an efficient body of European priests with their heart in their work, he brought out a number of young boys from Portugal and gave them a collegiate course in English, in the college to which he had raised the existing high-school, previous to their entering upon their ecclesiastical course of studies. His successors reaped the benefit of his policy. He opened a convent of European nuns at Saint Thomas, and another of Indian nuns in Mylapur, which have since thrown out branches into various parts of the diocese. He invited English-speaking priests to join his diocese (a call to which the present writer responded) and established the Catholic Register, a weekly newspaper. His courtly manners and noble bearing made him a favourite in society. Soon the people felt it an honour to point to him as their bishop. He pulled down the old cathedral, the chapel over the grave of St. Thomas and the old Augustinian priory, that had nothing antique to commend them, and built a magnificent cathedral in the centre of which, between the nave and chancel, lies the grave of St. Thomas. Despite the good he was accomplishing, he incurred the ill-will of certain parties connected with the churches situated in other dioceses, and when he found the accusations brought against him accepted without demur in Europe, he resigned and retired to Portugal, as titular Bishop of Trajanopolis.|$|E

500|$|The hope {{of finding}} these lost papers led Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka of the U.S. Army to organise an {{expedition}} to the island between 1878 and 1880. Traveling to Hudson Bay on the schooner Eothen, Schwatka, assembling a team that included Inuit who had assisted Hall, continued north by foot and dog sled, interviewing Inuit, visiting known or likely sites of Franklin expedition remains, and wintering on King William Island. Though Schwatka failed to find the hoped-for papers, in a speech at a dinner given in his honour by the American Geographical Society in 1880, he noted that his expedition had made [...] "the longest sledge journey ever made both in regard to time and distance" [...] of 11 months and 4 days and , {{that it was the}} first Arctic expedition on which the whites relied entirely on the same diet as the Inuit, and that it established the loss of the Franklin records [...] "beyond all reasonable doubt". The Schwatka expedition found no remnants of the expedition south of a place known as Starvation Cove on the Adelaide Peninsula. This was well north of Crozier's stated goal, the Back River, and several hundred miles away from the nearest Western outpost, on the Great Slave Lake. Woodman wrote of Inuit reports that between 1852 and 1858 Crozier and one other expedition member were seen in the Baker Lake area, about [...] to the south, where in 1948 Farley Mowat found [...] "a very ancient cairn, not of normal Eskimo construction" [...] inside which were <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> a hardwood box with dovetail joints.|$|E

The Home Secretary had on a number of occasions told the House of Commons that grinding bone was work of too penal a nature to be carried out by workhouse inmates, and the Poor Law Commission would see that his wish that it should cease was acted upon.
