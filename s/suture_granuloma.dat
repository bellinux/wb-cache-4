40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{the prevalence of}} foreign body granulomas in intra-abdominal adhesions in patients {{with a history of}} abdominal surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional, multicenter, multinational study, adult patients with a history of one or more previous abdominal operations and scheduled for laparotomy between 1991 and 1993 were examined during surgery. Patients in whom adhesions were present were selected for study. Quantity, distribution, and quality of adhesions were scored, and adhesion samples were taken for histologic examination. RESULTS: In 448 studied patients, the adhesions were most frequently attached to the omentum (68 %) and the small bowel (67 %). The amount of adhesions was significantly smaller in patients with a history of only one minor operation or one major operation, compared with those with multiple laparotomies (p < 0. 001). Significantly more adhesions were found in patients with a history of adhesions at previous laparotomy (p < 0. 001), with presence of abdominal abscess, hematoma, and intestinal leakage as complications after former surgery (p = 0. 01, p = 0. 002, and p < 0. 001, respectively), and with a history of an unoperated inflammatory process (p = 0. 04). Granulomas were found in 26 % of all patients. <b>Suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> were found in 25 % of the patients. Starch granulomas were present in 5 % of the operated patients whose surgeons wore starch-containing gloves. When <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> were present, the median interval between the present and the most recent previous laparotomy was 13 months. When <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> were absent, this interval was significantly longer [...] i. e., 30 months (p = 0. 002). The percentage of patients with <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> decreased gradually from 37 % if the previous laparotomy had occurred up to 6 months before the present operation, to 18 % if the previous laparotomy had occurred more than 2 years ago (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The number of adhesions found at laparotomy was significantly larger in patients with a history of multiple laparotomies, unoperated intra-abdominal inflammatory disease, and previous postoperative intra-abdominal complications, and when adhesions were already present at previous laparotomy. In recent adhesions, <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> occurred in a large percentage. This suggests that the intra-abdominal presence of foreign material is an important cause of adhesion formation. Therefore intra-abdominal contamination with foreign material should be minimized...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} one surgeon's practice {{was conducted to}} assess the prevalence of wound complications associated with acute and chronic rupture repair, peritenolysis, tenodesis, debridement, retrocalcaneal exostectomy/bursectomy, and management of calcific tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon. METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of infection and other wound complications, such as suture reactions, scar revision, hematoma, incisional neuromas, and granuloma formation. RESULTS: A total of 219 surgical cases were available for review (140 males and 70 females; mean +/- SD age {{at the time of}} surgery, 46. 5 +/- 12. 6 years; age range, 16 - 75 years). Seven patients experienced a wound infection, three had keloid formation, six had <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas,</b> and six had suture abscesses, for a total complication rate of 10. 0 %. Six patients had more than one complication; therefore, the percentage of patients with complications was 7. 3 %. There were no hematomas. Seven patients had additional surgery after their wound complications; some had simple granuloma excision, and one necessitated a flap. Patients with risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, smoking, and rheumatoid arthritis necessitating corticosteroid therapy {{were more likely to have}} a wound complication (Fisher exact test, P =. 03).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{cosmetic}} outcome, pain and tenderness around the operation scar of {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} surgery using either nylon, polyglactin 910 or stainless steel sutures for skin closure. METHODS: A randomised clinical trial comparing nylon, polyglactin 910 or stainless steel sutures for skin closure in 61 patients undergoing carpal tunnel syndrome surgery was performed. Pain, tenderness, scar hypertrophy, redness {{and the presence of}} granulomas were assessed in all patients at ten days and six weeks after surgery and compared by non-parametric statistical tests. RESULTS: Adequate surgical decompression of the median nerve could be achieved in all patients. All but two patients experienced significant relief of tingling of the fingers. Nearly all patients reported some degree of discomfort around the scar. At ten days, the mean pain score was 1. 7 (+/- 2. 2), 3. 1 (+/- 2. 3) and 1. 9 (+/- 2. 3) for the nylon, vicryl and steel groups, respectively. At six weeks, the pain score was 3. 6 (+/- 3. 1), 3. 4 (+/- 2. 6) and 2. 7 (+/- 2. 1) for the nylon, vicryl and steel groups, respectively. The infection rate was 0 %, 8 % and 0 % for the nylon, vicryl and steel groups, respectively. <b>Suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> were significantly more present in the vicryl group (p< 0. 05). There were no statistical differences in redness or hypertrophy of the wound between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nylon and stainless steel sutures are both suitable for skin closure after carpal tunnel surgery.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Suture</b> <b>granuloma</b> {{is a rare}} {{benign tumor}} caused by suture material, which usually appears several months or years after surgery. Presentation of case: A 71 -year-old man {{underwent}} sigmoidectomy and partial hepatectomy (S 6) for sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis at a previous hospital. At 4 postoperative months, surveillance computed tomography (CT) revealed a suspicious tumor at the hepatic resection stump. He was referred to our hospital for further examinations and treatments. Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) revealed abnormal hepatic F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake below the diaphragm at the S 5 /S 8 surface. Peritoneal metastasis was suspected and surgery was performed. White nodules {{were found in the}} Douglas pouch. A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed by frozen section analysis of the nodules. He underwent a partial hepatectomy (S 5 /S 8) and partial resection of the diaphragm. Pathological examination showed that the liver tumor was a foreign body granuloma that included silk suture material. Discussion: Although postoperative PET/CT surveillance is useful following malignant tumor resection, {{it is important to note}} that PET/CT false-positive findings are possible. Furthermore, PET/CT cannot detect small peritoneal metastases, necessitating a thorough abdominal examination. Conclusion: In cases of malignancy, the possibility of postoperative <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma</b> should be considered. In addition, a thorough surgical examination of the abdomen should be performed in cases of suspected recurrence...|$|E

The search found records of 42 silicone granulomas, 37 fat necrosis, 20 idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, 14 <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas,</b> 1 Corynebacterium, 1 Mycobacterium fortuitum infection, 2 sarcoidosis and 1 Sjögren’s syndrome. Additionally, nine cases of granulomatous lymphadenitis where found: six of which were secondary to granulomatous causes involving the breast (for example, silicone granuloma), one was idiopathic and one patient was diagnosed with cat-scratch disease.|$|R
30|$|Most common {{causes of}} granulomatous lesions {{of the breast}} and axilla {{included}} silicone granulomas 33 % (n[*]=[*] 42), fat necrosis 29 % (n[*]=[*] 37) and <b>suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> 11 % (n[*]=[*] 14).

Other granulomatous aetiologies included granulomatous infections, sarcoidosis and Sjögren’s syndrome. Causes of axillary granulomatous disease were similar to the breast; however, a case of cat-scratch disease was found that only involved the axillary lymph nodes. They can have a variable appearance on imaging and may mimic malignancy with irregular masses seen on mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Fistulas to the skin and nipple retraction can suggest chronicity and a granulomatous aetiology. Combination of clinical history, laboratory and imaging findings can be diagnostic.|$|R

40|$|Metastatic {{recurrence}} in {{the abdominal}} wall surgical scar is not uncommon. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate the role of ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis of metastatic recurrence along the surgical scar. We evaluated 17 nodules in the surgical scar, either single (n= 9 patients) or multiple (n= 2 patients), in 11 patients operated on for known abdominal neoplasm confirmed by histology. The most common primary tumour was colonic carcinoma. All patients had undergone open surgery, and the lesions were detected at routine follow-up or at diagnostic examinations performed for clinical suspicion of recurrence. Ultrasonography (7. 5 - 10 / 10 - 13 MHz) and fine needle biopsy were performed in all cases; contrast-enhanced CT {{was carried out in}} 10 patients. All lesions underwent histopathological examination. The histological findings showed 16 / 17 metastatic nodules and one <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma.</b> Lesions had variable size (15 - 55 mm), roundish shape, ill-defined margins (60 % cases) and hypoechoic solid echotexture. All were characterised by marked contrast medium uptake on CT examination. US-guided aspiration biopsy precisely defined the metastatic nature of the nodules in 16 / 17 cases. In the patient with <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma,</b> both CT and US findings suggested malignancy; however, cytology showed only scant fibrous material. The anterior abdominal wall was the most common site of metastatic disease (14 lesions). US enables an accurate detection and diagnosis of metastatic nodules along the surgical scar.

40|$|Classical {{abdominal}} surgeries usually require long incisions of {{the abdominal}} integuments followed by tight closure with adequate suturing material. Nonabsorbable sutures may cause various reactions, including granuloma reactions, both sterile and inflammatory. The {{aim of the}} study was to analyze prospective ultrasound examinations of the abdominal integuments in order to detect tissue reactions to surgical sutures. Material and methods: For 10 years, ultrasound examinations of the abdominal integuments involved the assessment of surgical scars in all patients who underwent open or closed surgeries for various reasons (in total 2254 patients). Ultrasound examinations were performed only with the use of linear probes with the frequency ranging from 7 to 12  MHz. Each scar in the abdominal integuments was scanned in at least two planes. When a lesion was detected, the image was enlarged and the transducer was rotated by approximately 180 ° in order to capture the dimensions of the granuloma and the most characteristic image of the suture. Moreover, vascularization of the lesion was also assessed with the use of color Doppler mode set to detect the lowest flows. Results: All granulomas (19  lesions, two in one patient) created hypoechoic oval or round nodules, were relatively well-circumscribed and their size ranged from 8 × 4 mm to 40 × 14 mm. In the center of the lesion, it was possible to notice a thread that was coiled to various degrees and presented itself as a double, curved hyperechoic line. In  9  out of 19 granulomas, slight peripheral vascularization was observed. The substantial majority of the lesions (n = 15) were in contact with the fascia. In seven patients, compression with the transducer induced known local pain (n = 4) or intensified pain that had already been present (n = 3); all of these granulomas infiltrated the fascia and showed slight peripheral vascularization. Cutaneous fistulae developed in two patients with purulent reactions to the running stitch (in one patient – two fistulae). Conclusions: <b>Suture</b> <b>granulomas</b> in the abdominal integuments manifest themselves as nodular hypoechoic lesions, usually localized at the edge of the fascia – subcutaneous fat. A pathognomonic sign of this type of granulomas is the presence of a thread in their center that usually manifests itself as a chaotically shaped, double hyperechoic line. In some granulomas, particularly those with clinical presentation, slight peripheral vascularization is observed...|$|R

METHODS: Under laparoscopic visualization through a single umbilical port, an 18 -gauge epidural needle was inserted {{at the point}} of the internal ring. The orifice of the hernia defect was obliterated extraperitoneally by a non-absorbable suture that was introduced and withdrawn through the epidural needle around the internal ring using the hydrodissection-lasso technique. RESULTS: A total of 251 inguinal repairs were performed by LASSO in 207 children. 163 patients had unilateral inguinal hernia repairs and 44 patients underwent repair of bilateral inguinal hernias.

Complications occurred in 5 patients and comprised intraoperative migration (1), type I endoleak (1), type II endoleak (1), ischemic myelopathy (1), pneumonia (2), <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma</b> (1) and common femoral artery dissection (1). Conclusions: stent-grafting can be successfully employed to treat {{a wide range of}} thoracic aortic pathologies with a mortality, morbidity and resource utilization that is considerably less than that associated with conventional surgery. However, long term follow-up on safety and efficacy is needed. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 25, 532 - 539 (2003...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSuture {{granuloma}} {{is a rare}} {{benign tumor}} caused by suture material, which usually appears several months or years after surgery. Presentation of caseA 71 -year-old man underwent sigmoidectomy and partial hepatectomy (S 6) for sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis at a previous hospital. At 4 postoperative months, surveillance computed tomography (CT) revealed a suspicious tumor at the hepatic resection stump. He was referred to our hospital for further examinations and treatments. Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) revealed abnormal hepatic F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake below the diaphragm at the S 5 /S 8 surface. Peritoneal metastasis was suspected and surgery was performed. White nodules {{were found in the}} Douglas pouch. A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed by frozen section analysis of the nodules. He underwent a partial hepatectomy (S 5 /S 8) and partial resection of the diaphragm. Pathological examination showed that the liver tumor was a foreign body granuloma that included silk suture material. DiscussionAlthough postoperative PET/CT surveillance is useful following malignant tumor resection, {{it is important to note}} that PET/CT false-positive findings are possible. Furthermore, PET/CT cannot detect small peritoneal metastases, necessitating a thorough abdominal examination. ConclusionIn cases of malignancy, the possibility of postoperative <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma</b> should be considered. In addition, a thorough surgical examination of the abdomen should be performed in cases of suspected recurrence...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} “Postcholecystectomy Syndrome” {{may be due}} {{to various}} pathological biliary causes. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the significance of the cystic duct stump syndrome and if so, how often a long (> 1. 5 cm) cystic duct stump was an indication for reoperation on the bile ducts after cholecystectomy in our patients. Three hundred and twenty two patients underwent a second operation on the bile ducts after cholecystectomy in the last ten years. In 35 patients (10. 8 %) a striking finding was a long cystic duct stump (> 1. 5 cm). In 24 of these patients, a pathological finding, in addition to the long cystic duct stump, was found on exploration. Out of these 24 patients there were 14 with common bile duct stones; 6 with stenosis of the sphincter of Oddi; 3 with chronic pancreatitis and in one patient hepatitis was the cause of the symptoms. From the remaining 11 patients 8 had a stone in a partial gall bladder or cystic duct stump. One patient had a fistula between the cystic duct stump and duodenum and one a <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma.</b> There was only one patient where a 1. 5 cm long cystic duct stump remnant was the only pathological finding. Four years after reoperation this patient is still suffering from the same intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms. We conclude that the cystic duct stump is hardly ever a cause for recurrent symptoms in itself. Total excision of the cystic duct does not eliminate the existence of postcholecystectomy symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Background: New {{surgical}} {{techniques are}} developed to enable a quicker, easier and safer surgery with reduced risk of complications and shortened time needed for recovery. A resorbable device, a self-locking loop, {{was designed for}} surgical ligation. The objective of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} the feasibility of ligating the spermatic cord with the device, its biocompatibility and long-term resorption in dogs.   Results: The device was made of a block co-polymer (glycolide and trimethylene carbonate), manufactured by injection moulding and consisted of a flexible band running through a case with a locking mechanism. Ten devices were tested for ligation of the spermatic cords in five dogs admitted for routine neutering. The dogs were monitored by physical examination and ultrasonography of the site of ligation, area of spermatic cord and medial iliac lymph nodes regularly until no hyperechoic remnants of the device or acoustic shadowing or local tissue reactions were observed. Haemostasis of the spermatic cords was achieved with the devices. On ultrasonography the devices were seen as hyperechoic structures for 2 months after neutering causing acoustic shadowing for 1 month. The dogs were monitored for 3 - 5 months after surgery. Gradual decrease in echogenicity and final disappearance of the hyperechoic structures suggested resorption. Macroscopic and histological post mortem examinations were performed in one dog at 3 months after surgery. Post mortem examination showed a tissue reaction of a <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma</b> that was restricted in extent at site of the device.   Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest biocompatibility and indicate that ligation of the spermatic cord is feasible with the device...|$|E
40|$|Living related donor (LRD) nephrectomies are {{controversial}} due to {{the risks}} to the donor and improved cadaveric graft survival using cyclosporine A. Between December 22, 1970, and December 31, 1984, 1096 renal transplants were performed at a single institution, 314 (28. 6 %) from LRD. The average age was 34. 3 years (range: 18 - 67); none had preoperative hypertension. All nephrectomies were performed transabdominally. Major perioperative complications occurred in 22 (7. 0 %). These include wound infections (3. 5 %), pancreatitis (1. 0 %), injuries to spleen (1. 0 %) or adrenal gland (0. 3 %) requiring removal, pneumonitis (0. 6 %), ulnar nerve palsy (0. 6 %), femoral artery thrombosis after arteriogram (0. 3 %), pulmonary embolus (0. 3 %), and upper pole infarct of contralateral kidney (0. 3 %). There are six known deaths in this series, none of which {{were related to the}} operation. Major late complications were seen in 50 (20. 0 %) of 250 patients followed for 6 to 175 months (mean 53. 1 months). These included definite hypertension (5. 6 %), <b>suture</b> <b>granuloma</b> (4. 4 %), incisional hernia (3. 6 %), proteinuria (2. 4 %), bowel obstruction (2. 0 %), nephrolithiasis (1. 2 %), wound infection (0. 4 %), scrotal hydrocele (0. 4 %), and chronic pancreatitis (0. 4 %). While the risk of hypertension appears to increase as the interval from donation increases, no cases of renal failure after donation have been noted, and negligible proteinuria among those followed long-term has been seen in this series. It is felt that living related kidney donation is justified when the relative is sincerely motivated and well informed prior to donation...|$|E
