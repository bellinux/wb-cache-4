Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a <b>special</b> <b>allowance</b> for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology. Months before she won the Nobel Prize, she was promoted to full professor, a post she held until her death in 1957.|$|E
5|$|As at 31 December 2010, the {{remuneration}} of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a <b>special</b> <b>allowance</b> of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since {{there was no one to}} assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} as prime minister, average living {{standards}} steadily rose while numerous social reforms were carried out. The 1956 Clean Air Act was passed during {{his time as}} Chancellor; his premiership saw the 1957 Housing Act, the 1960 Offices Act, the 1960 Noise Abatement Act, the Factories Act 1961, {{the introduction of a}} graduated pension scheme to provide an additional income to retirers, the establishment of a Child's <b>Special</b> <b>Allowance</b> for the orphaned children of divorced parents, and a reduction in the standard work week from 48 to 42 hours.|$|E
500|$|On 21 May 2011, {{following}} the 2011 general election, the Prime Minister {{announced that a}} committee would be appointed to review politicians' remuneration, and that revised salaries would take effect from that date. The Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries chaired by Gerard Ee rendered its report on 30 December 2011, and released {{it to the public}} on 4 January 2012. As regards ministerial pay, the Committee recommended benchmarking an MR4-grade minister's salary to the median income of the top 1,000 wage earners who are Singapore citizens, with a 40% discount [...] "to signify the sacrifice that comes with the ethos of political service". It also recommended removing the <b>special</b> <b>allowance</b> and public service leadership allowance; capping performance bonuses at six months' salary (with good performers generally receiving three months' salary); and replacing the GDP bonus with a national bonus based on four equally weighted indicators: the real median income growth rate (that is, the growth rate taking inflation into account), the real growth rate of the incomes of the lowest 20th percentile earners, the unemployment rate, and the real GDP growth rate. As regards the latter, no bonus will be paid if the minimum targets for the indicators are not met. A bonus of three months' salary will be paid if the targets are met, and a maximum bonus of six months' salary if the targets are greatly exceeded. This would result in a reduction of an M4-grade minister's annual salary by 31% of the 2010 figure to $1.1 million.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, the Armed Forces Vocational Schools and the Vocational Advancement Organization {{extended}} their {{services for the}} first time to conscripts, “so far as military duty permitted.” New enlistment bonuses were authorized and previous bonus schemes were improved, and new pay regulations were introduced that improved the financial situation of military personnel and civil servants. In July 1973, the 3rd Amendment to the Civilian Service Act came into force; “a prerequisite for the creation of additional civilian service places for recognized conscientious objectors.” The amendment provided that men recognized as conscientious objectors while performing military service should immediately be transferred to a civilian service assignment. The maximum amount for servicemen enlisting for at least 12 years was increased from DM 6,000 to DM 9,000, and from October 1971 onwards, long-term personnel were paid grants towards the cost ‘of attending educational institutes of the “second educational route" [...] or participating in state-recognized general education courses provided by private correspondence schools and the “television college."' In 1972, two Bundeswehr universities were established; a reform which, according to one historian, “fought against the closed nature of the military and guaranteed that officers would be better able to successfully interact with the civilian world.” From April 1973, the general maintenance payments under the Law amending the Maintenance Security Act and the Workplace Protection Act were increased, while increases were also made in the <b>special</b> <b>allowance</b> (Christmas bonus) for conscripts, together with the dismissal allowance. The expense allowance for troops on duty-related absence from place of employment was improved, together with travel subsidies and provisions for military service damaged soldiers and their families. In addition, the position of non-commissioned officers was improved.|$|E
