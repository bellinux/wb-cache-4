40|$|AbstractThe {{interest}} for investment with “green” outcomes is increasing worldwide. Its driver {{could be considered}} the more and more appealing environmental discourse, but also the development of various economic mechanisms which facilitate the reduction of transaction costs and the emergence of new market opportunities. <b>Some</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> reached the volume and rate of return that respect the conditions of large institutional investors. Such funds are related to forestry, depending on two important and increasing markets: certified wood products and carbon certificates. Other “green” investment opportunities are biodiversity credits, ecotourism payments, and renewable energy. Supporting natural ecosystems is not new in environmental protection. Nevertheless, looking to this from a business perspective is a recent development resulting from the increased importance given to environmental economics and how it creates an appropriate framework for more effective and prompt action toward the preservation of life supporting systems of the Earth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During {{the last}} three decades, the European Union (EU) {{commitment}} towards the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) market penetration has been very complex, involving several aspects pertaining to {{the economic and political}} action of Member States.

The delicate matter of State aid is discussed, paying particular attention to the transition from 1999 to the recent EU Guidelines (2014 / 2020), as these wider scopes could lead to an effective and well functioning European Energy Single Market. Focusing the attention on three case-studies, we have produced final remarks on the correct functioning of the EU political framework, giving attention to important improvements needed at infrastructural level. The EU awareness of the power grid limits, that are currently recorded in Europe has lead to further reforms of the legislation, as shown by the new EU Guidelines that will probably support Member States in dealing with the infrastructure challenge...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MComm (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The study {{addresses}} {{foreign investment}} in China’s fund–management industry, with {{a detailed analysis of}} the opportunities and challenges that foreign investors may face. With the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001, foreign investors have been allowed to hold up to 33 % of a joint fund-management firm, which has increased to 49 % from the end of 2004. As a trendy <b>investment</b> tool, <b>investment</b> <b>funds,</b> and particularly mutual funds, have expanded significantly especially as regards market size and economic importance in developed economies. This study starts with an introduction to the <b>investment</b> <b>fund,</b> which includes types of <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> and the advantages of mutual funds. Then, the history of China’s fund-management industry is described to give a brief picture of this nascent industry. In order to justify the promising future for {{foreign investment in}} China’s fund-management industry, the study first analyses the sustainability of China’s economic growth, which is driven by some favourable aspects such as the gradual development of an economic structure, continued FDI inflow and WTO membership. Another two specific factors that may be favourable for the fund-management industry in this regard, namely pension fund reform and increased income, are also discussed. Foreign investors in China’s fund-management industry are also exposed to <b>some</b> challenges. For <b>investment</b> <b>funds,</b> the main platform is the financial markets, which means that the development of the fund-management industry is tied closely {{to the development of the}} financial markets. In the case of China, the financial markets are still developing and have not grown into efficient capital allocation mechanisms due to the restricted involvement of foreign participants and substantial government intervention. However, this study only focuses on major opportunities and challenges associated with foreign investment in China’s fund-management industry. A detailed analysis of each of various relevant aspects can be conducted in a future study, as well as a pertinent survey...|$|R
40|$|Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is an {{alternative}} means of investment in the capital market and absolutely prospective for the public. But, {{for the last three}} years its activity is more dominated by the rapid growth and development of the so-called open-end collective investment agreement than the closed-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> taking the form of limited liability company, particularly among the Investment Manager as players in the capital market. On the other side, Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is also purported to be a collective investment means which is favouring domestic investors, particularly small and medium investors that need both certainty and protection of their investment. What is reflected is that there are some legal aspects in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> activity, mostly on the side of the Investment Manager as a company providing management service for securities portfolio or investment of its customers. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on these legal aspects to reveal the reasons why [...] particularly among the Investment Manager [...] open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> is more developed than its closed-end counterpart. It is also necessary to conduct research on the institutional character and the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> as a business construction, the control of the government over the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to ensure protection of the public investors interest, and the system of responsibility of the Investment Manager to the investors in Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund.</b> In order to identify and to understand the above mentioned problems, this descriptive-analytical research is performed through juridical-normative and sociological approach by focusing on secondary data which is supported by primary data. Data of this research is gathered from BAPEPAM, <b>some</b> <b>Investment</b> Managers, <b>some</b> Representatives of <b>Investment</b> Manager, APEI (Indonesian Association of Securities Companies), and PIPM Semarang. In gathering data, the techniques employed in this research are document analysis, questionaire, and interview. Next, qualitative analysis is applied to the data gathered. The facts of the field resarch reveal that the growth and development of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> in Indonesia is more influenced by the role and participation of the Investment Managers rather than by the degree of knowledge and understanding on the side of public investors, as may be seen from the fact that the development in the open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> which is not necessarily corelated to the preference of public investors to choose Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> product. Legal obstacles that make closed-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is less-developed than open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> among the <b>Investment</b> Managers are in fact closely related to the legal procedure of establishment, flexibility in management, support from the government [...] particularly in term of taxation, and the marketability of the product of open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> As a business stucture, the characteristic of the institution and activity of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> lies more on its purpose to protect the interest of public investors in investment portfolio than on the juridical structure of company organization. Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> institution in the form of limited liability company is cathegories as 'PT Terbuka' with specialities in the capital structure, the system/structure in managing the company's assets and the rights of the share-holders. Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> in the formof collective investment contrat basically falls within the cathegory of business entities which are established by a particular contract containing legal relationship of providing service in management and depository of collective investment assets for the interest of investors as a single unit. In term of activity, both kind of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> share the same goals in giving investment benefit (economical rights) coming from securities portfolio, [...] which is managed by the Investment Manager [...] , in a diversified way to the beneficiary, that is the share holders/participation unit holders in a particular form influenced by the purposes character of the formation of securities portfolio of the relevant Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> The control of BAPEPAM over the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to protect public investors is hampered by the purpose and interest on the government's part in stimulating the development of the quantity of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> industry. Consequently, the control is more focused on fostering Investment Manager as reflected from the whistleblowing nature of the legal sanctions, from the compliance request, and the from the refusal to approve the request of dismissing Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> by <b>Investment</b> Manager on the ground that Investment Manager is expected to participate in developing trust in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> The reponsibility system of Investment Manager as the manager of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to the investor can be cathegorized as fiduciary duties, based on either the law or the management contract. As a consequence of the representative nature of the duties given, the authority of the Investment Manager is restrictied by good-faith in the transaction of the fund and the securities as the investment portfolio of the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> There is also a mechanism in settling the transaction of the securities which falls within the authority and responsibility of the Custodian Bank so that interest of the investors is more protected. Although there is a principle that Investment Manager should be responsible for any damage caused by his mistake or negligence, the customer bears the investment risk on the reason that the action is within the boundary of the good-faith principle in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> Any dispute emerging from investment loss tend to be settled out of the court, that is by the Investment Manager's explanation to the investors, by the Investment Manager's compliance with BAPEPAM's rule and by the acceptance of the administrative sanction delivered by BAPEPAM. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{intends to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> in emerging markets by looking at the performance of multimarket funds in Brazil from a manager perspective. The aim of the paper was to analyze whether <b>some</b> characteristics of <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> managers, as well as their portfolio holdings, can affect fund performance. In emerging countries both portfolio asset allocation and manager characteristics can help explain differences in the fund performance, which increases the relevance of this study. Therefore, the impact of this research lies in its revealing a significant relationship between risk-adjusted return and the portion of portfolios allocated to fixed or variable income, which seems that have not been explored in the context of emerging economies yet. A total of 6, 002 multimarket funds were analyzed, covering the period between September 2009 and December 2015, using panel data with robust standard errors clustered by funds. We also employed robust statistics in order to assess some potential biases due to outliers, by analyzing the breakdown point in the estimated models. It should be noted that portfolio composition (allocation of portfolios into variable income and fixed income) was {{the most important factor in}} explaining a potential change in the performance of Brazilian multimarket funds. Also important were the effectiveness of the management of these funds, that is, the best risk-adjusted returns were delivered by less experienced managers, funds investing more in fixed income, managers with more funds under management, and larger funds...|$|R
