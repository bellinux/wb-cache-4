5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} <b>scoreboard</b> was a black, non-descript, rectangular {{unit with}} a two line reader panel. In 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole {{to make room for}} a new rectangular 4-line <b>scoreboard</b> 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town <b>scoreboard,</b> displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original <b>scoreboard</b> was removed and replaced by the second <b>scoreboard,</b> which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town <b>scoreboard</b> was not used to display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.|$|E
5|$|One of Greer Stadium's most {{distinctive}} features was its guitar-shaped <b>scoreboard.</b> After First Tennessee Park was approved, the team {{announced it would}} not be relocating the original Greer <b>scoreboard,</b> which was technologically outdated and difficult to maintain, to the new stadium. While plans for First Tennessee Park's <b>scoreboard</b> were initially undisclosed, following overwhelming support for Greer's guitar from the community, the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped <b>scoreboard</b> for the new ballpark. The new guitar <b>scoreboard,</b> paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with Panasonic, and was installed beyond the right-center field wall on the concourse.|$|E
5|$|During the 1908â€“1909 offseasons, Joss {{worked on}} {{designing}} an electric <b>scoreboard</b> {{that would later}} {{be known as the}} Joss Indicator. The Naps decided to install the <b>scoreboard,</b> which allowed spectators to monitor balls and strikes at League Park.|$|E
50|$|Sportable <b>Scoreboards</b> is an American {{manufacturer}} of electronic <b>scoreboards,</b> based in Murray, Kentucky. Founded in 1986 by Mike Cowen, Sportable <b>Scoreboards</b> is a family-owned company that grew from a {{manufacturer of}} portable <b>scoreboards</b> {{to one of the}} nation's major manufacturers of permanent electronic <b>scoreboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|In about 2000 Fair Play updated {{its product}} lines, with all <b>scoreboards</b> being {{equipped}} with LEDs (or Light-emitting diodes) in them. Now Fair Play's indoor <b>scoreboards</b> have a bar LED display, while the outdoor <b>scoreboards</b> have individual LED clusters.|$|R
50|$|Wrestling <b>scoreboards</b> will {{display the}} team scores, the current match time, the match score, {{and the weight}} class. Some <b>scoreboards</b> may also display riding time.|$|R
5|$|As a result, {{the mayor}} of Richmond granted the pair {{the freedom of the}} city. The <b>scoreboard</b> at Punt Road Oval, Richmond's home ground was named the Ring-Johnston <b>scoreboard</b> in honour of their feat. Johnston took match figures of 3/55 in the Fifth Test as Australia {{completed}} the series with a win. Johnston ended the season by taking a total of 7/86 in Victoria's innings win over South Australia. He ended the entire first-class season with 54 wickets at 20.63.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football <b>scoreboard,</b> {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large <b>scoreboard</b> featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured {{at each end of}} the field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the move to Triple-A, renovations {{continued}} prior to the 1985 season {{with the addition of}} 1,200box seats, which replaced some of the reserved grandstand seating, as well as more seating past the right field foul pole. A 4-line <b>scoreboard</b> 10 feet (3.0m) high replaced the stadium's original, which was relocated to far left field to serve as an out-of-town <b>scoreboard,</b> providing scores for American League, National League, and American Association baseball games.|$|E
50|$|Fair Play also {{manufactures}} multipurpose <b>scoreboards</b> (i.e., {{suitable for}} two or more sports, such as football and baseball), as well as portable <b>scoreboards</b> and timing devices.|$|R
50|$|Several {{character}} generators allowing {{scores and}} statistics {{to be shown}} on screen. The <b>scoreboards</b> used in most sports facilities {{can be linked to}} the truck to drive the television production's graphics as well as the arena <b>scoreboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|By volume, Electro-Mech {{manufactures}} more baseball <b>scoreboards</b> {{than any}} other sports category. Basketball {{is the second most}} popular sport by volume and football the third. Soccer, hockey, and a handful of specialty <b>scoreboards</b> round out the main product line.|$|R
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped <b>scoreboard.</b> The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the <b>scoreboard.</b> These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E
5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, <b>scoreboard,</b> sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar <b>scoreboard</b> were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{announced}} its 14-game non-conference schedule on August 1, 2011. The team began {{the season in}} a renovated Crisler Arena: new seats and a high-definition <b>scoreboard</b> were added, but seating capacity was reduced to 12,721 from 13,751 in the previous 10 seasons.|$|E
50|$|In October 1930, Michigan Stadium {{became the}} first to use {{electronic}} <b>scoreboards.</b> The electronic <b>scoreboards,</b> installed at both ends, were controlled from a switchboard in the press box and displayed the score, downs, yards to go, and other information on a current basis.|$|R
50|$|A {{video board}} {{is located on}} the south wall with home and visiting team <b>scoreboards</b> on either side showing the player's game information. There are two <b>scoreboards</b> on the north side and ribbon boards above the {{concession}} stands on the east and west sides.|$|R
50|$|The stadium got a {{substantial}} upgrade in 2014 {{with the addition}} of new <b>scoreboards,</b> pools, cabana seating and premium seating that includes 180 field-level seats. The <b>scoreboards</b> are 60 feet high and 362 feet long. The new <b>scoreboards</b> at EverBank Field are now the world's largest video boards. Two 25 feet by 12 feet pools were installed in the north and south end zones along with the cabana seating. The stadium upgrades were $63 million that owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million of the total cost.|$|R
5|$|On January 12, 2010, McCoy became {{engaged to}} his girlfriend, Rachel Glandorf, a former middle-distance {{track and field}} athlete for Baylor University, by proposing on the video <b>scoreboard</b> at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin. Their {{marriage}} took place on July 17, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the <b>scoreboard</b> featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium <b>scoreboard</b> has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire <b>scoreboard</b> would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the <b>scoreboard</b> had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the <b>scoreboard,</b> rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{typically}} seen by viewers, the set {{also includes a}} used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play, a <b>scoreboard</b> that is visible from the contestants' perspective, and a countdown clock. The used letter board is also used during the bonus round, and {{in at least one}} case, helped the contestant to see unused letters to solve a difficult puzzle.|$|E
25|$|New <b>scoreboards</b> {{were built}} under both superscreens.|$|R
5000|$|New <b>scoreboards</b> are erected at each home {{ground by}} the VFL's publication, The Football Record. With {{the help of}} a key {{published}} in that Saturday afternoon's Record, spectators can decipher the coded quarter-by-quarter scores of the other three matches as they appear on these <b>scoreboards</b> throughout the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|Fair Play {{recently}} bought American Sign and Indicator <b>scoreboards.</b>|$|R
5|$|McKinney Creek Stadium {{was built}} to host all of the {{cross-country}} races, which included the biathlon and {{a portion of the}} Nordic combined competition. It consisted of a timing building, two Quonset huts for competitors and course workers, a <b>scoreboard,</b> and bleachers to accommodate 1,200 people. Shooting ranges were interspersed throughout the biathlon course, and were supervised by non-commissioned officers of the United States military.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the 2016 season, the next phase of renovations was completed, which {{included}} the addition of a new club area behind home plate for season ticket holders, the installation of a new <b>scoreboard</b> system and additional scoreboards, new standing room areas in the left field area, and additional concession areas, again using local-based eateries.|$|E
5|$|The Master Ninja Tournaments were {{a series}} of three online {{contests}} held by Microsoft and Tecmo in 2004. They took place over Xbox Live, and were open to participants in Europe, Japan, and North America. Winner selection was based on the scores achieved through playing Ninja Gaiden or its Hurricane Packs. Players had 14 to 24 days to complete the required games and submit their scores to an online <b>scoreboard.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 2009 female {{players were}} {{referred}} to by the title [...] "Miss" [...] or [...] "Mrs" [...] on <b>scoreboards.</b> As dictated by strict rule of etiquette, married female players are referred to by their husbands' names: for example, Chris Evert appeared on <b>scoreboards</b> as [...] "Mrs. J. M. Lloyd" [...] during her marriage to John Lloyd, since [...] "Mrs. X" [...] essentially designates the wife of X. This tradition has continued {{at least to some}} extent. For the first time during the 2009 tournament, players {{were referred to}} on <b>scoreboards</b> by both their first and last names.|$|R
50|$|Team {{names are}} those used on CBSsports.com <b>scoreboards</b> and team pages.|$|R
5|$|The {{difference}} in the game came from special teams and turnovers. Virginia Tech turned the ball over three times, while Kansas turned the ball over just once. Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving the Jayhawks an enormous advantage on the <b>scoreboard.</b> Virginia Tech failed to convert its sole turnover recovery into any points.|$|E
5|$|The entire <b>scoreboard</b> {{measures}} 115.6feet (35.2m) across, 53feet (16m) high, and 2feet (0.61m) deep. Individual {{components of}} the guitar are as follows: 60-foot (18m) body, 36-foot (11m) neck, and 19.6-foot (6.0m) tuning key section. It is installed approximately 80feet (24m) above the ground. It takes 243,155watts to power its 8,179total lamps, which are connected to 64,169feet (19,559m) of wire. The entire display weighs 35,825pounds (16,250kg).|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} best {{recognized}} by its distinctive guitar-shaped <b>scoreboard,</b> which displays the line score across the neck. It {{has been the}} site of three minor league all-star games, eight no-hit games, including one perfect game, and a 24-inning game which tied {{the record for the}} longest game in PCL history.|$|E
50|$|Electro-Mech {{was created}} {{with a single}} purpose in mind: to {{manufacture}} <b>scoreboards.</b> Over the years the company has dabbled {{in a variety of}} other activities ranging from building wiring sub-assemblies used in cherry picker lifts to Christmas tree farming. The core business of <b>scoreboards</b> has remained the company's primary focus and primary source of revenue.|$|R
