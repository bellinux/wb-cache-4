5|$|<b>Skeleton</b> {{is one of}} the Olympic sport {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games. It {{was introduced}} at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz – the birthplace of <b>skeleton</b> – {{in the form of a}} men's event contested over four runs. Dropped from the 1932 and 1936 Winter Olympics program, <b>skeleton</b> returned in 1948, when St. Moritz hosted again the Winter Olympics, but was discarded from the following Games in Oslo. After 54 years of absence from the Olympic program, <b>skeleton</b> was reinstated as an official medal sport at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, featuring individual events for men and women.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{extraction}} of consistent <b>skeletons</b> {{in the presence}} of boundary noise is still a problem for most skeletonization algorithms. Many suppress <b>skeletons</b> associated with boundary perturbation, either by preventing their formation or removing them subsequently using additional operations. A more appropriate approach is to view a shape as comprising of structural and textural <b>skeletons.</b> The former describes the general structure of the shape and the latter its boundary characteristics. These two types of <b>skeletons</b> should be encouraged to remaining disconnected to facilitate gross shape matching without the need for branch pruning. Such <b>skeletons</b> can be formed by means of a multiresolution gradient vector field (MGVF), which can be generated efficiently using a pyramidal framework. The robust scale-invariant {{extraction of}} the <b>skeletons</b> from the MGVF is described. Experimental results show that the MGVF structural <b>skeletons</b> are less affected by boundary noise compared to <b>skeletons</b> extract by other popular iterative and non-iterative techniques. ...|$|R

5|$|Barnum Brown {{recovered}} the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a nearly complete <b>skeleton</b> (AMNH 5220). Now {{on display in}} the American Museum of Natural History, this <b>skeleton</b> was the first nearly complete dinosaur <b>skeleton</b> from Canada. It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted little time in describing his material, giving it its own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, as seen in the names of Prosaurolophus ("before Saurolophus") and Parasaurolophus ("near Saurolophus"). However, little additional material has been recovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial <b>skeleton</b> of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this <b>skeleton</b> Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial <b>skeleton</b> in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E
50|$|In April 2015, four {{complete}} human <b>skeletons</b> were excavated from mound RGR-7. These <b>skeletons</b> {{belonged to}} two male adults, one female adult and one child. Pottery with grains of food {{as well as}} shell bangles were found around these <b>skeletons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Proceeding {{further into}} the excavation, the team began to reveal a 2nd level of burials. This level {{contained}} twelve <b>skeletons</b> that were accompanied by thousands of grave goods. The primary occupants of the grave, <b>skeletons</b> 15 and 16, were located {{in the center of}} this level with five <b>skeletons</b> on the pair’s east side, three on the west and single <b>skeletons</b> on the north and south ends.|$|R
50|$|During the works; two <b>skeletons</b> were found; that of {{an adult}} and that of a child. The <b>skeletons</b> were {{originally}} estimated to be between 400 and 500 years old. Soon, three more part <b>skeletons</b> {{were expected to be}} excavated; but eventually, within a 15m sq area; 40 <b>skeletons</b> were found, around 50% were children. The <b>skeletons</b> were taken to Guernsey by a team led by Philip de Jersey, then were returned to Herm for burial. The earliest bones dated were from {{the second half of the}} 10th century.|$|R
5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the <b>skeleton,</b> 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the <b>skeleton</b> and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the <b>skeleton</b> adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E
5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the <b>skeleton</b> of a single individual, {{including}} numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of the arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the <b>skeleton</b> was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the <b>skeleton,</b> Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{challenging}} problem of algorithm and program {{design for the}} Computational Grid by providing the application user {{with a set of}} high-level, parameterized components called <b>skeletons.</b> We describe a Java-based Grid programming system in which algorithms are composed of <b>skeletons</b> and the computational resources for executing individual <b>skeletons</b> are chosen using performance prediction. The advantage of our approach is that <b>skeletons</b> are reusable for dierent applications and that skeletons' implementations can be tuned to particular machines. The focus of this paper is on predicting performance for Grid applications constructed using <b>skeletons...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Roebuck, {{there is}} a {{historical}} plaque located on County Road 21 which honours {{the site of an}} Iroquoian village. This plaque also marks the site of a 500-year-old burial ground which was excavated in the 20th century. In total, 120 <b>skeletons</b> were excavated from the site; 85 of the <b>skeletons</b> belonging to Iroquoian villagers, and 35 of the <b>skeletons,</b> which were buried further away from the others, were from outsiders. When the remains were studied, it was determined the first set of 85 <b>skeletons</b> were villagers, due to the fact the <b>skeletons</b> were relatively intact, and nicely buried; some <b>skeletons</b> were even buried in pairs. The group of 35 <b>skeletons</b> was determined to be the bones of captives or enemies of the tribe, with only a slight possibility of the remains being those of Iroquoian people. This conclusion was made after archaeologists ruled at least 31 of the 34 <b>skeletons</b> recovered belonged to young men; in contrast to the former group of remains which contained a mixed demographic in regards to age and gender. The latter group of 35 <b>skeletons</b> were also found disarticulated or fragmented; and many proven to be victims of cannibalism.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the <b>skeleton</b> based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying <b>skeleton.</b> Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum <b>skeleton</b> from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we develop a framework, based on strand spaces, for {{reasoning}} about cryptographic protocols and characterizing their executions.
