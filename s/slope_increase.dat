Further, statistical analysis shown, soil bulk density was significant (P[*]<[*]. 05) affected with slope position. The lowest bulk density was recorded at gentle slope (1.03  g cm− 3) and highest at steep slope (1.19  g cm− 3). The change in soil bulk density along slope position was attributed to soil organic carbon and clay fraction. This coincides with Hailu et al.

For this purpose a simulation code is developed, solving the Poisson equation on the entire device coupled self-consistently with the drift-diffusion transport equation. We show that the charges trapped at grain boundaries in the high-permittivity (high-kappa) layer induce 2 -D potential fluctuations in the structure, {{not only in the}} high-kappa layer, but also in the underlying oxide and semiconductor regions. These potential fluctuations are shown to significantly degrade the subthreshold behavior of the drain current.

We conclude that at Bullwinkle, pressure is reduced due to an underlying salt body and the bowl-shape of the basin. A geometric approach to predict sandstone pressure is to assume that the reservoir pressure equals the area-weighted average of the mudstone pressure.

When anchorages bear the prestressed force and bridge construction loads, the change of rock slope's displacement and anchoring force were studied comparatively by three dimensional numerical simulation, which were carried on in two conditions, one is the prestressed cable group arranged with equal length while the other is quincunx.

For any value of the barrier strength, measured by the length l_es, nucleation of islands on terraces is always able to destroy asymptotically step-flow growth. The breakdown of the metastable step-flow occurs through the formation of a mound of critical width proportional to L_c= 1 /sqrt(l_es), the length associated to the linear instability of a high-symmetry surface. The time required for the destabilization grows exponentially with L_c. Thermal detachment from steps or islands, or a steeper <b>slope</b> <b>increase</b> the instability time but do not modify the above picture, nor change L_c significantly. Standard continuum theories cannot be used to evaluate the activation energy of the critical mound and the instability time. The dynamics of a mound can be described as a one dimensional random walk for its height k: attaining the critical height (i. e. the critical size) means that the probability to grow (k->k+ 1) becomes larger than the probability for the mound to shrink (k->k- 1). Thermal detachment induces correlations in the random walk, otherwise absent. Comment: 10 pages. Minor changes. Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

Each polymer is essentially different in its structure, and the variables {{used in the}} present Study are comonomer size and content in the main linear backbone polymer. The polymers were characterized initially using GPC, DSC, FTIR, and tensile tests. Later, at different time intervals, samples were removed from the oven and characterized using FTIR and GPC in order to detect changes in chemical structure, size, and molecular weight distribution due to thermo-oxidative aging. At the end of aging, films were subjected to tensile tests to quantify the effect of time on their useful life. As a qualitative reference parameter, the carbonyl index, the ratio of the infrared absorbance of the CO stretching band at 1715 cm(- 1) and the absorbance of a reference band at 718 cm(- 1), was determined.

The analytical contents include the displacement and acceleration of supporting slope, {{as well as the}} time history responses of the axial forces of anchors. In the establishment of finite element model, the interaction between soil body and supporting structure is considered. The elastic-plastic M-C model with nonlinear static and dynamic behavior is used to simulate the soil body, and the dual linear strengthen model is adopted to simulate the supporting structure, then the interaction between soil body and supporting structure is simulated with contact element. The results show that the composite soil nailing slope supporting structure has better seismic performance than the general soil nailing slope supporting structure. The maximum horizontal displacement of the latter occurs at the slope top, but that of the former occurs at the slope upper. Especially after the imposition of the prestress, the slope displacement under earthquake reduces significantly, and the axial forces of anchors under earthquake enlarge significantly. Moreover, the axial forces of anchors reach maximum values near the slipping surface. The displacement and the acceleration of <b>slope</b> <b>increase</b> along the slope height.

The horizontal (inclined) forces exerted {{on the road}} surface are greatly increased due to traffic accelerating (uphill) and braking (downhill). These forces will cause horizontal creep of the blocks down the slope, resulting in opening of joints {{at the top of}} the road section. The objective of this study was investigate the effect of parameters include degree of slope, laying pattern, joint width, and thickness of paving block on the performance of CBP on slopes. A laboratory-scale test was used to study these parameters based on steel frame horizontal force and push in tests. Three different laying pattern (stretcher bond, herringbone 90 o and herringbone 45 o) and joint width (3 mm, 5 mm and 7 mm) were used in the test program. The pavement responses are characterized in terms of horizontal creep and deflection due to applied load for half of an allowable single axle limit. The results indicate that herringbone 45 o laying pattern and 3 mm joint width performed best on slopes section.
