During operation, the telescope {{is aimed at}} target stars in the semihemisphere away from the Earth's Sun. The observatory rotates about its pointing axis during a single star observation, resulting in relative movement of the Sun. The sunshade assembly protects the telescope against excessive solar-induced thermal distortions for times long enough to complete observations. The assembly includes a cylindrical baffle immediately surrounding the telescope, {{and a series of}} coaxial conical shields at half-cone angle increments of between 3 and 6. The black inner surface of the cylindrical baffle suppresses stray light. The outer surface of the cylindrical baffle and all the surfaces of the conical shields except the outermost one are specular and highly reflective in the infrared. The outer surface of the outer shield is a material with low solar absorptance and high infrared emittance, such as silverized Teflon or white paint. This arrangement strongly radiatively couples each shield layer more effectively to cold space than to adjacent shield layers. The result is that the solar-driven temperature gradients in the cylindrical baffle are nearly negated, and only weakly communicated to the highly-infrared-reflective face of the primary telescope mirror...|$|E

40|$|High {{precision}} photometry from a <b>spaceborne</b> <b>telescope</b> has {{the potential}} of discovering sub-earth sized inner planets. Model calculations by Wetherill indicate that Mars-sized planets can be expected to form throughout the range of orbits from that of Mercury to Mars. While a transit of an Earth-sized planet causes a 0. 084 % decrease in brightness from a solar-like star, a transit of a planet as small as Mars causes a flux decrease of only 0. 023 %. Stellar variability will be the limiting factor for transit measurements. Recent analysis of solar variability from the SOLSTICE experiment shows that much of the variability is in the UV at < 400 nm. Combining this result with the total flux variability measured by the ACRIM- 1 photometer implies that the Sun has relative amplitude variations of about 0. 0007 % in the 17 - 69 pHz bandpass and is presumably typical for solar-like stars. Tests were conducted at Lick Observatory to determine the photometric precision of CCD detectors in the 17 - 69 pHz bandpass. With frame-by-frame corrections of the image centroids it was found that a precision of 0. 001 % could be readily achieved, corresponding to a signal to noise ratio of 1. 4, provided the telescope aperture was sufficient to keep the statistical noise below 0. 0006 %. With 24 transits a planet as small as Mars should be reliably detectable.

40|$|Abstract. With {{well over}} a hundred Jupiter-class planets now discovered, {{speculation}} on the abundance of Earth-like planets in the cosmos will soon give way to efforts to detect and characterize them. The formation of terrestrial planets—rocky bodies like Earth, Venus, and Mars—appears to be a natural consequence of {{the rapid growth of}} lunar- to Mars sized “embryos ” after the disruptive era of giant planet formation. Then, gravitational perturbations by Jupiter-mass planets may elongate the orbits of the embryos, causing the bodies to collide and grow. Architectures not too dissimilar to our own inner solar system may be obtained after roughly 100 million years, for a giant planet in the region around 5 AU or so from a Sun-like star. Discovery of terrestrial planets will likely come first from <b>spaceborne</b> <b>telescopes</b> that sense the dimming of starlight as planets pass directly in front of their parent stars (“transit”), or for distant planetary systems, via the so-called microlensing technique. To discover habitable planets will require direct detection of the light of the planet, so that spectra may be taken to identify atmospheric carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and oxygen. Such an undertaking will require large telescopic systems deployed in space. 1...|$|R
40|$|The cosmic {{deuterium}} to hydrogen (D/H) {{ratio is}} of key importance from a cosmological and stellar evolution perspective since deuterium originates from big-bang nucleosynthesis and is destroyed by stellar thermonuclear reactions. Further, from the interstellar perspective, the galactic distribution of deuterium and the D/H ratio among various molecular species also traces interstellar chemical evolution. Over {{the past few}} decades, radio observations have enabled the study {{of a handful of}} small, deuterated interstellar species. However, the number of deuterated species detected and environments probed are limited, raising issues of selection effects that hamper generalization and applications to other environments. Infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar medium offers a distinct advantage in this regard as the extent of deuteration of entire chemical families, rather than one species, can be probed. These observations require <b>spaceborne</b> <b>telescopes</b> because the molecular vibrations involving D which produce the strongest IR bands fall in spectral regions which are obscured by terrestrial CO 2 absorption. Here we report the tentative detection of the C-D stretching vibration from deuterated interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Orion nebula.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spectral appearance of Earth-like exoplanets in the HZ of different main sequence stars at different orbital distances. We furthermore discuss for {{which of these}} scenarios biomarker absorption bands may be detected during primary or secondary transit with near-future telescopes and instruments. We analyze the spectra taking into account different filter bandpasses of two photometric instruments planned to be mounted to the JWST. We analyze in which filters and for which scenarios molecular absorption bands are detectable when using the space-borne JWST or the ground-based telescope E-ELT. Absorption bands of CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4 and O 3 are clearly visible in high-resolution spectra {{as well as in}} the filters of photometric instruments. However, only during primary eclipse bands of CO 2, H 2 O and O 3 are detectable for all scenarios when using photometric instruments and an E-ELT telescope setup. CH 4 is only detectable at the outer HZ of the K star since here the atmospheric modeling results in very high abundances. Since the detectable CO 2 and H 2 O bands overlap, separate bands need to be observed to prove their existence in the atmosphere. In order to detect H 2 O in a separate band, a S/N> 7 needs to be achieved for E-ELT observations, e. g. by co-adding at least 10 transit observations. Using a <b>spaceborne</b> <b>telescope</b> like the JWST enables the detection of CO 2 at 4. 3 mu, which is not possible for ground-based observations due to the Earth's atmospheric absorption. Hence combining observations of spaceborne and groundbased telescopes might allow to detect the presence of the biomarker molecule O 3 and the related compounds H 2 O and CO 2 in a planetary atmosphere. Other absorption bands using the JWST can only be detected for much higher S/Ns, which is not achievable by just co-adding transit observations since this would be far beyond the planned mission time of JWST.

40|$|This work explores {{remote sensing}} of {{planetary}} atmospheres and their circumstellar surroundings. The terrestrial ionosphere {{is a highly}} variable space plasma embedded in the thermosphere. Generated by solar radiation and predominantly composed of oxygen ions at high altitudes, the ionosphere is dynamically and chemically coupled to the neutral atmosphere. Variations in ionospheric plasma density impact radio astronomy and communications. Inverting observations of 83. 4 nm photons resonantly scattered by singly ionized oxygen holds promise for remotely sensing the ionospheric plasma density. This hypothesis was tested by comparing 83. 4 nm limb profiles recorded by the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System aboard the International Space Station to a forward model driven by coincident plasma densities measured independently via ground-based incoherent scatter radar. A comparison study of two separate radar overflights with different limb profile morphologies found agreement between the forward model and measured limb profiles. A new implementation of Chapman parameter retrieval via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques quantifies the precision of the plasma densities inferred from 83. 4 nm emission profiles. This first study demonstrates the utility of 83. 4 nm emission for ionospheric remote sensing. Future visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy will characterize the composition of exoplanet atmospheres; therefore, the second study advances technologies for the direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets. Such spectroscopy requires {{the development of new}} technologies to separate relatively dim exoplanet light from parent star light. High-contrast observations at short wavelengths require <b>spaceborne</b> <b>telescopes</b> to circumvent atmospheric aberrations. The Planet Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Rocket Experiment (PICTURE) team designed a suborbital sounding rocket payload to demonstrate visible light high-contrast imaging with a visible nulling coronagraph. Laboratory operations of the PICTURE coronagraph achieved the high-contrast imaging sensitivity necessary to test for the predicted warm circumstellar belt around Epsilon Eridani. Interferometric wavefront measurements of calibration target Beta Orionis recorded during the second test flight in November 2015 demonstrate the first active wavefront sensing with a piezoelectric mirror stage and activation of a micromachine deformable mirror in space.
