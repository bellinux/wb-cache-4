40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest in using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to study and monitor glaciers and ice sheets for glaciological and climate change research. SAR is a powerful remote sensing tool due to its high spatial resolution and wide coverage, and its ability to penetrate beneath the ice's surface to observe sub-surface structures. However, SAR backscattering from ice and the inversion of geophysical parameters from SAR ice data remain poorly understood. The relative importance of scattering from the air/snow and snow/ice interfaces, from internal layers and structures in the firn, as well as the dependence of the land ice radar signatures on frequency and glacier facie, is unclear. Few models address the interferometric coherence as an observable, and the greatest focus to date has been on modelling single-polarisation backscattering coefficients. This paper augments the use of SAR backscattering coefficients with polarisation and baseline diversity (Polarimetric Interferometric SAR or Pol-InSAR) to provide additional information on the underlying glacial structure and more thorough validation criteria for evaluating the applicability of electromagnetic models. The backscatter and interferometric coherence from the ice is modelled as a coherent sum of slightly rough annual layers as well as volume <b>scattering</b> <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> between the layers. Validation is performed using a unique Pol-InSAR data set acquired over the Nordaustlandet sheet in Svalbard, Norway. The data were collected using DLR's airborne E-SAR (Experimental SAR) system as part of the SVALEX (April 2005) and ICESAR (March/April 2007) campaigns. Fully-polarised multi-baseline data at L- (1. 3 GHz) and P-band (0. 35 GHz) frequencies and single-pass VV data at X-band (9. 6 GHz) were obtained. For calibration purposes and to determine the penetration of the radar signals, corner reflectors and an approximately 200 -m-long wire were deployed directly {{on the surface of the}} ice. Backscatter and coherence at different frequencies and thus different depths of penetration, and at different polarisations and thus potentially different scattering mechanisms, are examined as a function of incidence angle, spatial baseline, and temporal baseline (a two year temporal baseline is available). Modelled results are compared with the quad-pol observed backscatter and complex coherences, providing insight on the electromagnetic interaction between the radar signal and the polythermal ice. The use of interferometry and surface reflectors enables measurement of the phase centre depth of the penetrating radar signal. Electromagnetic modelling of longer-wavelength Pol-InSAR observables over glaciers and ice sheets has relevance for future spaceborne SAR concepts. Potential satellite missions including a P-band sounder and the BIOMASS earth observation proposal would benefit from an increased understanding of long-wavelength SAR observables over land ice...|$|E

Experimental data was {{gathered in the}} form of <b>scattering</b> patterns <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> analogue <b>crystals</b> with similar optical properties and hexagonal symmetry to ice, yet stable at room temperature. A laboratory rig is described which images <b>scattering</b> patterns <b>from</b> single particles while allowing precise control over the orientation of the particle with respect to the incident beam. Images of scattering patterns were captured and compared to patterns from modelled crystals with similar geometry. Methods for introducing particles en-masse and individually to the Small Ice Detector (SID) instruments are discussed, with particular emphasis on the calibration of the gain of the SID- 2 instrument. The variation in gain between detector elements is found to be significant, variable {{over the life of the}} detector, and different for different detectors. Fitting was performed by comparison of test scattering patterns (either modelled or experimental) to the reference database. Representation of the two dimensional scattering patterns by asymmetry factor, moment invariants, azimuthal intensity patterns (AIP) and the Fourier transform of the AIP are compared for fitting accuracy. Direct comparison of the AIP is found to be the most accurate method. Increased resolution of the AIP is shown to improve the fitting substantially. Case studies are presented for the fitting of two <b>ice</b> analogue <b>crystals</b> to the modelled database. Fitting accuracy is found to be negatively influenced by small amounts of surface roughness and detail not currently considered by the RTDF model. Fitting of in-situ data gathered by the SID- 3 instrument during the HALO 02 campaign at the AIDA cloud chamber in Germany is presented and discussed. Saturation of detector pixels is shown to affect pattern fitting. In-flight operation of the instrument involves the variation of gain of the whole detector (as opposed to individual elements) in order to obtain unsaturated images of both large and small particles.

The interaction of spherical particles on the radiative budget are well known, however mineral dusts and <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> are generally non-spherical leading to large uncertainties in the radiative impacts of these particles. In addition, atmospheric dust {{has the ability}} to act as an Ice Nuclei (IN) aiding in the formation of <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> in the atmosphere through four well known nucleation mechanisms. The work presented here discusses new instrumentation and methods to measure and identify both the optical scattering properties and ice nucleation properties of atmospherically relevant dusts. The Texas A&M University Continuous Flow Diffusion Chamber (CFDC) was constructed and characterized in the laboratory using a known effective IN, silver iodide. This instrument was then deployed in the Arctic as part of the Indirect Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC) where it measured the concentration of potential IN under atmospheric conditions. The results of which, showed the Arctic has higher particle concentrations during the spring compared to data collected in the fall during other field projects. In addition, extreme nucleation events were observed with average IN concentrations as high as 100 L^(- 1). The optical scattering properties of atmospherically relevant dusts were measured using a prototype instrument, the Cloud Aerosol Spectrometer with Polarization (CASPOL) under laboratory conditions. The data collected using this instrument allowed the classification of 13 atmospherically relevant dusts into 3 distinct groups based on the optical scattering properties.

It assumes that backscattered light <b>from</b> <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> is depolarizing, whereas water clouds, being spherical, result in minimal depolarization. However, because {{of the relationship between the}} CALIOP field of view (FOV) and the large distance between the satellite and clouds and because of the frequent presence of oriented <b>ice</b> <b>crystals,</b> there is often a weak correlation between measured depolarization and phase, which thereby creates significant uncertainties in the current CALIOP phase retrieval. For water clouds, the CALIOP-measured depolarization can be large because of multiple scattering, whereas horizontally oriented ice particles depolarize only weakly and behave similarly to water clouds. Because of the nonunique depolarization–cloud phase relationship, more constraints are necessary to uniquely determine cloud phase. Based on theoretical and modeling studies, an improved cloud phase de-termination algorithmhas been developed.

A new microphysical instrument, the Cloud Particle Spectrometer with Polarization Detection (CPSPD), has been developed that measures light intensity scattered (in forward and backward directions) by individual cloud particles that pass through a focused laser beam and derives their size and thermodynamic phase (liquid or ice) in the optical diameter range from 2 to 50 μm.

5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3.

Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.
