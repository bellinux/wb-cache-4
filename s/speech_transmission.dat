The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the practical implementation of the required Hilbert transform. It was recently shown that suitable overshoot compensation (so-called controlled-envelope single-sideband modulation or CESSB) achieves about 3.8dB of peak reduction for <b>speech</b> <b>transmission.</b> This results in an effective average power increase of about 140%.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper stochastically models a single-node telecommunications system both {{with and without}} the use of intelligent multiplexing. Intelligent multiplexers take advantage of the idle periods or silences that occur during the course of <b>speech</b> <b>transmissions</b> to merge (or multiplex) packetized talkspurts from more than one source onto a single channel. This allows for a more efficient use of available bandwidth, thereby reducing the amount of bandwidth required to carry a particular traffic load. Digitizing speech into packets of equal size also allows for compression, further reducing bandwidth needs. By comparing the models for systems both with and without multiplexing, we are able to determine the reduction in bandwidth which may be expected for a particular grade of service (measured by blocking probabilities). A bivariate continuous time Markov chain model for a multiplexer is presented. An approximation is introduced to calculate limiting blocking probabilities much more quickly and for larger systems than is possible by solving a set of linear equations for the bivariate model. The accuracy of the approximation is explored through comparison with the bivariate model; the approximation provides a somewhat conservative estimate of blocking, but is close enough {{to be used as a}} tool for the range of relevant values. The approximation is then used to compare blocking probabilities for three different levels of speech activity.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to real-time digital secure speech commu-nication is proposed based on the inversion theory of nonlin-ear discrete-time dynamical systems. The proposed approach uses an observable minimal-phase nonlinear discrete-time dynamical system, particularly with chaotic zero-dynamics, as the drive system to generate encrypted message signals for transmission. The receiver is the minimal left-inverse sys-tem of the drive system with the capability of synchroniza-tion. The receiver decrypts the received signal, recovers the original message in real-time. The effectiveness of the pro-posed approach and design is demonstrated via several ex-amples for secure <b>speech</b> signals <b>transmission.</b> Performance evaluation of the designed secure communication system is discussed.

In this context, three main sources of distortion should be considered: acoustic environment, speech coding and trans-mission errors.

We have found out that band-pass filtering of the recognition features improves ASR performance when distortions due to these particular communication systems are present. Furthermore, we have evaluated two alternative configurations at different Bit Error Rates (BER) typical of these channels: band-pass filtering the LP-MFCC parameters or a modification of the RASTA-PLP using a sharper low-pass section perform consistently better than LP-MFCC and RASTA-PLP, respectively.
