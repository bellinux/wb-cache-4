5|$|In 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an {{amplifier}} and a three-cord pickup electric guitar. During {{a show in}} Helotes, Texas, Nelson {{left the}} guitar {{on the floor of}} the stage, and it was later <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> by a drunk man.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Florida, {{damage was}} mostly limited to moderate wind gusts; in Miami-Dade County, gusty winds knocked out several traffic lights along U.S. 1, the only route {{to and from}} the Florida Keys. A man died in Ft. Lauderdale when he <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> a downed electrical wire and was electrocuted. Also, 100,000homes in Miami Dade County were without electric power.|$|E
5|$|Smith's early musical {{influences}} {{were his}} mother, and his father, who played guitar. At {{the age of}} four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because he believed it would only direct Buster {{to a life of}} sin.|$|E

5|$|Traversing a {{crossroads}} at night was considered dangerous {{because it was}} the place and time of the ala’s supper; the unfortunate person who <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> an “ala’s table” could become blind, deaf, or lame. Ale gather at night on the eves of greater holidays, divert men from their ways into gullies, and torture them there by riding them like horses.|$|E
5|$|As {{their journey}} continues, SpongeBob and Patrick reach a {{dangerous}} trench, but a now-banished Mindy helps them past it {{by making them}} think she can turn them into men. They are stopped by Dennis, who tries to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> by a seemingly massive hardhat diver {{they believe to be}} a Cyclops. The diver grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5000|$|Another popular myth among Brown {{students}} is that bad luck will befall {{all those who}} <b>step</b> <b>on</b> the seal engraved in the stone steps leading to Pembroke Campus.

5|$|On October 11, 2009, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{played the}} Detroit Lions at Ford Field. Nearing {{the end of}} the fourth quarter the Steelers were up by 8 points and the Lions were marching down the field. At this time the Lions mascot Roary The Lion, <b>stepped</b> <b>on,</b> bit and ripped apart a Terrible Towel. Following this the Lions {{suffered}} three straight sacks to put them in a long fourth and twenty-eight situation. The Lions did not convert and the Steelers won the game 28-20.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis wasps {{frequently}} {{interact with}} humans {{because of their}} tendency to make their nests in backyards, gardens and sidewalks. Pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest in areas with little to no vegetation, usually ignore people, and females are not aggressive, tending to save their venom for their cicada prey, but will sting if they are grabbed or <b>stepped</b> <b>on.</b> Despite their large size, being the largest wasp to inhabit California, their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate. Males, while smaller, are naturally more aggressive and less tolerant of disturbance.|$|E

25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on mountain, hybrid, and touring bicycles with three chainrings. The relative <b>step</b> <b>on</b> the chainrings (say 25% to 35%) is typically around twice the relative <b>step</b> <b>on</b> the cogset (say 15%), e.g. chainrings 28-38-48 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} campaign, Edler {{improved to}} career-highs of 37 assists, first among team defensemen, and 42 points, second to Christian Ehrhoff. He missed six games near {{the midpoint of}} the campaign due to a left arm injury, sustained in December 2009. In the post-season, he added six points in 12 games as the Canucks lost again in the second round to the Blackhawks. Edler was injured in the sixth and deciding game of the series after opposing forward Dustin Byfuglien <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> his right ankle after hitting him along the boards. Requiring a walking cast for five weeks, he rehabilitated his ankle during the off-season.|$|E
5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When <b>stepped</b> <b>on,</b> the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which the door is open. Once the timer is active, the player must get to the door before the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} few {{accidents}} at Waterloo compared to other London terminal stations. On 21 August 1896, an engine leaving the locomotive yard overran its clearance point, colliding with a departing passenger train. Five passengers were injured. On 5 May 1904, a linesman accidentally <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> a signal wire. This gave a false clear signal to a goods van, which collided with a passenger train, killing one, while on 25 October 1913, a collision between two passenger trains at Waterloo Junction killed three people.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy to study the faceting of oriented <b>steps</b> <b>on</b> Si(001) and Ge(001) surfaces. The oriented <b>steps</b> <b>on</b> Si(001) tend to facet into local SA and SB step segments, whereas oriented <b>steps</b> <b>on</b> Ge(001) meander along the mean direction. We show that the step faceting behavior of the Si and Ge(001) surfaces is fully governed by the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction between the substrate dimers. Only {{in the case of}} a repulsive NNN interaction, as for Si(001), faceting occurs...|$|R
5|$|Well-executed {{evacuations}} and warnings {{limited the}} death toll to six, while damage amounted to $305.8million (1998USD, $409.8million 2009USD). In addition to the six human lives lost, 497 heads of cattle and 21,387 chickens were killed. All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges; the first death occurred when an 61-year-old woman <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> a downed wire and was electrocuted; the second occurred when a 56-year-old man drove over another downed wire on his motorcycle and was electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} players control the main protagonist, who can be named by the player. The environments within the Schwarzwelt are seen and navigated from a first-person perspective: the 3D environment is displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo DS, while a 2D map is displayed on the bottom screen. Explored environments are automatically mapped out, with highlights being placed for unopened containers and doorways. These environments contain traps including pits, shifting floors, and floor tiles which damage the protagonist if <b>stepped</b> <b>on.</b> Alongside the main story quests, human non-playable characters and demons within the Schwarzwelt unlock side quests which yielded rewards upon completion. During the game, the protagonist's Demonica suit can be upgraded to open new pathways, enabling entry into new areas for story progression, {{as well as new}} parts of previously explored areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a threat to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, <b>stepped</b> <b>on</b> and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be <b>Stepped</b> <b>On,</b> which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
