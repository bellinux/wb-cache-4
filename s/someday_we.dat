5000|$|The hatred between BYU and Utah {{is nothing}} {{compared}} to what it will be.

5000|$|Irvine takes a {{more modest}} stance and he proposes a program of “voluntary discomfort.” As he {{describes}} it: “By undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort - by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed - we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befell us in the future. If {{all we know is}} comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as <b>we</b> <b>someday</b> almost surely will.

40|$|How {{society will}} provide {{healthcare}} to its most vulnerable populations {{is a complex}} and difficult question that quality of life utilitarianism cannot resolve. The situation is further complicated by reflections on historic experience (i. e., Nazi Germany) and our own tendencies to devalue the neurologically vulnerable, the poor, and the genetically “impure. ” This paper reviews this issue practically and philosophically and concludes that {{the answer lies in}} the collective experience of western civilization that all human life must be intrinsically valued. On the basis of an experiential a priori: every individual is crowned with dignity. It all goes back to Aristotle. “All men are mortal ” is the major premise. “John is a man, ” is the minor premise. The conclusion is inescapable: “Therefore John is mortal. ” This paper is about that inevitability. As Pogo the philosopher (Kelly 1954) once put it, “We cannot be absolutely sure we are going to die, but we can be pretty damned sure. ” What then do we actually mean by saying that there is a special vulnerability of the sick that should drive our healthcare commitments? If, after all, we are all made of friable stuff and will be sick <b>someday,</b> then <b>we</b> are all equally vulnerable from the beginning. Birth and death are parentheses, setting off life’s bumpy ride from the silence at either end. The Vulnerability of Illnes...|$|R

5000|$|In summer 1962, Owsley and Lyon were {{exploring}} {{an abandoned}} silver mine, when they discovered the skeletal {{remains of a}} large horse. Fascinated, they raced home and returned with their red wagons to gather the bones {{and take them to}} their converted chicken coop lab on the Lyon property. They wanted to reassemble the bones and build the horse's skeleton, similar to the dinosaur skeletons they saw in their school's science films. Once all of the bones were transported to the [...] "lab", they spread the bones out and sorted them by size and shape. Over the summer, without the assistance of textbooks or diagrams, they spent their free time matching various bones that looked like they fit together, much like assembling a jigsaw puzzle.

40|$|Literature {{begins in}} the {{creative}} possibilities of human language and in the desire of human beings to use their language creatively. It means, language is the tool of human in creating literature. By studying literature students can learn many thing {{which can be found}} in literature, such as: human's ways of life, human's values, and human's culture. Besides that, literature also enriches our life because it increases our capacity for understanding and communication. Drama is the part of the literature that the writer is interested in. In studying drama, the writer feels that the interaction between the person in drama is more alive compare to the other forms of literature. Thus, he takes a character study because character is the one who plays the important role in a drama and also the one who brings the message of the play from the author to the readers or audiences. By conducting the a study on character analysis we can learn that a character or a person is a unique individual. Each of us has different personality and behaviour determine by environment, education, and society. Therefore by conducting an analysis on character we can enlarge our vision about life and human. In this study the writer takes Hendrik Ibsen's play, The Master Builder because the writer feels that this play is very interesting to be analyze. This play reflects about the reality of life that we all have to face <b>someday</b> when <b>we</b> gets old. The reality about the pressure that a man has to bare when he feels that he is not young anymore and the fear that his position will be taken over by the young generation. In conduction a character study on Hendrik Ibsen's The Master Builder the writer uses Little's point in analyzing the character, literary analysis and also contents analysis. Thus, the writer focuses his study on the characters found in the play especially the protagonist which finally comes to some interesting finding: I. Halvald Solness is a successful builder, he is considered as a lucky person in physical and material things but his fear to the youth and his unhappy married life have ruined all his life, every actions that he does reflect his fear. As a result, he lives in fearful and unhappy life because of his own fear. 2. Halvald Solness because of his own fear to the youth has created bad relationships with other people around him. He refuses to let Ragnar work independently. He has a negative thinking about Dr. Herdal concerning his sanity. He uses Kaja Fosli, his book-keeper in order to make her finance, Ragnar, works for him. He also betrays Aline, his wife, by having an affair with Hilde Wangel. 3. The theme of Hendrik Ibsen's The Master Builder is about the downfall of a man because of his own fear to the youth. And as the protagonist, Halvald Solness is able to embody the theme convincingly. He {{is a man who has}} feeling of fear to the youth that he believes is going to take over his position as master builder. His fear has has forced his to make a flaw tragic error which takes and destroys his whole life. But, when he finds a new hope of a happy life, he wakes up and tries to reach it. However he fails because he finally falls down from the top of the building and dies miserably. Based on the finding that the writer found in Henrik Ibsen's The Master Builder, we can learn an important lesson about reality of life. That is we all are going to be old someday and our position will be replaced by the young generation. And as a human being, we should not be afraid with the youth and the old age, but we have to accept it as a normal thing and not as a threat to us...|$|R

[...] Janni shipped limestone all over Washington from the quarry. The quarry was located {{in the center of the}} tetrahedrite mineralized zone of Northern Stevens County. [...] Ore deposits in the district occur in “Vugs” or “Chimneys” usually narrow veins of galena with high silver content. In 1953 Janni’s crew discovered a chimney of galena with silver, 6 feet by 5 feet on the second level of the quarry. They followed it down and shipped nearly forty tons of high grade galena to CM&S Company’s lead refinery in nearby Trail. After following it down 15 feet Janni came and said “cover the damn thing up”. [...] Janni’s men pleaded to follow the chimney further, but Janni refused saying “maybe <b>someday</b> <b>we</b> will dig her up again”. [...] Why he abandoned the chimney remains a mystery.
