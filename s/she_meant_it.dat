James opined that Aden and Nicole were great together and explained, [...] "they started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more."

Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden." [...] Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship [...] "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration though Aden realises <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|David had gone; he did {{not believe}} that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b> Isabella {{believed}} that {{he did not}} care whether <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> or not. David Spencer left behind him a woman, calm outwardly, inwardly a seething volcano of anger, wounded pride, and thwarted will.|$|E
60|$|He could {{scarcely}} believe <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> {{but when he}} did believe he screamed with joy.|$|E
60|$|Both Carrie and {{her husband}} knew exactly what <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> but <b>it</b> was the latter who {{had the courage to}} admit it.|$|R
60|$|She said it so simply, {{yet with}} such an earnestness of despair, that Cyril knew with a pang <b>she</b> really <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|The fright and abhorrence that Mrs Betty Higden {{smoothed}} {{out of her}} strong face as she ended this diversion, showed how seriously <b>she</b> had <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|The man {{realized}} that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> {{and though it}} cost him an effort, he made a sign of resignation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> as a compliment,' said Anne; 'you know, Mary of Scotland says, that [...] "Sovereigns {{ought to}} have long ears."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} NO {{one will ever}} again ask {{me to marry him}} as long as I live," [...] sobbed poor Anne, devoutly believing that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{drew her}} nearer to him, and eyed her closely. Even his {{intelligence}} {{discovered that he}} had brought her to bay, and that <b>she</b> really <b>meant</b> <b>it!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "But I hope to be, one day." [...] She spoke without thinking, {{not quite}} knowing what <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b> But <b>it</b> {{came back to}} her in after years.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Moy {{said this}} as if <b>she</b> really <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> {{and would be}} terribly {{disappointed}} if she met with a refusal. Nora tried to speak, but Babel {{was too much for}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{begin to}} believe that the Evil One has been allowed to come among us in person because of our sins," [...] she said to Martha;--and <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her to know if <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> and finding that she did, {{returned}} to his post. When the mill had rumbled on a little longer he came back.|$|E
6000|$|The {{man sitting}} on the wall {{appreciated}} the compliment to his sex, and proved that he deserved his share of it by taking it exactly as <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> and saying heartily: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you may suppose, I {{particularly}} inquired. Do {{you know}} what she had the cheek to tell me?" [...] Owen asked. [...] "She didn't better it much: <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>it's</b> excessively unnatural." ...|$|R
60|$|O fatal word! <b>She</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> was her dignity as Queen he wounded, for {{she clung}} to that as to the anchor of salvation. But he in his egregious vanity must of cours e misunderstand.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{saw what}} was happening; his {{restraint}} was breaking down, and <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to give <b>it</b> the last blow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lay {{a finger}} on him, and I shall be dead before sunset,' said she; and as they saw that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> they left the palace, and carried the tale to her father.|$|E
6000|$|Robina {{said that}} if he dared to mention the word [...] "household-fairy" [...] she would box his ears, and go {{straight}} up to bed, and leave everybody to do everything. She said <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but {{you could}} see that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b> Do you think it would do for them to change from their hotel, and go to the Grand Union or the States or Congress Hall?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Posts {{editorial}} board prior to Hiatt's appointment {{was described by}} then-editor Meg Greenfield as collectively having [...] "the sensibility of 1950s liberals," [...] by which <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>it</b> was generally conservative on foreign policy and national defense and generally liberal on social issues.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Protection?' Mrs. Peck {{stared at}} me a moment, moving some valued morsel in her mouth; then she exclaimed, familiarly, 'Pshaw!' I was struck with this and I was {{on the point of}} asking her what <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> by <b>it</b> when <b>she</b> continued: 'Are we not going to see Mrs. Nettlepoint?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do your best, Lady Jane," [...] he muttered, and Lady Jane plunged {{down the}} steep hillside, through the glutinous mud of a {{ploughed}} field as if <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to do <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Parkman {{said this}} in a good-natured way, as if <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> in joke. It {{was one of those}} cases where people say what they wish to have {{considered}} as meant in a joke, but to be taken in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, don't!" [...] {{she said}} quickly. <b>She</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b> She wanted no facts to stand {{between her and}} this single romance of her life. [...] "I must go and get the things," [...] she added, turning away, [...] "before he gets back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She thought <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> poor dear, and {{repeated}} such things again and again; but when I asked whether I should send him away without seeing her, she cried more than ever, and said, 'You are tempting me! It would be selfishness.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, there will; see {{if there}} is n't," [...] cried Polly, nodding and smiling, for Fan had confided to her that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to try <b>it</b> after her friend had gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Victrix causa deae--" [...] said Michael gloomily; {{and this}} angered her more, as, {{not knowing what}} <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> <b>she</b> {{imagined}} <b>it</b> to be witty.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> really <b>meant</b> <b>it!</b> The purely selfish {{considerations}} {{which she}} urged on her daughter {{were so many}} undeniable virtues in Mrs. Presty's estimation. She took the highest moral ground, and stood up and crowed on it, with a pride in her own principles which the Primate of all England might have envied.|$|R
60|$|Charnock saw <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it,</b> {{which was}} strange. Sadie knew and {{sometimes}} used her power of attraction, {{but it was}} obvious that she was angry. It {{looked as if he had}} chosen the wrong moment, and he felt worse baffled and disappointed than he had thought possible.|$|E
6000|$|She wouldn't, however, have this. [...] "Nothing for {{you will}} ever {{come to the same}} thing as {{anything}} else." [...] And she understood what <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> <b>it</b> seemed, sufficiently to go straight on. [...] "You say that if he does break he'll come in for things at home?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{instead of}} the print he seemed to see his wife--with her yellow hair flowing over her bare shoulders, and her great dark eyes--standing like an animal at bay. And the whole meaning of her act of revolt came to him. <b>She</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> to be for good.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{looked at}} her gravely, and once more felt the blood creep into his face. She had {{told him she was}} going to Alaska on board the yacht, and he almost ventured to fancy <b>she</b> had <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> as an inducement; but there was no trace of resentment in her voice. Anthea was too proud for that.|$|R
6000|$|... "People {{have said}} so!" [...] Lady Mason repeated. <b>She</b> <b>meant</b> nothing; <b>it</b> {{was nothing to}} her who the people were. If one said it now, all would soon be saying it. But she uttered the words because she felt herself forced to say something, {{and the power of}} {{thinking}} what she might best say was almost taken away from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please take me--unless--" [...] Joan did {{not know}} what to add, but <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> unless <b>it</b> was not right for her to see any more. A strange curiosity had stirred in her. After all, this place where she now stood was not greatly {{different}} from the picture imagination had conjured up. That dance-hall, however, was beyond any creation of Joan's mind.|$|R
