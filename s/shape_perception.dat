5000|$|The {{most famous}} example of figure-ground {{perception}} {{is probably the}} faces-vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described. This drawing exemplifies {{one of the key}} aspects of figure-ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on <b>shape</b> <b>perception.</b> Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Visual {{training}} of light detection {{in the transition}} zone between blind and healthy hemianopic visual fields leads to improvement of color and simple pattern recognition. Recently, we demonstrated that visual field enlargement (VFE) also occurs when an area just beyond the transition zone is stimulated. In the current study, we attempted to determine whether this peripheral training also causes improvement in color and <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> and reading speed. Further, we evaluated which measure of VFE relates best to improvements in performance: the average border shift (ABS) in degrees or the estimated amount of cortical surface gain (ECSG) in millimeters, using the cortical magnification factor (CMF). METHOD: Twelve patients received 40 sessions of 1 -hour restorative function training (RFT). Before and after training, we measured visual fields and reading speed. Additionally, color and <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> in the trained visual field area was measured in 7 patients. RESULTS: VFE was found for 9 of 12 patients. Significant improvements were observed in reading speed for 8 of 12 patients and in color and <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> for 3 of 7 patients. ECSG correlates significantly with performance; ABS does not. Our data indicate that the threshold ECSG, needed for significant changes in color and <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> and reading speed, is about 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS: White stimulus training-induced VFE can lead to improved color and <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> and to increased reading speed in and beyond the pretraining transition zone if ECSG is sufficiently large. The latter depends on the eccentricity of the VFE...|$|E
40|$|Both {{judgment}} {{studies and}} studies of feedforward reaching {{have shown that}} the visual perception of object distance, size, and shape are inaccurate. However, feedback has been shown to calibrate feedfoward reaches-to-grasp to make them accurate with respect to object distance and size. We now investigate whether <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> (in particular, the aspect ratio of object depth to width) can be calibrated in the context of reaches-to-grasp. We used cylindrical objects with elliptical cross-sections of varying eccentricity. Our participants reached to grasp the width or the depth of these objects with the index finger and thumb. The maximum grasp aperture and the terminal grasp aperture were used to evaluate perception. Both occur before the hand has contacted an object. In Experiments 1 and 2, we investigated whether perceived shape is recalibrated by distorted haptic feedback. Although somewhat equivocal, the results suggest that it is not. In Experiment 3, we tested the accuracy of feedforward grasping with respect to shape with haptic feedback to allow calibration. Grasping was inaccurate in ways comparable to findings in <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> judgment studies. In Experiment 4, we hypothesized that online guidance is needed for accurate grasping. Participants reached to grasp either with or without vision of the hand. The result was that the former was accurate, whereas the latter was not. We conclude that <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> is not calibrated by feedback from reaches-to-grasp and that online visual guidance is required for accurate grasping because <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> is poor.

40|$|SummaryAn {{essential}} part of visual perception is the grouping of local elements (such as edges and lines) into coherent shapes. Previous {{studies have shown that}} this grouping process modulates neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V 1) that is signaling the local elements [1 – 4]. However, the nature of this modulation is controversial. Some studies find that <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> reduces neural activity in V 1 [2, 5, 6], while others report increased V 1 activity during <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> [1, 3, 4, 7 – 10]. Neurocomputational theories that cast perception as a generative process [11 – 13] propose that feedback connections carry predictions (i. e., the generative model), while feedforward connections signal the mismatch between top-down predictions and bottom-up inputs. Within this framework, the effect of feedback on early visual cortex may be either enhancing or suppressive, depending on whether the feedback signal is met by congruent bottom-up input. Here, we tested this hypothesis by quantifying the spatial profile of neural activity in V 1 during the perception of illusory shapes using population receptive field mapping. We find that <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> concurrently increases neural activity in regions of V 1 that have a receptive field on the shape but do not receive bottom-up input and suppresses activity in regions of V 1 that receive bottom-up input that is predicted by the shape. These effects were not modulated by task requirements. Together, these findings suggest that <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> changes lower-order sensory representations in a highly specific and automatic manner, in line with theories that cast perception in terms of hierarchical generative models...|$|E

40|$|Little {{has been}} known about China’s {{policing}} of the Internet until recently, when researchers began publishing insights on the types of messages that gets deleted and permitted on various social media platforms, as well as whether or not such moderations are performed automatically. Many discussions have focused on how such efforts may undermine the democratic potential and civic actions that may be empowered and facilitated by the Internet. Two cases discussed in this paper show a different picture: {{the aftermath of a}} train collision in Wenzhou in 2011, and an elaborate plan by a company to take out its competition – both utilizing social media. Structuration theory is used to analyse the types of agency, structures, and power negotiations that can be observed in both cases. The paper then reports a survey carried out with 499 participants on their perceptions of both cases, focusing on how trust propensity and types of information may <b>shape</b> their <b>perceptions</b> of media credibility. Results show that trust propensity was only significant in <b>shaping</b> <b>perceptions</b> of credibility for social media, but the types of information is significant in <b>shaping</b> <b>perceptions</b> of credibility for both mainstream and social media.

By contrast, human <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> works best under complex illumination patterns. I will present a review of some of the findings from our research group {{in which human}} <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> is evaluated under conditions that are particularly challenging for many computer systems, including complex lighting conditions and spatially varying or non-Lambertian BRDFs.

First, is tactile agnosia secondary to a general impairment of spatial cognition?

Secondly, {{within the realm of}} high level tactile perception, is there a distinction between the ability to derive shape (‘what’) and spatial (‘where’) information?

Our results indicate that despite accurate encoding of metric length and normal manual exploration strategies, the ability tactually to perceive objects with the impaired hand, deteriorated as the complexity of shape increased. In addition, asymmetrical performance was not found for other body surfaces (e. g. her feet). Our results suggest that tactile <b>shape</b> <b>perception</b> can be disrupted independent of general spatial ability, tactile spatial ability, manual shape exploration, or even the precise perception of metric length in the tactile modality...|$|E
