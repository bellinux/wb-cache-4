5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall <b>soundness</b> <b>of</b> the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the <b>soundness</b> <b>of</b> the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E

A base for using such methods serves criteria representing these processes. Their relative importance is assigned by attributing proper weights to these criteria.

25|$|The {{concept of}} a formal theorem is {{fundamentally}} syntactic, {{in contrast to the}} notion of a true proposition, which introduces semantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. belief, justification or other modalities). The <b>soundness</b> <b>of</b> a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are tautologies. A formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its tautologies are also theorems.|$|E

40|$|Classical {{workflow}} nets (WF-nets) are {{an important}} class of Petri nets that are widely used to model and analyze workflow systems. Soundness is a crucial property that guarantees these systems are deadlock-free and bounded. Aalst et al. proved that the soundness problem is decidable, and proposed (but not proved) that the soundness problem is EXPSPACE-hard. In this paper, we show that the satisfiability problem of Boolean expression is polynomial time reducible to the liveness problem of bounded WF-nets, and soundness and liveness are equivalent for bounded WF-nets. As a result, the <b>soundness</b> problem <b>of</b> bounded WF-nets is co-NP-hard. Workflow nets with reset arcs (reWF-nets) are an extension to WF-nets, which enhance the expressiveness of WF-nets.
