2500|$|In 2005, a {{group of}} Republican {{senators}} led by Majority Leader Bill Frist proposed having the presiding officer, Vice President Dick Cheney, rule that a filibuster on judicial nominees was unconstitutional, as it was inconsistent with the President's power to name judges with the advice and consent of a simple majority of senators. This {{was a response to}} the Democrats' threat to filibuster some judicial nominees of President George W. Bush. <b>Senator</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott,</b> the junior senator from Mississippi, used the word [...] "nuclear" [...] to describe the plan, and so it became known as the [...] "nuclear option".|$|E

5000|$|President Bill Clinton {{nominated}} Ferris to be {{the seventh}} Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1997, a post Ferris held through 2001. Ferris {{was the subject of}} some controversy in 2000 when the National Council on the Humanities, the NEH's advisory board, selected President Clinton for the Jefferson Lecture, which the NEH describes as [...] "the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities." [...] The Jefferson Lecture honor had never been given to an elected official before; Ferris said that his intent was to establish a new tradition for every President to deliver a Jefferson Lecture during his or her presidency, and that this was consistent with the NEH's broader efforts under his leadership to increase public awareness of the humanities. However, some scholars and political opponents objected that the choice of Clinton represented an inappropriate and unprecedented politicization of the NEH. William J. Bennett, a conservative Republican and former chairman of the NEH under President Reagan, charged that the proposal was an example of how Clinton had [...] "corrupted all of those around him." [...] In the wake of the controversy, President Clinton declined the honor; a White House spokesperson said the President [...] "didn't want the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities to be called into question." [...] Despite this controversy, and even after the 2000 presidential election replaced Clinton with Republican George W. Bush, Ferris retained the strong support of Mississippi's two Republican <b>senators,</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott</b> and Thad Cochran. They stressed Ferris's efforts during his tenure at NEH to reduce the ideological battles that had troubled the NEH under prior administrations, as well as his popularity among the state humanities leaders, and they publicly asked President Bush to retain Ferris. However, Bush ultimately decided to replace Ferris with his own appointee, Bruce Cole.|$|R

2500|$|James Roosevelt, a U.S. {{representative}} from California {{and a son}} of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, once called Rayburn [...] "the most impressive person in Congress".

Roosevelt Jr., of New York, who, according to Rayburn, did not take seriously his duties of office. Thomas Abernethy of Mississippi said that Rayburn was the most influential Speaker in history because he could [...] "work with liberals and conservatives, ran the House with a firm hand but was generous". William Colmer, another Mississippian and the mentor of later Representative and U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Lott,</b> described Rayburn as a [...] "very strong parliamentarian" [...] and far more effective than his successor, John McCormack of Massachusetts, who, Colmer found, [...] "wanted to be liked" [...] by his colleagues.|$|E
