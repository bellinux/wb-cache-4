5|$|Cornwallis {{refused to}} attend the {{surrender}} ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender finally took place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E
5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

Currently AVUS is {{a vital part of the}} German public highway system as Autobahn A 115.|$|E
25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it.

500|$|Although Stanfield {{worked to}} try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved {{difficult}} to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on a bilingualism bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson {{died of cancer in}} 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and said only, [...] "He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize." ...|$|E

500|$|The meeting became confrontational when Krulak {{interrupted}} Phillips, {{asserting that}} American military advisers {{on the ground}} rejected the USOM officer's assessments. Phillips conceded that although the overall military situation had improved, {{this was not the}} case in the crucial delta areas. Phillips noted that the provincial military adviser in Long An Province adjacent to Saigon, had reported that the Viet Cong had overrun 200 Strategic Hamlets in the previous week, forcing the villagers to dismantle the settlement. McNamara <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at the radically divergent reports. When Krulak derided Phillips, Assistant Secretary of State W. Averell Harriman could no longer restrain himself and called the general [...] "a damn fool". Phillips diplomatically took over from Harriman and asserted that it was a battle for hearts and minds rather than pure military metrics.|$|E
500|$|Pound {{could not}} {{understand}} Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes). Cathay {{was the first of}} many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by Herbert Giles in his History of Chinese Literature [...] and used Fenollosa's work {{as a starting point for}} what he called the ideogrammic method, which proceeded on Fenellosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound. Robert Graves recalled [...] "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> despondently." [...] Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees Cathay as a [...] "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language. Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how anybody could think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and remarked, [...] "I don't think too many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree {{that they would not}} stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E

500|$|While these {{preparations}} were underway, Fox kept wavering in {{its commitment}} to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron [...] "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," [...] so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to {{less than half of}} the film's official $237million budget. After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and told Cameron and Landau, [...] "I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you can do this..." ...|$|E
500|$|The Passamaquoddy tribal council fired Gellers {{and asked}} Tureen to take over. Fearing that his federally funded legal aid {{employer}} could not withstand the political pressure that the suit would inevitably provoke, in 1971, Tureen asked the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) {{to act as}} co-counsel. Tureen himself would eventually move to NARF {{during the course of}} the litigation. Tureen attempted to persuade a large law firm to join the case pro bono. Among those who turned him down were Arthur Lazarus, Jr. of Frank, Harris, Shriver & Kampelman, who had litigated many claims in front of the Indian Claims Commission. Based on the acreage involved, Lazarus pointed out that the claim would net only $300,000 before the Commission, which would be less than the cost of litigation. When Tureen said, [...] "Mr. Lazarus, this is not an Indian Claims Commission case, this is a Nonintercourse Act claim," [...] Lazarus <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and told Tureen he was dreaming. Tureen was able to recruit Barry Margolin, David Crosby, and Stuart Ross of Hogan & Hartson. The other members of the team were Robert Pelcyger of NARF and Robert Mittel of Pine Tree Legal Assistance.|$|E
500|$|Leaf {{opened the}} second half with a 99-yard drive for a go-ahead {{touchdown}} to take a 13–7 lead after the extra point was blocked by James Hall. On the ensuing possession, Griese threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Streets on a play-action pass to take a 14–13 lead with 5:07 {{left in the third}} quarter. After a punt by Washington State, Griese led a 14-play, 77-yard drive that ended with a 23-yard play-action touchdown pass from Griese to Jerame Tuman, giving Michigan a 21–13 lead with 11:21 remaining in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, Leaf converted a 3rd-and-18 play from his own 12 by connecting with McKenzie for 19 yards. Eventually, Washington State settled for a Rian Lindell 48-yard field goal with 7:25 to play to make the score 21–16. Michigan started a drive that included four consecutive third down conversions and consumed most of the clock. The conversions were as follows: a 3rd-and-11 Griese scrambled to the Michigan 29; a 3rd-and-7 lateral to Woodson who faked a pass before running eight yards to keep the drive alive; a 3rd-and-6 13-yard pass to Shaw; and a 3rd-and-7 pass to Woodson taking the ball to the Washington State 33. A pooch punt by Jay Feely from field goal formation left Washington on its own seven-yard-line with 29 seconds remaining. Washington State's final drive began at the Cougars 7-yard-line with 16 seconds left to play. Leaf completed a 46-yard pas to Nian Taylor to move the ball to the Michigan 47. Washington State drew an illegal formation penalty with nine seconds remaining, but executed a hook and lateral play for 26-yards to the Michigan 26-yard-line, with an eight-yard catch by Love Jefferson and an 18-yard run by Jason Clayton who was tackled by Weathers and Jones. [...] With two seconds to play, the clock was stopped to move the chains. With no timeouts left, Leaf spiked the football, but Dick Burleson, the referee from the Southeastern Conference crew, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as Leaf contested the decision. Michigan's victory evened the series between the Pac-10 and Big 10 in the Rose Bowl at 26 wins apiece.|$|E
