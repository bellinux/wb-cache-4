5|$|The {{architecture}} of Madagascar {{is unique in}} Africa, bearing strong resemblance to the {{architecture of}} southern Borneo from which the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar {{are believed to have}} emigrated. Traditional construction in this part of Borneo, also known as South Kalimantan, is distinguished by rectangular houses raised on piles. The roof, which is supported by a central pillar, is steeply sloped; the gable beams cross to form roof horns that may be decoratively carved. The central Highlands of Madagascar are populated by the Merina, peoples who bear strong physiological and cultural resemblance to their Kalimantan ancestors; here, the traditional wooden houses of the aristocracy feature a central pillar (andry) supporting a steeply <b>sloped</b> <b>roof</b> decorated with roof horns (tandro-trano). In the southeast of Madagascar, actual zebu horns were traditionally affixed to the gable peak. Throughout Madagascar, houses are rectangular with a gabled roof as in Kalimantan, central pillars are widespread, and in all but a handful of regions, traditional homes are built on piles in a manner handed down from generation to generation, regardless of whether the feature is suited to local conditions.|$|E

25|$|The tower {{has four}} storeys, with fenestrations and battlements, {{the ground floor}} being {{occupied}} by a vaulted cistern. On the first floor, there is a south-facing rectangular door with arched windows on the east and north, and bartizans {{in the northeast and}} northwest corners. The southern part of the second floor is dominated by a covered veranda with a loggia (matacães), consisting of an arcade of seven arches, resting on large corbels with balusters. It is covered by laced stonework to form a porch, and its <b>sloped</b> <b>roof</b> ends in a sculpted twisted rope. The eastern, northern and western walls are occupied by double-arched enclosures, with the northeast and northwest corners occupied by statues of Saint Vincent of Saragossa and the archangel Michael in niches. The third floor has twin windows in the northern, eastern and western façades, with balusters, interspersed by two armillary spheres and large relief with the Royal coat of arms. The final floor is encircled by a terrace with shields of the Order of Christ, and a northern arched door and eastern arched window. The terrace is enclosed by a low wall with colonnaded pyramidal merlons with bartizans in the four corners. A similar terrace above this floor offers a view of the surrounding landscape.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of a male high school [...] "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively" [...] was authorized unanimously by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839. A townhouse of probably two stories with a <b>sloped</b> <b>roof</b> and dormer window structure on what was then known as Courtland Street (now east side of [...] "Preston Gardens", built in the late 1910s with terraced and bermed flower beds with shrubs and monumental staircases along St. Paul Street and St. Paul Place, of five square blocks between East Centre Street {{in the north and}} East Lexington Street to the south, as Baltimore's first downtown [...] "urban renewal" [...] project, which unfortunately resulted in the razing of hundreds of beautiful, but run-down, then neglected Federal, Georgian, and Greek Revival architecture-styled townhomes and classical business structures that would be considered to be saved under the [...] "historic preservation" [...] standards today) was acquired to serve as the home of the new high school. The school opened its doors that Fall on October 20, 1839 with 46 students. Enrollment was restricted to white, male students of Baltimore City who had completed grammar school and passed an entrance exam. Additional student applicants from the surrounding rural (and later suburban) Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County were considered upon payment of tuition to the Baltimore City Public Schools system [...] Those enrolled were offered two academic tracks, a classical literature track and an English literature track. The sole instructor for both tracks was the educator and poet, Nathan C. Brooks, who also served as principal. To accommodate the two tracks, Brooks split the school day into two sections: one in the morning from 9am to 12am, and another in the afternoon from 2pm to 5pm. During the morning session, students studied either classics or English; however, the afternoon was devoted to English.|$|E

2500|$|The first temple {{built in}} the six-spire <b>sloped</b> <b>roof</b> style was the Boise Idaho Temple, the design of which started after its {{announcement}} on March 31, 1982. Early examples of this design proved inadequate: Boise, Dallas, and Chicago were closed for extensive renovations not long after opening. These renovations restructured rooms, added facilities, and made other enhancements that significantly improved the buildings. The last temple built in this style was the Las Vegas Nevada Temple, which was completed in 1989. This style was then largely replaced by the classic modern, single-spire design. The unifying concept behind this style was the six spires and the <b>sloped</b> <b>roof.</b> Other than those factors, the temples varied widely in size and capacity, as illustrated in the table below: ...|$|E

40|$|Steeply <b>sloped</b> <b>roofs,</b> low <b>sloped</b> <b>roofs,</b> flooded {{roofs and}} roof {{terraces}} discussed. A perfectly flat roof cannot {{be achieved in}} normal construction and slopes will inevitably develop owing to structural deflections. It is better to build in slopes to control water on a roof. The practicable minimum for main roof areas is about 1 / 4 inch per foot, and greater slope is desirable. Where drainage is achieved by a folded plate type of arrangement, crickets should be placed {{at the intersection of}} the larger slopes to direct water to the drains. When controlled flow drainage or evaporative cooling are required on <b>roofs,</b> a <b>sloping</b> <b>roof</b> produces a less hazardous condition than a flat roof. For protected membrane type roofs, the principal membrane at the deck below insulation and landscaping should be sloped, continuous and sealed round all penetrations.
