5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The {{size and shape of}} the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, <b>striae,</b> fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range is the {{smallest}} shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered. Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small alkaline shields found in Kenya and Ethiopia along the East African Rift. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under glacial drift deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the Pleistocene epoch. Glacial <b>striae</b> on polished surfaces {{of some of the}} oldest volcanic rocks {{in the eastern part of}} the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the stratigraphy indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross <b>striae</b> on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and flesh of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E
40|$|Background and Design: <b>Stria</b> gravidarum is a cosmetically disfiguring {{condition}} that is commonly seen in pregnancy. Various parameters {{such as age}} of mother, genetical factors like family history, skin colour, various hormonal changes seen in pregnancy, weight gain and physical features of newborn are accused in the development. The studies reported primarily include primigravidas. In this study, the presence of <b>stria</b> gravidarum and associated risk factors are aimed to be investigated. Materials and methods: All attenders' gestastional week, prepregnancy and delivery weights, height, family history of <b>stria,</b> smoking habits and/or alcohol use during pregnancy, any use of cream and/or oil for preventing <b>stria,</b> delivery way, newborn's gender, height, weight and head circumference were recorded. In both primigravidas and multigravidas, factors that could be associated with <b>stria</b> gravidarum were investigated by Spearman'scorrelation analysis and risk factors {{in the development of}} <b>stria</b> gravidarum by logistic regression analysis. Results: Fifty of 128 pregnant women were primigravidas and 78 were multigravidas. In primigravidas, a correlation was detected between family history of <b>stria,</b> non-usage of cream and/or oil during pregnancy,head circumference of newborn and development of <b>stria</b> gravidarum while in multigravidas, a correlation is detected between prepregnancy weight, delivery weight, smoking during pregnancy, not using of any cream and/or oil during pregnancy, family history of <b>stria,</b> head circumference of newborn, weight of newborn and <b>stria</b> gravidarum development. Presence of family history of <b>stria</b> and not using of any cream and/or oil were found to be risk factors in development of <b>stria</b> gravidarum in all pregnant women by logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Both genetical and physical factors are thought {{to play a role in}} development of <b>stria</b> gravidarum; however, further broad scale studies with larger samples including both primigravidas and multigravidas are needed to be carried out...|$|R
50|$|The <b>stria</b> {{terminal}}is (or terminal <b>stria)</b> is {{a structure}} in the brain consisting of a band of fibers running along the lateral margin of the ventricular surface of the thalamus.

40|$|Cochlear {{hair cells}} and the <b>stria</b> vascularis are {{critical}} for normal hearing. Hair cells transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, whereas the <b>stria</b> is responsible for generating the endocochlear potential (EP), which {{is the driving force}} for hair cell mechanotransduction. We questioned whether hair cells and the <b>stria</b> interdepend for survival by using two mouse models. Atoh 1 conditional knockout mice, which lose all hair cells within four weeks after birth, were used to determine whether the absence of hair cells would affect function and survival of <b>stria.</b> We showed that <b>stria</b> morphology and EP remained normal for long time despite a complete loss of all hair cells. We then used a mouse model that has an abnormal <b>stria</b> morphology and function due to mutation of the Mitf gene to determine whether hair cells are able to survive and transduce sound signals without a normal electrochemical environment in the endolymph. A strial defect, reflected by missing intermediate cells in the <b>stria</b> and by reduction of EP, led to systematic outer hair cell death from the base to the apex after postnatal day 18. However, an 18 -mV EP was sufficient for outer hair cell survival. Surprisingly, inner hair cell survival was less vulnerable to reduction of the EP. Our studies show that normal function of the <b>stria</b> is essential for adult outer hair cell survival, while the survival and normal function of the <b>stria</b> vascularis do not depend on functional hair cells...|$|R

The damage may have caused changes to the arrangement of ligaments of muscles. The two coracoids are also differently developed. A rib of specimen MPC-D 100/127 shows a healed trauma which has remodelled the bone. In 2012, bite marks on two gastralia of the holotype specimen were reported.

50|$|There {{are three}} major fiber bundles, axons of {{cochlear}} nuclear neurons, that carry {{information from the}} cochlear nuclei to targets that are mainly {{on the opposite side}} of the brain. Through the medulla, one projection goes to the contralateral superior olivary complex (SOC) via the trapezoid body, whilst the other half shoots to the ipsilateral SOC. This pathway is called the ventral acoustic <b>stria</b> (VAS or, more commonly, the trapezoid body). Another pathway, called the dorsal acoustic <b>stria</b> (DAS, also known as the <b>stria</b> of von Monakow), rises above the medulla into the pons where it hits the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus along with its kin, the intermediate acoustic <b>stria</b> (IAS, also known as the <b>stria</b> of Held). The IAS decussates across the medulla, before joining the ascending fibers in the contralateral lateral lemniscus. The lateral lemniscus contains cells of the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, and in turn projects to the inferior colliculus. The inferior colliculus receives direct, monosynaptic projections from the superior olivary complex the contralateral dorsal acoustic <b>stria,</b> some classes of stellate neurons of the VCN, as well as from the different nuclei of the lateral lemniscus.|$|R

25|$|Plantar warts {{are often}} similar to calluses or corns, {{but can be}} {{differentiated}} by close observation of skin striations. Feet are covered in skin <b>striae,</b> which are akin to fingerprints on the feet. Skin <b>striae</b> go around plantar warts; if the lesion is not a plantar wart, the striations continue across {{the top layer of}} the skin. Plantar warts tend to be painful on application of pressure from either side of the lesion rather than direct pressure, unlike calluses (which tend to be painful on direct pressure instead).|$|E

50|$|The upper {{portion of}} the spiral {{ligament}} (which forms the outer wall of the cochlear duct) contains numerous capillary loops and small blood vessels, and is termed the <b>stria</b> vascularis. It produces endolymph for the scala media, {{one of the three}} fluid-filled compartments of the cochlea. The <b>stria</b> is a somewhat stratified epithelium containing primarily three cell types (marginal, intermediate, and basal cells) and intraepithelial capillaries. The marginal cells are involved primarily in K+ transport and line the endolymphatic space of the scala media. The intermediate pigment-containing cells are scattered among capillaries. The basal cells separate <b>stria</b> vascularis from the underlying spiral ligament. The <b>stria</b> vascularis also contains pericyte, melanocyte, and endothelial cells.It is the only epithelial tissue that is not avascular (i.e. completely lacking blood and lymphatic vessels).|$|R
50|$|While the <b>stria</b> terminalis carries {{information}} {{primarily from}} the corticomedian nuclei of the amygdala, the ventral amygdalofugal pathway carries output from the central and basolateral nuclei and delivers it a number of targets; namely, the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the basal forebrain, the brain stem, septal nuclei and nucleus accumbens. Both the amygdalofugal pathway and the <b>stria</b> terminalis project to the septal region, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus, but the <b>stria</b> terminalis reaches the septal region and the hypothalamus in a much longer and less direct path. While the <b>stria</b> terminalis follows a C-shaped pathway along the lateral ventricles, the ventral amygdalofugal pathway is more direct and contains {{a higher proportion of}} myelinated axons, causing the pathway to appear darker upon observation in stained crossection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pendred syndrome, an autosomal-recessive {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} deafness and goiter, {{is caused by}} a mutation of SLC 26 A 4, which codes for the anion exchanger pendrin. We investigated the relationship between pendrin expression and deafness using mice that have (Slc 26 a 4 +/+ or Slc 26 a 4 +/-) or lack (Slc 26 a 4 -/-) a complete Slc 26 a 4 gene. Previously, we reported that <b>stria</b> vascularis of adult Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice is hyperpigmented and that marginal cells appear disorganized. Here we determine the time course of hyperpigmentation and marginal cell disorganization, and test the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to this tissue degeneration. Methods Slc 26 a 4 -/- and age-matched control (Slc 26 a 4 +/+ or Slc 26 a 4 +/-) mice were studied at four postnatal (P) developmental stages: before and after the age that marks the onset of hearing (P 10 and P 15, respectively), after weaning (P 28 - 41) and adult (P 74 - 170). Degeneration and hyperpigmentation <b>stria</b> vascularis was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Gene expression in <b>stria</b> vascularis was analyzed by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, the expression of a select group of genes was quantified in spiral ligament, spleen and liver to evaluate whether expression changes seen in <b>stria</b> vascularis are specific for <b>stria</b> vascularis or systemic in nature. Results Degeneration of <b>stria</b> vascularis defined as hyperpigmentation and marginal cells disorganization was not seen at P 10 or P 15, but occurred after weaning and was associated with staining for CD 68, a marker for macrophages. Marginal cells in Slc 26 a 4 -/-, however, had a larger apical surface area at P 10 and P 15. No difference in the expression of Lyzs, C 3 and Cd 45 was found in <b>stria</b> vascularis of P 15 Slc 26 a 4 +/- and Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice. However, differences in expression were found after weaning and in adult mice. No difference in the expression of markers for acute inflammation, including Il 1 a, Il 6, Il 12 a, Nos 2 and Nos 3 were found at P 15, after weaning or in adults. The expression of macrophage markers including Ptprc (= Cd 45), Cd 68, Cd 83, Lyzs, Lgals 3 (= Mac 2 antigen), Msr 2, Cathepsins B, S, and K (Ctsb, Ctss, Ctsk) and complement components C 1 r, C 3 and C 4 was significantly increased in <b>stria</b> vascularis of adult Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice compared to Slc 26 a 4 +/+ mice. Expression of macrophage markers Cd 45 and Cd 84 and complement components C 1 r and C 3 was increased in <b>stria</b> vascularis but not in spiral ligament, liver or spleen of Slc 26 a 4 -/- compared to Slc 26 a 4 +/- mice. The expression of Lyzs was increased in <b>stria</b> vascularis and spiral ligament but not in liver or spleen. Conclusion The data demonstrate that hyperpigmentation of <b>stria</b> vascularis and marginal cell reorganization in Slc 26 a 4 -/- mice occur after weaning, coinciding with an invasion of macrophages. The data suggest that macrophage invasion contributes to tissue degeneration in <b>stria</b> vascularis, and that macrophage invasion is restricted to <b>stria</b> vascularis and is not systemic in nature. The delayed onset of degeneration of <b>stria</b> vascularis suggests that a window of opportunity exists to restore/preserve hearing in mice and therefore possibly in humans suffering from Pendred syndrome. </p...|$|R
25|$|Stretch marks (technically called <b>striae)</b> {{are also}} a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is {{stretched}} rapidly (for instance during pregnancy, significant weight gain, or adolescent growth spurts), or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near joints).

However, {{the shell}} of Oospira miranda is light corneous, more or less smooth, i.e. with only some faint, {{irregular}} <b>striae.</b> Its topwhorls increase more rapidly in width, which gives the shell a more fusiform shape, and the lamella subcolumellaris is not visible in a frontal view.|$|E
25|$|If {{keratoconus}} is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's <b>striae,</b> fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The <b>striae</b> temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E

The gastric H,K-ATPase in <b>stria</b> vascularis {{contributes}} to pH regulation of cochlear endolymph {{but not to}} K secretion. BMC Physiology, 17 (1), 1. [URL] Disturbance of acid‚Äìbase balance in the inner ear {{is known to be}} associated with hearing loss in a number of conditions including genetic mutations and pharmacologic interventions. Several previous physiologic and immunohistochemical observations lead to proposals of the involvement of acid‚Äìbase transporters in <b>stria</b> vascularis. Results We directly measured acid flux in vitro from the apical side of isolated <b>stria</b> vascularis from adult C 57 Bl/ 6 mice with a novel constant-perfusion pH-selective self-referencing probe. Acid efflux that depended on metabolism and ion transport was observed from the apical side of <b>stria</b> vascularis. The acid flux was decreased to about 40 % of control by removal of the metabolic substrate (glucose-free) and by inhibition of the sodium pump (ouabain). The flux was also decreased a) by inhibition of Na,H-exchangers by amiloride, dimethylamiloride (DMA), S 3226 and Hoe 694, b) by inhibition of Na, 2 Cl,K-cotransporter (NKCC 1) by bumetanide, and c) by the likely inhibition of HCO 3 /anion exchange by DIDS. By contrast, the acid flux was increased by inhibition of gastric H,K-ATPase (SCH 28080) but was not affected by an inhibitor of vH-ATPase (bafilomycin). K flux from <b>stria</b> vascularis was reduced less than 5 % by SCH 28080. Conclusions These observations suggest that <b>stria</b> vascularis may be an important site of control of cochlear acid‚Äìbase balance and demonstrate a functional role of several acid‚Äìbase transporters in <b>stria</b> vascularis, including basolateral H,K-ATPase and apical Na,H-exchange. Previous suggestions that H secretion is mediated by an apical vH-ATPase and that basolateral H,K-ATPase contributes importantly to K secretion in <b>stria</b> vascularis are not supported. These results advance our understanding of inner ear acid‚Äìbase balance and provide a stronger basis to interpret the etiology of genetic and pharmacologic cochlear dysfunctions that are influenced by endolymphatic pH...|$|R
