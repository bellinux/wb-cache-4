40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} hydroxy-terminated {{polybutadiene}} liquid rubber (HTPB) and <b>softened</b> <b>agent</b> {{on the performance}} of epoxy resin are studied. The mechanical properties of the composites investigated and the toughening mechanism were studied trough the SEM. In the HTPB/epoxy resin composites, the hardness is reduced but the elongation and the shear strength increased. Added 20 wt%HTPB, the breaking elongation can be up to 16. 19 % and the shear strength rise to 13. 74 MPa. From the images of the SEM, the globular and trumpet-like hole and shear zone can hinder the development of the cracks, thus increasing the toughness of the epoxy resin. In the softened agent/epoxy resin composites, The addition of the <b>softened</b> <b>agent,</b> the breaking elongation and the impact strength have increased.

25|$|Hydrogen {{and other}} {{elements}} within iron act as <b>softening</b> <b>agents</b> that promote the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements—their formation in the iron hydride either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases—enables the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting iron hydride. Iron hydride's ductility compared to pure iron is only possible {{at the expense of}} strength, of which elemental iron has a relative deficiency. However, iron hydride is metastable and subject to the rapid formation of a precipitated phase of gaseous dihydrogen, a process known as hydrogen embrittlement. Thus, the material properties of iron hydride are time-sensitive. One alloying element intentionally added to modify the characteristics of iron hydride is titanium.|$|R

As it was noted that CDs stored in paper sleeves were deteriorating sooner and faster than CDs stored in jewel cases, it is likely that storing CDs in an acid-free environment might slow down the bronzing effect. A minimum measure would be to remove the booklet and paper inlay from the CD's jewel case, though it might be advisable to store affected CDs in envelopes made of alkaline paper inside a box made of acid-free cardboard.
