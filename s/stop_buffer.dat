Time-series samples were taken between 0 and 30  min at regular intervals. Samples were immediately mixed with 33 % (v/v) fourfold concentrated <b>stop</b> <b>buffer.</b> This concentrated <b>stop</b> <b>buffer</b> contains 0.25  M Tris∙HCl pH[*]=[*] 8, 8 % (w/v) SDS, 40 % (v/v) glycerol, 40  mM EDTA, 0.008 % (w/v) bromophenol blue and 4  mM β-mercapto-ethanol. For the phosphoryl transfer experiments, the histidine kinases were first autophosphorylated for 1  h in the dark, after which Ypd 1 {{was added to the}} sample in a molar ratio of 1 : 2. Time-series samples were taken between 1 and 30  min. Samples were immediately mixed with <b>stop</b> <b>buffer,</b> just as described above. Samples were analyzed on 10 % (w/v) SDS PAGE gels, which were then exposed to a GE Healthcare screen (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, United States). Screens were scanned with a Typhoon Fla 7000 system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, United States) and the resulting data files were saved as.tiff files. Image Quant software (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, United States) was used for the quantification of the intensity of the different bands. Kinase phosphorylation experiments and phosphoryl transfer experiments were conducted in the dark, with minimal red background light (Avila-Perez et al. 2006), or under constant illumination from blue light emitting diodes (LEDs with λmax[*]=[*] 464  nm) with an incident light intensity of 200  µEinstein m 2  s− 1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was the {{development}} of a simple chromogenic factor VIII assay for practical clinical use. The criteria that the assay fulfils are: (1) The method is so sensitive that even l 0 lo factor VIII in human plasma is easily detected. (2) The method is linear in the amount of factor VIII from 0 to 2000 /o in plasma. (3) The pipetting scheme is very simple; two reagents are prepared, reagent I (factor IXa, thrombin, Ca 2 * and phospho-lipids) and reagent 2 (factor X). Then we pipet at t: 0 s, 100 pl diluted plasma + 100 pl reagent 1 in a reaction tube; at t: 30 s, 100 pl reagent 2 in the same tube and at t: 90 s, 200 pl of the reaction mixture in a cuvette with 700 pl EDTA buffer (<b>stop</b> <b>buffer)</b> and the formed factor Xa is measured with a chromogenic substrate.

30|$|To {{examine whether}} {{recruitment}} of Pcf 1 to chromatin {{was affected by}} H 4 acetylation, we first treated wild type and Δpcf 1 mutant cells with 12  mM HU at designated times before chromatin fractionation. The fractionation procedure was generously provided by Drs. M. Sadaie and J. Nakayama (RIKEN, Kobe, Japan). Approximately 2.5 [*]×[*] 108 cells of wild type or Δpcf 1 mutant were harvested and washed in ice-cold <b>STOP</b> <b>buffer</b> (150  mM NaCl, 50  mM NaF, 10  mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1  mM NaN 3).

After washing out lysing enzyme and zymolyase 100  T with 1.2  M sorbitol, we then suspended the spheroplasts in HBS-T buffer (25  mM MOPS, 60  mM β-glycerophosphate, 15  mM MgCl 2, 15  mM EGTA, 1  mM dithiothreitol, 0.2  mM Na 3 VO 4, 1  mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.2  M sorbitol, and 0.5 % Triton X- 100, pH 7.2) and incubated on ice for 5  min. After centrifugation at 13, 000  rpm for 20  min, the supernatant was saved as an unbound fraction. Then pellet was washed twice in HBS-T buffer, resuspended in the initial volume of HBS-T buffer, and saved as a chromatin fraction. Both fractions were subjected to immunoblots as described above. Proper performance of the assay was confirmed by using anti-α-tubulin and anti-H 3 antibodies as loading controls. Fractionated Pcf 1 -GFP was detected by using the anti-GFP antibody.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported on characterisation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Theileria parva (1), an intracellular protozoan parasite of cattle (reviewed in (2). The mtDNA encodes ORFs for apocytochrome b and polypeptides I and III and cytochrome oxidase, contains fragmented rRNA genes and exists as a 7. 1 kbp linear DNA molecule. The mtDNA was only amenable to cloning following brief treatment with Bal 31 exonuclease and partial sequence data indicated {{the presence of}} terminal inverted repeat (TIR), sequences which could have made the intact molecule refractory to cloning (1). The limited protein coding capacity, rRNA gene fragmentation and TIR sequences of the parasite mtDNA {{is similar to that}} described for the 15. 8 kbp linear mtDNA of Chlamydomanas reinhardtii, a unicellular green algae (3). In an attempt to complete the sequence analysis of the ends of the parasite mtDNA we have taken advantage of cycle sequencing. Rather than using purified mtDNA as template, we reasoned that since the T. parva genome is only about 10 (7) bp (4, 5), and parasite mtDNA is present in multiple copies (1), {{we should be able to}} employ cycle sequence analysis of total genomic DNA to obtain mtDNA sequences. This method has been described for obtaining nucleotide sequence from a cloning vector in a single bacterial colony or bacteriophage plaque (6). Total genomic DNA was isolated from bovine red blood cells infected with the piroplasm stage of T. parva (7) and an aliquot of the DNA was digested to completion with HindIII. This restriction enzyme cleaves the mtDNA once (1) and was used to reduce the viscosity of the DNA solution. The digested DNA was exracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with absloute cold ethanol, rinsed with 70 percent ethanol (8) and then suspended in water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. A 5 mu-gamma sample of the genomic DNA was subjected to cycle sequencing using the fmol DNA sequencing ssystem (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 pmol of 33 P labelled primer was used with Taq DNa polymerase, template and dNTP/ddNTP mixes in the standard buffer. The microtitre plate was placed in a programmable thermal cycler preheated to 95 degree centi-grade and the cycle sequencing program started. Cycling profile conditions consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 95 degree centi-grade followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 degree centi-grade, 30 s at 55 degree centi-grade and 1 min at 72 degree centi-grade.

50|$|In some instances, due to {{low line}} speeds, an OSS {{may not be}} fitted.An OSS on its own {{may be used to}} protect a {{permanent}} speed restriction, a signal at danger, or <b>buffer</b> <b>stop.</b> Although loops are standard, <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> may be fitted with 'mini loops', due to the very low approach speed, usually 10 mph. When <b>buffer</b> <b>stops</b> were originally fitted with TPWS using standard loops there were many instances of false applications, causing delays whilst it reset, with trains potentially blocking the station throat, plus the risk of passengers standing to alight being thrown over by the sudden braking. This problem arose when a train passed over the arming loop so slowly that it was still detected by the train's receiver after the on-board timer had completed its cycle. The timer would reset and begin timing again, and the trigger loop then being detected within this second timing cycle would lead to a false intervention. As a temporary solution, drivers were instructed to pass the <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> OSSs at 5 mph, eliminating the problem, but meaning that trains no longer had the momentum to roll to the normal stopping point and requiring drivers to apply power beyond the OSS, just a short distance from the buffers, arguably making a <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> collision more likely than before TPWS was fitted. The redesigned 'mini loops', roughly a third the length of the standard ones, eliminate this problem, although due to the low speed and low margin, <b>buffer</b> <b>stop</b> OSSs are still a major cause of TPWS trips.|$|R
