Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two <b>states</b> <b>still</b> selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially {{known as}} the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, were an {{international}} multi-sport event held in Los Angeles, California, United States, from 28 July to 12 August 1984. These Games had 6,829 athletes from 140 NOCs participating {{in a total of}} 221 events in 23 sports. Athletes from 47 NOCs won medals, of which 25 secured at least a gold medal. As a result, 93 NOCs were left without any medal. The host NOC, the United States, received 83 gold medals, breaking the previous Summer Olympic record of 78 golds, set at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Even so, the United <b>States</b> <b>still</b> won fewer medals than the previous overall record.|$|E

5|$|The CPC has {{retained}} close {{relations with the}} remaining socialist <b>states</b> <b>still</b> espousing communism: Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam and their respective ruling parties. It spends {{a fair amount of}} time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the collapse of the Eastern European socialist states in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United <b>States</b> <b>still</b> {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
5|$|With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. {{splitting}} up, the Midnight Express {{needed a}} new team to defend their newly won title against. They began {{a long series of}} matches against The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches were so well received by the fans that independent promoters all over the United <b>States</b> <b>still</b> book those two teams against each other today, 20 years after the rivalry started.|$|E

When the United <b>States</b> <b>still</b> seemed uninterested in reciprocity, he threatened to forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand. Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United <b>States</b> <b>still</b> has more speakers of English than India.|$|E

25|$|Before this {{landmark}} case, pre-trial involuntary {{commitment of}} incompetent individuals often meant lengthy or even lifetime confinement in a maximum security institution with little concern for treatment. This was true {{even though they}} were neither tried for or convicted of a crime. In this case, the Court for the first time put limits on the length of time an incompetent person may be confined. However, the Court offers only general guidelines and by 1994, twenty years after the case, 32 <b>states</b> <b>still</b> had not enacted periodic judicial review of incompetent detainees. Many <b>states</b> <b>still</b> allowed a detention period that exceeded that maximum sentence that person would have received if convicted.|$|E
