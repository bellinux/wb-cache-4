The remarkable hysteresis behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> in EBFs is so appealing to seismic design that they have also been used in other types of structure applications such as fuse members that provides required ductility and energy dissipation.

However, the seismic behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> made of high strength steel, which are essential "fuse" elements in EBFs, are not fully understood yet. Furthermore, most existing studies either assumed no axial load or an unrealistic constant axial load. In this numerical simulation study, two steel grades (Q 460 high strength structural steel (by China standard) and ASTM A 992 steel for comparison) were considered for the <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> specimens and their effects on <b>shear</b> <b>link's</b> seismic performance were numerically studied under cyclically varying lateral load along with axial force.

The specimen {{is to examine the}} behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400 mm of the steel profile of WF 200. 100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses,, thickness and length of web stiffener, thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility’s between <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> with diagonal stiffener and <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant. Analysis results also show thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric model of stiffener to have a significant influence on the performance of <b>shear</b> <b>links.</b> To perform validation of the numerical study, the research is followed by experimental work conducted in Structural Mechanic Laboratory Center for Industrial Engineering ITB. The Structures and Mechanics Lab rotary PAU-ITB. The experiments were carried out using three test specimens with model and dimension identical to the model in the numerical study. Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study.

The intermediate supports of those structures are hammerhead piers which are having pier heads in the range of 4 - 5 m cantilever lengths. After erection of post tensioned girders the deck slab and the diaphragms were cast in stages to make the deck slab continuous over the piers.

Practical connection details for the link components were proposed in an effort to provide elastic connections that shift plastic strains away from critical welds, thereby avoiding some of the failures observed in past tests on similarly detailed link-to-column eccentrically braced frames. Link end details were investigated using detailed non-linear finite element analyses and showed the viability of the <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> component to provide inelastic energy dissipation while limiting plastic strains at the bolted connection. In general, the linked column framing system is thought to be viable under seismic loading, offering a ductile structural system with the ability to rapidly return to occupancy. ...|$|R

The flexural strength retrofitted by this method {{is limited to a}} certain value as the balanced compression region of concrete is restricted. For an engineering project of retrofitting, this method can not be used and other methods are not convenient to apply. In this condition, externally bonded small sized H-type steel member may be used to get larger resistance of bending moment as the arm of the tension force is also extended. The JGN structural adhesive is used for bonding and the new type of steel-concrete composite beam is formed. Some related problems of the design and analysis for this retrofitted beam are presented. Similar to the design analysis of reinforced concrete beam, the hypothesis for the rigid-plastic equilibrium of the forces across the section is adopted for the analysis of the flexural strength of the retrofitted beam. The flexural stiffness can be got by the design code. The primary purpose for retrofitting the beam is reached. Shear stress of the retrofitted beam is analyzed by the method of material mechanics for shear strength check.

In this study, failure load, beam displacement, stiffness, strain value of steel reinforcement, mode of failure had been presented. The repeated reversed loads were applied to the end of cantilever beam. The dimension for each column was 300 x 300 x 1500 mm, and the cantilever beam with dimension, 300 x 150 x 1000 rnm was located at the mid-height of column. High-yield steel was utilized for all main reinforcement with 8 T 16 bars for column rebar and 4 T 16 for cantilever RC beam. Mild steel type was used for all steel links. In addition, 30 grade of concrete was employed and the concrete design was based on JKR mix design method. The result of this study shown that the best performances of RC beam column joint is third specimen which is can be explained that cross bracing joint of the beam-column joint is the greatest type of joint among the three specimen of joint since it showed the well performance under seismic condition...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> overstrength, which {{is defined as the}} ratio between the peak inelastic and the yield strength. Three basic parameters are devised as generally influencing shear overstrength: (i) axial forces acting on the link, (ii) the ratio of link flange over web area and (iii) the ratio between link length and cross section depth. The study presented does not consider the case of axial forces directly applied to the link, but the tensile axial forces developing as a consequence of axial restraints are taken into account. Numerical analysis of finite element (FE) models has been carried out in order to ascertain the combined influence of these factors on the plastic overstrength. A simple analytical model is proposed on the basis of FE model analysis results. The analytical predictions are compared with results of available experimental test results, showing satisfactory agreement...|$|R
50|$|However, the investigation, {{released}} in August 2012, {{found that the}} probable cause of the crash were reused single-use locknuts in the left elevator trim tab system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an attachment screw and allowed the trim tab to flutter. This flutter caused the trim tab <b>link</b> <b>assembly</b> to fail which led to loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right trim tab had been fixed in place. Had both trim tabs been operational, {{the loss of the}} left trim tab alone may not have caused loss of control. When the trim tab failed, Leeward was exposed to 17Gs which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.|$|R

Derived response formulations showed that the constraining of a rocking equipment by a link element can produce four different sets of response equations depending on the link stiffness and the place of <b>link</b> <b>assembly.</b> Buildup-like, beating-like and chaotic behaviors are some new aspects of the response in such equipments. Sensitivity analysis results showed that although in the most cases interning of the link element reduces the rocking response rotations but can increase the total damped energy during the contacts of the equipments to the base. This can {{be known as a}} risk for the equipments with leakage potential or with fragile wedges...|$|R
