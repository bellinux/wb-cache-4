40|$|Some recent {{empirical}} {{findings suggest}} that there are intrinsic links between the statistical regularities regarding cohort survival patterns, the persistence of firm turnover, and shakeout during an industry life-cycle. This paper presents a theoretical model which explains these regularities and the links between them. I begin the analysis by treating the market as comprising a number of strategically independent submarkets, so that I can separate the strategic interaction effect at the submarket level and the independence effects which operate across these independent submarkets at the aggregate level. The analysis reveals that within each submarket a 'selection process' in in quality competition induces market concentration over time, and this leads to a certain shakeout pattern at the disaggregate level. The study also finds that the dynamics of the emergence of submarkets in a conventionally defined industry plays a crucial role in shaping the aggregate pattern of the industry life-cycle.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three pieces of research on moral hazard, reputation and market structure. In particular, following an opening discussion of previous literature, I explore the dynamic interaction between moral hazard and market structure in two distinct game theoretic settings and empirically test a fundamental assumption of these models concerning consumer rationality. In the first Chapter, I survey the studies which shed light on some dimension {{of the relationship between}} asymmetric information and market structure and identify the gap in the literature that my research aims to fill. The mechanism of reputation has been primarily investigated in the setting of perfect competition; however, this setting is ill suited for uncovering the rich set of relations between asymmetric information and market structure. Only a handful of articles departed from the perfect competition framework and only few of those introduced strategic interaction among firms, a fundamental ingredient of my research interest. The models which do include strategic interaction have, however, ignored some important dynamics in the interaction of asymmetric information and market structure. Therefore in Chapter II, I develop a model in which market structure affects moral hazard while, in turn, moral hazard fuels market structure dynamics. The model is very general allowing for all kinds of strategic interaction among firms usually considered in the literature. I identify and analyse an important driving force -a survival contest - which has so far been overlooked. The main conclusion is that market concentration in and of itself reduces moral hazard and moral hazard drives the market towards concentration through the survival contest. The model is suitable to explain the puzzling market transformation of important industries such as banking, audit and health care. In Chapter III, I extend the model of Chapter 11 by introducing stochastic entry. First, I demonstrate that my results in the previous Chapter are robust to the entry process. Second, stochastic entry allows me to derive a non-degenerate steady state distribution which exhibits a very intuitive dynamics. Finally, although the complex nature of the dynamics prevents a detailed comparative static analysis of this distribution, it displays two well known empirical regularities. In particular, my model shows that the presence of moral hazard in and of itself produces <b>shake-outs</b> in the market {{from time to time and}} also correlated exit and entry rates. The reputation mechanisms in general and in the models of Chapter II and III in particular crucially depend on consumers' ability and willingness to develop an understanding of imperfect information on quality. In order to make reputation an effective disciplinary force, consumers must be strongly rational so that they read and understand imperfect quality indicators. In Chapter IV, this basic assumption on consumer rationality is tested empirically in discrete choice settings in the audit market. I find robust empirical evidence that if consumers are firms rather than individuals, they are strongly rational. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of Warwick.

A {{qualitative}} study about coaches´ appreciations concerning youth hockey The aim with {{this study is}} to strengthen the knowledge about coaches´ appreciations concerning youth hockey. This study contains interviews with three leaders that operate on the strategic level within youth hockey and three coaches working with youth players in the ages of 11 and 12. I have divided my main results into 4 categories, based on an earlier study from Karin Redelius (2002). These categories include the following themes: 1) Competition on {{the good and the bad}} 2) The importance of winning 3) <b>Shake-out</b> versus sports on children 9 ̆ 2 s terms 4) Instruction, play and learning The main conclusions in this study show that leaders on the strategic level appreciate youth hockey in a very similar way. Coaches´ appreciations vary on a much higher level both from each other and from the appreciations expressed by the leaders. One of the coaches recon that winning is very important and gives the coach assurance of a job well done.

40|$|We {{characterize}} the dynamic equilibrium path ofa competitive industry with free entry and exit, where atomistic fmns undertake investment {{over time in}} order to reduce their future production costs. Investment reduces both total as well as marginal cost of production; however, the associated dynamic scale economies are eventually bounded. Cost reduction is deterministic and there are no inter-firm spill-overs. Marginal cost in any time period is stricdy increasing in output and active firms incur a positive fixed cost even if no output is produced. The industry equilibrium path is socially optimal. Equilibrium prices are (weakly) decreasing over time. Firms invest in cost reduction and eam negative net profit when they are young.

40|$|The {{competition}} {{challenge of}} the mature systems in the global market. Innovation and institutional change in the Emilian model. Competitiveness is defined as capability to satisfy a potential demand, or ability to produce by a technology. For this reason, {{issues related to the}} territorial organization of production and to the industry life cycle are overlapped. In fact, the possibilities to use a technology strictly depend on the ways of production organization and, when production is a local matter, also the technology becomes local. Localized systems of production are just defined by this overlapping and, once a dominant technological paradigm is arisen, they turn in mature ones, i. e. they have to cope with a competition paradox. The only solution is an increase in the division of labour getting the territory to take a new technological path and start a new development process. This process goes through a system <b>shake-out</b> expanding the set of productive relations in the direction of an institutional division of labour, because maturity represents the depletion of a «work to be done» that is also the reaching of the full divisibility of labour. Hence, production processes have to be opened to new players that must {{be able to use the}} same local technology. These ones are the institutions that by «functional spin-offs» are entitled to participate to the production. Thus, the territory becomes a «territorial platform of production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this {{experimental}} study, six pearlitic {{grey cast}} irons with different Cu and Cr content, different section thicknesses and different eutectoid cooling {{rates have been}} examined. The eutectoid cooling rate was approximated by casting simulation analysis. The purpose of the experiments was to study {{the effect of the}} matrix structure on the overall mechanical properties. An emphasis is put on the pearlite interlamellar spacing because this controls the resulting mechanical properties to a large extent. By keeping the graphite structure constant, the effect of the matrix structure was able to be studied. This was achieved by <b>shake-out</b> at temperatures above the eutectoid transformation range followed by subsequent cooling in air, mould or in a furnace. The pearlite interlamellar spacing ranged from 90 to 330 nm for the matrices studied. Comparing the strength of the fine structured and coarse structured materials, the tensile and yield strength was reduced by almost 50 %. Regarding the elastic deformation, a weak increase in the tangent modulus with increasing alloying content was observed. It was also observed that lower cooling rate decreased the tangent modulus. The tangent modulus ranged between 70 and 110 GPa. Analysing the plastic deformation of the materials, in terms of strain hardening exponent, n, and strength coefficient, K, a strong dependence on the pearlite coarseness was observed. It was concluded that the effect of graphite particle length on tensile strength was negligible and the major improvement on the strength was due to refinement of the pearlite...|$|E
40|$|Optoelectronics (or photonics) has {{developed}} as a significant enabling technology central to the operation {{of a wide range}} of artefacts evident in telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical devices and defence. Policy makers in several nation states and regions have been keen to develop capability in optoelectronics given that these technologies may be widely leveraged in such high-value sectors. The paper explains reasons for the emergence of optoelectronics activity in Scotland. A sectoral system of innovation approach is used to explain the activities of optoelectronics actors in Scotland. The Scottish optoelectronics sector has survived significant exogenous shocks and there is evidence of enduring local geographic connections within the network coupled with international interactions. Reactive and proactive strategies of firms and other actors within the cluster have enhanced articulation to international value chains of knowledge and technology production. As in many other locations with significant optoelectronics activity, Scottish firms tend to be geographically clustered. The use of value chain and industry architecture frameworks has been applied to the sectoral systems of innovation construct in order to bring additional explanatory power to the dynamics and power asymmetries in the cluster. Distinct patterns are evident between the set of firms which engage in final products (essentially acting as system integrators) positioned towards the end of the value chain, compared with the set of firms positioned earlier in the value chain (predominantly reflecting producers of materials and components).

The Authors 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Associazione ICC. All rights reserved. This article considers the causal connection between adaptability and survival in populations of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs). Some literatures have downplayed adaptability by focusing on statics and equilibria (parts of mainstream economics). Others have argued {{that it is very}} difficult to make individual firms more adaptable and the focus should be on selection forces in the population as a whole (early organizational ecology). By contrast, writers on strategy devote much attention to improvements in adaptability. Here we outline an approach to the measure of adaptability that focuses on organizational dispositions and routines, and is usable within large samples of firms. This approach was field tested on 909 firms in 2008 in the East of England. A follow-up survey during the severe recession and <b>shake-out</b> in 2009 provided an opportunity to assess the relationship between adaptability and survival. The results were then replicated and interpreted using a computer simulation. While preliminary, our overall findings suggest that adaptability can have a small but important effect in some circumstances. But our evidence is also consistent with a decline in adaptability in individual firms through time, and the strong overall effect of selection forces. Our interpretative methodology may signpost a route toward the reconciliation of ???selectionist??? and ???adaptationist??? views in the literature...|$|E
