50|$|Among the <b>significant</b> <b>frequency</b> pulling {{mechanisms}} {{inherent to}} the gas cell are wall-shift, buffer-gas shift, cavity-shift and light-shift. The wall-shift occurs as the gas bumps into {{the wall of the}} glass container. Wall-shift can be reduced by wall coating and compensation by buffer gas. The buffer gas shift comes from the reference atoms which bounce into buffer gas atoms such as neon and argon; these shifts can be both positive and negative. The cavity shift comes from the RF cavity, which can deform the resonance amplitude response; this depends upon cavity centre frequency and resonator Q-value. Light-shift is an effect where frequency is pulled differently depending on the light intensity, which often is modulated by the temperature shift of the rubidium lamp and filter cell.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, for compatibility, it is {{required}} to use no more bandwidth than the monochrome signal alone; the color signal has to be somehow inserted into the monochrome signal, without disturbing it. This insertion is possible because the spectrum of the monochrome TV signal is not continuous (for most typical video content), hence empty space exists which can be utilized. This typical lack of continuity results from the discrete nature of the signal, which is divided into frames and lines. (Strictly speaking, monochrome video does use the full spectrum, if arbitrary and unconstrained movement of subjects and/or cameras is permitted. Therefore, all of these color systems compromise luma quality to some extent {{in exchange for the}} addition of colorâi.e. all of these color signals look worse at some time or other than they would if the color signal were absent.) Analog color systems differ by the way in which infrequently used space in the frequency band of the signal is used. In all cases, the color signal is inserted {{at the end of the}} spectrum of the monochrome signal, where it causes less visual distortion (only affecting fine detail) in the uncommon case that the monochrome signal had <b>significant</b> <b>frequency</b> components overlapping the color signal.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} were first {{recognized}} in human lung cancer cell lines.

Another recent study demonstrated a causal role of BRG1 in the control of retinoic acid and glucocorticoid-induced cell differentiation in lung cancer and in other tumor types. This enables the cancer cell to sustain undifferentiated gene expression programs that affect the control of key cellular processes. Furthermore, it explains why lung cancer and other solid tumors are completely refractory to treatments based on these compounds that are effective therapies for some types of leukemia.The role of BRG1 in sensitivity or resistance to anti-cancer drugs had been recently highlighted by the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of darinaparsin, an arsenic-based anti-cancer drugs. Darinaparsin has been shown to induce phosphorylation of BRG1, which leads to its exclusion from the chromatin. When excluded from the chromatin, BRG1 can no longer act as a transcriptional co-regulator. This leads to the inability of cells to express HO-1, a cytoprotective enzyme.|$|E
