50|$|Not {{long after}} the opening of Disneyland in 1955, a similar <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> called the Skyway debuted, {{connecting}} Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. When Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort was opened, the same <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> was implemented as was at Tokyo Disneyland when it {{opened to the public}} in 1983. The Magic Kingdom Skyway closed in 1999, with the station in Tomorrowland demolished in 2009 and the Fantasyland station demolished in 2012.|$|R

50|$|The Disney Skyliner <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> was {{announced}} during the D23 Expo in 2017. The proposal {{was announced}} {{as part of}} the unveiling of 23 improvements to Disney Parks. The three-line system will connect Disney's Pop Century Resort, Disney's Art of Animation Resort, Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort, and the new Disney Riviera Resort to Disney's Hollywood Studios and Epcot.|$|R
40|$|The final {{integration}} {{and testing of}} the Energetic X-ray Imaging Telescope Experiment (EXITE) are described. The detector and telescope as finally assembled are described, and problems as well as solutions are detailed. The preflight calibration of the position-sensitive NaI detector revealed unanticipated effects in the energy spectra. In particular, an effect due to surface roughness (lack of firm optical polishing) on the crystal was found and calibrated. The radial variation of gain and resolution in the detector was also measured, and so-called flat fielding methods have been derived to analyze the data. The integration of the EXITE detector and <b>gondola</b> <b>systems</b> is described. Several novel features were developed for the EXITE gondola, most notably a shock absorber system. The performance of the detector and <b>gondola</b> <b>systems</b> was evaluated on a first balloon flight from Australia (May 1988) and a second flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico (October 1988) ...|$|R
25|$|At 4:50 p.m. on July 21, 2007, {{the service}} on the <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> was {{suspended}} for approximately 2 hours due to a mechanical glitch, trapping 323 people on the cable cars.

50|$|The pulse-movement <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> runs {{two sets}} of two {{unidirectional}} six-seater tandem cabins. In each direction, there are two ropes, one for carriyng {{and the other for}} hauling the cabins. The cabins stop at the terminal, and they are accelerated to line speed at 4 m/s (13 ft/s) after leaving the terminal. In case of power supply cut, a standby generator ensures the travel of the cabins to the target station at a low speed.|$|R

Mountaineer Peter Habeler and Downhill Racer Uli Spiess both come from Mayrhofen.|$|R
50|$|The Awana Skyway {{is one of}} the two aerial lines serving Genting Highlands, {{with the}} Genting Skyway serving as an {{alternate}} route. The <b>gondola</b> lift <b>system</b> was launched in 2016, and it replaces the former 2-car aerial tramway system running between 1977 and 2014. The <b>gondola</b> lift <b>system</b> can carry up to 3,600 passengers per hour with 10 passengers per gondola. At the maximum speed of 6 metres per second (21.6 km/h), the 2.8-kilometre journey up the mountain peak takes about 10 minutes, though it varies on the weather conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Disney Transport is a mass {{public transit}} {{system of the}} Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake, Florida. The {{transportation}} system provides free service to guests and consists of a monorail system, buses, watercraft, [...] a proposed <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> and parking lot trams. Most of the routes operated by Disney Transport are buses that run along the resort's public roads maintained by the Reedy Creek Improvement District and private roads. All of these modes of transportation do not charge a fare, which makes the entire network free to use.|$|R

50|$|Mechanical {{access to}} the {{mountain}} {{is limited to a}} closed, two-stage, pulse <b>gondola</b> <b>system.</b> The first lift starts at 1,450 metres, runs through one intermediate station (known as P1 at 1,800 metres) then terminates at Peyrou d'Amont (2,400 metres). The second stage of the gondola runs directly from Peyrou d'Amont to the Col des Ruillans (3,200 metres). The top of the gondola then allows access to button lift (which is the world's only fully suspended surface lift) to reach the top of the Girose Glacier (3550m). The Girose Glacier can also be reached from the resort of Les Deux Alpes on the other side, although this entails a one to two kilometre walk.|$|R
50|$|The old {{cable car}} uses a jig-back system: A large {{electric}} motor {{is located at}} the bottom of the tramway so that it effectively pulls one cabin down, using that cabin's weight to help pull the other cabin up. A similar system of cables is used in a funicular railway. The two passenger cabins are situated at opposite ends of the loops of cable. Thus, while one is coming up, the other is going down the mountain, and they pass each other midway on the cable span. It ceased its operations since 1 April 2014 to make way for the construction of an all-new monocable <b>gondola</b> <b>system</b> similar to the one used on Genting Skyway by Leitner Ropeways.|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{interesting}} efforts to address informal settlements, or favelas, are exemplified in Latin America. We are now witnessing spectacular libraries in depressed neighborhoods, <b>gondola</b> <b>systems</b> in marginalized areas, and museums in informal settlements. Following {{a long history of}} tabula rasa, public housing, self-help, and sites-and-services schemes, current approaches have evolved to include strategies characterized as urban acupuncture, making design a central component in the approach and aiming to minimize displacement while improving conditions in the area. Although current design-centered interventions could be catalysts to claim rights to the city, conversations about key issues and short- and long-term outcomes are critical: Why, where and how are these interventions operating? Based on comparative field studies in South America, this essay will illustrate the potentials and limitations of current practices in ‘slum upgrading. ...|$|R
