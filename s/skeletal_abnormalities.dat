5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E

25|$|Three main forms {{have been}} described: {{thalassemia}} major, thalassemia intermedia, and thalassemia minor. All people with thalassemia {{are susceptible to}} health complications that involve the spleen (which is often enlarged and frequently removed) and gallstones. These complications are mostly found in thalassemia major and intermedia patients. Individuals with beta thalassemia major usually present within {{the first two years}} of life with severe anemia, poor growth, and <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> during infancy. Untreated thalassemia major eventually leads to death, usually by heart failure; therefore, birth screening is very important.|$|E

25|$|Two {{forms of}} the {{disorder}} exist, dominant and recessive, of which the former is more common. Patients with the dominant version often suffer moderately from the aforementioned symptoms. Recessive cases, on the other hand, are usually more physically marked, and individuals may exhibit more <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> The recessive form is particularly frequent in Turkey. However, this can likely be explained by a common ancestor, as these patients' families {{can be traced to}} a single town in Eastern Turkey. Clusters of the autosomal recessive form have also been documented in Oman and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|Forensic {{anthropology}} is {{the application}} of the anatomical science of anthropology and its various subfields, including forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy, in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable, as might happen in a plane crash. Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental to the investigation and documentation of genocide and mass graves. Along with forensic pathologists, forensic dentists, and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses. [...] Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim's age, sex, stature, and ancestry. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> to potentially determine cause of death, past trauma such as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as bone cancer.|$|E
2500|$|For {{those with}} type-I and most type-III, enzyme {{replacement}} treatment with intravenous recombinant glucocerebrosidase can decrease liver and spleen size, reduce <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and reverse other manifestations. This treatment costs about US$200,000 annually {{for a single}} person and should be continued for life. The rarity of the disease means dose-finding studies {{have been difficult to}} conduct, so controversy remains over the optimal dose and dosing frequency. [...] Due to the low incidence, this has become an orphan drug in many countries, meaning a government recognizes and accommodates the financial constraints that limit research into drugs that address a small population.|$|E
30|$|Polyostotic fibrous {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Lichtenstein [1], as a <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormality</b> where the medullary cavities of multiple bones {{were filled with}} ‘gritty, greyish white fibrous tissue containing trabeculae of newly formed primitive bone’. It is now recognised that FD can occur as a solitary focus (monostotic form), in multiple bones (polyostotic form), {{or as part of}} the McCune–Albright syndrome. Mutations in the GNAS gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of FD, but the precise molecular and cellular mechanism remains unknown [2].|$|R
40|$|Asphyxiating {{thoracic}} dystrophy of {{the newborn}} {{is a rare}} <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Though the disease is generalized in distribution, the cartilaginous thoracic cage bears the brunt, with the results that the chest is narrow and immobile. The outcome is usually fatal early in the neonatal period. Less fre-quently the patients survive with severely impaired respiratory function only to succumb to repeated and ultimately fatal respiratory infections. The entity was first described by Jeune et al. (1954) who observed it in two sibs. Subsequently, nine more cases were reported in the Europea...|$|R
30|$|Cleft palate {{assessment}} is one possible application of CBCT for orthodontics and surgery. CBCT examination {{can be used}} to determine the volume of bone needed for grafting and the adequacy of the bone fill after surgery (Fig.  12). The smallest volume size compatible with the situation should be selected because of the reduced radiation dose [6]. A large FOV CBCT should not be used routinely for orthodontic diagnosis. For complex cases of <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormality,</b> particularly those requiring combined orthodontic/surgical management, a large FOV CBCT may be justified for planning the definitive procedure, particularly where MSCT is the current imaging method of choice [6]. In a recent systematic review of CBCT applications in orthodontics, no high-quality evidence regarding the benefits of CBCT use in orthodontics was found [44].|$|R
2500|$|First {{noted by}} Hugh W. Josephs in 1936, the {{condition}} is however named for the pediatricians Louis K. Diamond and Kenneth Blackfan, who described congenital hypoplastic anemia in 1938. [...] Responsiveness to corticosteroids was reported in 1951. In 1961, Diamond and colleagues presented longitudinal data on 30 patients and noted an association with <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> In 1997, a region on chromosome 19 was determined to carry a gene mutated in some DBA. In 1999, mutations in the ribosomal protein S19 gene (RPS19) {{were found to be}} associated with disease in 42 of 172 DBA patients. [...] In 2001, a second DBA gene was localized to a region of chromosome 8, and further genetic heterogeneity was inferred. Additional genes were subsequently identified.|$|E
2500|$|Physical growth slows {{generally}} {{around the}} age of 18 months, and stops completely by {{the age of}} 8. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>abnormalities</b> include a bell-shaped chest, a flattening or curvature of the spine, shortened long bones, and dysplasia of the hips, knees, ankles, and wrists. The bones that stabilize the connection between the head and neck can be malformed (odontoid hypoplasia); in these cases, a surgical procedure called spinal cervical bone fusion can be lifesaving. Restricted breathing, joint stiffness, and heart disease are also common. Children with the more, severe form of Morquio syndrome may not live beyond their twenties or thirties. [...] The oldest known living person with Morquios Type IV A Kenneth D. Martin died Sept. 20 2016 at Mesa, Ariz. from complications of Morquio Syndrome.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that local changes in extracellular calcium may serve a physiological role in regulating osteoblast, osteoclast, and cartilage function through the extracellular cation-sensing receptor, CasR, is gaining widespread support, but lacks definite proof. To {{examine the effects}} of CasR deficiency on the skeleton, we performed a detailed analysis of the skeleton in CasR knockout mice (CasR �/ �) and wild-type littermates (CasR �/ �). CasR ablation in the parathyroid glands of CasR �/ � mice resulted in hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Except for dwarfism, the expected skeletal manifestations of PTH excess, namely chondrodysplasia and increased mineralized bone formation and resorption, were not the main skeletal features in CasR �/� mice.

40|$|Achondroplasia, {{the most}} common and best known {{skeletal}} dysplasia, is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Like a number of other skeletal dysplasias, among which hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia, achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR 3) gene. FGFR 3 is a negative regulator of bone growth. Binding of fibroblast growth factors to the FGFR 3 receptor stimulates its tyrosine kinase activity in the cell. This activates a signal transduction pathway that regulates enchondral ossification by inhibition of cell division and stimulation of cell maturation and differentiation. Mutations in the FGFR 3 gene give rise to activation of the receptor in the absence of growth factors, thus causing abnormal long bone development. Position and type of mutation in the FGFR 3 gene determine the extent of overactivation and thus the severity of the <b>skeletal</b> <b>abnormality...</b>|$|R
