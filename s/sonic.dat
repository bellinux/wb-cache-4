5000|$|The Four <b>Sonics</b> {{performed}} extensively and headlined many {{shows in}} the Detroit area. The original Four <b>Sonics</b> grew by adding another [...] "Sonic", Johnny Dixon. But rather than renaming the group the Five <b>Sonics,</b> they chose the more creative name, [...] "Four <b>Sonics</b> + 1". According to Johnson, Johnny Dixon had an enormous singing range, going from baritone to soprano. In 1968, as the Four <b>Sonics</b> + 1, they recorded one single on the Sepia label [...] "Tell Me You're Mine" [...] backed with [...] "Lost Without You". Although Johnson had formed the Four <b>Sonics,</b> there were some internal problems. As a result there was also another release by the Four <b>Sonics</b> on Triple [...] "B" [...] {{at a time when}} Johnson was not singing with the group. The tunes on this release were [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] and [...] "Where Are You" [...] (with Dixon on lead).|$|R

5|$|According to Roger Hector, vice {{president}} and general manager of Sega Technical Institute, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of <b>Sonic</b> & Knuckles, between the releases of <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog and <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog 2.

5|$|After the Sequel was {{inspired}} by <b>Sonic</b> Heroes and other games {{both inside and outside}} the <b>Sonic</b> series, and it was developed with <b>Sonic</b> Worlds, an engine based in Multimedia Fusion 2 that reduces the amount of computer programming involved in game creation. It was released as a free download for Microsoft Windows personal computers. The game was very well received by video game journalists, who lauded its preservation of retro <b>Sonic</b> gameplay and its eclectic, 1990s-style soundtrack. The trilogy of Before the Sequel, After the Sequel, and their successor <b>Sonic</b> Chrono Adventure performed unusually well for fangames, having been downloaded 120,000 times by March 2014.|$|E

50|$|On April 18, 2015, Easy Street {{presented}} a special Record Store Day in-store {{performance by the}} legendary Northwest band, The <b>Sonics,</b> who had just released their first album in nearly 40 years, This Is The <b>Sonics.</b> Tickets went on sale {{the day before the}} event, with all proceeds going toward funding Seattle radio station KEXP’s move to larger headquarters at the Seattle Center. The event was billed as The <b>Sonics</b> (and Special Guests), which raised a great deal of speculation and excitement about who the guests would be. At 10pm on Record Store Day, with the store packed to capacity, the <b>Sonics</b> took the stage, and as night went on, they welcomed Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready, Chris Ballew (Presidents of the USA), Ben Shepherd (Soundgarden), Van Conner & Mark Pickerel (Screaming Trees), original <b>Sonics</b> bassist Andy Parypa, Calvin Johnson (Beat Happening), Matt Lukin (Mudhoney), Emily Nokes (Tacocat), Bill “Kahuna” Henderson (Girl Trouble), and Rod Moody (Swallow).

5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to <b>Sonic</b> is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in <b>Sonic</b> Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks <b>Sonic,</b> Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes <b>Sonic,</b> although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In <b>Sonic</b> Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while <b>Sonic</b> and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when <b>Sonic</b> and Tails replenish it.|$|E
5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, <b>Sonic</b> CD. Like the <b>Sonic</b> CD introduction Metal <b>Sonic,</b> an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in <b>Sonic</b> Adventure.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{is a major}} {{character}} in the <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog manga. She is the girlfriend of protagonist Nicky, whose alter ego is <b>Sonic,</b> and is unaware that they are identical. Antagonist Anton Brooke is also attracted to her; he kidnaps her a number of times, forcing Nicky to become <b>Sonic</b> and rescue her. In <b>Sonic</b> Adventures, a 1994 two-issue French comic book published by Sirène, Doctor Robotnik (Eggman) uses Amy as bait to lure <b>Sonic.</b> When <b>Sonic,</b> Amy and Tails fall into a pit of lava, they are saved by a giant ring which transports them to a different location.|$|E

5|$|Amy rescues <b>Sonic</b> from {{imprisonment}} {{and asks}} him {{to marry her}} but yet again <b>Sonic</b> refuses to in <b>Sonic</b> Adventure 2. When she looks for <b>Sonic</b> (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for <b>Sonic.</b> Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} <b>Sonic</b> the Hedgehog 2, <b>Sonic</b> and Tails {{fly over}} the ocean in Tails' biplane, the Tornado, after {{defeating}} Doctor Eggman. Beginning from this point, After the Sequel depicts <b>Sonic</b> and Tails noticing a forested island and deciding to make a landing and explore. After completing the first zone, <b>Sonic</b> finds a robot resembling Tails—a trap sprung by Eggman. The robot ensnares <b>Sonic</b> in a forcefield while Eggman steals Sonic's Chaos Emeralds. <b>Sonic</b> escapes and sets out with Tails to recover the Emeralds.|$|E
