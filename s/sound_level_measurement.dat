Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2008 to investigate the existing noise situation in Kerman. Sound levels (LMax, LMin, Leq, L 99, L 90, L 50 and L 10) were determined throughout 13 stations using <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>measurement</b> system (model, CEL- 440). Number of passing vehicles was also assessed at the sampled stations. Results: Sound level in all sampled stations was higher than Iran and World Health Organization guidelines. Comparison of Leq in different hours using statistical tests showed significant difference between different hours with 95 % confidence coefficient (P= 0. 01).

40|$|Occupational noise {{exposure}} {{is one of}} the most frequent hazards present in the workplace; up to 22 million workers have potentially hazardous {{noise exposure}}s in the U. S. As a result, noise-induced hearing loss {{is one of the}} most common occupational injuries in the U. S. Workers in manufacturing, construction, and the military are at the highest risk for hearing loss. Despite the large number of people exposed to high levels of noise at work, many occupations have not been adequately evaluated for noise exposure. The objective of this experiment was to investigate whether or not iOS smartphones and other smart devices (Apple iPhones and iPods) could be used as reliable instruments to measure noise exposures. For this experiment three different types of microphones were tested with a single model of iPod and three generations of iPhones: the internal microphones on the device, a low-end lapel microphone, and a high-end lapel microphone marketed as being compliant with the International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) standard for a Class 2 -microphone. All possible combinations of microphones and noise measurement applications were tested in a controlled environment using several different levels of pink noise ranging from 60 - 100 dBA. Results were compared to simultaneous measurements made using a Type 1 <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>measurement</b> system. Analysis of variance and Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test were used to determine if the results differed by microphone or noise measurement application. Levels measured with external microphones combined with certain noise measurement applications did not differ significantly from levels measured with the Type 1 sound measurement system. Results showed that it may be possible to use iOS smartphones and smart devices, with specific combinations of measurement applications and calibrated external microphones, to collect reliable, occupational noise exposure data under certain conditions and within the limitations of the device. Further research is needed to determine how these devices compare to traditional noise dosimeter under real-world conditions.

The annual test is a full-scale sounding of the individual siren systems around {{each of the three}} Department of Energy (DOE) sites in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The purpose of the annual test is to demonstrate and validate the siren systems&#x 27; ability to alert personnel outdoors in the Immediate Notification Zones (INZ) (approximately two miles) around each site. The success of this test is based on two critical functions of the siren system. The first function is system operability. The system is considered operable if 90 % of the sirens are operational. System diagnostics and direct field observations were used to validate the operability of the siren systems. Based on the diagnostic results and field observations, greater than 90 % of the sirens were considered operational. The second function is system audibility. The system is considered audible if the siren could be heard in the immediate notification zones around each of the three sites.

In 2003, the University of Waterloo’s Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technologies (CPATT) and the Regional Municipality of Waterloo embarked on a partnership to design quiet pavement test sections and to conduct controlled <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>measurement</b> on four different types of asphalt surface courses. Four different surface courses, two Rubberized Open Graded Friction Course Asphalt Pavements (rOFC and rOGC), Stone Mastic Asphalt Pavement (SMA), and a control mix Hot-Laid 3 (HL- 3), were placed in lengths of 600 m. The overall 2. 4 km test area was closed to traffic and test vehicles were driven through the test area at the prescribed control speeds with sound level meters recording sound levels both at the tire/pavement interface {{as well as at}} the monitoring stations off the roadway. Impedance Tube Method and Reverberation Time Method were performed to determine the sound absorption coefficients of the pavement mixes. In order to evaluate the sound attenuation ability of the mixes, the results from rOFC, rOGC, and SMA were used to compare with the result from the control mix HL- 3. Statistical analysis of measurement results was performed to see whether the differences between mixes are significant at a 95 % confidence interval. Life cycle cost analysis was also performed in order to determine the cost effectiveness of each asphalt mix. Results indicate that traffic sound level increases as vehicle speed and size increase regardless of asphalt types. rOFC and rOGC perform significantly better than HL- 3, but the performance slightly deteriorate after one year because of the clogging problem. SMA does not attenuate sound as effectively when compare to HL- 3 at the early age. However, sound attenuation ability improves after one year of service. Overall result indicates that rOGC performs the best among all mixes in terms of the sound attenuation ability. Life cycle cost analysis shows that HL- 3 is the most economical mix but it is the worst mix in terms of sound attenuation ability. It is recommended to conduct additional sound level and skid resistance measurements in the future to monitor the long-term pavement performance. Also investigation of the relationship between the sound level and sound absorption coefficient measurements is beneficial for the future acoustical evaluation for the asphalt mix...|$|E
