40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) refers to all {{conditions}} of the kidney, lasting at least three months, where a person has had evidence of kidney damage and/or reduced kidney function, regardless of the specific diagnosis of disease or condition causing the disease 1. Five stages of CKD are defined and patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or stage 5 require renal replacement therapy: regular dialysis or a kidney transplant. Of the two main types of dialysis, peritoneal and haemodialysis, haemodialysis accounts for most hospitalisations due to the <b>specialised</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>required.</b> The prevalence of ESKD in Queensland can be determined {{using data from the}} Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) 2 - 6. The incidence and prevalence of treated CKD in the community will be underestimated, as not everyone with ESKD will be eligible for, or take up renal replacement therapy. In Queensland, the number of new patients for renal replacement therapy increased from 305 in 1999 to 508 in 2008 (Figure 1). The age-standardised incidence rate followed a similar trend, reaching a maximum of 121 per 1, 000, 000 in 2006 before falling slightly to 118 pe...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the initial}} {{association}} of the Panton Valentine leucocidin (PVL) toxin with highly virulent strains of Staphylococcus mtreus found in the community, a film epidemiological link has been established between the PVL encoding genes and community-acquired strains of both meticillin resistant (CA-MRSA) and susceptible (CA-MSSA) Staphylococcus mtreus. While most research has predominantly concentrated on the genotyping of CA-MRSA strains, PVL-MSSA appear to pose an increasing public health risk. CUlTently though, there exists a deatih of epidemiological data on PVL-MSSA strains, {{particularly with regard to}} the lukS and lukF genes which encode the PVL toxin. This first aim of the present study therefore was to explore the genetic diversity of a group of PVL-MSSA clinical local isolates in order to contribute to the limited current data and provide insight into the evolution and emergence of PVL-MRSA isolates. In addition, as CUlTent typing systems are cumbersome, time consuming and expensive, this present study was also aimed at the development of a rapid high resolution melt (HRM) typing system for the characterisation ofPVL-positive isolates. The PVL toxin is encoded for by two highly conserved adjacent genes (lukF and lukS) which are cotranscribed. Variations in these genes correlate with a strain's genotype. Therefore, the present study set out to genotype isolates based on the four major SNPs at positions 527 and 663 of the lukS gene and 1396 and 1729 of the lukF gene. The final aim ofthe present study was the development of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (for the detection and quantification of both PVL and alpha haemolysin) that has potential application in clinical diagnosis and as a research tool. Characterisation of a collection of UK PVL-MSSA isolates by MLST and spa typing which is presented in the present study, showed a genetic similarity to circulating PVL-MRSA strains, with 94. 7 % of the isolates belonging to CA-MRSA related genetic backgrounds (STl, ST 22, ST 30, ST 772 and ST 88). Three novel spa types (t 6642, t 6643 and t 6769) and a novel ST (ST 1518) were however detected in this population. Furthelmore, the presence of identical PVL phages and haplotypes in the PVL-MSSA isolates to those previously described in PVL-MRSA isolates point 2 strongly at the role these strains may play as precursors of emerging lineages of clinical significance. The HRM assay developed in this study was able to accurately genotype PVL-positive isolates based on the double allelic variations in both the lukS and lukF genes. The high degree of sensitivity of this technique was clearly demonstrated by its ability to differentiate between the lukS AS 27 /G 663 and Gs 27 /T 663 genotypes which theoretically should have the same melt temperature. Despite the issues in data interpretation, which arose following attempts to improve the discrimination of this technique by the addition of a third locus (spa), the technique still showed potential as a useful tool for the rapid genotyping of PVL-positive isolates. While HRM was useful in rapidly detecting and genotyping PVL-positive isolates, the actual level of protein production of both PVL and HLA toxins could only be determined following the development and validation in the present study of a simple competitive ELISA platform which exploited the high affinity biotinistreptavidin interaction to improve sensitivity. This technique would be especially useful in settings which lack the <b>specialised</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>required</b> for genetic studies like HRM. In summary, in addition to contributing to the limited epidemiological information about PVL-MSSA strains and demonstrating a clear role for these strains in the evolution of PVL-MRSA strains, the present study has developed two distinct methods to aid the study of S. aureus PVL producing strains which are becoming a significant healthcare problem worldwide. The present study will contribute to our understanding of these strains and to the development of intervention strategies to curb their spread and threat.

40|$|Purpose: To {{inventory}} {{the examination}} methods available to assess antero-medial rotational laxity (AMRL) {{of the knee}} following medial collateral ligament injury. Methods: Searches were conducted {{in accordance with the}} PRISMA guidelines and using four online databases: WEB OF SCIENCE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and AMED. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme guidelines for Diagnostic Test Studies were used for the quality assessment of the articles. Results: A total of 2241 articles were identified from the database searches. From this, four articles were included in the final review. All were case–control studies, considered a combined ACL/MCL injury and had small study populations. <b>Specialised</b> <b>equipment</b> was <b>required</b> in all studies, and one needed additional imaging support before measurements could be taken. Two employed commercially available measuring equipment as part of the assessment process. Conclusion: Clinical assessment of AMRL in relation to a MCL injury remains challenging. Although methods have been developed to support clinical examination, they are limited by a number of factors, including the need for additional time in the clinical environment when setting up equipment, the need for specific equipment to produce and measure rotational movement and imaging support. In addition, there are patient safety concerns from the repeated imaging. A reliable and valid clinical examination remains to be found to truly assess antero-medial rotational laxity of the knee...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. This study focuses its {{attention}} on conducted common mode EMI. Common mode current {{is the current}} that flows from an electrical circuit to a zero reference plane {{and back to the}} circuit again. It is known that {{the manner in which the}} common mode current flows is through stray capacitances that form between the electrical circuit and the zero reference. This study was aimed at developing a method to measure the value of the stray capacitance of a switching circuit. Determining the value of the stray capacitance by taking physical measurements on a circuit board is a challenge for a number of reasons, one of which is that great care should be taken not to add to the stray capacitance by means of the measuring equipment. By measuring the value of the stray capacitance, it will be possible to model the occurrence of Common Mode EMI better and more accurately. This could, in turn, lead to a reduction in EMI. Any body of an arbitrary shape, size and material exhibits a self-capacitance with respect to a zero reference frame. This principle, together with the principle of conservation of charge, also applies to electrical components, or circuits as a whole. The experimental work was performed on a buck DC-DC converter. The circuit was simplified to aid in analysis. By varying the value of an external capacitance and taking basic measurements, it is then possible to uniquely determine the absolute values of the self-capacitances. For every pair of external capacitance values placed in the circuit (of which one can be = 0 pF), a value for stray capacitance is calculated. Many data points were recorded with many different external capacitors in the circuit, resulting in a variety of stray capacitance values. In order to obtain a single value, a weighted mean of all the values was calculated. The values obtained in this proposed method of measuring the stray capacitance compares well with that obtained using the Finite Element Method. The advantage of the method presented here is that the self-capacitances are determined under the actual operational conditions, no <b>specialised</b> <b>equipment</b> is <b>required</b> and no unique handling of parasitics is needed. The method relies on very simple measurements and no complex data manipulations are required...|$|R
