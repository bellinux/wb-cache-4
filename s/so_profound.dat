5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are <b>so</b> <b>profound</b> that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E

Lewis’ white queen gained the aura of historical accuracy through primary research without sacrificing its symbolic links to abolitionism, black Africa, or black diaspora. But what it refused to facilitate was the racial objectification of the artist’s body. Lewis could not so readily become the subject of her own representation if her subject was corporeally white.|$|E

25|$|When Laurence Olivier {{gave his}} {{acclaimed}} performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre (UK) in 1964, {{he had developed}} a case of stage fright that was <b>so</b> <b>profound</b> {{that when he was}} alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film — Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, physics {{had evolved}} to the point at which {{classical}} mechanics could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. <b>So</b> <b>profound</b> were these and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories—the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear—and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as Hendrik Lorentz, Emil Cohn, Ernst Wiechert and Wilhelm Wien believed that some modification of Maxwell's equations might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of classical physics were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as modern physics.|$|E

40|$|The clearest {{exposition}} {{of the life}} and teachings of the diminutive Carmelite Friar whose influence has been <b>so</b> very <b>profound.</b> Men celebrated by later generations normally achieve fame through their contribution to a particular area of human endeavour. San Juan de la Cruz (1542 - 91) achieved greatness on two counts; {{in the realm of}} spirituality, as a mystic; in literature, as a poet. He stands at a high peak in the mystical tradition of the Christian west. The Mystical Doctor of The Roman Catholic Church, he is also regarded by many {{as one of the greatest}} lyrical poets that Spain has ever produced. To understand and explore his work, both sides of his achievement must be examined. In this book, Steven Payne shows how the roots of the Western mystical tradition go very deep and the discovery of Dionysius profoundly altered the direction of this tradition.

The latter country had long been seen negatively by many Americans, a legacy of its colonial role that was refreshed by its Civil War neutrality, when British-built raiders such as the Alabama preyed on US-flagged ships. In spite of these past differences, according to Taliaferro, [...] "rapprochement made more sense {{than at any time in}} their respective histories". In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897, Hay echoed these points, [...] "The great body of people in the United States and England are friends... that intense respect and reverence for order, liberty, and law which is <b>so</b> <b>profound</b> a sentiment in both countries". Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.|$|E

500|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onward, {{many of the}} Yale School of critics {{describe}} the poem as a reworking of John Milton's poetic diction, but, they argued, that poem revealed that Keats lacked the ability of Milton as a poet. The critics, Harold Bloom (1965), Leslie Brisman (1973), Paul Fry (1980), John Hollander (1981) and Cynthia Chase (1985), all focused on the poem with Milton as a progenitor to [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] while ignoring other possibilities, including Shakespeare who was emphasised as being the source of many of Keats's phrases. Responding to the claims about Milton and Keats's shortcomings, critics like R. S. White (1981) and Willard Spiegelman (1983) used the Shakespearean echoes to argue for a multiplicity of sources for the poem to claim that Keats {{was not trying to}} respond just to Milton or escape from his shadow. Instead, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was an original poem, as White claimed, [...] "The poem is richly saturated in Shakespeare, yet the assimilations are <b>so</b> <b>profound</b> that the Ode is finally original, and wholly Keatsian". Similarly, Spiegelman claimed that Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream had [...] "flavored and ripened the later poem". This was followed in 1986 by Jonathan Bate claiming that Keats was [...] "left enriched by the voice of Shakespeare, the 'immortal bird'".|$|E
