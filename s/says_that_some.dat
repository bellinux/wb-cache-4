Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E
25|$|The axiom schema of {{collection}} {{is closely related}} to and frequently confused with the axiom schema of replacement.

So Rabbi Moses of Coucy <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> do not use the tefillin ("phylacteries") on the Ninth Day of Av, a custom which later was universally observed (it is now postponed until the afternoon). In this manner all customs originally designated as marks of unusual piety finally became the rule for all.|$|E

One {{unconfirmed}} report <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> were on the strength of the Romanian dictator Antonescu's bodyguard unit (Batalionul de gardă al mareşalului Antonescu or Regimentul de gardă al Conducătorului Statului). Supposedly three were destroyed during American bombing of Ploieşti in the summer of 1944 while being serviced at the depot there.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of al-Qādisiyyah (636 CE) and the Battle of Nihavānd (642 CE) were {{instrumental}} {{to the collapse}} of the Sassanid Empire and state-sponsored Zoroastrianism; destruction or conversion (mosques) of some fire temples in Greater Iran followed. The faith was practiced largely by the aristocracy but large numbers of fire temples did not exist. Some fire temples continued with their original purpose although many Zoroastrians fled. Legend <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> took fire with them and it most probably served as a reminder of their faith in an increasingly persecuted community since fire originating from a temple was not a tenet of the religious practice.|$|E

25|$|Sexual arousal from {{watching}} animals mate {{is known as}} faunoiphilia. A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals mate is cited {{as an indicator of}} latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). Sexual fantasies about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality..|$|E

500|$|Scott Lobdell {{claims that}} it is more often the fans, rather than editors, that have {{stronger}} negative reaction to LGBT issues. Moore notes however, that [...] "it's probably quite fashionable... to have the odd gay character," [...] and that the inclusion of LGBT people continues to improve in mainstream comics, but that the characters continue to be limited by stereotypes and do not represent a varied cross-section of LGBT people. Greg Rucka <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> scenes of same-sex interactions are rejected by editors due to unease with sexual content in general rather than the LGBT content.|$|E
500|$|The stag and the eagle, {{which are}} popular motifs of 10th-century Magyar art, have close analogies in Scythian art. [...] The Scythians, Sarmatians, and other peoples who spoke Iranian {{languages}} dominated the Eurasian steppes between around [...] and [...] During this period, all {{ethnic groups in}} the steppes were nomads with almost identical material cultures, for which the certain identification of the Magyars is impossible. Consequently, the location of their original homeland is subject to scholarly debates. Róna-Tas says the development of Hungarian started in the region of the rivers Kama and Volga, west of the Urals. Archaeologist István Fodor writes that the original homeland lay to the east of the Urals. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> features of the tumuli erected at Chelyabinsk in the , including the northward orientation of the heads of the deceased and the geometric motifs on the clay vessels put in the graves, are similar to older burials that he attributes to Ugric peoples.|$|E
500|$|Songwriting for Augie March is {{primarily}} initiated by Richards; he delivers demos {{to the rest}} of the band members who then collaborate with him to develop the music. Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph suggests [...] "almost every songwriter in Australia has name-checked [...] as one of the finest tunesmiths of his generation" [...] and that [...] "Richards is a storyteller who is spoken of in reverential terms by peers". Richards simply states that he enjoys [...] "dabbling with words", and that people often appreciate him doing so. Despite this, Richards rejects the [...] "literary" [...] reputation he believes the band have gained. At the 2006 ARIA Awards, Midnight Oil's Rob Hirst called for more political songs; Richards told Simon Collins of The West Australian he saw great risk in writing political music, and would rather write music that rung true, so that [...] "I can sing the song a thousand times after it's been written". Richards asserts he preferred to draw on everyday experiences than on literary influences. He also <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the music he writes is intentionally confusing.|$|E

500|$|Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all {{defend the}} episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, [...] "I am very, {{very proud of}} the job I did on this episode. This is the best episode of {{television}} I feel I ever wrote." [...] He describes the episode as a commentary on [...] "people who like things just the way they are", and remarks, [...] "It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it." [...] However, Keeler <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E
500|$|Kenrick {{prefers the}} 1964 Lincoln Center cast {{recording}} {{to the earlier}} ones, especially approving of the performances of Risë Stevens as Anna and Patricia Neway as Lady Thiang. The inclusion on that recording, for the first time, of [...] "The Small House of Uncle Thomas", was notable because LP technology limited a single-disc album to about fifty minutes, and thus inclusion of the ballet required the exclusion {{of some of the}} other numbers. [...] Kenrick finds the recording of the 1977 Broadway revival cast to be [...] "asily the most satisfying King & I on CD". [...] He judges it to be Brynner's best performance, calling Towers [...] "great" [...] and Martin Vidnovic, June Angela {{and the rest of the}} supporting cast [...] "fabulous", though lamenting the omission of the ballet. [...] Hischak, in contrast, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> might prefer Brynner in his earlier recordings, when he was [...] "more vibrant". Kenrick enjoys the 1992 Angel studio recording mostly for the Anna of Julie Andrews, who he says is [...] "pure magic" [...] in a role she never performed on stage. Kenrick praises the performance of both stars on the 1996 Broadway revival recording, calling Lou Diamond Phillips [...] "that rarity, a King who can stand free of Brynner's shadow". Hischak finds the soundtrack to the 1999 animated film with Christiane Noll as Anna and Martin Vidnovic as the King, as well as Barbra Streisand singing on one track, more enjoyable than the movie itself, but Kenrick writes that his sole use for that CD is as a coaster.|$|E
