40|$|The {{prediction}} {{model for the}} ratio of skid numbers obtained with the ribbed E 501 test tire to those obtained with the blank E 524 test tire at any speed has been developed using data from 22 pavement test sites in Pennsylvania. The prediction {{is based on the}} Penn State Model for skid resistance-speed behavior. The model was developed as a function of a macrotexture parameter defined by <b>sand-patch</b> mean <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> (MTD). An application of this model permits the prediction of the blank-tire skid number at any speed from a measured ribbed-tire skid number and a macrotexture measurement. A simplified model for the blank-tire skid number at 64 km/h (40 mph) test speed was also developed. Values calculated from both models show good agreement with each other {{as well as with the}} actual data. Another effort in this study was to relate skid resistance measured with both types of test tires to pavement texture. The results show a strong relationship between skid numbers with both test tires and pavement macrotexture and microtexture. Therefore, if a pavement skid-resistance survey is performed with both the blank E 524 and the ribbed E 501 test tires, the levels of macrotexture and microtexture can readily be estimated. The seasonal and short-term variations in data with the two tires also were compared. It was found that the short-term variations in the blank tire data do not pose at great a problem as those in the ribbed tire data...|$|R

Road Administrations face the problems of dealing with data acquired by different methods and, in addition to that, the repeatability and reproducibility of the results. This paper presents an analysis of test methods used for <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> evaluation in Portugal: the volumetric patch method and two methods based on surface profiles. Hence, three roads with low (dense asphalt), medium (“open texture asphalt”) and high (porous asphalt) <b>texture</b> <b>depths</b> were selected, where five profilometers made five runs. Two subsections of 150 m length were also selected to carry out the volumetric patch test. The texture indicators analysed were: the mean <b>texture</b> <b>depth,</b> the mean profile depth and the sensor measured <b>texture</b> <b>depth.</b> The average and the standard deviation were the statistical parameters used for the analysis. The results obtained for each method are significantly different and a good correlation between the mean profile depth and the sensor measured <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> was established...|$|R

40|$|Chipseal is {{the most}} common road surface in New Zealand due to its low cost and high {{performance}} monitoring. One of the parameters surveyed is the road <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> which is currently measured by a volumetric technique known as the circular sand patch method, a method that is slow to perform, requires traffic control and depends on operator skill. The objective of our research is to design and build a portable device able to estimate the <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> and evaluate its performance by correlating the results with the depths obtained with the sand patch method. The method chosen falls under the circular texture meters (CTM) category where a surface profile is acquired using a laser displacement sensor mounted on an arm that is rotated around an axis. The mechanical design follows the specifications from current practice established by a number of standards in Australia, USA and Europe. Profile processing is realized on board by a purpose built embedded system the results are available to the operator on an LCD display. Parameters used in estimation of <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> are the standardized mean profile depth (MPD) and three parameters borrowed from surface metrology: average roughness (Ra), average square roughness (Rq) and average maximum height (Rz) which was redefined to allow for shorter CTM profiles. Algorithms were first developed into a Matlab toolbox then ported to the embedded system. The efficiency of the parameters was determined by the extent of how parameters correlate with <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> obtained with the sand patch method characterised by the slope α and the intercept β of the linear relation that result in the best r-square for the parameter. The intercept was derived from mean of the parameters measured over a flat surface. The slope was estimated firstly from a test area of one square meter where sand patch <b>texture</b> <b>depths</b> were obtained and a number of profiles were recorded. Secondly, the slope was estimated from tracks acquired from a variety of sites using the correlation method with the intercept being constrained to the value found from the flat surface measurements. The results show that all parameters have an improved r-square when a second order fit is applied to the profile segments. The slopes estimated with the correlation method are in average 67 % percent smaller than the slopes projected with the square meter test. Considering both the coefficient of determination of the correlations and the slope, the circular texture meter returns best estimates from the average maximum height when a second order fit is applied to the profile segments...|$|R

In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation among <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of multiview images. More specifically, suppose we are given a coding tool to encode <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps at the encoder and a view-synthesis tool to construct intermediate views at the decoder using neighboring encoded <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps. Our goal is to determine how to best select captured views for encoding and distribute available bits among <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of se-lected coded views, such that the visual distortion of desired con-structed views is minimized. First, in order to obtain at the encoder a low complexity estimate of the visual quality {{of a large number of}} desired synthesized views, we derive a cubic distortion model based on basic DIBR properties, whose parameters are obtained using only a small number of viewpoint samples. Then, we demon-strate that the optimal selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps is equivalent to the shortest path in a specially constructed 3 -D trellis. Finally, we show that, using the assumptions of monotonicity in the predictor’s quantization level and distance, suboptimal solutions can be ef-ficiently pruned from the feasible space during solution search. Experiments show that our proposed efficient selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps outperforms an alternative scheme using constant quanti-zation levels for all maps (commonly used in video standard im-plementations) by up to 1. 5 dB.

Unlike <b>texture,</b> <b>depth</b> video is a gray scale map that represents {{the distance between the}} camera and 3 D points in a scene. Existing multiview video coding (MVC) techniques including 3 D- High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard encode both <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> videos jointly by exploiting texture video information for the corresponding depth video coding (DVC) to reduce computational time as the <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> videos have motion similarity in representing the same scene. This strategy has two limitations: (i) more bits and computational time might be required due to the large residuals for the misalignment between <b>depth</b> and <b>texture</b> edges and (ii) switching between different views may require more times due to the increased dependency between <b>texture</b> and <b>depth.</b> In this paper, we propose an independent DVC technique using HEVC (a video coding standard for single view) so that we can improve the rate distortion (RD) performance and reduce computational time by improving switching speed. For this, we use motion features to reduce a number of motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC) modes in HEVC. As we use motion feature which is the underlying criteria for selecting different modes in the standard and then we select a subset of modes which can provide almost the same RD performance.

The problem gets exacerbated during wet weather. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that about 70 % of wet pavement crashes {{can be prevented}} or minimized by improving pavement friction. High Friction Surface Treatment (HFST), a specially-designed thin surface application of hard aggregates and thermosetting resins like epoxy, has been proven {{to be an effective}} method to increase road surface friction.

However, the bitrate over-head required for reconstruction of multiple <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps at decoder can be large. The performance of multiview video en-coders such as MVC {{is limited by}} the simple fact that the chosen representation is inherently redundant: a <b>texture</b> or <b>depth</b> pixel visible from both camera viewpoints is represented twice. In this paper, we propose an alternative 3 D scene representation without such redundancy, yet at decoder, one can still reconstruct <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of two camera viewpoints for DIBR-based synthe-sis of intermediate views. In particular, we propose to first encode <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> videos of a single viewpoint, which are used to synthesize the uncoded viewpoint via DIBR at decoder. Then, we encode additional rate-distortion (RD) optimal auxiliary infor-mation (AI) to guide an inpainting-based hole-filling algorithm at decoder and complete the missing information due to disocclu-sion. For a missing pixel patch in the synthesized view, the AI can: i) be skipped and then let the decoder by itself retrieve the missing information, ii) identify a suitable spatial region in the reconstructed view for patch-matching, or iii) explicitly encode missing pixel patch if no satisfactory patch {{can be found in the}} reconstructed view.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{compression of}} multi-view-video-plus-depth (MVD) data raises the bit-rate allocation {{issue for the}} com-pression of <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> data. This question has not been solved yet because not all surveys reckon on a shared frame-work. This paper studies the impact of bit-rate allocation for <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> data relying {{on the quality of}} an interme-diate synthesized view. The results show that depending on the acquisition configuration, the synthesized views require a different ratio between the <b>depth</b> and <b>texture</b> bit-rate: be-tween 40 % and 60 % of the total bit-rate should be allocated to depth...|$|R
50|$|While {{it is not}} {{possible}} to create a stereo image on a standard display without special equipment, it is possible to create an image with enhanced <b>texture</b> and <b>depth.</b> The parallax scanning lens technology creates autostereoscopic moving images with enhanced <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> on standard displays (television, movie screens and computer monitors) without the necessity of special screens or the use of viewing glasses. Images can be recorded on normal film or videotape using industry standard camera systems. The image depth enhancement is accomplished entirely by the lens using parallax scanning technology.|$|R
