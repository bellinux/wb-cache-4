25|$|However, due to {{the rise}} in {{tensions}} between the East and West over the political landscape of Europe, the threat from the Soviet Union in 1949 and 1950, coinciding with {{the start of the}} Cold War, led to a return to the militaristic policy by the Swedish government. From 1950 until around 1976 the size of the army was at an average of 250 000 soldiers with a peak of 400 000 active duty soldiers during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The mandatory period of service during this period was 22 months for non-educated conscripts and 14 months for college educated ones, with 30 years in the reserve and 30 days of reserve service obligation per 18 months. The compulsory <b>service</b> <b>period</b> included 2 months of basic training and 3 months of advanced occupational training. The rules were badly enforced, but dodging the draft was punishable with a year of imprisonment and the refusal of state social welfare benefits. Only in 1976–77 was there a change in policy where the compulsory <b>service</b> <b>period</b> of all conscripts was reduced and equalized at 14 months.|$|E
25|$|Permanent {{service is}} based on a {{contractual}} agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.

The number of female volunteers to annually enter armed service had stabilised at approximately 300. The <b>service</b> <b>period</b> is 165, 255 or 347 days for the rank and file conscripts and 347 days for conscripts trained as NCOs or reserve officers. The length of civilian service is always twelve months. Those electing to serve unarmed in duties where unarmed service is possible serve either nine or twelve months, depending on their training.|$|E
25|$|The 19th Cavalry was {{constituted}} on 24 October 1967 in the Hawaii Army National Guard as {{a parent}} regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS). It was organized and Federally recognized on 17 December 1967 at Wahiawa to consist of Troop E, part of the 29th Infantry Brigade. During the Vietnam War in May 1968, the 29th Brigade was mobilized for active Federal service {{to serve as the}} strategic reserve for United States Army Pacific. Troop E was ordered into active Federal service on 13 May 1968 at Wahiawa, under the command of Captain Kazumasa Ota. The troop spent its active <b>service</b> <b>period</b> training at Schofield Barracks, and was also equipped with the M114A1 armored fighting vehicle at the time. In June, the troop received ten M551 Sheridan tanks, the first time the Sheridan was sent outside of the continental United States.

2500|$|As the war progressed, Portugal rapidly {{increased}} its mobilized forces. Under the Salazar regime, a military draft required all males to serve {{three years of}} obligatory military service; many of those called up to active military duty were deployed to combat zones in Portugal's African overseas provinces. [...] The national <b>service</b> <b>period</b> was increased to four years in 1967, and virtually all conscripts faced a mandatory two-year tour of service in Africa. [...] The existence of the draft and likelihood of combat in African counterinsurgency operations would over time result in {{a sharp increase in}} emigration by Portuguese men seeking to avoid such service. [...] By the end of the Portuguese colonial war in 1974, black African participation had become crucial due to declining numbers of recruits available from Portugal itself.|$|E
2500|$|Port Victors initial <b>service</b> <b>period</b> proved eventful. Her first {{recorded}} voyage to Australia {{took place in}} December 1885, carrying eight cabin- and six steerage-class passengers {{in addition to her}} cargoes.

The firm in question quickly sued the paper for libel, and in August 1887, won damages of £250 in a split jury decision. The Argus however maintained that it had been correct to publish the story, citing public safety and noting that public pressure had since forced the shipping firm in question {{to reduce the amount of}} the chemical shipped in individual vessels.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, however, {{there was already}} a {{perception}} that guerrilla type conflicts would erupt {{in some of the}} Portuguese African territories, leading the Portuguese Army to re-orient its strategy and reorganize its forces in the Overseas, at the same type preparing its forces in Europe to be able reinforce the Overseas. As part of this, the 9th Infantry Regiment in Lamego was transformed in the Special Operations Training Centre, intended to provide counter insurgency and guerrilla warfare training. The Army territorial organization that was implemented when the Overseas war erupted, divided the Portuguese national territory (Metropolitan and Overseas) in military regions (that could be subdivided in territorial commands) and in independent territorial commands. Angola and Mozambique constituted military regions commanded by generals, subdivided in territorial commands, while the other Overseas provinces - including Portuguese Guinea - constituted independent territorial commands (The exception was São Tomé and Príncipe which constituted a territorial command of the Angolan military region, until becoming an independent command in 1962). The Overseas military regions and territorial commands included units of the normal garrison (regiments, battalions and others), which constituted the permanent territorial administrative bodies responsible for the mobilization and preparation of active troops. The active troops themselves were organized in formations and units raised by the normal garrison units. Besides the local raised active units, many of these were raised by the European Portuguese regiments and deployed to the Overseas, being referred as [...] "reinforcement units". The active units were temporary units - mainly formed with conscripts framed by a small cadre of career officers and NCOs - that existed only during the tour of duty or active military <b>service</b> <b>period</b> of their elements (usually two years). When their period of existence was near the end, these units were replaced in the field by newly raised similar units, then returning to their parent regiment's barracks, where they were formally disbanded, their conscripts being licensed and their career elements being transferred to other units. The majority of active units employed in the Overseas War were light infantry units, designed for the counterinsurgency role, designated as caçadores (similar units raised by cavalry and artillery regiments had the designation of their respective branches, although trained, equipped and organized as caçadores). These were organized in companies of caçadores that could be independent or be grouped in battalions of caçadores. Besides the caçadores units, the Portuguese Army also raised and fielded regimental-level battlegroups (agrupamentos) headquarters and a number of specialized units (including units of field artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, armored reconnaissance, military police, engineering, signals, mortars, recoilless guns and combat support services). The Army also raised special forces and was involved in the organization of a number of irregular forces. The Army's special forces in the initial stages of the War were the Special Caçadores companies, raised by the 5th (Lisbon) and 10th (Chaves) Caçadores battalions, with specially selected personnel that then received their training in the Special Operations Training Centre. The Army lobby against the special forces prevailed however, with these units ceasing to be raised in 1962, with the intention that all normal caçadores units would receive the same training as the disbanded special caçadores. However, this proved infeasible and the lack of special forces made quickly felt, with some units mitigating this issue by raising informal special forces sub-units with selected personnel, with some of these being referred as [...] "commandos". The Commandos would soon be formalized in Angola and then in the other theatres. From 1966, a special anti-guerrilla horse unit (the Angola Dragoons) also existed.|$|E
