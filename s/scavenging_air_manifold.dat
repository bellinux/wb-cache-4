40|$|Maintenance {{is today}} an {{increasing}} {{part of the}} shipping industry. The demand for safer operations, lower emissions and low downtime is constantly increasing. As {{a result of this}} more complicated and complex system is developed and the focus on maintenance and efficient operations {{is becoming more and more}} important. As a result of this, models such as the TCI concept has been invented. The TCI concept is based on condition monitoring of the combustion process in the cylinder and the involved equipment. The objective is to detect slowly developing deviations in parameters related to efficiency, safety and environmental condition of the propulsion function. This is done through monthly measurements by the crew and sent to the TeCoMan database for processing. There the measurements are normalized for engine load and ambient conditions to be able to compare the results with reference values collected from the sea trial and equipment manufacturer. The measurements is then transformed to TCI’s which can be explored by the crew and administrators in the TeCoMan program. The TCI value reflect the severity of the performance and will decide what actions needs to be taken, and makes it possible for the crew and administrators to plan the maintenance The problem with the TCI model has been the "noisy" behaviour for the different parameters and the goal for this thesis has been to address this problem. Data from the TOCC project has been used throughout the project, one series of seven ship and one series of four ships. A in- depth study and a sensitivity analysis to study the influence of the correction factors has been done, where the mean effective pressure, cylinder pressure and the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> pressure are the factors that were found to have the biggest influence. To identify the reason for the noisy behaviour each ship was studied to find the root cause. For the series with seven ships, erroneous measurements for both the parameters itself and the correction factors, are the main factor for the variations in the efficiency TCI’s. This errors results in large deviations for the corrected values and thus low TCI values. For the degradation it is the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> filter pressure drop and fuel pump index which have the lowest TCI’s. For the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> filter the low performance is due to the varying measurements done by the U-tube manometer. For the fuel pump index the corrected values are wrong due to a fuel flow of 0 m 3 /h. For the second series the large variations in both the measured parameters and the parameters used for correction, such as mean effective pressure and cylinder power, are the cause for the low TCI’s for both the efficiency and the degradation. With defined limits for the parameters based on expert opinions a large portion of the erroneous measurements would be eliminated. Also adjustment of reference and correction values for each ship due to individual differences could enhance the TCI performance. For the second series the routines for the different measurements needs to be improved. Good procedures and trained workers will help to keep the variations at a minimum. For unstable parameters lower weighted sum can be used to decrease the influence to aggregated systems. </p...|$|R
50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} blower for scavenging {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal turbo-compressors, including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate <b>scavenging</b> <b>air.</b> As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning clutch disengages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Measurements of {{pollutants}} <b>scavenged</b> from <b>air</b> masses over southern Svalbard in summer precipitation are presented. Rainfall was sampled in July and August 2002 at Calypsobyen, Bellsund. Specific conductivity (SpC) and pH were measured and ion con− centrations {{were determined by}} ion chromatography. Ions of marine origin were subtracted, assuming that all chlorides were of marine origin. The FLEXTRA trajectory model was ap− plied to discover the sources of air masses arriving at Svalbard and track the paths of pollut− ant transport. Average (v/w) rainfall pH was 4. 94, mean SpC amounted to 34. 8  μS cm− 1. To− tal dissolved solids concentration (TDS) ranged from 12. 6 to 67  mg L− 1, with ions of marine origin (Cl−, Na+, Mg 2 +) prevailing. Rains with {{the highest percentage of}} marine salts oc− curred with winds from the East at above average velocities. Non−sea salt (nss) sulphate concentrations ranged from 0. 5 μeq L− 1 to 23  μeq L− 1, (v/w) average was 17  μeq L− 1. Nitrate concentrations ranged from 0 to 24 μeq L− 1. The highest concentrations of nss−SO 42 − and NO 3 − were measured on 25 August, when the highest rainfall occurred (27  mm) and pH was the lowest (4. 65).

40|$|Abstract—Air–fuel {{ratio control}} is a {{challenging}} control problem for port-fuel-injected and throttle-body-fuel-injected spark igni-tion (SI) engines, since the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>manifold</b> and fuel injec-tion of the SI engines are highly nonlinear and often with unmod-eled uncertainties and disturbance.

When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas control valve would close and another control valve would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third control valve {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system. In this manner, as CO 2 was consumed by the algae, additional CO 2 was automatically fed into the system as needed to maintain the desired operating pH.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to establish a new approach for prediction of the marine diesel engine emissions based on ANNs. The marine engine exhaust emissions were measured for different engine loads conditions according to the IMO technical code. According to the results, the network performance is sufficient for all emission outputs. In the network, engine speed (N), engine load (L), fuel flow rate (FFR), air mass flow rate (AMR), <b>scavenge</b> <b>air</b> pressure(SAR), maximum injection pressure (MIP), electronic parameters and environmental conditions were taken as the input parameters, and the values of emissions were used as the output parameters. The R 2 values of the modeling were 0. 98, and the mean % errors were smaller. However, filter smoke number (FSN) higher mean errors were obtained due to the complexity of the burning process and the measurement errors.

5000|$|The Humphrey pump {{could operate}} {{with either a}} {{four-stroke}} or two-stroke cycle. [...] Their normal operation was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and scavenge valves open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression cycle afterwards. A two-stroke cycle was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a Humphrey pump has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the oscillating water column. As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate <b>scavenge</b> <b>air</b> valve.|$|R

Lower temperatures require larger heating power on board, hence a larger demand for waste heat usage, to cover services and maintaining on board spaces temperatures. However, a lower heat rejection temperature increases the WHRS thermal efficiency.
