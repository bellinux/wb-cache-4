5|$|The first Prussian corps {{to arrive}} in {{strength}} was Bülow's IV Corps. Bülow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended {{to use as a}} <b>springboard</b> into the rear of the French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon the Châteaux Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road. Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack. General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow his}} system {{to reach its}} full potential, Chapman {{encouraged}} his chairman {{to spend money on}} new players. The club's first ever transfer fee, £400, was paid for Welsh international Lloyd Davies who remains Northampton's most-capped player, winger Fred McDiarmid and playmaking centre half David McCartney. With this new talent, in his first season in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this as a <b>springboard</b> to take the Southern League title in 1908–09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.|$|E

5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland {{could be used as}} a <b>springboard</b> for an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. Due to the nature of Soviet demands, which included the installation of Soviet military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E
5|$|Atlantis: the Lost Empire {{was meant}} to provide a <b>springboard</b> for an {{animated}} television series entitled Team Atlantis, which would have presented the further adventures of its characters. However, because of the film's under-performance at the box office, the series was not produced. On May 20, 2003, Disney released a direct-to-video sequel called , consisting of three episodes planned for the aborted series.

These plans were canceled and the attraction was re-opened in 2007 as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, its theme based on the 2003 Disney·Pixar animated film Finding Nemo.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a <b>springboard</b> for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was sidelined with a groin injury at the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, and did not make his first start until 17 September in a 3–0 victory against Dartford, in which he scored one goal and set up another. This victory provided the <b>springboard</b> for Luton to embark on a 27-game unbeaten run in the league, in which Lawless was heavily involved, scoring five further times and contributing 10 assists. After playing in 32 games and scoring six goals, including many games in an unfamiliar position as a left midfielder, he missed the final part of the season due to injury. On 15 April 2014, with three games to spare, Luton won the Conference Premier title and were promoted to League Two; this was Lawless' first title and promotion as a player.|$|E
5|$|Marjorie Gestring {{became the}} {{youngest}} Olympic champion ever {{at the age of}} 13, winning a gold medal in the women's 3 meter <b>springboard.</b> As Korea was under Japanese rule, Korean athletes who hoped to compete in the Games were required to qualify for the Japanese team. Sohn Kee-chung, competing as Kitei Son, won gold in the marathon, which made him Japan's first gold medalist at these Games and the first Korean ever to win a medal. His fellow countryman Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal in the same event. For {{the first time since the}} 1908 Games, the United States failed to lead the medal table.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces within striking distance of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a <b>springboard</b> for further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E
