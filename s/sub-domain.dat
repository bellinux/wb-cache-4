Parameter domain pruning aims to identify parameter <b>sub-domains</b> {{that are more}} likely to produce feasible and good design solutions. These parameter <b>sub-domains</b> are found using the proposed Simplified Affine Transforms (SAT) operators. Selected variable <b>sub-domains</b> can then be used as input to exploration-based synthesis tools and help improve the convergence of synthesis algorithm. I...|$|R
50|$|Initial {{literature}} and database reviews and a Request for Information of NIH-funded researchers identified the <b>sub-domains</b> {{for inclusion in}} the NIH Toolbox, existing measures relevant to the project goals, and criteria for instrument selection. NIH Project Team members, external content experts, and contract scientists met at a follow-up consensus meeting to discuss potential <b>sub-domains</b> along with the criteria affecting instrument selection, creation, and norming. Additional expert interviews were undertaken to gather more detailed information from clinical and scientific experts to help further refine the list of possible <b>sub-domains.</b> A second consensus group meeting was held and results directed the selection of the <b>sub-domains</b> within each core domain area to be measured in the final NIH Toolbox.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid IP {{networks}} that use both control paradigms - distributed and centralized - promise {{the best of}} two worlds: programmability and agility of SDN, and reliability and fault tolerance of distributed routing protocols like OSPF. The common approaches follow a division of labor concept, where SDN controls prioritized traffic and OSPF assures care-free operation of best effort traffic. We propose SDN Partitioning, which establishes centralized control over the distributed routing protocol by partitioning the topology into <b>sub-domains</b> with SDN-enabled border nodes, such that OSPF's routing updates have to traverse SDN border nodes to reach neighboring <b>sub-domains.</b> This allows the central controller to modify how <b>sub-domains</b> view one another, which in turn allows to steer inter-sub-domain traffic. The degree of dynamic control against simplicity of OSPF can be trade off by adjusting {{the size of the}} <b>sub-domains.</b> This paper explains the technical requirements, presents a novel scheme for balanced topology partitioning, and provides the models for common network management tasks. Our performance evaluation shows that - already in its minimum configuration with two <b>sub-domains</b> - SDN Partitioning provides significant improvements in all respects compared to legacy routing protocols, whereas smaller <b>sub-domains</b> provide network control capabilities comparable to full SDN deployment.

25|$|The first grid is coarse mesh {{spanning}} the entire problem domain including the bath regions {{and the channel}} region. The second grid (and so on for any other grids, 3rd, 4th, etc.) is a relatively much finer mesh that spans a <b>sub-domain</b> of the system containing the region that requires fine resolution like the channel pore. The Poisson equation is first solved on the coarse mesh with all the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, {{taking into account the}} applied bias. Next the boundary conditions for the secondary meshes are obtained by interpolating from the first or previous solutions of the Poisson equation. The Poisson equation is solved again for the finer meshes using the new boundary conditions. In this way, electrostatic fields with different mesh discretization for different regions can be generated.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} including the UN Global Compact Cities Programme, World Vision and Metropolis have since 2010 begun using the Circles of Sustainability approach that {{sets up a}} four-domain framework for choosing appropriate indicators. Rather than designating the indicators {{that have to be}} used like most other approaches, it provides a framework to guide decision-making on what indicators are most useful. The framework is arranged around four domains - economics, ecology, politics and culture - which are then subdivided into seven analytically derived sub-domains for each domain. Indicators are linked to each <b>sub-domain.</b> By choosing culture as one of its key domains, the approach takes into account the emphasis of the 'Anthropological' approach (above), but retains a comprehensive sense of sustainability. The approach can be used to map any other sustainability indicator set. This is foundationally different from the Global Reporting Initiative Index (below) which uses a triple-bottom-line organizing framework, and is most relevant to corporate reporting.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dyspnoea {{and diminished}} {{functional}} status are pivotal {{features of the}} health status (HS) in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). However, it is still not fully understood how pulmonary function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing relate to these aspects. This may be due to incomplete assessment and/or deficient definitions of HS. Especially regarding peak oxygen consumption, inconsistent results have been reported. OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of maximal cycle ergometry in relation to a broad spectrum of HS aspects. METHODS: 129 patients with COPD, stage II and III according to the GOLD classification, performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Sixteen independent <b>sub-domains</b> of HS were assessed according to the Nijmegen Integral Assessment Framework, covering physiological functioning, complaints, functional impairments and quality of life as main domains. VO(2) (max) and HS <b>sub-domains</b> were correlated by bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Weak correlations of VO(2) (max) with most <b>sub-domains</b> were found, except for exercise capacity; the other 5 <b>sub-domains</b> of physiological functioning did not correlate. Between different types of exercise limitation (5 types were differentiated), no significant differences were noted in the scores of 13 / 16 HS <b>sub-domains.</b> CONCLUSIONS: VO(2) (max) is indeed correlated with most aspects of HS, except for physiological variables, but associations are weak. No single exercise limitation type is associated with specific HS problems. Thus separate assessment of all HS <b>sub-domains</b> is advocated to ensure adequate planning of therapeutic interventions...|$|R

This manuscript version is {{made available}} under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] and Objective Diagnoses and prognoses vary widely across sub-populations of people referred to specialist palliative care services; variations also exist in the way these services are configured. These variations create substantial heterogeneity in palliative care populations enrolled in research studies which, in turn, limits the generalizability of study results. This paper reports on the refinement of a checklist of patient/research participant and service/research site descriptors; the checklist can be completed for any palliative care research study. Its purposes are to: (1) facilitate the design and reporting of rigorous palliative care research, and thereby, (2) aid clinicians in appropriately applying research evidence in clinical practice. Methods A previously published framework (five domains; 13 core <b>sub-domains</b> and 25 noncore <b>sub-domains)</b> was used to code all research articles (n= 189) published over a 12 -month period in the three leading palliative care journals internationally.

Data in certain <b>sub-domains,</b> such as time from referral to death, socio-economic indices and ethnicity, were rarely reported; none of the included studies reported whole-of-service or whole-of-population data.
