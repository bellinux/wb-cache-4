The company started production in March 2004 with a 5th wheel under the Landmark brand name which was introduced in December 2004 at the Louisville Show. Landmark was introduced with industry first features such as a Universal Docking Center (UDC), Texas-sized unobstructed pass through storage, and a patent pending front cap design for an 88 degree turn with a <b>short</b> <b>box</b> truck. The first Landmark floorplan was the Golden Gate model (a 36’ 3-slide unit).|$|E
50|$|The Trekker was {{produced}} from early 1981 through 1983. The Trekkers were all built on Toyota <b>short</b> <b>box</b> chassis'. All of the Trekkers {{were classified as}} SR5 by both Winnebago and Toyota, regardless of the actual VIN denotation. Originally {{there were to be}} a SR5 and Deluxe version of the Trekker, one with vented windows and one without. All 1981 Trekkers had vented canopy windows. Non vented canopy windows were not installed on the Trekker until the 1982 model year. Non vented windows were installed due to the leaking issues of a forward facing vent on the 1981 Trekkers canopy windows rather than the classification of SR5 vs Deluxe.|$|E

5000|$|The Explorer Sport Trac was {{introduced}} in February 2000 as a 2001 model. It was built on a lengthened Explorer chassis, but with a small pickup bed behind the four normal SUV doors. To {{make up for the}} <b>short</b> <b>box,</b> a bed extender was available. The bed was made entirely of a plastic composite material, and a hard plastic tonneau cover was a common factory option. The tailgate was carried over from the F-150 Flare Side. The pickup had a more rugged-appearing front end, which the 2-door Explorer Sport also received. The dash and front cabin area were nearly identical to the Ranger, while the exterior used Explorer parts. Midway through the 2001 model year, the engine design was changed. The [...] "Job 1" [...] 4.0L SOHC featured an alloy intake manifold. This was changed to a composite manifold in June 2000, and the oil filler cap moved from the driver side to the passenger side of the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{upstream}} {{region of}} the Xenopus laevis L 14 ribosomal protein gene was deleted starting from the 5 ' extremity in order to define the promoter length necessary to express a linked reporter CAT gene. The functional analysis indicated that a sequence located between - 63 and - 49 from the capsite is important for an efficient promoter activity. Band shift and ExoIII protection assays evidenced the binding to this region of a factor, called XrpFI, present in the crude nuclear extract from X. laevis oocytes. Methylation interference analysis localized the contacts in the G residues belonging to a <b>short</b> <b>box,</b> 5 ' CTTCC 3 ', positioned between - 53 and - 49 from the capsite. An additional factor, XrpFII, makes contacts with the sequence 5 'GCCTGTTCGCC 3 ' located between - 27 and - 17 from the capsite. The deletion mutant still containing this sequence is poorly transcribed, but resumes activity when a short fragment containing the binding site for factor XrpFI is cloned in an upstream position...|$|E
40|$|<b>Short</b> <b>box</b> cores (to 30 cm bsf) and {{seafloor}} carbonate grab {{samples were}} acquired at mapped hydrocarbon seep sites (600 – 1200 m water depths) during the 2007 RV SONNE SO 191 cruise on the Hikurangi Margin offshore eastern North Island, New Zealand, {{to evaluate the}} influence of methane seepage on sedimentologic, biotic, mineralogic and stable isotopic attributes of seabed sediments. Sedimentary horizons in the box cores consist of siliciclastic silts and sands, shell beds and nodular, microcrystalline aragonite bands up to 15 cm thick. The megafauna is dominated by infaunal to semi-infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves (Calyptogena, Lucinoma, and Acharax), as well as associated worms and carnivorous and grazing gastropods. Burrows in silts, some occupied by worms or juvenile Acharax, mainly have simple morphologies more typical of high-energy, nearshore settings than deep-sea environments, while a few are large and sparsely branched with wall scratch marks inferred to be of decapod crustacean origin. The box core silts and nodular carbonate samples vary in TOC content from 0. 2 to 0. 9 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{bridge is}} widely used in highway {{infrastructure}} in China, especially in short and medium span bridges. Concrete bridges are prone to fatigue failure under the coupled actions of repeated vehicles loads, environment and material degradation. In recent years, the traffic volume and vehicle weights of highway bridges have been continuously increasing, so concrete bridge fatigue problem becomes more serious. This paper introduces advanced fatigue safety monitoring techniques and fatigue performance assessment methods for short and medium span concrete girder bridges. Weigh-in-motion (WIM) system was used to record the real traffic volume, and then the acquired load spectrum was applied on typical concrete bridges through Matlab to analyze the fatigue performance of different bridge types. From the analysis results, several typical short and medium span concrete girder bridges are selected to conduct long-term service monitoring. The cross section types include hollow slab girder, T-girder and <b>short</b> <b>box</b> girder, and the structure types contain simple supported bridge and continuous girder bridge. WIM technique, dynamic strain monitoring technique and acoustic emission technique are used to monitor the key details. Fatigue performance is assessed and analyzed based on monitoring data, considering traffic increase, overload and corrosion factors...|$|E
