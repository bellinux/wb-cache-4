25|$|When Earthrealm was young, Raiden was its protector. He {{fought the}} rogue Elder God Shinnok, {{who wished to}} {{overthrow}} his fellow gods, in a war that threatened to destroy Earthrealm itself. One of the casualties {{of the war was}} the Saurian civilization (of which Reptile is a descendant), forcing the remaining survivors to emigrate to another world, which they named Zaterra. With the aid of the Elder Gods, Raiden managed to defeat Shinnok, then banished him to the Netherealm and secured Shinnok's amulet of power in a secret location—a Temple of the Elements tucked away in the highest mountains of Nepal. Raiden charged four gods with guarding the amulet—the gods of Wind (Fujin), Fire, Earth and Water. When the elder Sub-Zero stole Shinnok's amulet from the temple for Quan Chi millions of years later, Raiden appeared before the Lin Kuei warrior and instructed him to enter the Netherealm and steal it back, lest Shinnok use it to free himself. Raiden could not retrieve it himself as his powers would dissipate in the Netherealm. Sub-Zero's mission into the Netherealm was a success and Shinnok was, for a time, no longer a threat. Though it was later revealed that the sorcerer Quan Chi had given <b>Sub</b> <b>Zero</b> a false amulet, Raiden never realized the counterfeit and Quan Chi would remain in possession of the true amulet for years.|$|E

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that under certain conditions, such as a weak {{electron}} temperature anisotropy, the magnetic-drift wave instability can become rather important, and the growth rate can be greater than the ion gyrofrequency when the scale length of the density gradient is comparable to, or shorter than, the thermal ion gyroradius. The instability is attributed to wave-electron interactions, and the growth rate is far greater than the case investigated by Krall and Rosenbluth (1963) who attributed the instability to wave-ion interactions. The anticipated vanishing of the instability is observed as epsilon sub n/epsilon <b>sub</b> B approaches <b>zero.</b> The presently observed instability {{may be used to}} explain the low-frequency fluctuations evidenced by the Active Particle Tracer Explorer Ion Release Module magnetometer measurements, and may contribute to the acceleration of ions along the plasma cometary tail...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Implementing a multi-tone (MT) {{architecture}} for high-speed backplane electrical links {{is difficult}} given the tight power and complexity constraints in this application. This paper proposes {{an approach that}} incorporates a baseband (BB) channel and a few passband (PB) channels. In this MT system interchannel interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) are eliminated through fractionally spaced equalization at the transmitter and feedback equalization at the receiver. The design is modeled as a MIMO system, and optimal equalizer coefficients to minimize the transmit peak voltage are found by casting the optimization as a Second Order Conic (SOC) problem. In addition, for systems that need adaptation, we show how equalizer and power allocation coefficients can be obtained (<b>sub</b> optimally) using <b>Zero</b> Forcing (ZF) optimization. The effect of transmitter and receiver clock jitter are modeled {{in a way that}} can be included in both SOC and ZF optimizations, and the performance of this system is compared to more conventional baseband examples. It is shown that this AMT system can be built with complexity/power similar to a comparable performance baseband system, but has the ability to scale to higher bit rates. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made for}} the variable fluid property problem for laminar free convection on an isothermal vertical flat plate. For a number of specific cases, solutions of the boundary layer equations appropriate to the variable property situation were carried out for gases and liquid mercury. Utilizing these findings, a simple and accurate shorthand procedure is presented for calculating free convection heat transfer under variable property conditions. This calculation method is well established in the heat transfer field. It {{involves the use of}} results which have been derived for constant property fluids, and of a set of rules (called reference temperatures) for extending these constant property results to variable property situations. For gases, the constant property heat transfer results are generalized to the variable property situation by replacing beta (expansion coefficient) by one over T sub infinity and evaluating the other properties at T sub r equals T <b>sub</b> w minus <b>zero</b> point thirty-eight (T sub w minus T sub infinity). For liquid mercury, the generalization may be accomplished by evaluating all the properties (including beta) at this same T sub r. It is worthwhile noting that for these fluids, the film temperature (with beta equals one over T sub infinity for gases) appears to serve as an adequate reference temperature for most applications. Results are also presented for boundary layer thickness and velocity parameters...|$|R
40|$|Spin gapless {{semiconductors}} (SGS) form a {{new class}} of magnetic semiconductors, which has a band gap for one spin <b>sub</b> band and <b>zero</b> band gap for the other, and thus are useful for tunable spin transport based applications. In this paper, we report the first experimental evidence for spin gapless semiconducting behavior in CoFeMnSi Heusler alloy. Such a behavior is also confirmed by first principles band structure calculations. The most stable configuration obtained by the theoretical calculation is verified by experiment. The alloy is found to crystallize in the cubic Heusler structure (LiMgPdSn type) with some amount of disorder and has a saturation magnetization of 3. 7 Bohr's magneton/f. u [...] and Curie temperature of 620 K. The saturation magnetization is found to follow the Slater-Pauling behavior, one of the prerequisites for SGS. Nearly temperature-independent carrier concentration and electrical conductivity is observed from 5 to 300 K. An anomalous Hall coefficient of 162 S/cm is obtained at 5 K. Point contact Andreev reflection data has yielded the current spin polarization value of 0. 64, which is found to be robust against the structural disorder. All these properties are quite promising for the spintronic applications such as spin injection and can bridge a gap between the contrasting behavior of half-metallic ferromagnets and semiconductors.

40|$|Microwave filters utilize extensively, complex {{perovskite}} barium zinc tantalate ceramics, due {{to their}} superior selectivity and near zero temperature coefficient. A study of Ba sub 1 sub - sub x Sr sub x [Zn sub 1 sub / sub 3 (Ta sub 1 sub - sub y Nb sub y) sub 2 sub / sub 3]O sub 3 (BSZNT) synthesised by a mixed oxide route was conducted to {{understand the relationship between}} structure/microstructure and dielectric properties. Densities > 95 % and 97 Vo were achieved in undoped (x= 0 y= 0) and Sr sup + sup 2 and or Nb sup + sup 5 doped Ba(Zn sub 1 sub / sub 3 Ta sub 2 sub / sub 3) O sub 3 (BZT) respectively. The investigation found a reversible order-disorder phase transition in pure barium zinc tantalate at approx 1600 degC. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed a disordered cubic phase above, and an ordered trigonal-phase below, 1600 degC. Thermogravimetric analysis detected weight loss due to zinc oxide evaporation beginning at approximately 1200 degC. Thus, non-perovskite phases such BaTa sub 2 O sub 6, observed as a thin white-powdered surface film gave additional peaks in X-ray diffraction. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of annealed samples showed large ordered domains in samples quenched from 1600 degC (approx 100 - 400 nm) compared to as-sintered samples (approx 20 - 40 nm). Sr sup + sup 2 substitution, due to its high ionic polarisability improved epsilon sub r (approx 32) and was effective in systematically tuning tau <b>sub</b> f through <b>zero,</b> however, the quality factors were poor (approx 5000 at approx 3 GHz) and inconsistent from sample to sample. The changes in tau sub f correlated with phase transition, involving rotations of octahedra. The driving force for the onset of the transition was the decrease in perovskite tolerance factor as Sr content increased. Nb sup + sup 5 doping in barium strontium zinc tantalate (60 mol% strontium) increased the relative permittivity significantly (approx 34 - 43).
