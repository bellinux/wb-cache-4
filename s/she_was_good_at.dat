At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made him think of her as [...] "unusual".

2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, {{her hand on}} her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E

At the age of seven, she filled Woolworths notebooks with stories of her imaginary games. At the age of nine she wrote her first [...] "novel" [...] which was 21 sides long. That story, Meet the Maggots, was about a family with seven children. Although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> English, she had no interest in mathematics; she would often stare out of the window and imagine rather than pay attention to the class, leading her final-year teacher at Latchmere to nickname her [...] "Jacky Daydream". Jacqueline Wilson later used the nickname as the title of the first stage of her autobiography.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reading was horrid," [...] Elvira said, and {{certainly}} hers deserved the epithet. Her attainments fell far behind those of Essie and Ellie, {{and she did}} not mean to improve them. Her hostess let her alone till she had twice shaken her rich mane at her grandfather, and refused to return with him; and he had shown himself deeply grateful to Mrs. Brownlow for keeping her there, and had said he hoped <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> her lessons.|$|E

6000|$|The pigwidgeons {{visited the}} next four cells, which were {{occupied}} by four boys, but {{not one of them}} could tell how to divide five-sevenths by six. The Prince was questioned, but he did not know; and neither did the course-marker, nor the map-maker. It was not until they came to the cell of the oldest girl that they received an answer. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> mental arithmetic; and, after a minute's thought, she said, [...] "It would be five forty-seconds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Susy,--Mrs. Senator Boompointer, that is,"--said Hooker, with an {{apparent}} dignity {{in his late}} wife's new title, [...] "allowed that she'd gone abroad on a secret mission from the Southern Confederacy to them crowned heads over there. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> ropin' men in, you know. Anyhow, Susy, afore she was Mrs. Boompointer, was dead set on findin' out where she was, but never could. She seemed {{to drop out of}} sight a year ago. Some said one thing, and some said another. But you can bet your bottom dollar that Mrs. Senator Boompointer, who knows how to pull all the wires in Washington, will know, if any one does." ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire's {{ambition}} {{had once}} been babies and a solid husband, but as various young males of the species appeared before her, sang their mating songs and preened their newly dry-cleaned plumage, she found that the trouble with solid young men {{was that they were}} solid. Though she liked to dance, the [...] "dancing men" [...] bored her. And she did not understand the district's quota of intellectuals very well; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> listening to symphony concerts, but she never had much luck in discussing the cleverness of the wood winds in taking up the main motif. It is history that she refused a master of arts with an old violin, a good taste in ties, and an income of eight thousand.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the case}} with Miss Calthea's establishment. It had become rare for any one even to propose custom, but she did not in the least waver in regard to her plan of closing up the {{business}} left to her by her father. As has been said, she did not wish to continue this business, so she laid in no new stock, and as she had gradually sold off a great deal, she expected to be able in time to sell off everything. She did not adopt the usual methods of clearing out a stock of goods, because these would involve sacrifices, and, as Miss Calthea very freely said to those who spoke to her on the subject, there was no need whatever for her to make sacrifices. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> waiting, and she could wait. When she sold the few things which remained on the shelves--and she, as well as nearly every one in the village, knew exactly what these things were without the trouble of looking--she would retire from business, and have the shop altered into a front parlor. Until then the articles which remained on hand were for sale.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hazleby only said, 'Hm,' but {{the other}} lady paid more {{attention}} to the little girl, who was very little troubled with shyness, and soon was very happy--throwing the balls to the girls, and--at the same time--chattering to Mrs. Bouverie, and saying a great deal about 'Lizzie,' telling how Lizzie said that one little girl was good and another was naughty, that Lizzie said she should soon begin to teach her French; Lizzie taught her all her lessons, Mamma only heard her music; Lizzie had shewn her where to look in her Consecration-book, so that she should not be puzzled at Church to-day; Lizzie said she had behaved very well, and that she should tell Papa so; she had a red ribbon with a medal with Winchester Cathedral upon it, which Lizzie let her wear to shew Papa and Mamma when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> her lessons; she hoped she should wear it to-day, though she had not done any lessons, for Lizzie said it was a joyful day, like a Sunday. All this made Mrs. Bouverie desirous of being acquainted with 'Lizzie,' but she could find no opportunity of speaking to her, as Elizabeth never willingly came near strangers, and was fully occupied with the school-children, so that she and Anne were the last to come in-doors to dress.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{swimming}} and athletics as a child.|$|E
50|$|Kanatas mother. Despite her coarse language, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{looking after}} others. After her husbands death, she raised Kanata by herself. Although she hits Kanata quite often, she pampers the protagonist and Suzuya, and thinks of them like her own children.|$|R
