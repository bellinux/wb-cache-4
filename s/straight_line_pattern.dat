Improvements in sampling methodology including {{the development of a}} sequential sampling plan have reduced the minimum sampling time required to make a management decision to 20 minutes or less per field per visit to make a management decision. Many growers and scouts still find this time commitment a constraint to repeated scouting.

40|$|ReportCrop {{monitoring}} {{for corn}} rootworm remains {{the best means}} to assess fields at risk from this pest if replanted to corn the following year. Improvements in sampling methodology have reduced the minimum sampling time required to make a management decision to about 20 minutes or less per field per visit to make a management decision. Many growers still find this time commitment a constraint to weekly scouting. The current sampling scheme involves covering most of the field following a "W" pattern. The goal of this project {{was to assess the}} feasibility of replacing this current sampling pattern with a simpler and less time-consuming transect (<b>straight</b> <b>line)</b> <b>pattern.</b> Our computer simulations demonstrate that treatment decisions based on transect sampling would have an acceptably low error rate (< 0. 05) over a wide range of realistic rootworm densities and spatial dispersion patterns. Further research will be necessary to determine how likely rootworm populations are to fall within this range...|$|E

30|$|By {{means of}} laser {{radiation}} simple <b>patterns</b> of <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> (<b>pattern</b> 1) and grid (pattern 2) were created on the MPL surface (see Fig.  1). The distance between lines was approximately 2 – 3  mm {{and the line}} thickness was about 0.5  mm. The patterns were created by horizontal motion of the laser beam. The effect of the irradiation on the MPL with a laser beam is basically identical with a highly local heating of the material. This leads to burning, carbonization and/or evaporation of the surface components. It has been observed, that irradiation of the microporous layer media with 350  mW at 532  nm almost instantly burns holes or trenches into the material.|$|R

In some cases, breeds who can perform five gaits add equitation classes that require two additional gaits: the [...] "slow gait" [...] and [...] "rack." [...] All classes require Rail work, where competitors show and are judged {{as a group}} going both ways of the arena. Saddle seat equitation may include individual tests or a pattern to be ridden. Tests may include backing up, mounting and dismounting, riding without stirrups, [...] "addressing" [...] the reins (i.e. picking up the four reins correctly), figure eights, serpentines and <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>patterns</b> done at any gait.

A piece leaps over an adjacent enemy piece onto a vacant adjacent intersection point on the other side. The leap must be in a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> following the <b>pattern</b> on the board. Even pieces that are not yet promoted to King can capture enemy pieces backwards. A player's piece must continue to capture within a turn provided each capture meets the criteria of the short leap.|$|R
30|$|Compared to {{conductive}} <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>patterns,</b> curves {{pattern with}} acute angle {{was known to}} have a higher electric field singularity [13]. In the conductive pattern with the acute angle, the electric field singularity increases gradually from the peripheral to the intersection of the angled pattern. On the other hand, as the angle increases to an obtuse angle, the electric field becomes higher at the edge of peripheral than the intersection point. Therefore, {{in the case of an}} acute-angle conductive pattern, the electric field at the corner pattern is high, but the obtuse angle shows the low electric field at the corner. The effect of electric field on curved patterns was verified by observing the stacks of electrospun fibers on the patterns that were acute, right and obtuse angle-edge. Figure  3 b, c, and d show the images of the electrospun fibers stacked on the conductive pattern with acute, right and obtuse angles. As expected, the fibers in the acute angle pattern could be perfectly stacked along the pattern due to the high field intensity by the field singularity (Fig.  3 b). The fibers on the right angle pattern could be stacked along the pattern, but they did not perfectly follow the conductive pattern like on the acute pattern. They stacked toward the slightly inner side of the pattern edge due to the smaller electric field compared to the acute angle pattern (Fig.  3 c). The fibers formed on the obtuse pattern did not follow up the pattern due to the weaker electric field than the surrounding area (Fig.  3 d).|$|R

40|$|Figure 1. Our new {{algorithm}} {{compared to}} scaling and regular seam carving with forward energy. In this example, the width {{is reduced to}} 60 % of the original size. In this paper, we propose a new method to adapt the resolution of images to the limited display resolution of mobile devices. We use the seam carving technique to identify and remove less relevant content in images. Seam carving achieves a high adaptation quality for landscape images and distortions caused by the removal of seams are very low compared to other techniques like scaling or cropping. However, if an image depicts objects with <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> or regular <b>patterns</b> like buildings, the visual quality of the adapted images is much lower. Errors caused by seam carving are especially obvious if <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> become curved or disconnected. In order to preserve <b>straight</b> <b>lines,</b> our algorithm applies line detection {{in addition to the}} normal energy function of seam carving. The energy in the local neighborhood of the intersection point of a seam and a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> is increased to prevent other seams from removing adjacent pixels. We evaluate our improved seam carving algorithm and compare the results with regular seam carving. In case of landscape images with no <b>straight</b> <b>lines,</b> traditional seam carving and our enhanced approach lead to very similar results. However, in the case of objects with <b>straight</b> <b>lines,</b> the quality of our results is significantly better...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a {{complete}} system for online stroke recovery from offline data. The key idea of our approach is to use a novel pen device which is able to embed meta information into the ink during writing the strokes. This pen-device overcomes the need to get access to any memory on the pen when trying to recover the information, which is especially useful in multi-writer or multi-pen scenarios. The actual data-embedding is achieved by an additional inkdot sequence along a handwritten pattern during writing. We design the ink-dot sequence {{in such a way that}} it is possible to retrieve the writing direction from a scanned image. Furthermore, we propose novel processing steps in order to retrieve the original writing direction and finally the embedded data. In our experiments we show that we can reliably recover the writing direction of various patterns. Our system is able to determine the writing direction of <b>straight</b> <b>lines,</b> simple <b>patterns</b> with crossings (e. g., “x ” and “ll”), and even more complex patterns like handwritten words and symbols.

40|$|In {{this study}} Hinted Cell Switching is {{introduced}} {{as a new}} alternative to the Mobile IP advertisement based movement detection methods. It is a method that relies on "hints" generated during subnetwork layer hand-offs for reacting faster to Mobile IP hand-offs. In this study the performance of Hinted Cell Switching is compared {{through the use of}} simulations against those of advertisement based movement detection methods, namely: Lazy Cell Switching and Eager Cell Switching. The performance of the latter is determined for a range of advertisement periods. The scenarios investigated involve <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> movement <b>patterns</b> and Mobile IP hand-offs between Foreign Agents. It is identified that Hinted Cell Switching significantly outperforms its advertisement based counterparts in managing faster movement detection; performing independantly of agent advertisement period lengths and providing a small deviation to its performance. Overall, it is demonstrated through simulations of Internet Audio streaming that Mobile IP hand-offs with Hinted Cell Switching support complete faster with minimum packet loss. Finally it is identified that Eager Cell Switching performs significanlty faster than Lazy Cell Switching in the investigated scenario...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the Fast Hinted Cell Switching {{movement}} detection method for Mobile IP is introduced. This method {{assumes that the}} Link-Layer is capable of delivering information to Mobile IP regarding {{the identity of the}} local mobility agent. This tends to negate the need for Mobile IP movement detection as well as agent discovery and leads to accelerated Mobile IP hand-offs. Moreover, the existence of Link-Layer information renders the presence of periodic mobility agent broadcast advertisements as unnecessary which enables a more efficient utilisation of the network capacity. The performance of the proposed solution is experimentally compared against that of Eager Cell Switching that is considered the fastest of traditional Mobile IP movement detection methods. The scenarios investigated involve <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> movement <b>patterns</b> and Mobile IP hand-offs between Foreign Agents that provide wireless network connectivity through IEEE 802. 11 b Wireless LAN standard, compliant hardware. The IEEE 802. 11 SSID field was utilised to contain information important to Mobile IP such as the identity of the local mobility agent. The overlying communication involves a unidirectional GSM audio stream directed to the mobile node. Through the experimental investigation it is determined that the proposed solution outperforms its Eager Cell Switching counterpart by managing faster Mobile IP hand-offs and minimum packet loss of the active audio stream...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{family of}} fractal curves is {{proposed}} which provides the designer a systematic way of miniaturizing the microwave components with {{the freedom of}} choosing among form factor, design complexity and achieved miniaturization. The proposed fractal curve is characterized by two integer values m and n. The m value determines the form factor of the fractal while n value governs the iteration number.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with electron/jet discrimination and b-jet tagging for the ATLAS second level trigger. Electron/jet discrimination at the global second level trigger has been investigated with two different methods, combined linear cuts and Artificial Neural Networks. Data without and with pile up were represented by 11 selection variables from the calorimeter, the preshower and the tracking systems, transition radiation tracker and silicon strip detectors. For data without pile up a rejection of 300 is achieved for 95 % electron efficiency for both methods. For data with pile up the neural net proved better with a jet rejection of 100 and electron efficiency of 70 % whereas the linear cut efficiency drops below 60 %. The second level trigger has access to full granularity data from the tracking detectors in regions where the first level trigger found high transverse momentum jets. The separation between b-quark jets and u-quark jets at the second level trigger has been studied with an algorithm for finding multiple tracks in the pixels and silicon strip detectors. The algorithm employs histogramming of Hough transformed <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> for <b>pattern</b> recognition. This algorithm was used for discrimination between b-jet and u-jet data of the decay H #-># bb-bar for m_H = 100 GeV. A rejection of 30 u-jets for a b-tagging efficiency of 50 % has been achieved using the transverse impact parameter d_ 0 for jets with #>=# 3 reconstructed tracks.
