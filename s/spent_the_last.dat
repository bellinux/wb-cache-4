5|$|Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, {{moved to}} Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid {{to see him}} in the back room of a shop owned by showman Tom Norman.

5|$|Ladislaus <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{years of}} his life {{wandering}} from place to place. Hungary's central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.|$|E
5|$|As a spy {{working for}} the {{government}} of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather intelligence on resistance groups the U.S. government was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the German nuclear program. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.|$|E
5|$|Cantor {{retired in}} 1913, {{living in poverty}} and {{suffering}} from malnourishment during World War I. The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium {{for the last time}} and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year of his life.|$|E

5|$|During Grand Duke Gian Gastone's rule, the Governor was {{responsible}} for formal court audiences. Violante Beatrice, {{in collaboration with the}} Electress Anna Maria Luisa, attempted to withdraw Gian Gastone from the Ruspanti, his salacious entourage, by arranging banquets and public appearances. Gian Gastone, however, was immune to these approaches and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> eight years of his reign confined to bed, entertained by the myriad Ruspanti.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{arranges}} a {{game with}} wealthy William Jefferson Slade, who secures Shooter's services as dealer. Howard wins $6,000 from Slade over a 30-hour game, angering Slade and wounding his pride. That night at Slade's home, he tries to bribe Shooter into cheating in the Kid's favor when the two players meet. Shooter declines, but Slade calls in Shooter's markers worth $12,000, and blackmails him by threatening to reveal damaging information about Shooter's wild wife, Melba. Shooter agonizes over his decision, having <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 25 years building a reputation for integrity.|$|E
5|$|Howe's health {{declined}} in 1934, {{and he was}} hospitalized for heart problems and breathing difficulties. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{two years of his}} life in and out of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E

5|$|Paoli <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 20 {{years of}} his life {{teaching}} voice and singing in San Juan, while also working {{for the establishment of a}} music conservatory in that city. He would not see this last dream come true, because he developed cancer and died at age 75. He was buried in San Juan, but his remains were later transferred to a mausoleum in his birth town of Ponce.|$|E
5|$|Quisling <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{months of}} the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the {{showdown}} that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German prisoner-of-war camps. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a naïve offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{received}} {{no information about}} the massacre until the summer of 1943, when Pooley, who had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{three years in a}} German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared medically unfit and repatriated. British authorities did not believe Pooley's story on his arrival; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops. Private O'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner-of-war camp. His confirmation of Pooley's story prompted an official investigation.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{not known}} where Stanford White spent the first five months of her {{merchant}} career, she <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two in the Atlantic. She sailed from Galveston, Texas on 12 September 1943 and arrived in Key West on 16 September. The ship departed the same day for New York and arrived there on 22 September. On 28 September the ship, carrying a general cargo, joined a convoy headed to Liverpool, where it arrived on 13 October. Five days later, the Stanford White set out for New York, arriving back there on 4 November.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E

After a season with them, he enlisted {{in the armed forces}} for World War II, and joined the Greenville Spinners upon his return to baseball. During the next two seasons he spent some time with the Cleveland Indians, but mainly {{remained}} with the Indians' minor league teams.

He retired {{at the end of the}} 1953 season and died in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had {{probably}} been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{years of his life}} (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Georgia family, Chivers became {{interested}} in poetry at a young age. After he and his first wife separated, he received a medical degree from Transylvania University but focused his energy on publishing rather than medicine. In addition to submitting poems to various magazines and journals, Chivers published several volumes of poetry, including The Lost Pleiad in 1845, as well as plays. Edgar Allan Poe showed {{an interest in the}} young poet and encouraged his work. Chivers <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few years of his life defending the reputation of Poe, who had died in 1849, though he also thought Poe had been heavily influenced by his own poetry. Chivers died in Georgia in 1858.|$|E
