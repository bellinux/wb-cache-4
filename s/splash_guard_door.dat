50|$|The Canadian {{version of}} the Yaris sedan, {{is based on the}} US-market Yaris S with power and {{all-weather}} guard packages, but with standard 14 in wheels. The regular CE, LE, and RS trims used in the Canadian Yaris hatchback are replaced in the Yaris sedan by option packages of B, C, D, or Aero types. The B adds 15 in all-season tires, chrome trim on the decklid, front and rear <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> colour-keyed <b>door</b> handles, blacked-out side window frames, keyless entry and power door locks; the C adds ABS, air conditioning, power windows, colour-keyed mirrors and power mirrors; the D adds both side and side-curtain airbags; the Aero adds alloy wheels, wheel locks, a rear spoiler, and a body kit. The Aero, however, has neither air conditioning nor side airbags. The Canadian model lacks the two-tone interior, pseudo-metallic trim on the door panels, and the new audio system controls (instead it uses an old design) found on the Japanese and American models.|$|R

5000|$|A shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is a {{permanently}} installed, fixed, rigid fitting made {{of plastic}} or glass that prevent water from a shower from splashing out of the bathtub and onto the floor. [...] Typically, the shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is a small triangular piece of plastic that is used in combination with a shower curtain, to prevent water escaping at the corners, {{but it may be}} a much larger piece that is used by itself.|$|R
50|$|Dealer {{installed}} {{options for}} the third generation Integra included: security system, alloy wheels, trunk mat, <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> fog lights, and CD changer.|$|R
50|$|The shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> is {{designed}} {{to solve the problem}} of containing water, mostly at the shower head end of the bathtub. Like the shower curtain, it dates back to the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|An underbone cycle may share its {{fuel tank}} {{position}} and tube framing, along with fitted bodywork and <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> with a scooter while the wheel size, engine position, and power transmission are {{like those of}} conventional motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Generally, shower <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> {{are made}} from plastic and {{function}} as a dam to prevent water from escaping the bathtub and pooling on the floor. These devices are installed to fill the intersecting void between the top ledge of the bathtub and the perpendicular wall.|$|R
25|$|Safer {{cutting fluid}} {{formulations}} provide a resistance to tramp oils, allowing improved filtration separation without removing the base additive package. Room ventilation, <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> on machines, and {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) (such as safety glasses, respirator masks, and gloves) can mitigate hazards related to cutting fluids.|$|R

50|$|Most shower <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> {{designs are}} based on a right triangle, where the 90 degree legs are {{attached}} to the wall and tub ledge. The right triangle design functions well when the bathtub and walls are installed perfectly square with each other. Some extend as much as 4 feet up the wall, and are held in position using adhesive foam tapes or glues.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Hunter Railcars {{is derived from the}} Transwa Prospector - the major {{difference}} being the driving cars are each single-engined instead of dual-engined, due to the lower top speed requirement for the Hunter line. Reversible seating is covered with durable, vandal proof woollen moquette farbric in 3x2 formation, and have retractable footrests. CCTV is installed. The cars have been fitted with Dellner SP couplers. They are able to absorb the impact of a collision, and the anti-climbers will also reduce the force of impact. They also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, such as the Tangara, the driver's cab is built as a protective cage, made of fibreglass, which stretches {{to the end of the}} <b>guard's</b> <b>door.</b> The stainless steel paneling starts at the <b>guard's</b> <b>door.</b> The <b>guard's</b> <b>door</b> is designed to operate separately from the passenger doors.|$|R
50|$|The wood then {{needs to}} be transported to the {{building}} site. It is convenient to have the source of cordwood and construction site nearby. Once a proper foundation has been poured which rises 12-24 inches above ground level with a <b>splash</b> <b>guard,</b> construction of the walls can begin. Temporary shelters {{can be used to}} cover the worksite and cordwood from rain. A post and beam frame supplies this shelter for subsequent cordwood mortaring.|$|R
5000|$|... 2015 Corvette Stingray Atlantic Design Package is {{inspired}} by the luxury and performance of private jets seen at European vacation destinations. Based on Z51-equipped Corvette Stingray convertibles with 2LT or 3LT trims, changes include front Z06-style splitter, Shark Gray exterior vents, hood [...] "stinger" [...] graphic and tonneau inserts; chrome Torque wheels with Stingray center caps, Stingray underhood liner and floor mats, custom <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> rear license plate frame and logo valve stem caps; custom luggage.|$|R
2500|$|In 1944, Piaggio {{engineers}} Renzo Spolti and Vittorio Casini {{designed a}} motorcycle with bodywork fully enclosing the drivetrain and forming a tall <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> at the front. In {{addition to the}} bodywork, the design included handlebar-mounted controls, forced air cooling, wheels of small diameter, and a tall central section {{that had to be}} straddled. [...] Officially known as the MP5 ("Moto Piaggio no. 5"), the prototype was nicknamed [...] "Paperino" [...] (either [...] "duckling" [...] or [...] "Donald Duck" [...] in Italian).|$|R
50|$|An underbone {{motorcycle}} {{is a small}} motorcycle {{built around}} a single tube frame called the underbone. This ‘underbone’ supports the whole vehicle and runs low all across {{the length of the}} motorcycle. There is a similarity in appearance to the scooter, largely due to the fuel tank position, the open-frame design which the fuel tank position allows and the <b>splash</b> <b>guards.</b> However, the entire power train, namely the engine position, power transmission and wheels are based on the design of conventional motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|Karren {{labelled}} Sterling's <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> as {{arguably the}} worst product {{she had seen}} on the show, saying that in an emergency it {{would prove to be}} an obstacle with assisting a baby in the bath. On Why I Fired Them, Lord Sugar felt that the product was [...] "absolute garbage" [...] and had left the team [...] "dead in the water" [...] the moment it was selected, yet expressed surprise that Amazon had placed an order, let alone a larger one than they did from Phoenix.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{about half}} of all burns were deemed preventable. Burn {{prevention}} programs have significantly decreased rates of serious burns. Preventive measures include: limiting hot water temperatures, smoke alarms, sprinkler systems, proper construction of buildings, and fire-resistant clothing. Experts recommend setting water heaters below 48.8 C. Other measures to prevent scalds include using a thermometer to measure bath water temperatures, and <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> on stoves. While the effect of the regulation of fireworks is unclear, there is tentative evidence of benefit with recommendations including the limitation of the sale of fireworks to children.|$|R
40|$|Liquids, such as juices, milk, {{molten metal}} {{and the like}} are {{concentrated}} by forming uniformly-sized, small droplets in a precision droplet forming assembly and deploying the droplets in free fall downwardly as a central column within an evacuated column with cool walls. A portion of the solvent evaporates. The vapor flows to the wall, condenses, and usually flows down the wall as a film to condensate collector and drain. The vertical column of freely falling droplets enters the <b>splash</b> <b>guard.</b> The condensate can be collected, sent to other towers or recycled...|$|R
25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today. It consists of {{a single piece of}} heavy canvas, with a strip of vinyl along the bottom acting as a reinforcement and <b>splash</b> <b>guard.</b> It fits over the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the roof rack) as a sort of foyer or vestibule. It's big enough for two adults to stand inside, but little else, and was probably intended as a means of getting {{in and out of the}} camper in cold or wet weather.|$|R
50|$|Corvette Stingray Convertible Atlantic {{concept is}} {{a version of}} 2014 Corvette Stingray Convertible with Blade Silver body colour, carbon flash {{metallic}} front splitter, rocker extensions and rear lower diffuser, fusion gray headlamp housings and hood accents, a sueded-wrapped interior package, Chevrolet accessories parts (19x8.5-inch front and 20x10-inch rear chrome five-spoke wheels, wheel center caps with the Stingray script, under-hood liner with the Stingray logo, carbon flash metallic rear license plate holder, molded <b>splash</b> <b>guards,</b> windscreen mounted behind the seats, custom luggage, premium carpet floor mats, sill plates, embroidered center armrest with the Stingray logo), and six-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|An open-topped turret {{was fitted}} as {{standard}} to the BA-64 series, with a 7.62mm light machine gun mounted on a pintle to the right. The machine gun mount was designed for maximum elevation so it could engage low-flying aircraft or infantry in the upper floors of a building during urban combat. A {{very small number of}} BA-64s were fitted with a 12.7mm heavy machine gun in a larger, open-topped turret. This model included <b>splash</b> <b>guards</b> and armoured fillets on the hull roofline. Personal crew weapons, such as hand grenades, were also stored inside the vehicle's hull.|$|R

5000|$|Personal hygiene {{products}} that aid women in urinating while standing up are not new. [...] The GoGirl product {{is based on}} a 20-year-old design by a doctor. It was rebranded and relaunched in January 2009 at the Minnesota State Fair in St. Paul, Minnesota by FemMed, a company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. [...] It is a vessel made of flexible pink or purple medical-grade silicone with a <b>splash</b> <b>guard</b> on one end which the operator presses against her body. It has a spout on the other side, out of which the urine streams by pressure from a woman's natural flow.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1860s, some {{trade unions}} in Sheffield used {{violence}} against non-members, in {{what became known}} as the [...] "Sheffield Outrages". At the time, Butchers Wheel was known as a safe workplace for those who had incurred the opposition of such unions, given that access was only through a single, <b>guarded</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

2500|$|D'Ascanio's MP6 {{prototype}} had {{its engine}} mounted beside the rear wheel. [...] The wheel was driven {{directly from the}} transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels. [...] These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section {{like that of the}} MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front <b>splash</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|R

25|$|Unit 307118 was {{converted}} into a test unit for the 'Holec' three-phase AC traction motors and associated electrical gear used in the Class 323 EMUs. As 316998, the BDTBSO coach had its seating removed and the electrical equipment mounted in the passenger cabin and cooling provided via a large grill fitted {{in place of the}} <b>guard's</b> <b>doors</b> on the left hand side. The pantograph well was also revised, bringing it closer towards the cab.|$|R
5000|$|Equipment {{as built}} {{included}} load sensing [...] "Metacone" [...] air suspension, rheostatic braking, hydraulic parking brake, pneumatic camshaft control by GEC and Brush DC motors of type LT117, with each Dm car having four motors. Air supply was by Reavell reciprocating compressors and braking equipment was by Westinghouse. The <b>guard's</b> <b>door</b> controls {{were in the}} driver's cab; this eased conversion to one-man operation in 1983-4, the first LU line to do so.|$|R
