40|$|International audienceA moist entropy {{potential}} temperature-denoted by θs-is defined analytically {{in terms}} of the specific entropy for moist air. The expression for θs is valid for a general mixing of dry air, water vapour and possible condensed water species. It displays the same conservative properties as the moist entropy, even for varying dry air or total water content. The moist formulation for θs is equal to the dry formulation θ if dry air is considered, and it displays new properties valid for the moist air cases, both saturated or unsaturated ones. Exact and approximate versions of θs are evaluated for several stratocumulus cases, in particular by using the aircraft observation datasets from the FIRE-I experiment. It appears that there is no (or only a small) jump in θs {{at the top of the}} planetary boundary layer (PBL). The mixing in moist entropy is almost complete in the PBL, with the same values observed in the clear air and the cloudy regions, including the very top of the entrainment region. The Randall-Deardorff Cloud-Top Entrainment Instability analysis may be interpreted as a mixing in moist entropy criterion. The iso-θs lines are plotted on <b>skew</b> <b>T-log</b> <b>p</b> and conserved variable diagrams.

40|$|We explore {{magnetic}} field configurations {{that lead to}} the formation of magnetic spots on the surface of neutron stars and the displacement of the magnetic dipole axis. We find that a toroidally dominated {{magnetic field}} is essential for the generation of a single spot with a strong magnetic field. Once a spot forms, it survives for several million years, even after the total magnetic field has decayed significantly. We find that the dipole axis is not stationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general coincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to non-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal dipole axis at rates that may reach 0 fdg 4 per century. A misaligned poloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant displacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss the evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the <b>P</b> [...] <b>Ṗ</b> <b>diagram</b> and the observational implications. We find that neutron stars spend a very short time before they cross the Death Line of the <b>P</b> [...] <b>Ṗ</b> <b>diagram,</b> compared to their characteristic ages. Moreover, the maximum intensity of their surface magnetic field is substantially higher than the dipole component of the field. We argue that SGR 0418 + 5729 could be an example of this type of behavior, having a weak dipole field, yet hosting a magnetic spot responsible for its magnetar behavior. The evolution on the pulse profile and braking index of the Crab pulsar, which are attributed to an increase of its obliquity, are compatible with the anticipated drift of the magnetic axis...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{electromagnetic}} pulsar spindown by combining our experience from the two limiting idealized cases which have been studied in great extent in the past: that of an aligned rotator where ideal MHD conditions apply, and that of a misaligned rotator in vacuum.

We show that near the death line aligned rotators spin down much slower than orthogonal ones. In order to test this approach, we use a simple Monte Carlo method to simulate the evolution of pulsars and find a good fit to the observed pulsar distribution in the P − ˙ <b>P</b> <b>diagram</b> without invoking magnetic field decay.
