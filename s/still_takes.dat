5|$|Fluorite or {{fluorspar}} {{is called}} Blue John in the Peak District, the name allegedly {{coming from the}} French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the bandings. Blue John is now scarce, {{and only a few}} hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave; mining <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place in the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|Today, Mérens {{closest to}} the {{original}} type and lifestyle {{are found in the}} valleys of the high mountains of the Pyrenees, near Andorra. The majority of Mérens breeding <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place in Ariege, the traditional homeland of the breed. However, they can also be found in almost all regions of France, including the Alps, the Cévennes, the Centre, the Massif Central and the Île-de-France. Besides the annual breed show in Bouan, Mérens are also commonly seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show and other major horse shows.|$|E

5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place in Casamance, {{which is one}} of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, {{which is one of}} the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} annual Danish-inspired {{celebrations}} in town, including the town parade, Grundlovsdag (Danish Constitution Day), Fastelavn, and Æbleskiver Days. Æbleskiver are traditional Danish pancakes in a distinctive spherical shape. Æbleskiver Days {{is one of}} the town's top attractions, and has been held annually by Danish descendants for more than a hundred years. During this two-day festival held on the 4th weekend of every July, Danebod celebrates its Danish heritage and community. During this festival, there is a parade inspired by Danish traditions and culture that goes down Main Street with floats made by the various neighborhoods. Traditional Danish foods such as medisterpølse, frikadeller, rabarbergrød, rødkål, cream wafers, cinnamon sticks, rosettes, kisses, as well as æbleskiver, smørrebrød, Danish coffee, liver-pâté, and sweets are also popular during the festival. Other activities during Æbleskiver Days include traditional Danish folk dancing, Danish art displays, Danish folk song singing, children's activities, and the fairground fair called Tivoli The Scandinavian tradition of singing and dancing around the Christmas tree <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place {{at the center of the}} Gym Hall during Christmas time. Some families keep up the tradition of celebrating Christmas Eve on December24. There is a town fair on the Danish Constitution Day, June5. There are still quite a few Danish speakers, especially among the elders.|$|E

25|$|HTS is a {{relatively}} recent innovation, made feasible largely through modern advances in robotics and high-speed computer technology. It <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> a highly specialized and expensive screening lab to run an HTS operation, so in many cases a small- to moderate-size research institution will use the services of an existing HTS facility rather than set up one for itself.|$|E

Medical and related studies replace the bachelor's degree with six-year first professional degrees and graduate Doctor of Medicine (doktor medicine) degrees.|$|E
25|$|Some {{agriculture}} <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> {{place in}} the municipality but environmental degradation {{and the growth of}} the city is making this a smaller sector of the economy. Crops raised include corn, beans, wheat, oats, avocados, pears, apples, peaches, choke cherries, Mexican hawthorns, nuts and white sapotes. Most agriculture takes place on small plots on the edges of the municipality. Similarly livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and horses are raised.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the oldest}} league in the world, the English Football League (EFL) now ranks {{second in the}} {{hierarchy}} of English football since the split of England's top clubs in 1992 to form the FA Premier League.

25|$|Ideally, the {{computational}} method {{will be able}} to predict affinity before a compound is synthesized and hence in theory only one compound needs to be synthesized, saving enormous time and cost. The reality is that present {{computational method}}s are imperfect and provide, at best, only qualitatively accurate estimates of affinity. In practice it <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> several iterations of design, synthesis, and testing before an optimal drug is discovered. Computational methods have accelerated discovery by reducing the number of iterations required and have often provided novel structures.|$|E
25|$|Mining, {{particularly}} of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), baryte, graphite and slate, was historically a major Lakeland industry, {{mainly from the}} 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide charcoal for smelting. Some mining <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place today; for example, slate mining continues at the Honister Mines, {{at the top of}} Honister Pass. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite {{led to the development of}} the pencil industry, especially around Keswick.|$|E
25|$|Underwood {{was born}} March 10, 1983, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, to Carole (Shatswell) and Stephen Underwood. She is the {{youngest}} of three daughters and was raised on her parents' farm in the nearby rural town of Checotah. Her father worked in a sawmill while her mother taught elementary school. She has two older sisters, Shanna and Stephanie. Extremely hyperactive, {{she was diagnosed with}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at age five and was prescribed Ritalin and Dexedrine, medicines she <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> as an adult. During her childhood, Underwood performed at Robbins Memorial Talent Show, and sang at her local church, First Free Will Baptist Church. She later sang for local events in Checotah, including Old Settler's Day and the Lion's Club.|$|E

25|$|The ICC {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} the Champions Trophy – a short cricket tournament to raise funds {{for the development of the}} game in non-test playing countries, with the first tournaments being held in Bangladesh and Kenya. Due to its massive commercial success, the tournament has been held in nations like India and England as a revenue generator for the ICC, and the number of teams has been reduced to eight. The tournament, later dubbed as the mini-World Cup as it involved all of the full members of the ICC, was planned as a knock-out tournament so that it was short and did not reduce the value and importance of the World Cup. However, from 2002, the tournament has had a round-robin format, followed by a few knockout games but the tournament <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> places over a short period of time – about two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Taiji, Wakayama Prefecture is {{the only}} town in Japan where drive hunting <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> place on a large scale. Captive dolphin are now sold to aquariums and swim {{programs}} all over the world. The animals that are captured often die within days due to shock and injury. [...] Many die during transport. [...] The rest will live out their considerably shortened lives in captivity. A hunt {{took place in the}} Futo area of Itō, Shizuoka in 2004. In 2007, Taiji wanted to step up its dolphin hunting programs, approving an estimated ¥330 million {{for the construction of a}} massive cetacean slaughterhouse in an effort to popularize the consumption of dolphins in the country.|$|E
500|$|Today, Sde Dov Airport mostly handles {{domestic}} flights within Israel, {{as well as}} light-aircraft {{activity and}} limited international flights, mostly to nearby Cyprus. The airport has two terminals. The IAF <b>still</b> <b>takes</b> up about 40% of overall movements (take-offs and landings), and uses the airport {{as a base for}} some of its operations, as well as a convenient hub for military and government passenger traffic. Due to its location in the centre of Israel, air-force and civilian pilots alike cross the airspace controlled by Sde Dov's air traffic control tower from north to south and vice versa in order to reach their destination, without landing at Sde Dov. This increases significantly the air traffic density above and around the airport, and efforts have been made to keep [...] "crossing traffic" [...] away from the approach and departure patterns in order to minimise their effect on air traffic safety at Sde Dov. The airport has seven check-in desks and 45 aircraft stands.|$|E
