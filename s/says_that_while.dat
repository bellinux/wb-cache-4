5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> Zone Three on {{the surface}} {{appears to be a}} feminist utopia, Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Said's father, who {{had been}} working for the {{government}} as an Islamic magistrate since 1948, sent for him to begin schooling. Samatar subsequently moved to the town of Qalaafo, transitioning from nomadic life to urban life. A sixteen year old at the time, Samatar found himself surrounded by eight-year-old classmates. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> the experience in general was humiliating, he endured.|$|E

Setting out to find her, Haven reaches Darkwater Castle, home of Overlord, who {{contacts}} Vetch to tell him their plan is going well. Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Haven's dreams.

25|$|The Concord (Mass.) Public Library {{committee}} {{has decided to}} exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One {{member of the committee}} <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and {{the other members of the}} committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.|$|E
25|$|Dave Gaubatz, {{a former}} Air Force special {{investigator}} {{who was as}} a civilian employee in Iraq in 2003, <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> in Iraq, he acquired what he considered reliable information about WMD caches in four locations that had gas and chemical weapons that were recently produced. He could not get U.S. military officials {{to look into the}} matter, so he eventually contacted Weldon and Representative Peter Hoekstra, head of the House Intelligence Committee, to share his information and to try to get them to pressure the Defense Department and intelligence agencies to do the WMD searches in four locales.|$|E

On {{the day he was}} to face questioning, Aponte Aponte fled the country, and has sought refuge in the U.S., where he began to cooperate with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Department of Justice. Aponte <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> serving as a judge, he was forced to acquit an army commander who had connections with a 2 metric ton shipment of cocaine. Aponte also claimed that Henry Rangel, former defense minister of Venezuela, and General Clíver Alcalá Cordones were involved in the drug trade.|$|E

25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E
25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, {{the very}} concept of human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E
5000|$|Spider Robinson {{gave the}} novel a mixed review, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> [...] "the book reads well [...] [...] [...], {{individual}} sections are often brilliant, {{and the message}} is incisive and timely," [...] that [...] "as a story it limps" [...] and that many characters, including the main antagonists, [...] "are cut from cardboard." [...] New York Times reviewer Gerald Jonas was even more critical, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> Brunner was attempting to write [...] "slice-of-life" [...] fiction about a future society, {{the result of his}} arbitrary choices about social details is that [...] "the entire fictional edifice collapses like a house of cards." ...|$|R

500|$|Michael Bell <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> Hel [...] "might {{at first}} {{appear to be}} {{identical}} with the well-known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld" [...] as described in chapter 34 of Gylfaginning, [...] "in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of Nicodemus she casts quite a different a shadow," [...] and that in [...] Bartholomeus saga postola [...] "she is clearly {{the queen of the}} Christian, not pagan, underworld." ...|$|E
500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{says that}} [...] "the eight-legged horse of Odin is the typical steed of the shaman" [...] {{and that in}} the shaman's {{journeys}} to the heavens or the underworld, a shaman [...] "is usually represented as riding on some bird or animal." [...] Davidson <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> the creature may vary, the horse is fairly common [...] "in the lands where horses are in general use, and Sleipnir's ability to bear the god through the air is typical of the shaman's steed" [...] and cites an example from a study of shamanism by Mircea Eliade of an eight-legged foal from a story of a Buryat shaman. Davidson <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> {{attempts have been made to}} connect Sleipnir with hobby horses and steeds with more than four feet that appear in carnivals and processions, but that [...] "a more fruitful resemblance seems to be on the bier on which a dead man is carried in the funeral procession by four bearers; borne along thus, he may be described as riding on a steed with eight legs." [...] As an example, Davidson cites a funeral dirge from the Gondi people in India as recorded by Verrier Elwin, stating that [...] "it contains references to Bagri Maro, the horse with eight legs, and it is clear from the song that it is the dead man's bier." [...] Davidson says that the song is sung when a distinguished Muria dies, and provides a verse: ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{has been}} {{described}} as having a wide-ranging sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has [...] "become a crossover sex symbol". Offstage Beyoncé <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress [...] "is absolutely for the stage." [...] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s (decade), the media often used the term [...] "Bootylicious" [...] (a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious) to describe Beyoncé, the term popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same name. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the trial}} begins, the {{skeleton}} is seen outside the courtroom. Everyone rushes {{to it to}} see a foreboding message that [...] "The End" [...] will come at sundown. Sundown approaches and the citizens gather around the skeleton, but nothing occurs. As Lisa starts to reprimand them, the skeleton silences her and is hoisted over {{to the entrance of}} the new Heavenly Hills Mall. Lisa realizes the whole saga was a publicity stunt for the mall and criticizes management. The bargain-loving public goes shopping and Dr. Gould confesses that he actually never tested Lisa's sample. Marge <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> it was rising, Lisa believed the angel was real. Lisa denies this, but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support.|$|E
500|$|Zacharias {{states that}} a {{coherent}} worldview {{must be able}} to satisfactorily answer four questions: that of origin, meaning of life, morality and destiny. He <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> every major religion makes exclusive claims about truth, the Christian faith is unique in its ability to answer all four of these questions. He routinely speaks on the coherence of the Christian worldview, saying that Christianity is capable of withstanding the toughest philosophical attacks. Zacharias believes that the apologist must argue from three levels: the theoretical, to line up the logic of the argument; the arts, to illustrate; and [...] "kitchen table talk", to conclude and apply. [...] Zacharias' style of apologetic focuses predominantly on Christianity's answers to life's great existential questions, with defense of God.|$|E
500|$|Many of Gordimer's {{works have}} {{explored}} {{the impact of}} apartheid on individuals in South Africa. Journalist and novelist George Packer writes that, as in several of her novels, a theme in Burger's Daughter is of racially divided societies in which well-meaning whites unexpectedly encounter a side of black life {{they did not know}} about. Literary critic Carolyn Turgeon <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>while</b> Lionel was able to work with black activists in the ANC, Rosa discovers that with the rise of the Black Consciousness Movement, many young blacks tend [...] to view white liberals as irrelevant in their struggle for liberation. Rosa witnesses this first hand listening to the black university student in Soweto (Duma Dhladhla) and, later, in London, her childhood friend [...] "Baasie" [...] (Zwelinzima Vulindlela), who both dismiss her father as unimportant.|$|E
