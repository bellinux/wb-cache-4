40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to model bank spread {{behavior}} under capital regulation and deposit insurance. Comparative static results show that an increase in the capital-to-deposits ratio or the deposit insurance decreases the bank's interest margin or spread. It is also shown that an increase in the equity that implies its opportunity cost of the coupon rate on the fixed leg decreases the margin. Previous research on market-based evaluations of bank equity has modeled the bank as a narrowing banking firm with risky assets and insured liabilities. The equity of the bank is viewed as a call option on its risky assets. No attempt was made to explicitly analyze a synergy between lending and deposit-taking, and, in our view, the equity of the bank is viewed as a <b>swap</b> <b>option</b> on coupon bonds. Synergy banking, particularly in the return to retail banking, is important in distinguishing banks from other lenders such as finance companies and mutual fund institutions. These other lenders call for the breaking up of banks into separate lending and deposit-taking operations, respectively. Our findings provide an insight for synergy banking operations concerning regulated bank spread behavior in the return to retail banking.

The research aims are to evaluate the growth and development of existing financial instruments and to recommend for introducing new financial instruments in the capital market of Bangladesh. The data are taken from the Dhaka stock exchange for the year 1977 to 2010 for interpretation of development and the data from 2003 to 2010 are taken for analysis and hypothesis test. There are only five products traded including three types of bonds. The average growth rate of market capitalization of common stocks, treasury bonds, mutual funds, corporate bonds & debentures are 71. 02 %, 124. 74 %, 99. 85 % and 105. 41 % respectively. The growth of market capitalization of all products is high. There is lot of scope in the market for absorbing the new products.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} the pricing of options on credit default swaps using the survival-measure-pricing {{technique}} is discussed. In particular, we derive {{a modification of}} the famous Black (1976) futures pricing formula which applies to options on CDS, and show how other pricing formulae can be easily derived if {{the dynamics of the}} forward CDS rates are specified differently. The main tool in the derivation of the pricing formulae is to express prices and payoffs in terms of a defaultable numeraire asset, the fee stream of the underlying forwardstarting CDS. As this numeraire becomes worthless in default, certain technical difficulties arise which can be solved using the mathematical tool of the T-forward survival measure (first introduced in Schönbucher (1999)), a pricing measure which is conditioned on survival until T. The properties of such pricing measures are a second focus of this note. With increasing liquidity of the plain-vanilla CDS markets, the first derivatives on these basic credit derivatives have been introduced. In particular the market options on credit default swaps, or credit default swaptions is growing, be it as embedded options to extend or cancel an existing CDS, or as explicit options on the CDS. In the cover article of the May 2003 issue of Risk magazine, Patel (2003) discussed the growing market for options on credit default swaps, or credit default swaptions, and their practical applications. In this note we explain in more detail some of the methods which were first used in Schönbucher (1999) to price such options. In particular, we derive a modification of the famous Black (1976) futures pricing formula which applies to options on CDS and show how the methods can be extended to other models if you do not like the lognormality assumption.

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningHoward HahnIn Novato, California, zoning {{regulations}} and the city’s urban growth boundary (UGB) have restricted development on open agricultural and hillside land outside the city. These restrictions {{have added to}} a shortage of affordable homes in Novato {{in spite of a}} demand for housing. Population growth estimates suggest that this demand will continue and strategic development of land outside the current city boundaries will need to occur in order over the next 15 - 20 years (Bay Area Census Data 2010 and Heid 2004). This report outlines a process of land development which evaluates the success of a development alternative relative to what the land owners, developers and the community want, need, and value. This process involved producing four community design alternatives of varying housing densities for an 867 acre parcel of land just beyond Novato’s UGB. The alternatives were: high density (556 homes), medium density (224 homes), low density (14 homes), and low density + land swap (72 homes). Using a systematic scoring process, each alternative was evaluated based on what the land owner, developer, and the community valued in the development and then awarded each a feasibility score. This score represents likelihood of implementation. The higher the feasibility score, the more likely the alternative could be pursued as a development option. The high density alternative (556 homes) received the lowest feasibility score. It met many of the land owner and developer values, but few of the community values. The low density + land swap alternative (58 homes) received the highest feasibility score. This alternative met nearly all of the developer and owner values as well as the community values. The land <b>swap</b> <b>option</b> of this alternative was unique and made this design more feasible. The swap identified land areas on the site property that could be traded for developable land inside the city boundary allowing Novato to maintain the rural character of the city fringe, while giving the developer land {{that could be used for}} future development. This alternative is a compromise that adequately addresses the values of all involved and is therefore recommended as the most feasible design possibility...|$|E

Credit default swaps (CDSs) have proved {{to be one of the}} most successful financial innovations of the 1990 s. They are instruments that provide insurance against a particular company (or sovereign entity) defaulting on its debt. The company is known as the reference entity and a default by the company is known as a credit event. The buyer of the protection makes periodic payments to the seller of protection at a predetermined fixed rate per year. The payments continue until the end of the life of the contract or until a credit event, whichever is earlier. If a credit event occurs, the buyer of protection has the right to deliver a bond issued by the reference entity (the reference bond) to the seller of protection in exchange for its face value...|$|R
