25|$|Note {{that some}} of these (such as median, or mid-range) are {{measures}} of central tendency, and are used as estimators for a location parameter, such as the mean of a normal distribution, while others (such as range or trimmed range) are measures of <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersion,</b> and are used as estimators of a scale parameter, such as the standard deviation of a normal distribution.|$|E

30|$|The pattern {{describing}} {{the uncertainties of}} design variables are probability distributions that can be assigned based on the trends of <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersions</b> including Gaussian normal, log-normal, Bernoulli sequence and Poisson distributions. The uncertainty in material properties can thus be designated according to prescribed probability density functions. Although a deterministic approach can be employed to define the safe mud pressure by observing the stress responses, there are some inherent limitations, so it {{does not account for}} all the uncertainties mentioned above. This research aims at carrying out follow-up stochastic analyses to investigate the robustness of wellbore conditions and design and to test the reliability of results from preceding deterministic analyses.|$|R
40|$|Outputs {{from new}} {{software}} program Aperture Photometry Tool (APT) are compared with similar outputs from SExtractor for sources extracted from R-band optical images {{acquired by the}} Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), infrared mosaics constructed from Spitzer Space Telescope images, and a processed visible/near-infrared image from the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA). Two large samples from the PTF images are studied, each containing around 3 × 10 ^ 3 sources from noncrowded fields. The median values of source-intensity relative percentage {{differences between the two}} software programs, computed separately for two PTF samples, are + 0. 13 % and + 0. 17 %, with corresponding <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersions</b> of 1. 43 % and 1. 84 %, respectively. For the Spitzer mosaics, a similar large sample of extracted sources for each of channels 1 – 4 of Spitzer’s Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) are analyzed with two different sky annulus sizes, and we find that the median and modal values of source-intensity relative percentage differences between the two software programs are between - 0. 5 % and + 2. 0 %, and the corresponding <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersions</b> range from 1. 4 to 6. 7 %, depending on the Spitzer IRAC channel and sky annulus. The results for the HLA image are mixed, as might be expected for a moderately crowded field. The comparisons for the three different kinds of images show that there is generally excellent agreement between APT and SExtractor. Differences in source-intensity uncertainty estimates for the PTF images amount to less than 3 % for the PTF sources, and these are potentially caused by SExtractor’s omission of the sky background uncertainty term in the formula for source-intensity uncertainty, as well as differing methods of sky background estimation...|$|R

2500|$|The mean {{absolute}} deviation around the mean {{is a more}} robust estimator of <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersion</b> than the standard deviation for beta distributions with tails and inflection points at {{each side of the}} mode, Beta(α, β) distributions with α,β > 2, as it depends on the linear (absolute) deviations rather than the square deviations from the mean.

40|$|The {{results of}} a further {{evolution}} of the bipolar application specific semicustom array (ASSA), intended for designing prototype ICs, used in physical experiments, are described. That is achieved by PC platform adaptation of the IC developer’s Design Kit on this array, by using thoroughly tuned SPICE-models, reflecting the temperature dependences over the chip, when it works, and the <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersions</b> arising during the production and so on. The development time frames can be significantly reduced {{due to the fact}} that an engineer should merely design the schematics and order the topology of connections in ASSA, that is to be made by a technological company.

40|$|We show empirically {{that fits}} to the color-magnitude {{relation}} of Type Ia supernovae after optical maximum can provide accurate relative extragalactic distances. We report {{the discovery of}} an empirical color relation for Type Ia light curves: During much of the first month past maximum, the magnitudes of Type Ia supernovae defined at a given value of color index have a very small magnitude dispersion; moreover, during this period the relation between B magnitude and B-V color (or B-R or B-I color) is strikingly linear, {{to the accuracy of}} existing well-measured data. These linear relations can provide robust distance estimates, in particular, by using the magnitudes when the supernova reaches a given color. After correction for light curve strech factor or decline rate, the dispersion of the magnitudes taken at the intercept of the linear color-magnitude relation are found to be around 0 ^m. 08 for the sub-sample of supernovae with < 0 ^m. 05, and around 0 ^m. 11 for the sub-sample with < 0 ^m. 2. This small dispersion is consistent with being mostly due to observational errors. The method presented here and the conventional light curve fitting methods can be combined to further improve <b>statistical</b> <b>dispersions</b> of distance estimates. It can be combined with the magnitude at maximum to deduce dust extinction. The slopes of the color-magnitude relation may also be used to identify intrinsically different SN Ia systems. The method provides a tool that is fundamental to using SN Ia to estimate cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the mass and dark energy content of the universe.

40|$|The {{computer}} program NORMTRI {{has been developed}} to calculate the behaviour of tritium in the environment released into the atmosphere under normal operation of nuclear facilities. It is possible to investigate the two chemical forms tritium gas and tritiated water vapour. The conversion of tritium gas into tritiated water followed by its reemission back to the atmosphere {{as well as the}} conversion into organically bound tritium is considered. NORMTRI is based on the <b>statistical</b> Gaussian <b>dispersion</b> model ISOLA, which calculates the activity concentration in air near the ground contamination due to dry and wet deposition at specified locations in a polar grid system. ISOLA requires a four-parametric meteorological statistics derived from one or more years synoptic recordings of 1 -hour-averages of wind speed, wind direction, stability class and precipitation intensity. Additional features of NORMTRI are the possibility to choose several dose calculation procedures, ranging from the equations of the German regulatory guidelines to a pure specific equilibrium approach.

40|$|Most {{statistical}} procedures, including {{parameter estimation}} and hypothesis testing, {{are based on}} a tacit assumption of a statistical sample consisted of independent random variables. This is not consistent with geophysical processes, which usually exhibit a strong temporal dependence, often of long range. Such dependence implies substantial negative bias in the estimation of <b>statistical</b> parameters of <b>dispersion,</b> e. g., variance, as well as parameters of dependence, e. g., autocorrelation. Failure to account for this bias leads to distorted picture of the underlying process and results in erroneous modelling and prediction. Here we demonstrate the impact of neglecting dependence in parameter estimators by using synthetic examples from stochastic processes with sort- and long-range dependence, as well as rainfall datasets that exhibit high temporal dependence. We also propose a methodology to correctly account for the bias...|$|R
