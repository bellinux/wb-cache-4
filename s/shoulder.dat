5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} <b>shoulder</b> of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. <b>Shoulder</b> steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork <b>shoulder</b> steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo analyze {{changes in}} the capsule from {{idiopathic}} frozen <b>shoulders</b> and clarify their etiology. Materials and methodsSamples (the rotator interval capsule, middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL), and inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL)) were collected from 12 idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders</b> with severe stiffness and 18 <b>shoulders</b> with rotator cuff tears as a control. The number of cells was counted and the tissue elasticity of the samples was calculated by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). The amount of glycosaminoglycan content was assessed by alcian blue staining. Gene and protein expressions related to fibrosis, inflammation, and chondrogenesis were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the total genes {{of the two groups}} were compared by DNA microarray analysis. ResultsThe number of cells was significantly higher and the capsular tissue was significantly stiffer in idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders</b> compared with <b>shoulders</b> with rotator cuff tears. Staining intensity of alcian blue was significantly stronger in idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders.</b> Gene expressions related to fibrosis, inflammation, and chondrogenesis were significantly higher in idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders</b> compared with <b>shoulders</b> with rotator cuff tears assessed by both qPCR and DNA microarray analysis. ConclusionIn addition to fibrosis and inflammation, which used to be considered the main pathology of frozen <b>shoulders,</b> chondrogenesis is likely to have a critical role in pathogenesis of idiopathic frozen <b>shoulders...</b>|$|R

5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right <b>shoulder</b> tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right <b>shoulder,</b> necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted <b>shoulder</b> {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that, as in numerous published studies, our anatomic parameters were measured on <b>shoulders</b> with normal or healthy bone morphology, whereas the findings are relevant to design prosthetic humeral stems for arthritic <b>shoulders</b> that feature substantial proximal deformations. We chose to study <b>shoulders</b> with normal or healthy bone morphology for two reasons: (i) in arthritic <b>shoulders,</b> subchondral damage to the humeral head often renders calculations of its diameter and centre difficult and inaccurate; and (ii) the goals of TSA are to replace damaged articular surfaces and restore adequate joint architecture, which is often deformed due to congenital or progressive pathologies in arthritic <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
