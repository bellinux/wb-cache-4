500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office {{was going to be}} some kind of subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are {{singled out}} by Cox as among the finest {{of this part of}} Wood's career. Among those {{conducting}} their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, [...] "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: [...] "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." [...] However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: [...] "I must <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands." ...|$|E

2500|$|Merezhkovsky's {{relationship}} with Severny Vestnik, though, again started to deteriorate, the reason [...] being Akim Volynsky's jealousy. In 1896 {{all three of}} them (husband still unaware {{of what was going on}} behind his back) made a trip to Europe to visit Leonardo da Vinci's places. Several ugly rows with Volynsky finally prompted Gippius to send her scandalous-minded lover home.

2500|$|These {{findings}} {{meant that}} as of January 2013, scientists were very sure they had found an unknown particle of mass ~ 125GeV/c2, and had not been misled by experimental error or a chance result. They were also sure, from initial observations, that the new particle {{was some kind of}} boson. The behaviours and properties of the particle, so far as examined since July 2012, also seemed quite close to the behaviours expected of a Higgs boson. Even so, it could still have been a Higgs boson or some other unknown boson, since future tests could show behaviours that do not match a Higgs boson, so as of December 2012 CERN still only stated that the new particle was [...] "consistent with" [...] the Higgs boson, and scientists did not yet positively <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Higgs boson.

Nuerbage police station chief Abulaiti Maitiniyazi (Ablet Metniyaz) was a witness to the attack. He recalled shouting to the men in Uyghur for a peaceful settlement, but receiving molotov cocktails and rocks in return. One Han paramilitary officer belonging to people's armed police force was killed by a molotov cocktail when his squad was entering ground level by force. According to Maitiniyazi, it was when the attackers were hacking at the civilian hostages' face, nose and ears with knives with intent to kill that police shot 14 of the assailants to death and captured the other four for questioning, ending the attack within 90 minutes of the initial break-in. Six of the eight hostages were rescued alive, while two Han women hostages were hacked to death during the operation, and four Uyghurs were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.|$|E
