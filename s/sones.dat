5|$|In the beginning, {{the major}} part of his work {{revolved}} around valvular and congenital diseases; later on he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of <b>Sones,</b> father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason <b>Sones,</b> Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 F. Mason <b>Sones,</b> a {{pediatric}} cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, accidentally injected radiocontrast in a coronary artery {{instead of the}} left ventricle. Although the patient had a reversible cardiac arrest, <b>Sones</b> and Shirey developed the procedure further, and are credited with the discovery (Connolly 2002); they published a series of 1,000 patents in 1966 (Proudfit et al.).|$|E
25|$|The Rumbitas were {{considered}} as Proto-sones (primeval <b>Sones),</b> {{because of the}} evident analogy that its structural components show with the Son, which emerged in Havana during {{the first decades of}} the 20th century.

25|$|In 1917 four musicians calling {{themselves}} Cuarteto Oriental recorded four numbers for Columbia in Havana. The numbers {{are listed in}} a Columbia catalog for 1921, but are probably lost. However, the same group expanded to a sextet in 1918, and were recorded by Victor in a field recording at the Hotel Inglaterra in Havana. At {{least one of these}} records has survived, giving two numbers, which are probably the first surviving <b>sones.</b> The new grouping called itself Sexteto Habanero in 1920.|$|E

25|$|The group's {{recordings}} in New York 1925-26 {{are available}} on LP and CD. The music is of high quality, considering the technical limitations of the time; the group won first prize in the Concurso de <b>Sones</b> in 1925 and 1926. When the group added a cornet, soon replaced by a trumpet, namely Félix Chappottín, it became the Septeto Habanero. This latter line-up lasted until the late 1930s, when sextetos were ousted by conjuntos and big bands. The leader, Gerardo Martínez then formed a new group, Conjunto Típico Habanero.|$|E
25|$|Trova {{is one of}} {{the great}} roots of the Cuban musical tree. In the 19th century a group of {{itinerant}} musicians known as trovadores moved around Oriente, especially Santiago de Cuba, earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. According to one writer, to qualify as a trovador in Cuba, a person should a) sing songs of his own composition, or of others of the same kind; b) accompany himself on the guitar; and c) deal poetically with the song. This definition fits best the singers of boleros, and less well the Afrocubans singing funky <b>sones</b> (El Guayabero) or even guaguancós and abakuá (Chicho Ibáñez). It rules out, perhaps unfairly, singers who accompanied themselves on the piano.|$|E

Benjamin E. <b>Sones</b> of Computer Games Magazine considered the game's story to be [...] "quite good", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail the events of the first game for new players. He wrote that Thief IIs graphics were passable but that its sound design was [...] "phenomenal". <b>Sones</b> praised its missions as [...] "very well crafted", and noted that they gave the impression of being in [...] "a living, breathing world."

[...] While the patient went into ventricular fibrillation, the dangerous arrhythmia was terminated by Dr. <b>Sones</b> promptly performing a precordial thump which restored sinus rhythm.

30|$|<b>Sone</b> River has {{undergone}} avulsion several (9) times, {{in the recent}} geological past (< 10, 000  years) and its abandoned channels mostly lie within ~ 50  km east from the present channel course (Sahu et al. 2010). The oldest bed of <b>Sone</b> River almost coincides with the north–south aligned geological section discussed in the present study. The above discussions suggest the fact that sediment deposited by <b>Sone</b> River {{is in the form}} of active channel deposit of coarse grain nature.
