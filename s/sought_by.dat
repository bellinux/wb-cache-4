5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> state Republicans. Under the court order, {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates or silver content, the dime is less widely <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's edicts {{emphasized}} the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public. The position of decurion, {{member of the}} city council, had been an honor <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall {{in the amount of}} tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, the species {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where the species is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research {{has been carried out}} on the species, especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, {{as well as}} the power <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.|$|E

5|$|Guy de Beauchamp {{is today}} remembered {{primarily}} {{for his part}} in the killing of Gaveston, but by his contemporaries he was considered a man of exceptionally good judgement and learning. He owned what was for his time a large collection of books, and his advice was often <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> many of the other earls. Next to Lancaster, he was the wealthiest peer in the nation, and after his death his lands and title were inherited by his son, Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|He idolized his {{elder brother}} Terry, who was {{considered}} a top NHL prospect until Terry's career was ended when he suffered a broken neck after being hit from behind into the boards during a college game. While his brother was highly <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> American universities, John received only two scholarship offers, choosing to play for Boston University (BU) in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In 1637 Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania died. He was {{the last}} of the Slavic Griffins Dynasty of the Duchy of Pomerania. Sweden {{acquired}} the Pomeranian rule, while the Commonwealth was only able to get back its fiefs, Bytów Land and Lębork Land. Słupsk Land was also <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> Władysław IV at the peace conference, but it ended up a part of Brandenburg, which after the Peace of Westphalia controlled all of Pomerania adjacent to the border of the Commonwealth, extending south to where it met with Habsburg lands. Portions of Pomerania were populated by the Slavic Kashubians and Slovincians.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, the Los Angeles County Superior Court denied Activision's {{motion to}} dismiss No Doubt's rights of {{publicity}} claims under California's anti-SLAPP law. In February 2011, the 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court's ruling, allowing No Doubt's case to proceed against Activision. In May 2012, the Superior Court denied Activision's motion for summary judgment, though it also denied a preliminary injunction <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> the band. In October 2012, {{on the eve of}} trial, the case was settled for undisclosed terms.|$|E
5|$|Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. is {{the first}} release by American metal band Slipknot. Released {{originally}} on October 31, 1996, it was limited to production of 1,000 copies. The band originally self-distributed some of these copies, but went on to release the remaining units through -ismist Recordings in 1997. Due to its limited release, the album has become much <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> fans since Slipknot's rise in fame.|$|E
5|$|Montauran, on {{the other}} hand, is devoted wholly to the royalist cause, and chafes against the ignorant nobles {{supporting}} it. He fights for the Chouan cause because he believes in it, not for the personal gain <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> the aristocrats in whose midst he works. He gives up the cause for Marie, but only {{as a result of}} an unclear series of events, the product of everyone's intertwined double-crossing.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|An Assembly of Notables (the members {{consisted}} of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 {{to ratify the}} financial reforms <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, the opportunity he had long been waiting for to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies {{that would have a}} say in local taxation. Calonne's proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, Louis XVI dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, acquired Calonne's ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne's reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated Louis XVI dissolved the assembly.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{a network}} of former SS members, Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949. He {{initially}} lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960 while being <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal {{so that he could}} be brought to trial. In spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, Mengele eluded capture. He drowned while swimming off the Brazilian coast in 1979 and was buried under a false name. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.|$|E
5|$|British rule {{came at a}} {{price for}} many {{ordinary}} {{people as well as}} traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were <b>sought</b> <b>by</b> the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms.|$|E
