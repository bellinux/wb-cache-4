5|$|Originally {{organized}} {{as a part}} of the 95th Infantry Division for World War I, the brigade never saw combat in that conflict. Kept active and in the reserve through much of the 20th century, the brigade in name was reorganized into a different unit for fighting during World War II. Seeing numerous moves, activations and deactivations, the brigade has been used principally as a training unit for most of its existence. Reactivated again in 2006, the brigade is now primarily responsible for training provincial reconstruction teams and their <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> for deployment to the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wareo (27 November– 8 December 1943) {{was fought}} by Australian and Japanese forces in New Guinea during the Huon Peninsula {{campaign}} of World War II {{in the later}} part of 1943. Coming after the capture of Sattelberg by the Allies, the battle took place amidst the Australian advance north towards Sio. The Australians committed elements from four infantry brigades from the Australian 9th Division with <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> including artillery, engineers and tank support, while the Japanese force consisted primarily of two depleted infantry regiments from the 20th Division, with limited artillery support.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Operation Barras {{was a factor}} in the {{decision}} to form the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), a permanent unit whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. The SFSG was formed in 2006 from an infantry battalion—originally 1 PARA, which was the first battalion to serve in the role—with <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment. The SFSG went on to support special forces operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{fighting}} {{had not yet}} spread to the Pacific, by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies {{about the possibility of}} a war with Japan. After a review of the defences around Singapore and Malaya, the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region. In October, the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and <b>supporting</b> <b>elements.</b> As a result, the 2/18th—with a strength of 793 men—subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941, bound for Singapore. The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, so the deployment was only intended to be short, as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May. Consequently, the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and while they were still in the process of being brought up to full strength.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 4th Armoured Brigade {{was formed}} in January 1943 to provide {{armoured}} support for Australian Army units operating in the South West Pacific Area. The brigade was never intended {{to serve as a}} single formation, rather its role was to provide a pool of armoured units from which units and sub-units could be provided to augment infantry forces. The brigade was also responsible for developing doctrine and specialised armoured vehicles for armoured warfare in tropical terrain. In keeping with the brigade's task of providing armoured units to other formations, its armoured regiments were organised into self-supporting regimental groups and the brigade did not possess the reconnaissance, infantry and other <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> which were common in World War II-era armoured brigades. Elements of the brigade saw action in the Huon Peninsula campaign of 1943–44 and attached to the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape–Wewak campaign from October 1944 {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1940–41, the Militia {{were called}} up in cohorts for periods of {{continuous}} training, and the 3rd Division, still {{consisting of the}} 4th, 10th and 15th Brigades, undertook a series of training camps around Seymour, Victoria. In March 1941, the division's artillery was reorganised to bring it {{in line with the}} British organisational system with each artillery brigade being converted to a field regiment. Numerical designations stayed the same, however, and by late 1941 the division had completed its transition. This saw its infantry brigades once again reduced from four battalions to three, while various <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> were inserted at brigade-level, however, training at this time was still rudimentary and limited mainly to individual skills, and the division's establishment was recorded as being only half of its authorised wartime establishment. There was also a shortage of modern equipment.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an insert for clamping thin-wall hollow sections, which comprises a <b>support</b> <b>element</b> whose outer cross-section is complementary {{to the inner}} cross-section of the hollow section. The rigid <b>support</b> <b>element</b> is divided into several <b>support</b> wedge <b>elements</b> and supplemented by a rubber-elastic <b>support</b> <b>element</b> on which, preferably, a hose designed to hold a flow medium for internal pressure tests is fitted. The <b>support</b> wedge <b>elements</b> have a clamping device for clamping them together and against the internal surfaces of the hollow section. The rubber-elastic <b>support</b> <b>element</b> has compression device. There must also be at least one channel passing through the clamping and compression device to feed in and carry off flow medium {{in the interior of}} the hollow section, particularly the hose. The thin-wall hollow section of this type supported on the inside can be clamped by means of an external clamping device without deformation and tested for strength in this state u nder def ined, reproducible clamping condition...|$|R

50|$|Army, army group, region, and theatre are all large {{formations}} {{that vary}} significantly between {{armed forces in}} size and hierarchy position. While divisions were the traditional level at which <b>support</b> <b>elements</b> (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) {{were added to the}} unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving <b>support</b> <b>elements.</b> A regiment with such <b>support</b> <b>elements</b> is called a regimental combat team in US military parlance, or a battle group in the UK and other forces.|$|R
5|$|With the British 6th Airborne Division still {{refitting}} after Operation Tonga, and {{the subsequent}} fighting in Normandy, the task of securing the Rhine Bridgehead fell to the 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General Roy Urquhart. The division was made up of three brigades of infantry (two parachute, one glider borne), supporting artillery and anti-tank batteries and substantial Royal Engineer units, as well as <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> such as Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps units. Most of the division had seen action in North Africa and Sicily, particularly the 1st Parachute Brigade and 1st Airlanding Brigade. However, {{this was the first time}} the division had fought together as a complete formation.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, the Australian Government {{agreed to}} take on {{responsibility}} for the military operations in the northern Solomon Islands and Australian New Guinea, including New Britain. The Australian Army's 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, was selected to replace the 40th Infantry Division on New Britain in August, with the unit to assume responsibility for the island on 1 November. Instead of maintaining the American bases in western New Britain the Australians planned to operate closer to the Japanese forces which were positioned around the Gazelle Peninsula in the north-east of the island. By {{the time of the}} Australian take-over, Allied intelligence estimated that the Japanese forces on New Britain amounted to 38,000 personnel, but in actuality there were 93,000 Japanese on the island, forming part of General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. The Japanese personnel were focused upon sustaining themselves, with rice-growing and gardening being undertaken to supplement the limited supplies that were arriving. Japanese <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> were limited, with only two aircraft capable of action and no ships other than 150 barges that could move up to 90 personnel or 15 tons of stores.|$|E
5|$|Upon formation, the {{division}} drew its personnel from all Australian states {{and consisted of}} three four-battalion infantry brigades—the 9th, 10th and the 11th—and a number of <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> including engineers, artillery and medical personnel. Only rudimentary initial training was undertaken before elements of {{the division}} began the embarkation process in May and June 1916 as they were moved to the United Kingdom, where the individual sub units concentrated for the first time, received arms and other equipment and began the task of undertaking further training at Lark Hill, on Salisbury Plain. In July the division's artillery component was formed, consisting of three batteries of 18-pounders and one 4.5inch howitzer battery. The process of raising and training took some time and consequently the division was not transferred to France until mid November 1916. Prior to this, however, the division endured proposals to break it up to provide reinforcements to the other four Australian divisions that were already in France. Although these threats passed, in early September 1916, following losses around Pozières, almost 3,000 men from the 3rd Division were transferred. Throughout October it seemed likely that further drafts would be siphoned away from the division, however, this did not occur and in early November two divisional exercises were undertaken. Finally, on 21 November 1916, the 3rd Division crossed the English Channel and arrived in France.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E
5|$|These {{delays in}} turn {{affected}} the fly-in of 1 RAR, with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO Colombus before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral. Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15:30 to discuss {{aspects of the}} defence, as well as events planned for the following day. The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16:10, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight, {{more than four hours}} late. It became clear to Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy to the east of the FSB, and with just two hours before last light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions, the last of which were not established until 17:00. Due to the hurried deployment, by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups, rather than in a co-ordinated defensive position. The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally, yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly—Commanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment—both remained in Bearcat. Hughes was not present either, having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat, and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August 1974, Turkish forces, {{reinforced}} to {{the strength}} of two infantry divisions and <b>supporting</b> <b>elements,</b> commenced a second major offensive, codenamed Attila-2. This offensive lasted three days and caused the defences of the Cypriot National Guard and ELDYK to collapse, leading to the capture of the towns of Famagusta, Morphou, and the northern quarter of Nicosia. The Greek Cypriots attempted to mount their main eastern defensive line between Mia Millia and Nea Chorio villages, northeast of Nicosia.|$|E

25|$|The Landing at Nassau Bay was an amphibious landing by Allied {{forces at}} Nassau Bay during the New Guinea {{campaign}} of World War II {{that took place}} between 30 June and 6 July 1943. The operation was undertaken so that Allies could secure a beachhead to establish a supply point to shorten their supply lines for the proposed attack on Salamaua {{as part of the}} Salamaua–Lae campaign and resulted in a battalion-sized force of US infantry and <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> being landed largely unopposed on the south-eastern flank of the battle zone.|$|E
25|$|Brigade: A Brigade {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 3,000 combat troops with <b>supporting</b> <b>elements.</b> An Infantry Brigade usually has three Infantry Battalions along with various Support Elements. It is commanded by a brigade commander {{who is a}} Brigadier, equivalent to a Brigadier General in some armies. In addition to the Brigades in various Army Divisions, the Indian Army also has five Independent Armoured Brigades, 15 Independent Artillery Brigades, seven Independent Infantry Brigades, one Independent Parachute Brigade, three Independent Air Defence Brigades, two Independent Air Defence Groups and four Independent Engineer Brigades. These Independent Brigades operate directly under the Corps Commander (GOC Corps).|$|E

25|$|In October 1944, after 16 months active service, {{the brigade}} {{returned}} to Australia for rest and reorganisation on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. By {{that time it}} had grown to a full brigade-group, consisting of a headquarters, three infantry battalions—the 24th, 57th/60th and 58th/59th Battalions—and <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> including a signals section, a flamethrower platoon, three troops of tanks from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment, a section of engineers from the 15th Field Company, a company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion, the 266th Light Aid Detachment, as well as military police, postal and dental units and a detachment from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit.

25|$|The 29th Brigade was an {{infantry}} brigade of the Australian Army {{that was}} raised for service during World War II. Formed in late 1941 {{as part of}} the Militia, the brigade was initially formed for home defence in response to Japan's entry into the war. Composed of three Queensland-based infantry battalions and various <b>supporting</b> <b>elements,</b> the brigade initially undertook defensive duties around Townsville in 1941–42 before deploying to New Guinea in 1943. There, the brigade undertook garrison duties before taking part in the Salamaua–Lae campaign. After a period of almost 18 months overseas, the brigade's elements were returned to Australia for a period of rest and reorganisation before later being assigned to the Bougainville campaign in 1944–45. After the war, the brigade was disbanded in December 1945, along with its component units.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, {{after the}} AIF was disbanded, the {{part-time}} Citizens Forces was re-organised {{to adopt the}} numerical designations of the AIF. Thus the 1st Division was re-raised as a reserve formation, initially {{under the command of}} Colonel Charles Brand, composed primarily of infantry units based in New South Wales and Queensland. During the inter-war years, the assignment of battalions to brigades and divisions varied considerably within the Army and as a result the 1st Division's composition was changed a number of times; its initial order of battle included three infantry brigades– the 1st, 7th and 8th– each of four infantry battalions, and various <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> including engineers, field ambulance, artillery, signals, transport, medical, veterinarians and service corps troops.
