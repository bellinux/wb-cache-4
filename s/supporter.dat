50|$|One {{can work}} through this same {{issue in the}} {{opposite}} political direction—where it actually was a concern of Democrats in the 2004 election. In the 2004 presidential election, votepair.org matched Democratic Party <b>supporters</b> of John Kerry in staunchly Republican states with third-party <b>supporters</b> in swing states (including Ralph Nader <b>supporters,</b> Libertarian Party <b>supporters</b> of Michael Badnarik, or Green Party <b>supporters</b> of David Cobb). A common question was whether Republican <b>supporters</b> of George W. Bush could manipulate the election by posing as John Kerry <b>supporters</b> or as third-party <b>supporters.</b> However, if such people had posed as third-party <b>supporters</b> in swing states, all they could do is trick John Kerry <b>supporters</b> in staunchly Republican states {{to vote for a}} third-party candidate—which wouldn't change the outcome of the election (since George W. Bush would win those states anyway). Similarly if such people had posed as John Kerry <b>supporters</b> in staunchly Republican states, all they could do is trick third-party <b>supporters</b> in swing states to vote for John Kerry—which would have politically hurt George W. Bush, not helped him.|$|R
