40|$|Raylee’s {{interest}} in learning space design emerges from library designing experiences with school communities as a consultant with Brisbane Catholic Education and through tertiary teaching at Queensland University of Technology in the Master of Learning Innovation (Teacher-Librarianship), most particularly in the unit Designing <b>Spaces</b> <b>for</b> Learning. Raylee’s <b>commitment</b> to this area of interest is fostered through continuing consultancy with schools and her doctoral research project Designing the school library: <b>spaces</b> and places <b>for</b> learning. The notion of recombinant architecture signals a loosening of spatial connections between physical and digital-online environments (Mitchell, 1996; 2000; 2003). Such an idea also points to the transformative nature of the designing approaches concerned {{with the creation of}} spaces where bits meet bodies to fulfil human needs and desires and, at the same time, pursuing those human dimensions of space and place which are so important to our senses of belonging, physical comfort and amenity. This paper proposes that recombinant spaces and places draw on familiar architectural forms an...|$|R

The Church is clear that lay ministers of the liturgy should be properly formed. The targeted audience for this project is young adults, the majority of whom are freshmen and sophomores in college. The work of Sharon Daloz Parks, who studies faith development in young adults, is considered. Parks recognizes that young adults need a period of questioning and “probing commitment ” before a maturity and depth of faith is realized. In order to provide a fruitful <b>space</b> <b>for</b> this “probing <b>commitment</b> ” to occur, the primary principle of design for this project is andragogy, an adult learning model that is life-centered and experience based. Mystagogical reflection, a form of ongoing post-baptismal catechesis and a methodology that gives particular credence to one’s experience of the sacraments, provides a fruitful means of ongoing spiritual formation for the EMC via the adult learning model. Reflection upon one’s experience of the Eucharist and one’s experience of the ministry offers an untapped resource fo...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{self-determination}} theory it is proposed that adolescents' motives for forming and maintaining identity-relevant commitments can be either autonomous or controlled in nature. This study examined whether motives <b>for</b> identity <b>commitments</b> would add {{to the prediction of}} late adolescents' adjustment beyond the effect of strength of commitment per se. In addition, it was examined how late adolescents' identity-processing styles would relate to motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment</b> and whether motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment</b> would mediate between identity styles and adjustment. In a sample of 431 late adolescents it was found that autonomous and controlled motives were, respectively, positively and negatively related to adjustment even after taking into account the role of strength of commitment. Each of the three identity styles showed a specific pattern of associations with the motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment,</b> with an information-oriented style relating to the most autonomous and internalized motivational profile. Mediation analyses showed that {{at least part of the}} associations between identity styles and adjustment are mediated by motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment.</b> Directions <b>for</b> future research are discussed...|$|R

Reputation is an imperfect substitute <b>for</b> <b>commitment</b> in the experiment. It is less efficient on average. Its effectiveness as a substitute declines as the return on investment declines. However, there are cohorts that converge to a convention exhibiting high levels of trust and trustworthiness in which behavior under reputation is indistinguishable from behavior under commitment...|$|R
