40|$|Suspensions play {{a crucial}} role in vehicle comfort and stability. Different types of {{suspensions}} have been proposed to fulfill the essential characteristics of vehicle suspensions. A semi-active suspension with adjustable damper improves the performance of a suspension in different conditions and it is better than a passive suspension in terms of ride comfort and handling. Furthermore, it is not as expensive and complicated as an active suspension. Semi-active suspensions rely on adjustable damping coefficient. A new type of air suspension with independent ride height and stiffness tuning has been developed recently. By using two air chambers in the <b>suspension</b> <b>system,</b> ride height of vehicle and stiffness of suspension can be adjusted independently and simultaneously. The conventional air <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> use <b>compressor</b> to pump the air into a single flexible rubber airbag and by inflating the air, the chassis will be raised from the axle (ride height control). In this type of suspensions, the stiffness of spring is not under control. In the new air <b>suspension</b> <b>system,</b> by controlling the air pressure on both chambers, one can tune the suspension stiffness and the ride height of the vehicle at the same time for different driving conditions. The air suspension is also able to maintain the vehicle body at the same height and natural frequency for different load or number of passengers. This thesis discusses about the design analysis of an air suspension with ride height and stiffness tuning. The analytical formulation is developed for the optimum design of the new air <b>suspension</b> <b>system.</b> In this thesis, the interconnection between the pressurized chambers of the new air suspension with ride height and stiffness tuning is studied to further improve the performance. Proper interconnection of air springs can help the <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> to distribute the load between tires more evenly on rough roads or uneven surfaces. Different configurations in air spring interconnection have different impact on the handling and tire load distribution. To study the effect of air spring interconnection configurations on tires load distribution and vehicle handling, a general mathematical model is developed. This model is used to compare various configurations in detail. Results show that interconnection could improve tire load distributions greatly. It is also shown that improving tire load distribution will deteriorate roll stiffness that in turn deteriorate vehicle handling at higher speeds. Since on rough roads, vehicle’s speed is necessarily low, interconnection will not have adverse effects on vehicle handling when activated...|$|R

These analyses were specifically applied on lower suspension arm to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on lower <b>suspension</b> arm <b>system</b> as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on lower <b>suspension</b> arm <b>system</b> is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on lower arm, where the lower arm force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> for reducing road force, it is possible to survey vibration condition of lower arm according to frequency respond of <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> and its natural frequency.
