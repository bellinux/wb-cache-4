40|$|For many {{applications}} in machine vision, digital photogrammetry and scientific research image sequences of rapidly moving objects {{have to be}} acquired with high temporal resolution. If the standard video rate (30 frames/sec NTSC resp. 25 frames/sec CCIR) is not sufficient, high-speed solid state cameras may be considered offering frame rates of up to 15, 000 frames per second. As the processing or data reduction of their images will usually not be possible in real time, appropriate analog or digital image sequence storage devices have to be discussed. One {{of the most important}} features of a high-speed <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>camera</b> system is the data rate. While the systems with the highest data rates still come with analog storage on video tape, systems with digital storage on RAM or realtime disks are preferable from the aspects of accuracy and data handling. This overview will present some high-speed <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>camera</b> systems with data rates ranging from 8 MB/sec up to 175 MB/sec, frame rates of 100 to 15, 000 images per second, sensor sizes of 64 x 64 to 756 x 287 pixels, digital and analogue data storage including an own scheme with cascaded standard cameras, compare their technical data and discuss their applicability and restrictions...|$|E

This system consists of a fixed x-ray tube, an image intensifier, coupled to a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>camera,</b> and a computer-controlled turntable on which phantoms were placed. In order to explore the imaging performance of this system, subtraction projection images, acquired over a few projection angles (20), were digitized and used for single slice reconstruction. These data then were reconstructed using two iterative reconstruction algorithms, specifically designed for vascular structures. The quality of the resultant reconstructed images agrees {{with the results of}} previous computer simulation studies and indicates that the performance of our algorithms is superior to standard filtered-backprojection. The results also suggest that an image intensifier-based detector can be used for reconstructing 3 -D vascular structures from a limited number of subtraction projections. 1...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{investigations}} are described of {{a method that}} is capable of measuring instantaneous, 3 -D, velocity vectors everywhere in a light sheet generated by a pulsed laser. The technique, here called Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV), is a variation of a new concept for velocity measurements that was called Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV) in its original disclosure. The concept relies on the use of a narrowband laser and measurements of the Doppler shift of scattered light from particles moving with a flow. The Doppler shift is recorded as a variation in transmission through a sharp-edged spectral filter provided by iodine vapor in a cell. Entire fields of velocity can be determined by using a solid-state camera to record the intensity variations throughout the field of view. However, the implementation of DGV has been centered principally on the use of high power, continuous-wave, ion lasers and measurement times that are determined by the 30 -ms framing times of standard video cameras. Hence, they provide velocity fields that are averaged in time at least over that period. On the other hand, the PDV concept described in this presentation incorporates a high energy, repetitively pulsed, Nd-YAG laser that is injection-seeded to make it narrowband and then frequency-doubled to provide light at frequencies absorbed by the iodine vapor. The duration of each pulse is less than 10 nanoseconds. When used in combination with nonstandard, scientific quality, <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>cameras,</b> a sequence of images can be obtained that provides instantaneous velocity vectors everywhere in the field of view. The investigations described in this paper include an accurate characterization of the iodine cell spectral behavior and its influence on the PDV measurements, a derivation of the PDV signal analysis requirements, and the unique aspects of the pulsed laser behavior related to this application. In addition, PDV measurements are to be demonstrated using data from a rotating wheel target and from the flow of a subsonic jet. Initially, single optical fiber light collection and photomultiplier detectors will be substituted for <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>cameras.</b> Those results will allow the determination of the fundamental limitations of the PDV technique without the complications of image acquisition and processing. They will then be used to provide an analysis of the measurement capabilities of PDV both in small aerodynamic research wind tunnels and in large wind tunnels designed for production airframe and propulsion testing. Future plans include the implementation of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>cameras</b> and the development of the required image acquisition and processing software. Eventually, the PDV technique will be applied to an aerodynamic research program related to transonic wing flutter...|$|R

Specifically, we present an image analysis technique for examining the fine scale (Kolmogorov scale) variations of the mixing process in a turbulent flow. The objec-tive is to trace the interaction of two flows by identifying their motions in a sequence of 3 -D images obtained with a system based on a high-speed <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>camera.</b> After briefly describing the imaging process and the particularities related to the capture of quasi-continuous 3 -D image sequences, we focus on theoretical and implementational issues associated with feature tracking in 3 -D image sequences.

The use of additional constraints of radiometric and/or geometric nature strengthens the matching solution. In addition, {{the large amount of}} data associated with 3 -D image sequences in general, and the high and multidi-rectional velocities involved in this application in particular, make the devision of an efficient matching strategy quite important. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{liquid crystal}} point {{diffraction}} interferometer (LCPDI) {{is a new}} instrument that has been developed for the measurement of phase objects. The LCPDI uses the compact, robust design of Linnik's point diffraction interferometer and adds to it phase stepping capability for quantitative interferogram analysis. The result is a compact, simple to align, environmentally insensitive interferometer capable of accurately measuring optical wave-fronts. A <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>camera</b> provides very high data density and automated data reduction.

In the former case, the refractive index distribution is measured and then related to various properties like temperature, density, chemical composition, or thickness. In the latter case, the measured phase distribution {{is related to the}} object shape. The objects measured must be stationary or quasisteady state because the measurement requires the acquisition of several frames of image data during which time the object's properties must not have changed.

The potential for faster data acquisition exists...|$|E

50|$|Early color cameras {{used the}} obvious {{technique}} of using separate red, {{green and blue}} image tubes {{in conjunction with a}} color separator, a technique still in use with 3CCD <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>cameras</b> today. It was also possible to construct a color camera that used a single image tube. One technique has already been described (Trinicon above). A more common technique and a simpler one from the tube construction standpoint was to overlay the photosensitive target with a color striped filter having a fine pattern of vertical stripes of green, cyan and clear filters (i.e. Green; Green+Blue & Green+Blue+Red) repeating across the target. The advantage of this arrangement was that for virtually every color, the video level of the green component was always less than the cyan, and similarly the cyan was always less than the white. Thus the contributing images could be separated without any reference electrodes in the tube. If the three levels were the same, then that part of the scene was green. This method suffered from the disadvantage that the light levels under the three filters were almost certain to be different, with the green filter passing not more than one third of the available light.|$|R
