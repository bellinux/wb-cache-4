5|$|Three soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Darby Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is prevalent in the northwest part of the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent throughout the watershed except in its lower reaches. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. The Urban Land-Wetbrook-Pitts soil association is prevalent {{in the southern part}} of the watershed. It consists of silty, sandy, and deep <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> rests on coastal sediments. Roughly 53% of the land in the Darby Creek watershed is classified as having slightly erodible soil.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E
5|$|Cut sod bricks, called terrone in Spanish, {{can be used}} to make {{tough and}} durable walls. The sod is cut from <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> has a heavy mat of grass roots, which may be found in river bottom lands. It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction.|$|E
50|$|Acid sulfate <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> {{have not}} been {{disturbed}} are called potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Acid sulfate <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> have been disturbed are called actual acid sulfate soils (AASS).|$|R
50|$|Cneorum tricoccon prefers light sandy <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> {{are common}} in the Mediterranean and also {{requires}} <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> drain particularly well. Spurge olive must have considerable sunlight to grow, and often stunts when in much of shade.|$|R
5000|$|Salty (saline) <b>soils</b> are <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> {{have a high}} salt content. The {{predominant}} salt {{is normally}} sodium chloride (NaCl, [...] "table salt"). Saline soils are therefore also sodic soils {{but there may be}} sodic <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are not saline, but alkaline.|$|R
5|$|Lead may {{be found}} in food when food is grown in <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> is high in lead, {{airborne}} lead contaminates the crops, animals eat lead in their diet, or lead enters the food either from what it was stored or cooked in.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.eburneus grow on the soil, mostly in {{coniferous}} woods, thickets and grassy areas. The fungus prefers <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> is moist, mesic, loamy and calcareous.|$|E
5|$|The geology of South Florida, {{together}} with a warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited for a large marshland ecosystem. Layers of porous and permeable limestone create water-bearing rock and <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> affect the climate, weather, and hydrology of South Florida.|$|E
40|$|Drainage is {{a common}} problem {{throughout}} Utah. Complex patterns of soil development, transport and deposition have resulted in excessively drained <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are coarse-textured (sandy or rocky), and poorly drained <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are fine-textured (silt and clay-dominated). Excessively drained are more common in higher elevation and bench areas...|$|R

30|$|This {{change that}} {{encompasses}} {{the development of}} industrial agriculture, takes place on <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are partly several {{tens of millions of}} years old. <b>Soils</b> <b>that</b> – different from those in Europe and North America have left behind their state of maturity and which are partly decoupled from their bedrock lithogeochemistry[11, 19, 20].|$|R
5|$|There {{are seven}} soil {{associations}} in Juniata County. One {{of these is}} the Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association. It is a deep and fairly well-drained <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> is found in 24% of the county. It is mostly found in the county's forested areas. The Berks-Weikert-Bedington Association is also found in the county. It is found in 33% of the county's area and is not as deep as the Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association, but is well-drained. The soil is mostly found in agricultural lands and some forested areas. Another soil association in the county is the Edon-Opequon-Weikert Association, which is a well-drained <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> occupies 17% of the county. The Elliber-Kreamer-Mertz Association is a deep and well-drained <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> makes up 12% of the county. The Chenango-Pope-Holly Association and the Morrison-Hazelton-Clymer Association make up 7% and 6% of the county, respectively. They are both deep and occur on gentle slopes. However, the former is poorly drained, while the latter is well-drained. The Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association is well-drained and makes up 1% of the county's area.|$|E
5|$|Two soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Ithan Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is present in {{a small part of}} the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent through the middle of the watershed. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. Most of the watershed is considered to have slightly erodible soil.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The Pascal blanc vine is {{extremely}} sensitive to many grape diseases, particularly powdery mildew and grape rots. It is {{best suited for}} dry climates with well drained <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> can minimize some {{of the risk of}} developing rot. In the Cassis region, the vineyard <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> Pascal blanc tend to be found in are almost always rocky and dry.|$|R
50|$|The soils on Central Mountain are deep-muck <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are {{saturated}} with water.|$|R
50|$|The {{group of}} Regosols is a taxonomic rest group {{containing}} all <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> {{could not be}} accommodated {{in any of the}} other groups. Excluded from the Regosols are weakly developed <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> classify as Leptosols (very shallow soils), Arenosols (sandy soils) or Fluvisols (in recent alluvial deposits. These soils have AC-profiles. Profile development is minimal as a consequence of young age and/or slow soil formation.|$|R
5|$|T. oreades {{grows in}} acidic <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> {{is high in}} {{nutrients}} and organic matter. Associated tree species in Victoria include shining gum (Eucalyptus nitens), messmate (E.obliqua), mountain grey gum (E.cypellocarpa), cut-tail (E.fastigata), silvertop ash (E.sieberi), southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), black oliveberry (Elaeocarpus holopetalus), blanket leaf (Bedfordia arborescens), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), privet mock‐olive (Notelaea ligustrina), banyalla (Pittosporum bicolor), Errinundra plum pine (Podocarpus sp. Goonmirk Rocks), Errinundra pepper (Tasmannia xerophila subsp. robusta) and soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica).|$|E
5|$|The site can be {{generally}} {{divided into three}} broad areas, the site core, a North Zone and an East Zone. The North Zone is separated from the site core by a wide depression containing clay <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> may {{have served as a}} reservoir for the city. Several quarries have been identified on the northern and southern edges of this depression.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
50|$|It does {{suffer in}} {{waterlogged}} <b>soils,</b> <b>that</b> may rot the rhizomes. It is rarely available for cultivation.|$|R
50|$|It likes <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> get {{an average}} amount of moisture. But it will {{tolerate}} temporary drought conditions.|$|R

5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota is {{generally}} wetter and features lower topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a higher region bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Numerous glacial lakes cover the Coteau, and it is largely drained by the Big Sioux River, a tributary of the Missouri. Further to the west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the park}} is {{eucalypt}} woodland with patches of sandy <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are used by the wombats for burrowing.|$|R
50|$|Ajuga australis {{grows on}} clay <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are medium to high in nutrients, either on Wianamatta Shale, basalt, or {{alluvial}} quartzite.|$|R
50|$|It {{prefers to}} grow in humus rich, (leafy) well drained soils.It is {{tolerant}} of <b>soils</b> <b>that</b> are mildly acidic to neutral.|$|R
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, 1896, Earp was {{a last-minute}} choice as referee for a boxing match that the {{promoters}} {{billed as the}} heavyweight championship of the world. Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A {{dividing}} ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large freestone stream. Roaring Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable coal is present in the watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the water line. To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown <b>soil</b> <b>that</b> is slightly poorly or moderately well drained and is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone.|$|E
