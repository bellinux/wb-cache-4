2500|$|Cressie is {{best known}} for having brought {{disparate}} statistical methodologies into a nascent discipline known as <b>Spatial</b> <b>Statistics.</b> In his widely cited book, Statistics for Spatial Data, Cressie established a general spatial model that unified statistics for geostatistical data, regular and irregular lattice data, point patterns, and random sets. [...] Since the 1980s, he has been a developer of statistical theory, methodology and applications for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Since the 2000s, this methodology has emphasized hierarchical statistical modeling, which was integrated into his most recent book Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data. It has been applied in areas of ‘big science,’ such as remote sensing of Earth on a global scale, understanding the global carbon cycle and its effect on climate change, Greenland ice-sheet dynamics, and disease mapping.|$|E
2500|$|A Cox process point, Cox {{process or}} doubly {{stochastic}} Poisson {{process is a}} generalization of the Poisson point process by letting its intensity measure [...] to be also random and independent of the underlying Poisson process. The process is named after David Cox who [...] introduced it in 1955, though other Poisson processes with random intensities had been independently introduced earlier by Lucien Le Cam and Maurice Quenouille. The intensity measure may be a realization of random variable or a random field. For example, if the logarithm of the intensity measure is a Gaussian random field, then the resulting process {{is known as a}} log Gaussian Cox process. More generally, the intensity measures is a realization of a non-negative locally finite random measure. [...] Cox point processes exhibit a clustering of points, which can be shown mathematically to be larger than those of Poisson point processes. The generality and tractability of Cox processes has resulted in them being used as models in fields such as <b>spatial</b> <b>statistics</b> and wireless networks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spatial</b> {{autocorrelation}} <b>statistics</b> {{measure and}} analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space. Classic <b>spatial</b> autocorrelation <b>statistics</b> include Moran's , Geary's , Getis's [...] and the standard deviational ellipse. These statistics require measuring a spatial weights matrix that reflects {{the intensity of the}} geographic relationship between observations in a neighborhood, e.g., the distances between neighbors, the lengths of shared border, or whether they fall into a specified directional class such as [...] "west". Classic <b>spatial</b> autocorrelation <b>statistics</b> compare the <b>spatial</b> weights to the covariance relationship at pairs of locations. Spatial autocorrelation that is more positive than expected from random indicate the clustering of similar values across geographic space, while significant negative spatial autocorrelation indicates that neighboring values are more dissimilar than expected by chance, suggesting a spatial pattern similar to a chess board.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Spatial</b> {{autocorrelation}} <b>statistics</b> such as Moran's [...] and Geary's [...] are global in {{the sense}} that they estimate the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset. The possibility of spatial heterogeneity suggests that the estimated degree of autocorrelation may vary significantly across geographic space. Local <b>spatial</b> autocorrelation <b>statistics</b> provide estimates disaggregated to the level of the spatial analysis units, allowing assessment of the dependency relationships across space.

2500|$|The Poisson point {{process is}} often defined {{on the real}} line, {{where it can be}} {{considered}} as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory [...] to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store or phone calls at an exchange, distributed in time. [...] In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, [...] particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest. In this setting, the process is often used in [...] mathematical models and in the related fields of spatial point processes, stochastic geometry, <b>spatial</b> <b>statistics</b> [...] and continuum percolation theory. On more abstract spaces, the Poisson point process serves as an object of mathematical study in its own right. In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. [...] Despite its wide use as a stochastic model of phenomena representable as points, the inherent nature of the process implies that it does not adequately describe phenomena where there is sufficiently strong interaction between the points. This has inspired the proposal of other point processes, some of which are constructed with the Poisson point process, that seek to capture such interaction.|$|E

In this paper, we evaluated the Gini coefficient for detecting irregularly shaped clusters through a simulation study. The Gini coefficient, the use of which in <b>spatial</b> scan <b>statistics</b> was recently proposed, is a criterion measure for optimizing the maximum reported cluster size. Our simulation study results showed that using the Gini coefficient works better than the original spatial scan statistic for identifying irregularly shaped clusters, by reporting an optimized and refined collection of clusters rather than a single larger cluster. We have provided a real data example that seems to support the simulation results.

40|$|<b>Spatial</b> scan <b>statistics</b> are {{commonly}} used for geographic disease cluster detection and evaluation.

We evaluate its power for the simulated annealing scan and compare it with the circular and elliptic <b>spatial</b> scan <b>statistics.</b> We observe that, with the non-compactness penalty, the simulated annealing method is competitive with the circular and elliptic scan statistic, and both have good power performance. The elliptic scan statistic is computationally faster and is well suited for mildly irregular clusters, but the simulated annealing method deals better with highly irregular cluster shapes.

40|$|Within {{affected}} communities, Plasmodium falciparum infections may be skewed in distribution {{such that}} single or small clusters of households consistently harbour {{a disproportionate number}} of infected individuals throughout the year. Identifying these hotspots of malaria transmission would permit targeting of interventions and a more rapid reduction in malaria burden across the whole community. This study set out to compare different statistical methods of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA- 1 and MSP- 1 antibodies) for prediction of infection the following year. Two full surveys of four villages in Mwanza, Tanzania were completed over consecutive years, 2010 - 2011. In both surveys, infection was assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). In addition in 2010, serologic markers (AMA- 1 and MSP- 119 antibodies) of exposure were assessed. Baseline clustering of infection and serological markers were assessed using three geospatial methods: <b>spatial</b> scan <b>statistics,</b> kernel analysis and weighted local prevalence analysis. Methods were compared in their ability to predict infection in the second year of the study using random effects logistic regression models, and comparisons of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for each model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of varying radius size for the kernel and weighted local prevalence methods and maximum population size for the spatial scan statistic. Guided by AUC values, the kernel method and <b>spatial</b> scan <b>statistics</b> appeared to be more predictive of infection in the following year. Hotspots of PCR-detected infection and seropositivity to AMA- 1 were predictive of subsequent infection. For the kernel method, a 1 km window was optimal. Similarly, allowing hotspots to contain up to 50 % of the population was a better predictor of infection in the second year using <b>spatial</b> scan <b>statistics</b> than smaller maximum population sizes. Clusters of AMA- 1 seroprevalence or parasite prevalence that are predictive of infection a year later can be identified using geospatial models. Kernel smoothing using a 1 km window and <b>spatial</b> scan <b>statistics</b> both provided accurate prediction of future infection...|$|R
