60|$|<b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> splendid {{horse with}} a switch, and next moment was {{flying over the}} Pampas {{at a pace that}} {{rendered}} pursuit useless.|$|E
60|$|But {{seeing her}} now {{apparently}} so overwhelmed, and having something soft and warm down beneath her granitic face and hungry eyes, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> on the back.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too {{touching}} to {{hear you}} reason about it. Fancy me telling such a hideous story--about myself--me--me!" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> breasts with her white fingers.|$|E
6000|$|LADY (quickly {{removing}} her hands). Oh, how unkindly you {{are speaking}} to me! (She takes her handkerchief from her fichu.) You frighten me. (<b>She</b> <b>touches</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes as if}} to wipe away a tear.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Claudie, dear," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>touching</b> <b>her</b> {{finger to}} her ruby tongue and testing the unresponsive curling irons, [...] "you do me an injustice. Mme. Toinette has not seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account." ...|$|R
50|$|With the manga to go by, Yomiko was head-over-heels in {{love with}} Donnie and deeply traumatized by his death at her hands. She wears his glasses, {{with the idea that}} when she reads, he sees what she is reading. Yomiko can get violent if someone <b>touches</b> <b>her</b> glasses. Often when {{thinking}} of the past <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>her</b> glasses self-consciously. In the TV, Joker implies Donnie's fate is even worse than Yomiko thought, sparking her temporary insanity during which she destroyed the British Library.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Munster {{looked at}} him, and her eye {{exhibited}} a slight responsive spark. <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> lips to {{a glass of}} wine, and then she said, [...] "Describe them. Give me a picture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But there is. I'm fond of Erik. He {{appeals to}} {{something}} in here." [...] <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> breast. [...] "And I admire him. He isn't just a 'young Swede farmer.' He's an artist----" ...|$|E
60|$|She sat {{silent in}} her corner. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon a nursemaid, {{with two or three}} young children, passing by. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} on the arm and pointed to them.|$|E
60|$|Victoria's {{answer was}} a little cry which startled him, and drew his look to <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> had <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> horse with the whip, and her eyes had widened in real alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, Rosa!" [...] Lady Dedlock beckons her, {{with even}} an {{appearance}} of interest. [...] "Why, {{do you know how}} pretty you are, child?" [...] <b>she</b> says, <b>touching</b> <b>her</b> shoulder with her two forefingers.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> nodded, <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> horse {{lightly with}} the whip, and cantered off. Prince Shan found himself {{suddenly}} accosted {{by a dozen}} acquaintances, all plying him with questions. He listened to them with an amused smile.|$|R
60|$|It {{certainly}} seemed probable. Even at {{that moment}} <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> escort upon the arm, and he distinctly looked across at Laverick. It was obvious {{that he was the}} subject of her conversation.|$|E
6000|$|Poor dear {{said the}} young lady. [...] "He did come a bump. It was awfully funny! Is he--er----?" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> forehead, where tendrils of fair hair were {{blowing in the}} breeze.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't cry," [...] {{she said}} drearily. [...] "I wish I could. I've a dreadful feeling here--" [...] <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> slender throat--"and if I could cry I {{think it would}} make it better. But I can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mamma,' <b>she</b> said, <b>touching</b> <b>her</b> mother's arm in {{her sweet}} winning way, 'may not Charley come to Linda's wedding? You know how fond Harry is of him: would not Harry wish {{that he should}} be here?' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{bright eyes}} had {{caught sight of}} the ring upon Joan's hand. <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> it with <b>her</b> little fragile fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now {{the woman}} for whom I {{have made this}} {{sacrifice}} stands {{between me and my}} Helena--my Helena, free to pour out all the treasures of her love on the man who adores the earth that <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> with <b>her</b> foot! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you have}} doubtless seen my poor Sir William also--my poor, poor Sir William!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> dress with her white, ring- covered fingers, {{as if to}} draw our {{attention}} to the fact that she was in the deepest mourning.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a bottle}} of {{champagne}} upon the table, ordered at the commencement of the meal. <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> glass; the waiter filled it. She raised it to her lips and set it down empty. Her fingers were clutching the tablecloth.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought of}} his face, white and purely wrought, and of his eyes that had such a dark, {{constant}} will of assertion, and <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> own forehead, to feel if she were mad, she was so transfigured in white flame of essential hate.|$|E
50|$|Katherine {{arrives at}} Mayor's wake and Bonnie walks right over her. Thinking she is Elena, {{she tells her}} about Damon giving his blood to Caroline to heal <b>her</b> but when <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> realizes {{that she is not}} Elena. She walks away to call Elena but Katherine follows her and {{introduces}} herself. Bonnie try to cause her a headache using her powers but Katherine {{has been around for a}} long time and Bonnie's spell is too weak yet to work on her. Katherine attacks her and Stefan gets there asking Katherine to let her go and she does.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} you in London!" [...] <b>she</b> said; and, <b>touching</b> <b>her</b> horse with her whip, without looking back, she rode away over the hill.|$|R
6000|$|Having mended her glove, Minnie Marsh lays {{it in the}} drawer. She {{shuts the}} drawer with decision. I catch sight of {{her face in the}} glass. Lips are pursed. Chin held high. Next she laces <b>her</b> shoes. Then <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>her</b> throat. What's your brooch? Mistletoe or merry-thought? And what is happening? Unless I'm much mistaken, the pulse's quickened, the moment's coming, the threads are racing, Niagara's ahead. Here's the crisis! Heaven be with you! Down she goes. Courage, courage! Face it, be it! For God's sake don't wait on the mat now! There's the door! I'm on your side. Speak! Confront her, {{confound}} her soul! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lord! It's not a {{woman at}} all. It's D. Ts." [...] Then, not quite {{convinced}} by this explanation, she suddenly stretched out her hand and attempted to grasp Marian's arm. Missing her aim, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> on the breast, and immediately cried, [...] "Mrs. Ned!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] she answered, {{pointing}} to her waist, [...] "and these," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> rich, red lips with her taper finger-points. [...] "Would {{you like to}} practise a little, my innocent English knight, before we go out? You look as though you might seem awkward and unconvincing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really I don't {{know what}} it was. But--your wound doesn't hurt you, does it? You were {{bleeding}} a good deal. It stained me here," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> breast and looked down wonderingly at her sacred, ancient robe as though she expected {{to see that it}} was red.|$|E
60|$|She led the {{way into}} the room in which that one little blue flower was blooming. She stooped to it, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> it with <b>her</b> hand.|$|R
6000|$|The beer {{came and}} {{interrupted}} her. [...] "Here's to good luck," [...] she said. They drank, and as <b>she</b> daintily <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> lips with her handkerchief {{she lifted her}} eyes to him again--strange eyes with lovely green and yellow and pink lights in them not unlike some semi-precious stones.|$|R
6000|$|... {{and smiles}} and sparkles {{in vain to}} allure us, and when <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> us with <b>her</b> warm, caressing <b>touch,</b> there is, {{compared}} with yesterday, only a faint response.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> {{horse with}} the whip, and they galloped up the hillside. Ughtred watched them closely {{as they rode}} up. He made room for Marie by his side. Brand had perforce to fall behind. They talked {{together}} eagerly of the manoeuvres. The girl was thoroughly well versed in the situation.|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{after the}} second {{daughter}} came in, and thought to pluck a golden feather for herself too; but hardly had <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> sister than she stuck fast as well. At last the third sister came with the same intentions, but the other two cried out: 'Keep off! for Heaven's sake, keep off!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come back!' cried Cynthia. She {{took a step}} as if to follow, {{but gave}} up the idea with a laugh. She sat down {{and began to read}} her {{illustrated}} paper again. Presently the bedroom door opened. Mrs Ford came in. <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> eyes with a handkerchief as she entered. Cynthia looked up.|$|E
60|$|Charmion {{bowed her}} head, and, turning, wrapped her dark-hued peplos round her. Then, taking my hand, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> it with <b>her</b> lips and went without any further word.|$|R
50|$|They are {{stopped by}} a man dressed in red, who {{commands}} Stephen at gunpoint {{to take him to}} a computer supply store and find a processor for him. With the processor, the man plans to find a solution for the world. Once Stephen completes this, the man gives him red tape and Stephen and Justine keep driving. They stop {{in the middle of a}} road, where Stephen covers the car in red tape. He and Justine fall asleep, but Stephen wakes up in the middle of the night to find the passenger-side door open and Justine missing. He manages to get Justine back before <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>her</b> mother's ghost and they race back to the car.|$|R
25|$|An {{artificial}} Genestella and {{a childhood}} friend of Julis. She {{used to be a}} kind girl who could not bring herself to killing bugs and was into gardening. However, she was experimented on by Hilda Jane Rowlands and her powers of miasma corrodes anything <b>she</b> <b>touches,</b> causing <b>her</b> to become socially detached.|$|R
