It is determined that the negative effects of district heating in the cities and towns are caused by the failure of current management mechanism to ensure the solution of basic problems and implement the heat supply system as life support system. The main goal of study was the development of theoretical, methodological and methodical principles of organizational-economic mechanism of development of heat supply system based on the analysis of problems and reserves of its formation and implementation. Application of the systematic approach methodology has allowed to conclude that the effectiveness of heat supply is determined by the interaction of a complex of interrelated and interdependent components that form the theoretical, methodological and methodical basis of its ensuring - concepts, strategies, programs, the mechanism of formation and development of heat supply system. The result of the study was developing of the conceptual foundations of improvement of organizational-economic mechanism of heat supply system development, based on the principles of civilized paradigm, methodology to improve its main basic elements - the mechanisms of information, organizational, infrastructural, legal, financial <b>support,</b> <b>tariff</b> setting, energy saving motivation, optimal development of heat supply system so as to satisfy individual requirements of consumers with high effectiveness as a combination of social, economic, energy, environmental effects...|$|E
40|$|In {{the trade}} policy debate, the {{complete}} liberalisation {{of world trade}} for agricultural products {{is one of the}} most relevant issues. European Union is a free trade area where agricultural products are protected and supported from the world market forces, more than any other good or service. The elimination of trade barriers among the EU member states has achieved European self-sufficiency in food and a strong integration in the European market. To resolve international disputes, Mc Sharry, Agenda 2000 and Mid Term Reforms of the CAP were introduced in the last decade, having in mind the reduction of domestic <b>support,</b> <b>tariff</b> barriers and export subsides. In this context, this paper studies the evolution of these trade flows among EU and some selected Asiatic countries. The aim is, on the one hand, to consider the impact of the progressive liberalisation of world agricultural trade in these areas, on the other hand, to measure the integration degree of these groups of countries. In order to be able to study these topics, this paper analyses the evolution of agricultural trade and of the role played by the different product groups. The paper is divided into three sections, followed by some concluding remarks. The first section studies the main agrarian policies adopted in the EU and some selected Asiatic countries. The second section presents the relationships among them. The third describes the agricultural import and export flows, considering the trade from a general perspective, from the point of view of the political decisions adopted and that of the agreements signed. world trade, agricultural products, Asia and Europe integration...|$|E
40|$|Access to clean, {{affordable}} and appropriate energy {{is an important}} enabler of development. Energy allows households to meet their most basic subsistence needs; it is a central feature of all the millennium development goals (MDGs) and, while a {{lack of access to}} energy may not be a cause of poverty, addressing the energy needs of the impoverished lets them access services which in turn address the causes of poverty. While much is known about the factors affecting the decisions made when choosing between fuel types within a household, few quantitative studies have been carried out in South Africa {{to determine the extent to}} which these factors affect energy choice decisions. It is assumed that the factors traditionally included in economic demand such as price and income of the household affect choice; tastes and preferences as well as external factors such as distance to fuel suppliers are expected to influence preferences. This study follows two typical low-income rural sites in South Africa, Antioch and Garagapola, where the Electricity Basic Services <b>Support</b> <b>Tariff</b> (EBSST) was piloted in 2002. The EBSST is set at 50 Â kWh/month per household for low domestic consumers; this is worth approximately R 201 (Â±US$ 3). This subsidy is a lifeline tariff, where households receive the set amount of units per month, free of charge irrespective of whether more units are purchased. These data (collected in 2001 and 2002), recently collated with detailed electricity consumption data, allow us to determine the drivers of electricity consumption within these households. The sample analysed is taken from the initial phase of the study, when no FBE had been introduced to the households. This enabled the study presented here to make use of the well-populated datasets to assess what affects the electricity use decision in these households. This paper attempts to assess which factors affected the decision-making process for electricity consumption within these households. A brief history of the electricity industry and the electrification is provided and the theoretical background for the electricity consumption model is provided. It was found that income, woodfuel usage, iron ownership and credit obtained were significant in determining consumption levels within these households. Price and cross-price elasticities were difficult to assess due to lack of data within the sample. The results have many possible implications for policy, including the effect that easily obtained credit has for low-income households. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a survey on {{domestic}} energy use in the community of Nkweletshini in south-western Kwa-Zulu Natal during 2002. The community has a low housing density, below the 50 households per km 2 measure used by Eskom as the limit for future electrification. Houses were modest, with a median number of 3 rooms, and built of either clay or cement blocks, and generally thatched although some had corrugated iron roofs. Many in the community are employed, but it is relatively low-level employment, with a median income of about R 660 /month/household. 96 % of all households cook on wood collected free of charge in the vicinity. 3 % cook on paraffin and 1 % on LP gas. The primary appliance is a wood stove; 4 % of the households use an open brazier (“imbaula”). 78 % of households reported problems with the fuel they used because it made them cough (43 %); it smelled (30 %); or it smoked and hurt the eyes (24 %). 65 % of the households reported a second choice of fuel, which was generally paraffin. The cost of paraffin relative to wood was cited as its major disadvantage. Cleaner fuels were preferred on social occasions, when the household had guests. Cooking took place once or twice a day, rarely in the evening, food cooked earlier in the day being heated for an evening meal. The profiles for space heating and water heating were very similar to that for cooking, with a significant quantity of wood being burned for these purposes even in summer. Space heating took place throughout the day, with a morning peak between 06 h 00 and 08 h 00, starting somewhat earlier in winter. There was little water heating during the day. There were two sources of lighting in the community, candles (70 %) and paraffin lamps (30 %). 59 % of the candle users did not like the source of light, while 62 % of the paraffin users did not like lamps. The average household bought 3 packets (each containing 6 candles) per month. The primary appliances in Nkweletshini were radios (91 %, battery powered); kettles (86 % of households, non-electrical); television (34 %, battery powered), and cell phones (17 %, battery powered). Average radio use was close to 24 h/day. The average household consumed 12. 1 bundles of wood per month, or somewhere between 300 and 400 kg of wood. Most households collected wood themselves – only two relied on neighbours or relatives. Wood collection was clearly a major effort. Most wood was collected first thing in the morning, somewhat earlier in summer than in winter, but even in winter 25 % of the households were collecting wood between 04 h 00 and 06 h 00. It was only between the hours of midnight and 04 h 00 that collection ceased. 94 % of the householders purchased paraffin. Monthly volumes averaged 12. 6 litres per household that bought paraffin. The calculated average price was R 3. 00 per litre, which is very close to the known cost of paraffin in the area. Over 20 % of households made use of car batteries, primarily for television, and recharged them twice a month on average. 67 % of the households purchased the 9 V PM 9 batteries, primarily for radio, using 2 per month on average. Less than 10 % of the households made much use of torches, buying about 4 batteries per month. These results are discussed in terms of the total energy demand of the households (4 000 to 5 500 MJ/month) and the time-of-day requirements that peak in the early morning rather than in the evening {{as is the case in}} urban and semi-urban environments.

40|$|The {{new energy}} {{policy of the}} European Union (EU) with the core {{objectives}} of competitiveness, reliability and sustainability, has driven Europe into a transition towards a low carbon & sustainable electricity supply systems. Under the new policy, the European energy systems are pursing two major objectives. First is to shift the focus from national to regional or (perhaps) a European level with {{the ultimate goal of}} introducing regional markets that facilitates cross-border power trades. Second, is to incorporate large renewable energy sources into the power systems to best exploit the energy resources. In this regards, special attention is oriented towards the development of the offshore gird in the North Sea region where offshore wind is abundant and has potential to become major energy source in the area. This thesis looks into transmission expansion planing in the North Sea region. It presents a market based approach to solve a long-term transmission expansion planning for a meshed VSC-HVDC offshore grid that connect regional markets. The main goal here is to determine the grid design that enables harnessing the offshore wind energy most efficiently, at the same time, creating capacity for conducting cross-border power exchange. Development of an offshore grid in the North Sea can encounter various technical, legal and economic barriers. Consequently advanced planning frameworks are required that enables accounting for these issues. The methodology proposed here provides a framework to investigate the impact of each of these factors on the development of offshore infrastructures. More precisely, the contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows:  Static Transmission Expansion Planning framework (STEP) In Chapter 5, I have proposed a multiple time-period static transmission expansion planning framework that is applicable to VSC-HVDC meshed grids. I have shown that the analytical solution to the problem gives the pricing mechanism that expresses the relationship between the electricity price of different zones and the congestion charges associated with the interconnectors between them. It is an extension of the work of Schweppe et al. that has been proven for and applied to VSC-HVDC grids. The proposed formulation includes investment recovery through congestion revenues as an implicit strict equality constraint. It, therefore, computes the expansion plan, such that the investment capital will be fully paid off through congestion revenues {{by the end of the}} chosen lifetime of the infrastructure. The framework determines the topology, transmission capacities and the power flows through the offshore grid, and the resulting distribution of social welfare among the price zones. By combining both flow-constraints and investment recovery-constraints and working with historical market data, the framework can deliver useful results that demonstrate how onshore price zones could benefit from an optimal grid design.  Iterative clustering methods for computation feasibility The optimization framework proposed in Chapter 5 was intended to be driven by historical market-data in the form of hourly regional cost curves. The dimensionality of the search space and the computational intensity of the proposed optimization algorithm make the problem intractable. It was desirable to identify and work with only a subset from the total set of operating states. I developed an iterative algorithm that combines an unsupervised clustering technique with the proposed optimization tool to cope with the computational burden of the large-scale optimization problem. Automatic space transformation and clustering were performed to select a subset of representative hourly operating states. The number of samples in the subset was adjusted in order to match the congestion-induced revenues to that of the full data set. This ensured that essential information was not lost. The framework, thus, balances the need for reasonable computation times against the benefits of a model that allows multiple time-periods (as defined by zonal prices and wind power production combinations) and obtains realistic results. Several clustering algorithms (including K-means) and feature reduction techniques (such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) have been used in investment planning analysis. Their combination has also been explored in literature. However, this is the first time that an unsupervised PCA/clustering technique has been combined with an optimization tool to refine the clustering results.  StaticWind and Transmission Expansion Planning framework (SWTEP) Chapter 6 describes a novel co-optimization wind and transmission expansion framework applicable to VSC-HVDC meshed grids. This is an extension of the static framework presented in Chapter 5 that adds wind to the TEP formulation, while implementing support schemes, which inherently induce a deviation from perfect competition. This results in a fundamental contradiction between the structure of the competitive market and the nature of support policies. The novelty of the work presented in Chapter 6 is that it has limited the market distortion by excluding the support payments from the market clearing process. To do so, I have proposed a formulation that divides the initial investment of the offshore wind infrastructure into subsidized and unsubsidized parts. Thus, the objective of the optimization problem was to maximize sum of incremental social welfare of all regions at all times, minus the aggregated investment cost of offshore transmission infrastructure and the investment cost of building the offshore wind farms that has not been covered through the support payments. The proposed framework enables the impact of implementing two types of feed-in premium support schemes (i. e., generation-based and capacity-based) to be accounted for in the final development of the grid. The goal of this chapter was to investigate the performance of the two feed-in support policies to verify if investment recovery would be fulfilled under a certain support scheme design. In addition, an ‘optimal’ support level and offshore wind <b>support</b> <b>tariff</b> rate were determined. The analytical solution to the optimization problems confirms the complete recovery of the investment cost of transmission infrastructure. In addition, under the assumption that no offshore wind was curtailed, the revenues collected from market sales of offshore wind farms can pay off the unsubsidized part of the wind farm investment, regardless of the payment basis (generation-based or capacity-based).  Dynamic Transmission Expansion Planning framework (DTEP) In Chapter 7, I have proposed a market-based, multiple stage, multi-time period dynamic transmission expansion planning framework for a meshed offshore grid to connect upcoming offshore wind farms to multiple onshore markets. The main contribution of this framework is that it enables accounting for delays in the construction and implementation of offshore infrastructures, including wind farms and transmission systems. Delays can occur mainly due to legal barriers associated with differing permitting criteria in an international context, but also due to market maturity and supply chain issues. The timing of delays in grid, market and wind farm developments are set exogenously in the model. This is an extension of the work presented in Chapter 5 in which the whole offshore grid was assumed to be built in one instant. The final results include the optimal grid topology, transmission capacities, construction timing and the resulting remuneration and distribution of the social welfare increase and financial benefit among the various onshore price zones. The analytical solution to the optimization problem gives the pricing mechanism that is consistent with the AC onshore counterpart. The proposed market mechanism facilitates the integration of a multi-terminal VSC-HVDC offshore grid into the existing AC grid. In addition, the analytical solution confirms the investment recovery through congestion revenues, regardless of the number of investors that are involved. In the case of multiple investors, an independent financial entity is required that collects the transmission revenues from the grid operators and distributes them appropriately amongst the investors. Under this regulatory assumption, the investment recovery of every cable of every interconnector will be completely fulfilled within the desired economic lifetime...|$|E
