40|$|The work {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of control of electronic texts. Whether it is a <b>source</b> <b>codes</b> or standard text documents. The first chapter is devoted to a brief explanation of the term plagiarism and its characters. Sequentially we describe the methods and metrics used to detect plagiarist. Then we pay attention to detect plagiarism in the free text and <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> We describe the way of preprocessing of a file and choice of basic units, which represent the document in the comparing. <b>Source</b> <b>codes</b> have a exact syntax. Therefore we attend to the syntax and semantic analysis in the chapter, which describes the check of <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> The second half of the work is focused on the practical part, particularly on programs intended to control the <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> The programs are divided to the freely available and the commercial. This is followed by their brief description and if it is a free trial possible we mention the results from this comparing. So we created a corpus of <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> At the end of the work we focus on design of a program, which compares two <b>source</b> <b>codes</b> on the basis of statistical similarities...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} multi-terminal <b>source</b> <b>coding</b> with {{a single}} encoder and multiple decoders where either the encoder or the decoders can take cost constrained actions which {{affect the quality of}} the side information present at the decoders. For the scenario where decoders take actions, we characterize the rate-cost trade-off region for lossless <b>source</b> <b>coding,</b> and give an achievability scheme for lossy <b>source</b> <b>coding</b> for two decoders which is optimum for a variety of special cases of interest. For the case where the encoder takes actions, we characterize the rate-cost trade-off for a class of lossless <b>source</b> <b>coding</b> scenarios with multiple decoders. Finally, we also consider extensions to other multi-terminal <b>source</b> <b>coding</b> settings with actions, and characterize the rate -distortion-cost tradeoff for a case of successive refinement with actions.

40|$|Through the years, the {{complexity}} {{and the size of}} a system are growing. Thus, to perform a testing with manual creation of test cases is very time consuming. This is because developer or tester will need to manually look into the <b>source</b> <b>codes,</b> line by line, to define the test cases. Moreover, manual creation of test cases does not increase reliability of testing the <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> For example, tester may perhaps miss or fail to define some of the possible test cases if they are not aware of it. Furthermore, manual creation of test cases based on <b>source</b> <b>codes</b> is also high costing. This paper discusses a system that generates test cases automatically based on program <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> This system is able to scan the program <b>source</b> <b>codes,</b> line by line, and check the syntaxes of the <b>source</b> <b>codes.</b> Then, the codes are parsed using the parser to generate the test cases based on detected tokens. The purpose of generating test cases automatically is to reduce the cost of testing the system...|$|R
