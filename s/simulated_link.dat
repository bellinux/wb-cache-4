40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of rainfall {{are important in}} many hydrological and meteorological applications, for instance, flash-flood early-warning systems, hydraulic structures design, irrigation, weather forecasting, and climate modelling. Whenever possible, link networks measure and store the received power of the electromagnetic signal at regular intervals. The decrease in power {{can be converted to}} rainfall intensity, and is largely due to the attenuation by raindrops along the link paths. Such an alternative technique fulfils the continuous effort to obtain {{measurements of}} rainfall in time and space at higher resolutions, especially in places where traditional rain gauge networks are scarce or poorly maintained. Rainfall maps from microwave link networks have recently been introduced at country-wide scales. Despite their potential in rainfall estimation at high spatiotemporal resolutions, the uncertainties present in rainfall maps from link networks are not yet fully comprehended. The aim of this work is to identify and quantify the sources of uncertainty present in interpolated rainfall maps from link rainfall depths. In order to disentangle these sources of uncertainty, we classified them into two categories: (1) those associated with the individual microwave link measurements, i. e. the errors involved in link rainfall retrievals, such as wet antenna attenuation, sampling interval of measurements, wet/dry period classification, dry weather baseline attenuation, quantization of the received power, drop size distribution (DSD), and multi-path propagation; and (2) those associated with mapping, i. e. the combined effect of the interpolation methodology and the spatial density of link measurements. We computed ~ 3500 rainfall maps from real and <b>simulated</b> <b>link</b> rainfall depths for 12 days for the land surface of the Netherlands. <b>Simulated</b> <b>link</b> rainfall depths refer to path-averaged rainfall depths obtained from radar data. The ~ 3500 real and simulated rainfall maps were compared against quality-controlled gauge-adjusted radar rainfall fields (assumed to be the ground truth). Thus, we were able to not only identify and quantify the sources of uncertainty in such rainfall maps, but also test the actual and optimal performance of one commercial microwave network from one of the cellular providers in the Netherlands. Errors in microwave link measurements were found to be the source that contributes most to the overall uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} project was the design, construction and testing of a fiber optic communication link for the simultaneous transmission of five audio signals using the technique of frequency division multiplexing. The five subcarrier frequencies were between 1 and 10 MHz. Amplitude modulation with two sidebands and suppressed carrier using an analog voltage multiplier (AD 834) was chosen for efficient transmission through the fiber. The unwanted image signals and intermodulation products from the mixing operation were removed using active bandpass filters. An interesting result was the successful design and operation of active filters at the high frequencies using the Generalized Immitance Converter (GIC) configuration. An LED and pin-photodiode pair {{was used for the}} optical portion of the link. <b>Simulated</b> <b>link</b> distances of up to 3. 2 kilometers were attained using these components.

40|$|Over the years, {{scholars}} have developed various models of pedestrian movement. These models {{can be used}} to assess the effects of detailed design decisions or to predict pedestrian behaviour under conditions of crowding. To date, not much {{attention has been paid to}} pedestrians’ shopping behaviour at the micro level. Therefore, the main purpose of this project is to test a model that aims at simulating micro pedestrian behaviour in shopping streets, including entering shops. The model assumes a detailed network of links to represent the structure of street segments and entrances to the shops. The basic principle underlying the model is that a pedestrian moves from one link in the network to another, adjacent link. In fact, a pedestrian enters a segment at one side, heading for the other side of the segment. However, a pedestrian might enter the segment by leaving a shop as well. Then, the pedestrian might be heading for either side of the segment. While transferring from the current link to the next link, the pedestrian will be attracted by the shops along both sides of the street. The study area is Antwerp’s main shopping street. During a one-week workshop in July 2004, students observed pedestrian movement in this shopping street. An inventory of some physical characteristics of the shopping street was made and pedestrians were tracked through two separate segments of the shopping street. In total, 334 pedestrians were tracked. A conventional multinomial logit model is used to simulate pedestrians’ micro behaviour. The process of consecutively selecting links continues until the pedestrian has reached one of the terminal links or a shop. The model performs very well. Simulated routes were used to assess the validity of the model. Observed and <b>simulated</b> <b>link</b> loading correspond fairly well, however, the model seems to slightly mispredict the attraction of a number of shops...|$|E

The {{objective is to}} study the precipitation of high energy electrons and protons from Van-Allen radiation belts to lower altitude of 600 - 900 km due to resonance interaction with low frequency EM waves. The unique communications system design of IITMSAT evolves from the challenging downlink data requirement of 1 MB per day in the UHF band posed by the mission and the satellite's payload, SPEED (Space based Proton and Electron Energy Detector). To ensure continuous downlink data stream in the short Low earth Orbit passes, a robust physical layer protocol was designed to counter time-varying aspects of a Space-Earth telecom link. For the on-board communications system, two types of design alternatives exist for each module. The first option is a custom design wherein a module is developed from scratch using discrete components. The other option is an integrated design wherein an electronics COTS module can be directly plugged into the subsystem. This module is evaluated by carrying out vibration and thermal tests. If an integrated module is low-cost and meets the design requirements, it is preferred over a custom design. In order to carry out performance tests under <b>simulated</b> <b>link</b> conditions, an RF attenuation test setup was designed that can work at extreme temperatures. Burn-In tests for 72 hours at ambient and extreme temperatures were carried out. Integrated tests indicate all IITMSAT design requirements have been met. Hence a robust communications system has been validated.

40|$|Demand {{estimation}} problems {{based on}} traffic counts {{have been investigated}} for decades. These are traditionally solved by an optimisation problem, where some distance between measured and <b>simulated</b> <b>link</b> flows is minimised, {{in order to find}} the most likely origin-destination (OD) flows. To partly limit the effects of solution under-determinedness, typical of these problem types, a-priori assumptions on the OD matrix structure are adopted. This structure is provided by either adding additional components in the objective function to be minimised, namely by adding the deviation between estimated OD flows and an available seed matrix as additional performance metric, or by using an opportune initial matrix as starting point for the chosen search algorithm, hence looking for the closest local optimum. In this paper we study the impact of sensor locations on the quality of OD estimations. We show that linear correlations between link flow data may negatively affect the estimation reliability. By contrast, efficient sensor location models, able to identify sensor positions that collect linearly independent link flows allow improving the reliability of the estimation process, especially when no good prior information is available on the OD matrix structure. Hence, we study the gain offered by efficient sensor positioning, which is threefold: 1) it reduces the overall solution space were to look for the true OD flows, 2) it allows better estimation of the gradient of the objective function, and 3) it allows enhancing the objective function by including information from links where sensors are not installed, whose flow is however fully determined by the set of sensors available in the network. In addition, we show that by selecting sensor locations according to partial observability metrics introduced by the authors in recent research, the contribution of the additional information in the objective function also improves with respect to alternative metrics introduced in the literature. Tests are done on a small and a mid-sized network example, showing the improvements in terms of a better estimation of the gradient of the objective function and the overall improvement in the objective function values up to 10 %. status: accepte...|$|E

3000|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  1, for the PMSGs whose <b>simulated</b> DC <b>link</b> {{voltages}} are higher than the normal value, the calculated DC link voltages are very close to the simulated ones. This effectively divides most of the above PMSGs into Group 1 or Group 2 based on the proposed calculation method, instead of the detailed WPP’s simulation results, even though there is one PMSG, i.e., PMSG_ 22, which has been wrongly divided into Group 3. As for the PMSGs whose <b>simulated</b> DC <b>link</b> voltages are lower than the normal value, the calculated results are lower than the simulated ones. This is because the value of i_d^ref is always set as √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2), instead of the minimum value between the current command of the PI controller for DC link voltage regulation and √(i_max^ 2 - (i_q^ref [...])^ 2). However, these errors will not make the mistake of dividing the above PMSGs into the wrong group because both the calculated and <b>simulated</b> DC <b>link</b> voltages are lower than the normal value. Based on the grouping principle, the PMSGs should be divided into Group 3 if the DC link voltage at the fault clearing time is lower than the normal value.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to test a model that aims at {{modeling}} and simulating micro pedestrian behavior in shopping street segments, including entering shops. The model assumes a detailed network of links to represent the structure of street segments and entrances to the shops. The basic principle underlying the model is that a pedestrian chooses a destination when entering a shopping street segment. Destinations may be shops located along the segment or the exit points at the opposite side of the segment. The choice of a destination is modeled by means of a discrete choice model, including variables such as type-specific supply of shops, distances, and tendency to visit a shop. After choosing a destination, the route to that destination is modeled by a discrete choice model as well. However, route choice is modeled at the link level, not at the level of complete routes. A sequence of chosen links constitutes the route to the destination. Relevant variables included in this model are walking distance, and angles between links and the direction of the destination. If the destination is a shop, the destination choice model is applied again to select the next destination. This process is repeated until one of the exit points of the segment is chosen or the pedestrian stays in a shop. The study area is the main shopping street of Antwerp (Belgium). During a one-week workshop in July 2004, students observed pedestrian movement in this shopping street. An inventory of physical characteristics of the shopping street was made and pedestrians were unobtrusively tracked through two separate segments of the shopping street (approximately 100 m of length each). In total, 335 pedestrians were tracked. The choice models were estimated using the tracked routes. Next, the models were used to simulate pedestrians' behavior by consecutively selecting destinations and links to these destinations. The models perform well. Observed and simulated routes were used to determine and compare observed and <b>simulated</b> <b>link</b> loadings. It can be concluded that by using observational data only, relevant models of pedestrian behavior can be developed...|$|E
