40|$|U. S. {{stock market}} <b>sectors</b> <b>and</b> {{industries}} perform better during winter than summer from 1926 to 2006. In {{more than two-thirds}} of <b>sectors</b> <b>and</b> industries, the difference in summer and winter returns, known as the Halloween effect, is statistically significant. There are, however, large differences across <b>sectors</b> <b>and</b> industries. The effect is almost absent in sectors related to consumer consumption but is strong in production sectors. We find that neither liquidity changes nor well-known risk factors can explain the anomaly. We illustrate how the differences between <b>sectors</b> <b>and</b> industries can improve the risk-return tradeoff using sector rotation. Copyright (c) 2009, The Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R
