60|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} of these projected reforms, and one which its author did not flinch from carrying out two years later to his own loss, related to the office of Paymaster. This functionary was accustomed to hold large balances of the public money in his own hands and for his own profit, for long periods, owing to a complex <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> which was so rigorous as entirely to defeat its own object. The paymaster could not, through the multiplicity of forms and the exaction of impossible conditions, get a prompt acquittance. The audit sometimes did not take place for years after the accounts were virtually closed. Meanwhile the money accumulated in his hands, and its profits were his legitimate perquisite. Lord Holland, or his representatives, held the balances of his office from 1765, when he retired, until 1778, when they were audited. During this time he realised, as the interest on the use of these balances, nearly two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Burke diverted these enormous gains into the coffers of the State. He fixed the paymaster's salary at four thousand pounds a year, and was himself the first person who accepted the curtailed income.|$|E

40|$|What we {{know today}} as double entry {{bookkeeping}} is traceable to a man called Luca Pacioli, {{the author of the}} world’s first printed book-keeping treatise. As the origin of all subsequent book-keeping treatises throughout Europe, Luca Pacioli’s book-keeping tract is not only the source <b>of</b> modern <b>accounting,</b> but also ensured that the medieval Venetian method itself survived into our times. However, this study is aimed at critically examining the emergence of the double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> by reviewing what past scholars and researchers have done in relation to the subject matter. This is to say that a comprehensive review <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> literature in relation to double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> was carried out to do justice to this study. And it was gathered that double entry bookkeeping existed amongst the early Italian merchants before Pacioli came into the scene. But the practice prior to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was rather crude because there were no formally documented principles to be followed. So the outburst of Pacioli in the fifteenth century recorded a landmark in the development <b>of</b> this all-embracing <b>accounting</b> <b>system.</b> The first ever published treatise about double entry bookkeeping was that of Luca Pacioli in his book titled “Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita”. This book became the road map for the development <b>of</b> double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> Therefore, away from the conclusions of the majority of authors and scholars in the accounting literature that Luca Pacioli is the father <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> he should rather be referred to as the father <b>of</b> modern <b>accounting,</b> having laid the milestone for the codification, development, preservation, and sustenance <b>of</b> double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting...</b>|$|R
