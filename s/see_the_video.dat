We're all separated and wandering the streets looking like it's the day after a funeral, with Ben {{in a suit and}} bare feet, and I'm never touching the ground. I'm sitting on a phone booth or lying on a car, to hint that I'm dead, that I'm singing from the dead. It's all about separation. It's almost like the director {{knew what was going to}} happen, but he can't have known. It's just one of those fate things." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] was {{directed}} by Vaughan Arnell. On 24 August 2012, One Direction announced that an accompanying music video for [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] was filmed at a [...] "secret place." [...] Afterwards {{it was confirmed that}} this place was Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. In August 2012, images of the shoot leaked on to the internet, which featured members of One Direction along with a group of people having a party in a pool. According to a MTV News article published on 14 September 2012, the video would feature a [...] "summer music festival vibe" [...] with the group [...] "getting wet and wild, acting silly with props and getting soaked by water guns." [...] The official video was initially due to premiere on 24 September 2012. However, a poor quality version of the music video leaked online on 20 September 2012: the same day it was officially published on One Direction's Vevo channel on YouTube. In regard, the group released a statement: [...] "We wanted our fans to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> and hear the single in the proper way so we've moved the premiere to tonight. We're really excited about LWWY, we've worked really hard on it and we can't wait for everyone to see and hear it later today!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] parodies the song, {{replacing}} {{references to the}} [...] "Empire State" [...] of New York with of the smaller Welsh city of Newport. In the Welsh language Ymerodraeth means [...] "empire". [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] was directed by British filmmaker M-J Delaney and featured London-based actors Alex Warren and Terema Wainwright, rapping and singing respectively. Days after its release Delaney said: [...] "I hope Jay-Z and Alicia get to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> {{as long as their}} publishing people don't force us to take it offline. It's only tongue in cheek." [...] Its participants were invited to appear on national television news and their work was reported in national newspapers. Their work was also so well received in Wales that they were invited to the reopening of the Newport Transporter Bridge. It achieved viral video status when it reached nearly a million hits in 3 days and, by August 2010, nearly 2.5million people had watched it on YouTube. In July both Warren and Wainwright met with Universal Records (the music publishers) to discuss releasing the track as a single, with some of the proceeds going to the mental health charity Newport Mind. But the seven co-writers of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] refused to give permission for the Newport single, a situation which led to the video being removed from YouTube on August 10.|$|E

When you're around him, you feel magical. The lyrics are, 'Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me.'... But if you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> it's all about being who you are, having fun and being confident — and feeling hot. It's not so much about looking hot ... although looking hot is important." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's debut album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, was {{released}} September 27, 2005. Sales began relatively slow. It debuted at No. 112 on the Billboard 200 album chart, No. 6 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart, and No. 1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, with nearly 10,000 albums {{sold in the}} first week of release. Within a span of four months, Panic! would <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> for its first single, [...] "I Write Sins Not Tragedies", rocket up the Billboard Hot 100 as sales of Fever passed the 500,000 mark. At the end of March 2006, the band announced a headlining tour. By August, the group's debut record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and the music video for [...] "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" [...] won Video of the Year at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards.

2500|$|By 1930, the Daily News {{began working}} with {{television}} broadcasting; a published announcement of March 30, 1930 indicated the equipment would be installed and operable within two months. [...] The video signal was to be sent by the shortwave station W9XAP, while the audio would be broadcast on the normal WMAQ radio frequency. [...] WMAQ did not receive an experimental license from the Federal Radio Commission to operate station W9XAP until September 2, 1930. The first broadcast of the station actually occurred shortly before this was granted, on August 27, 1930. Only those with special receivers-primarily radio stores who had received them from the Daily News-could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> portion of the broadcast. The station distributed 200 receivers {{in the city and}} suburbs. Those at the dealerships saw and heard Bill Hay, the announcer for Amos 'n' Andy, present a variety-show broadcast from the Daily News Building. The man behind this and other early Chicago television broadcasts was Ulises Armand Sanabria, who 2 years before used the WCFL Navy Pier transmitter to provide the video and radio station WIBO for the audio portions of the broadcast. Both the technical limitations and economic climate of the times brought an end to the station's broadcasts in August 1933. It was the beginning of WMAQ-TV, which would not re-appear until a World War later.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} further {{investigate}} {{the reversal of}} the bystander effect, van Bommel performed a second experiment, also reported in the article, with a sample size of 111 students. Unlike the first study, they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum. Therefore, the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum. The procedure was identical to the first study, with a few variations. To induce public awareness in this study, webcams were mounted on participant’s computers. Participants could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> feed, but to make this more salient, they asked participants before they started to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam. To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible, they asked participants in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on. Similar to the first experiment, five different messages were presented to the participants {{and the number of}} responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants. [...] Once again, the results were as expected. When the camera was not present, the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being 1.5. However, when a camera was present, the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to 3. That said, the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in the bystander effect.|$|E
