40|$|Abstract Silage {{density is}} an {{important}} factor in silage making. High density of silage in a silo implies a higher storing capacity and a high density of silage can also decrease the risk of dry matter losses due to air penetration into the silage. However, the density is often difficult to measure under practical conditions. In this study a method based on weighing drilled silage samples was evaluated. The method was tested on bunker silos with mainly grass/clover silage in four different farms in mid-Sweden. The drilled samples were collected by two methods: drilling by a 23. 2 mm diameter drill (Stickit) and a 39. 8 mm diameter drill (JTI). As the Stickit was a new device it was used twice for sampling. The resulting densities (calculated from the weight of the drilled samples and the volume of the hole in the silage created by the sampling) was compared with the densities derived from weighing <b>silage</b> <b>blocks</b> of 300 - 500 kg fresh weight using silo block-cutters with 1. 5 to 2. 3 meters width. The results showed that the correlation between the drilling methods was high and that both the JTI and the Stickit drill estimated the fresh weight density, the dry matter density and the dry matter content of <b>silage</b> <b>blocks</b> satisfactory. It was further concluded that the dry matter density depends on the dry matter content and the depth on which the sample is taken. The drilling operation must therefore represent the full silo depth to be able to estimate the density of the entire silo. ...|$|R

40|$|This master?s {{thesis is}} written in {{cooperation}} with NTNU, Robbins and BASF, with the aim to document the machine performance and production, when using the anti-abrasion agent ABR 5 versus water. In a traditional hard rock TBM water is sprayed on the cutters to cool them and suppress dust. Earlier studies indicate {{that the use of}} foam can reduce cutter wear, temperature, dust production and lead to cleaner cutter tools. The work on the thesis is mainly based on 8 weeks of field studies on a 10 mdiameter TBM at the AMR water irrigation project in India. To document the effects of using foam versus water the main scopes are to record and examine cutter wear and life, measure dust and log temperature of the cutters as well as general TBM performance. All this is seen in relation to the geology. This thesis suggests that foam has benefits in hard rock TBM tunnelling compared to water, but more research must be conducted with longer, and more consistent test periods. After boring 188 metres with foam, split into two intervals, the amount of <b>blocked</b> <b>cutters</b> has decreased with 47. 8 percent. When comparing the foam boring in the period between March 1. and May 12. a reduction in cutter wear of 12. 7 percent was achieved. In the same period cutter life increased with 18. 2 percent cubic metres per cutter and 713 meters longer rolling distance. The amount of time spent on cutter changes is 34. 2 percent less with foam. Temperature and dust measurements show slightly favourable values when boring with foam, but the data for these are too narrow to draw any conclusion. </p...|$|R

The maize silage was treated with the addition of granulated biological silage additive (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus pentosaceus) in a 0. 25 kg*t- 1 dose of matter. The maize silage was stored in unsheltered, impassable 36 x 23 x 6 m silo, covered with thin translucent underlying sheet and black upper sheet with tires laid on the top at the University farm, Ltd. Kolíňany – large scale dairy farm Oponice. Sampling of the silage from silo was realized by <b>block</b> <b>cutter</b> on 5 th of October 2011 at 4 a. m.

The sampling of the maize silage happened immediately after collection (H 0) and after 24 hours of storage at the feeding table (H 24). The air temperature in dairy cow's stall was 13. 5 °C (H 0) and after 24 hours of storage (H 24) 15 °C. The temperature of the silage in 30 cm depth was 28 °C (H 0) and 40. 3 °C (H 24).

As a child he adopted his mother’s family name, Arakawa, which would later appear on his prints in addition to his signature. After failing to develop in a dry-goods trade apprenticeship, Kunichika began studying under print designer Chikanobu around 1848. This led to his acceptance as an apprentice of Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III, 1786 - 1865). Training in the Utagawa school gave Kunichika a strong foundation of traditional style and technique. Because he was commissioned to do several portraits of his teacher, it is believed that he was held in high regard by Kunisada. By 1854 he had assumed the name Kunichika, taken from the names of his two teachers (“Kuni” from Kunisada, “Chika” from Chikanobu). The majority of Kunichika’s work consists of actor portraits and scenes from Kabuki plays. He saw himself as a traditional ukiyo-e print designer, and attempted to continue to work in the traditional manner despite the transformation of Japan during his life from the Tokugawa to the Meiji period. His work was affected by the times, noticeable in the use of strong Western red and purple aniline dyes that make up the background in many of his prints.
