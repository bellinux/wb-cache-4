It became effective on January 1, 2015 and is now complete. Its basis is the Styrian municipality <b>Structural</b> <b>Reform</b> Act (StGsrG).

40|$|The environments {{of public}} {{organizations}} have become substantially volatile due to economic and societal changes, requiring organizations to continuously adapt {{and to develop}} an innovation-oriented culture. In response to the multitude of challenges posed by this volatile environment, politicians in inter alia the executive and parliament impose <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> upon public organizations, implying that these organizations might be confronted {{with a series of}} <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> over their lifetime. This paper advances that a history of repeated and frequent <b>structural</b> <b>reforms,</b> irrespective of the underlying drivers of these reforms, has a negative effect on the innovation-orientedness of the organizational culture. We explore the link between an organization’s history of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> {{and the degree to which}} the culture within these organizations is innovation-oriented. Results indicate that organizational turmoil generated by repeated <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> reduces innovativeness, and suggest that too many <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> imposed in a too short time-span will have detrimental side-effects. status: accepte...|$|R

However, fiscal transfers cannot substitute <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> especially when shocks are permanent. In this way, the design of fiscal transfer systems determine whether <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> or non-reforming is preferred by governments.

In practice there had been lot of calls to implement more <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> and not to have flat (bookkeeper-style) cuts of expenditures across all parts of the economy. But one should take into account that <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> usually contradicts the internal devaluation, because the <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> require flexible and skilled workforce. <b>Structural</b> <b>reforms</b> usually result in high unemployment and attract a lot of criticism if workforce can not adapt and this lack of felxibility usually is due to lack or available resources (education expenses, time for gaining new skills and experience, etc.). There is at least one case when the country is left with immensely large structural unemployment after the internal devaluation.|$|R

The results suggest that <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> in core countries could be expected to offset the near-term negative impact on activity arising from the required fiscal consolidation. However, for the periphery, the results suggest that it would take several years before <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> could return the level of output back to its pre-consolidation path...|$|R
40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>reforms</b> {{in times}} of crisis The crisis has raised new policy challenges, but it has also made the {{necessity}} of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> more apparent. This initial chapter of Going for Growth assesses progress that countries have made in <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> {{since the start of the}} crisis, covering the whole period 2007 - 11. The key political economy lesson emerging from the analysis is that the crisis and ensuing recession have acted as a catalyst for <b>structural</b> <b>reforms,</b> especially in OECD countries where reforms were most needed. In particular, the depth of the labour market crisis has provided an impetus for <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> aimed at raising labour utilisation. The need to consolidate public finances and the financial pressure arising from mushrooming sovereign debt have given another impetus to reform, with a clear acceleration of politically sensitive reforms designed to help lift potential growth, regain price competitiveness and restore fiscal sustainability, especially in some euro area countries. Going forward, priority should be given to boosting jobs in the context of ongoin...|$|R
40|$|An {{insufficient}} {{level of}} <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> remains a perennial {{phenomenon in the}} EU. Despite the gradual expansion of macroeconomic governance, legal instruments fostering the implementation of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> have been underexploited. This article examines the leeway provided by EU Treaties and legislation to use existing and new instruments to incentivize <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> more forcefully. First, {{in light of the}} recent change in the EU Commission’s enforcement practice, we highlight how the sanctions-based regime under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) can be extended to incorporate <b>structural</b> <b>reforms.</b> There is significant room for manoeuvre to account for the implementation of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> both in the preventive and the corrective arm of the SGP. Second, contractual agreements on <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> offer an alternative to the sanction based system. Unlike existing instruments, contractual agreements allow for more egalitarian and reward-based incentives and thus deviate from the classic 'surveillance model' of economic governance in the EU. We can conceptualize such agreements in two ways: First, as agreements concluded between the EU and individual Member States, underpinned by financial support as an incentive. Second, as mutual agreements concluded between Member States, which agree on the implementation of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> as a kind of barter trading ensuring reciprocity. We highlight the legal boundaries on scope and design of such agreements and how they relate to the institutional governance setting in the EU.

40|$|In the {{perspective}} of a successful exit from the recent global crisis, the debate on the long-term programmes of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> in the EU countries has gradually revived.

On the basis of the extensive literature grounded on the political economy and public choice approaches, this paper analyses why the decision-making process of <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> is usually very difficult even though they lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and boost long-run growth. Finally, the paper points out how the progress of a country’s <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> may be strongly influenced by political, institutional and economic factors contributing to define the framework in which policy makers interact with the national community in its various forms, the lobbies and more in general the organized special interest groups...|$|R

Eventually, it led to a proposal for overhauling the CPP, which was presented to Parliament and was approved soon after, thereby averting a pension crisis if left unaddressed.|$|E

The main results are threefold. First, there is a general association between IMF programs and <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> but this relationship is not very robust. Second, IMF training leads to an increase in <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> but only through IMF programs and only when a significant share of public servants is trained. Third, IMF technical assistance does not significantly lead to more <b>structural</b> <b>reforms</b> but raises the likelihood of completion of ongoing IMF programs.
