40|$|Using {{longitudinal}} data from 769 white {{adolescents in the}} Midwest, this research applies a social structure and personality perspective to examine variation <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and mastery trajectories by gender and SES across the high school years.

40|$|Because {{motherhood}} is {{an expected}} and valued {{identity in the}} United States, becoming a mother should {{lead to an increase}} <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and perceiving a problem becoming a mother should lead to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Little research has examined the combined experience of both identifying with a fertility problem and becoming a mother or not over time. Guided by identity theory framework, this study uses two waves of data from the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB) to examine how change and stability in motherhood status and perceived fertility barrier status is associated with changes <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> among women who initially were not mothers. Results revealed that gaining or losing a fertility problem identity was not associated with changes in self-esteem; however, becoming a mother was associated with increased self-esteem. The persistence of a fertility problem identity was associated with a decrease <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> for those who did not become a mother and increased self-esteem for those who did become a mother. Women who did not report a fertility problem at either interview and became a mother by wave 2 had a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem</b> between waves. A small group of women became mothers and identified a fertility problem at wave two; this group had a substantial increase <b>in</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> and the association was larger for older compared to younger women.

25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low <b>self-esteem.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

25|$|Play is {{included}} as a productive occupation as it is often the primary activity for children. If play becomes difficult due to a disability, like CP, this can cause problems for the child. These difficulties can affect a child's <b>self-esteem.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the sensory and motor problems experienced by children with CP affect how the child interacts with their surroundings, including the environment and other people. Not only do physical limitations affect a child's ability to play, the limitations perceived by the child's caregivers and playmates also impact the child's play activities.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that no unique physiological response, {{such as an}} increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively {{as a threat to}} group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|Overall, First Nations {{individuals}} {{have some of}} the highest rates of suicide globally. Suicide rates are more than twice the sex-specific rate and also three times the age-specific rates of non-Aboriginal Canadians. Residential Aboriginals between ages 10 and 29 show an elevated suicide risk as compared to non-residential Aboriginals by 5–6 times. One theory for the increased incidences of suicide within Aboriginal populations as compared to the general Canadian population is called acculturation stress which results from the intersection of multiple cultures within one's life. This leads to differing expectations and cultural clashes within the community, the family and the individual. At the community level, a general economic disadvantage is seen, exacerbated by unemployment and low education levels, leading to poverty, political disempowerment and community disorganization. The family suffers through a loss of tradition as they attempt to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture. These lead to low <b>self-esteem</b> <b>in</b> the individual as First Nations culture and tradition are marginalized affecting one's sense of self-identity. These factors combine to create a world where First Nations individuals feel they cannot identify completely as Aboriginal, nor can they fully identify as mainstream Canadians. When that balance cannot be found, many (particularly youths) turn to suicide as a way out.|$|E

2500|$|Supporting the {{contention}} that American culture has become more narcissistic {{and that this is}} increasingly reflected in its cultural products is an analysis of US popular song lyrics between 1987 and 2007.

Similar patterns of change in cultural production are observable in other Western states.
