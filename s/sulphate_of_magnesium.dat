40|$|Magnesium has an {{essential}} role in numerous cellularprocesses and if its metabolism is disturbed it can have serious biological consequences. Discovery of the degree of its importance has had a long history from the time that Ep-som Spa water, which had an embittered taste due to contain-ing the <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnesium,</b> was drunk in 1645 [1]. In 1808 Sir Humphrey Davy isolated the alkaline metal by elec-trolysis, a pioneering technique developed by himself which was also used to isolate sodium and potassium [2]. In 1869 Jolyet and Cahours reported the results of investigations un-dertaken to examine the biological properties of the sulphates of magnesium, potassium and sodium [3]. In this report the authors reported that 2 – 6 g administered intravenously to an 8 kg dog would cause neuromuscular blockade and paralysis without disturbing cardiac function. Jolyet and Cahours also provided an astute observation that magnesium may hav...|$|E
30|$|Sulphates occur {{naturally}} in various minerals, including Barite (BaSO 4), Epsomite (MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O) and Gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) (Greenwood and Earnshaw 1984). The primary mineral sources <b>of</b> <b>sulphate</b> ions include evaporate minerals such as Anhydrite, Gypsum and <b>sulphates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magnesium</b> and Sodium and the leaching of fertilizers (Thivya et al. 2013 a) may {{also increase the}} sulphate concentration in groundwater. These dissolved minerals contribute to the mineral content of drinking water (WHO 2004). There {{have been a number}} of studies conducted to determine the toxicity <b>of</b> <b>sulphate</b> in humans. Case reports of diarrhoea in three infants exposed to water containing sulphate at concentrations ranging from 630 to 1150  mg/l have been presented (Chien et al. 1968). However, diarrhoea could not be explained as being solely due to exposure to high sulphate levels and other factors may have played a role (e.g. consumption of infant formula with high osmolarity or the presence of microbial pathogens). Sodium, potassium and magnesium sulphates are all highly soluble in water, whereas calcium and barium sulphates are less soluble. WHO and BIS suggests the maximum permissible limit of SO 4 in drinking water is 400  mg/l; all the surface water, shallow water and deep well water samples are within the permissible limit (Table  1).|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The study {{investigated}} the compressive strength performance of periwinkle shell ash (PSA) blended cement concrete exposed to sulphate environments. Periwinkle shells were obtained from Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria; and calcined in a furnace to temperature of 800 0 C at zero soaking time. Concrete mix of design characteristic strength of 25 N/mm 2 was adopted as the control. The cement component replaced with PSA at five levels of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % were cast, and on hardened exposed to varying concentration <b>of</b> <b>sulphates</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnesium,</b> sodium and calcium at four levels of 0 %, 1 %, 3 % and 5 % each for three exposure periods of 62, 92 and 152 days after complete immersion in water for 28 days. Using three replicates in all the tests, a total of 630 cubical (150 mm) specimens were cast and tested. The results revealed that compressive strength increased with increase in curing age but decreased as the PSA contents increased. The design compressive strength was attained with 10 % PSA content {{at the age of}} 28 days. The compressive strength reduction in sulphate solutions was noted to increase significantly (p = 0. 005, R 2 = 0. 995) with increase exposure period and concentration, with the most severe caused by magnesium sulphate and the least by calcium sulphate. The least reduction in compressive strength was experienced with 10 % PSA blended cement concrete. Based on the test results the study concluded that 10 % PSA content is adequate as supplementary cementitious material for structural concrete to be placed in an aggressive sulphate environment.

In this work, homogenized whole milk was fortified with iron, magnesium and zinc, individually and collectively, shortly before ultra-high-temperature (UHT) processing (145  °C, 6  s). <b>Sulphates</b> <b>of</b> iron, <b>magnesium</b> and zinc were added to give total concentrations (natural plus added) of approximately 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the recommended daily intakes (RDI) per litre of the UHT milk. The highest concentrations (100 % RDI) were 8, 320 and 16  mg. L− 1 for iron, magnesium and zinc, respectively. The fortified milks were analysed to determine the distribution of the minerals, their sensory characteristics and their stability during storage. Zinc and iron preferentially became associated with the casein fraction, while most <b>of</b> the <b>magnesium</b> remained in the serum phase. Some sensory panellists could perceive a different taste in UHT milk supplemented to 75 % of the RDI per litre, but not in milks supplemented to 50 %. During storage at 30  °C of milks supplemented to 50 %, changes in flavour were detected in milks supplemented with zinc and iron after 30 and 60  days, respectively; this generally corresponded with increases in oxidation. Viscosity and protein hydrolysis also increased but not to detrimental levels. It was concluded that fortification of UHT milk with magnesium and possibly zinc has considerable potential, but fortification with iron is more challenging due its ability to catalyse oxidation...|$|R

Three mineral admixtures (limestone filler, fly ash and natural pozzolan) representing a wide range of compositions were used in the study. Twelve formulations covering three strength classes (30, 50 and 70 MPa) and four concrete mixtures were studied. Mass loss with physical deterioration, and dimensional and compressive strength changes due to magnesium sulphate attack were determined through microstructural analysis. The <b>sulphate</b> profiles <b>of</b> sulphur, <b>magnesium,</b> silicon, calcium and aluminium elements were also quantified through analyses of the samples.

40|$|Magnesium {{sulphate}} {{is recommended}} by international guidelines to prevent eclampsia among women with pre-eclampsia, {{especially when it}} is severe, but fewer than 70 % of such women receive magnesium sulphate. We aimed to identify variables that prompt Canadian physicians to administer magnesium sulphate to women with pre-eclampsia. Data were used from the Canadian Perinatal Network (2005 - 11) of women hospitalized at < 29 weeks' who {{were thought to be}} at high risk of delivery due to pre-eclampsia (using broad Canadian definition). Unadjusted analyses of relative risks were estimated directly and population attributable risk percent (PAR%) calculated to identify variables associated with magnesium sulphate use. A multivariable model was created and a generalized estimating equation was used to estimate the adjusted RR that explained magnesium sulphate use in pre-eclampsia. The adjusted PAR% was estimated by bootstrapping. Of 631 women with pre-eclampsia, 174 (30. 1 %) had severe pre-eclampsia, of whom 131 (75. 3 %) received magnesium sulphate. 457 (69. 9 %) women had non-severe pre-eclamspia, of whom 291 (63. 7 %) received <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> among women with pre-eclampsia could be attributed to the following clinical factors (PAR%) : delivery for 'adverse conditions' (48. 7 %), severe hypertension (21. 9 %), receipt of antenatal corticosteroids (20. 0 %), maternal transport prior to delivery (9. 9 %), heavy proteinuria (7. 8 %), and interventionist care (3. 4 %).

Ash suitability was evaluated using a number of conventional characterisation tools including XRF, calorimetric and microscopy to analyse solid phase distribution in relation to compositional differences derived from ternary diagram analogues. Blends of brown coal ash with selected black coal fly ash (class F) and blast furnace slag were developed for compressive strength and durability tests. The study show that brown coal fly ash with higher Al content improved the rate of reaction of blended binders and that observed high contents <b>of</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>magnesium</b> oxides available in some brown coal fly ashes induced accelerated decomposition in high moist environments. Overall, it was evident from both microscopy and mineralogical analysis of binder mixtures that brown coal fly ash participate in geopolymer network formation rather than act as filler material.

The magnesium deficiency increases with the age of the person. Its content is not enough in the diet of the elderly and poorly provided people. The purpose of the research was to study the possibility of enriching <b>of</b> berries with <b>magnesium</b> enriched berries <b>of</b> various crops by the method of foliar treatment of plants during the formation of berries. The objects of research were the berries of the honeysuckle variety of Zimorodok, the strawberry variety of the Korona, the variegated–leaf hardy kiwi variety of Soroka. Enrichment was carried out by the method of single root foliar treatment of plants with an aqueous solution <b>of</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> various concentrations in variants of the experiment with the addition of hydrated lime {{in order to avoid the}} burning of plants. The rate of consumption of the solution depended on the number of plants per hectare and the age of plantations. Control samples were sprayed with distilled water. The magnesium content in the berries was determined in accordance with GOST R 51429 - 99. The results obtained in the first years of the study allowed to determine the optimal concentration of the solution used to enrich the berries with magnesium, which was 20. 0 g/l. The use of this method of enrichment showed a positive tendency <b>of</b> <b>magnesium</b> accumulation by plants. The magnesium content in berries increases, while the following regularity was observed: an increase in the concentration of the solution in the variants of the experiment contributed to its greater content in the berries. The results of further studies prove the possibility of increasing the natural content <b>of</b> <b>magnesium</b> in honeysuckle, strawberry and variegated–leaf hardy kiwi in 1. 7 – 6. 3 times.
