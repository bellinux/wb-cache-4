5|$|Open-spandrel <b>segmental</b> {{arch bridge}}: The {{earliest}} known fully stone open-spandrel <b>segmental</b> arch bridge is the Zhaozhou Bridge in southern Hebei province, China, completed in 605 by the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineer Li Chun. The bridge span is 37.5m (123ft) {{and the structure}} relatively light in weight due to the four semi-circular arch spandrels which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, and the simple <b>segmental</b> arch Lugou Bridge built in 1698 (originally in 1189). The latter, located just west of Beijing and features eleven <b>segmental</b> arches.|$|E
5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as <b>segmental</b> bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (<b>segmental)</b> bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The <b>segmental</b> anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|Tumors {{presenting}} {{with any}} kind of <b>segmental</b> chromosome copy number changes were associated with a high risk of relapse.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{features}} two {{ranges of}} shops {{designed in the}} Palladian style c.1770, between them forming a narrow street over the bridge. The street and buildings sit above three <b>segmental</b> arches of equal span.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} speech can be {{analyzed}} into a combination of <b>segmental</b> and suprasegmental elements. The <b>segmental</b> elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which {{are a result of}} their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.|$|E
5|$|Within tumors showing <b>segmental</b> alterations, {{additional}} independent {{predictors of}} decreased overall survival were N-myc amplification, 1p and 11q deletions, and 1q gain.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) <b>segmental,</b> are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or <b>segmental</b> and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E
5|$|The new bridge cost $14 {{million and}} was {{opened in the}} middle of 2008. The old bridge remains in place next to it as a {{pedestrian}} walkway and historic landmark. The National <b>Segmental</b> Bridge Institute recognized CDOT and the new bridge with a Bridge Award for Excellence in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded <b>segmental</b> pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and {{cambered}} lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of <b>segmental</b> and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera. The prothorax is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the mesothorax is the most developed.|$|E
5|$|This classically {{designed}} wing {{has been}} attributed to Inigo Jones, but without supporting evidence; as with a similar attribution at Brympton d'Evercy, also in Somerset, it seems to be based solely on the alternating <b>segmental</b> and pointed pediments over the groundfloor windows, and ignoring the irregularities in their spacings and placings, which Jones is unlikely to have countenanced.|$|E
5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the <b>segmental</b> concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastwards, {{the river}} is crossed by Iping Bridge at Iping, a narrow stone bridge with five arches dating from the seventeenth century. To {{the west of the}} bridge is the site of Iping watermill. A mill was {{recorded}} there in the Domesday survey, completed in 1086. By 1665, there were the remains of a fulling mill at the site, and a wheat-mill and malt-mill, both part of the same building. It became a paper mill in the eighteenth century, and continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire in 1930. At Stedham, part of the civil parish of Stedham with Iping, Stedham Lane crosses the river on a stone bridge with six <b>segmental</b> arches. Five of them date from the seventeenth century, with one later addition. The river then makes a large loop to the north, where Stedham Mill was situated. The mill building has been demolished, but the mill house is a listed structure. After the loop, Woolbeding Bridge, on the northern Edge of Midhurst, dates from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. It has four <b>segmental</b> arches, was restored in 1919, and is a grade II* listed structure.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced plans to}} build a new bridge, a <b>segmental</b> concrete bridge wider than the original, over the Susquehanna River. In 2004, work began on building the new, six-lane bridge which cost $150 million. On May 16, 2007, a ribbon-cutting took place to mark the completion of the westbound direction of the bridge, which opened to traffic the following day. The eastbound direction of the bridge opened a month later.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a <b>segmental</b> arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a <b>segmental</b> arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E
5|$|To {{construct}} the new Central line platforms, the larger diameter station tunnels were manually excavated around the existing running tunnels whilst trains continued to run. When the excavations were complete, the original <b>segmental</b> tunnel linings were dismantled. The new platforms came into use on 25 September 1933 replacing those of British Museum, which had closed the day before. As {{part of the}} modernisation the station was renamed Holborn (Kingsway) on 22 May 1933, but the suffix gradually dropped out of use and no longer appears on station signage or tube maps. The new platforms at Holborn led {{to the number of}} passengers switching between the lines increasing tenfold by 1938.|$|E
5|$|With {{a length}} of , the Limyra Bridge qualifies as the largest {{surviving}} engineering achievement of antiquity in Lycia. The bridge stands on 26 uniform <b>segmental</b> arches consisting of a double, radially laid course of bricks. At the eastern end, the original 27tharch {{has been replaced by}} two smaller, semicircular arches of later construction. The latter are built with a single course of bricks. Traces of the original, flat beginning of the collapsed arch are still visible on the piers.|$|E
5|$|He {{provided}} new fronts {{to the two}} official {{buildings of}} Rome's civic government, the Palazzo dei Conservatori, the Senatorio, and finally the Nuovo. Michelangelo designed a new façade for the dilapidated Palazzo dei Conservatori and he designed the Palazzo Nuovo to be a mirror complement, thereby providing balance and coherence to the ragged ensemble of existing structures. The construction of these two buildings were carried out after his death {{under the supervision of}} Tommaso Cavalieri. The sole arched motif in the entire Campidoglio design is the <b>segmental</b> pediments over their windows, which give a slight spring to the completely angular vertical-horizontal balance of the design. The three palazzi are now home to the Capitoline Museums.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, <b>segmental</b> domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The stables {{were built}} in 1820, during {{the early part of}} the Admiral's {{ownership}} of the estate, based on a design by John Smith; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house. Built in a horseshoe-shape, neo-classical design, the two-storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings; grey granite was used for the parapet and quoins. The main buildings were originally harled. A corrugated asbestos hipped roof was at some point substituted for the original slate roof. It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower, which has a finial and domed copper roof. The pedimented centrepiece of the symmetrical front elevation is a <b>segmental</b> arch and has three panels set back between columns. Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single-bay pavilions.|$|E
5|$|The {{town centre}} {{contains}} three Grade I listed bridges. The Town Bridge is a 15th-century ashlar stone bridge {{composed of two}} portions separated by a narrow strip of land. The eastern portion crosses the narrower of two branches of the River Avon that pass through the town and features five low round-headed arches. The western bridge features two arches and crosses the millstream which runs adjacent to the Avon. To {{the east of the}} Town Bridge on the same route from the town centre the Waterloo Bridge spans the larger branch of the Avon. Built circa 1816–1817 in the mediaeval tradition with dressed Portland stone, its design incorporates five wide <b>segmental</b> arches, circular piers and capped cutwaters. On the northern side of the bridge a modern steel pedestrian footbridge is cantilevered to the older structure.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} {{as a pair of}} circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with <b>segmental</b> cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and grouted into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle beam bridge, {{described}} by literary sources and seen in reliefs carved on tomb bricks. Evidence for arch bridges is elusive: one outside of Chengdu's south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (馬賢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a beam bridge. In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is <b>segmental,</b> although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed. Although there are rare references to simple suspension bridges in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the Himalaya, Hindukush and Afghanistan, demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there. Floating pontoon bridges made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the Yellow River and Yangzi River) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.|$|E
5|$|Sprotbrough Bridge is {{actually}} two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream {{and the northern}} one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a ferry crossing of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three <b>segmental</b> arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which {{has been replaced by}} a plate girder bridge resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a single storey with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge were said to have been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both <b>segmental</b> and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
25|$|Note 2: Each renal artery {{partitions}} into an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior branch further divides {{into the}} superior (apical), anterosuperior, anteroinferior and inferior <b>segmental</b> arteries. The posterior branch continues as the posterior <b>segmental</b> artery.|$|E
25|$|The Romans also {{introduced}} <b>segmental</b> arch bridges into bridge construction. The 330m long Limyra Bridge in southwestern Turkey features 26 <b>segmental</b> arches {{with an average}} span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed {{for more than a}} millennium. Trajan's bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel <b>segmental</b> arches made of wood (standing on 40m high concrete piers). This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790m long Puente Romano at Mérida.|$|E
25|$|The first bronchi {{to branch}} from the trachea {{are the right}} and left main bronchi. Second only in {{diameter}} to the trachea (1.8cm), these bronchi (1 -1.4cm in diameter) enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as <b>segmental</b> bronchi. Further divisions of the <b>segmental</b> bronchi (1 to 6mm in diameter) are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order <b>segmental</b> bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.|$|E
25|$|Although large Chinese {{bridges of}} wooden {{construction}} {{existed at the}} time of the Warring States, the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the Zhaozhou Bridge, built from 595 to 605 AD during the Sui Dynasty. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest open-spandrel stone <b>segmental</b> arch bridge. European <b>segmental</b> arch bridges date back to at least the Alconétar Bridge (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era Trajan's Bridge (105 AD) featured open-spandrel <b>segmental</b> arches in wooden construction.|$|E
25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} balanced cantilever bridges {{are often}} built using <b>segmental</b> construction.|$|E
25|$|The Romans also {{introduced}} <b>segmental</b> arch bridges into bridge construction.

This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790 m long Puente Romano at Mérida. The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch.|$|E

25|$|<b>Segmental</b> duplications (SDs or LCRs) {{have had}} roles in {{creating}} new primate genes and shaping human genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|Doors {{usually have}} square lintels. They may be set within an arch or surmounted by a {{triangular}} or <b>segmental</b> pediment.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-capillary (MCAP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes of megalencephaly. Typically, MCAP and MPPH can be {{distinguished}} by somatic features. MCAP includes many characteristics that are observed at birth including: cutaneous vascular malformations, especially capillary malformations of the face and cutis marmorata, polydactyly, connective tissue dysplasia, and focal or <b>segmental</b> body overgrowth. Furthermore, MCAP can occasionally be linked with asymmetric brain overgrowth (hemimegalencephaly) as well as <b>segmental</b> overgrowth of the body (hemihypertrophy).|$|E
