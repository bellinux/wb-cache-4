It was once a bald mountain, but due to reforestation with native trees, the area became a functioning watershed. It is home to about 27 native bird species, such as the emerald dove, Asian <b>glossy</b> <b>starling,</b> the collared kingfisher, the black-naped oriole, and the olive-backed sunbird. The park's size is 71 ha.|$|R
50|$|Lamprotornis {{is a large}} genus of glossy-starlings all {{of which}} occur in Africa south of the Sahara. They have glossy blue or green upper parts, {{which is due to}} hollow melanin {{granules}} arranged in a single layer near the feather barbule's surface. This unique arrangement led to some <b>glossy</b> <b>starlings</b> formerly placed in the genus Spreo being transferred to Lamprotornis, since they shared this feature (but see also below).|$|R
50|$|The Asian <b>glossy</b> <b>{{starling}}</b> (Aplonis panayensis) is {{a species}} of starling in the family Sturnidae. It is found in Bangladesh, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan (introduced) and Thailand. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. There is also {{a huge number of}} this species inhabiting towns and cities, where they take refuge in abandoned buildings and trees. They often move in large groups and are considered one of the noisiest species of birds.|$|R

In the caves {{on the slopes}} flanking the river basin, swiftlets known as sayaw-sayaw and several small to medium-sized native bats producing guano fertilizers can also be found. Some of the park's large mammals include the long-tailed macaque, Asian palm civet, Philippine tree squirrel and Celebes warty pig. It is also known to harbor reticulated pythons and water monitors.|$|R
5000|$|The fruit are {{eaten by}} people, vervet monkeys, bushpigs, Cape parrots, black-bellied <b>glossy</b> <b>starlings</b> and yellow-streaked bulbuls.

2500|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine {{birds in the}} family Sturnidae. The name [...] "Sturnidae" [...] comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as <b>glossy</b> <b>starlings</b> because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and {{are considered to be}} invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is indeed common.|$|R
60|$|All the Scansorial or climbing, {{and most}} of the Fissirostral or wide-gaped birds, for example, build {{concealed}} nests; and, in the latter group, the two families which build open nests, the Swifts and the Goat-suckers, are undoubtedly very widely separated from the other families with which they are associated in our classifications. The Tits vary much in their mode of nesting, some making open nests concealed in a hole, while others build domed or even pendulous covered nests, but they all come under the same class. Starlings vary in a similar way. The talking Mynahs, like our own starlings, build in holes, the <b>glossy</b> <b>starlings</b> of the East (of the genus Calornis) form a hanging covered nest, while the genus Sturnopastor builds in a hollow tree. One of the most striking cases in which one family of birds is divided between the two classes, is that of the Finches; for while most of the European species build exposed nests, many of the Australian finches make them dome-shaped.|$|R

I was now, however, pretty easy as {{to the fate of}} the men. There was plenty of sago on our rocky island, and there world probably be some on the fiat one they were left on. They had choppers, and could cut down a tree and make sago, and would most likely find sufficient water by digging. Shell-fish were abundant, and {{they would be able to}} manage very well till some boat should touch there, or till I could send and fetch them. The next day we devoted to cutting wood, filling up our jars with all the water we could find, and making ready to sail in the evening. I shot a small lory closely resembling a common species at Ternate, and a <b>glossy</b> <b>starling</b> which differed from the allied birds of Ceram and Matabello. Large wood-pigeons and crows were the only other birds I saw, but I did not obtain specimens.|$|R

40|$|Mistletoes of {{the family}} Loranthaceae have {{characteristically}} low dispersibility. Whereas the family is represented by c. 400 species on the continental masses and intervening archipelagos on the western Pacific rim, and by a similar number in South America, only a few species have reached remote South Pacific islands. Recent bird dispersal of Ileostylus micranthus from New Zealand to Norfolk I (c. 700 km) is comparable in distance with island-to-island bird dispersal in the most widespread species, Decaisnina forsteriana, from New Guinea to the Marquesas in Quaternary time. Once established in island communities, even species of generally low dispersibility may have an increased probability of further waif dispersal. For mistletoes a shift in avian vectors is the likely cause, from berrypeckers (Dicaeidae) in Malesia-Australia to probably campephagids (Campephagidae), <b>glossy</b> <b>starlings</b> (Sturnidae) and fruit doves and imperial pigeons (Columbidae) in the Pacific islands. This shift has disrupted the association which exists between mistletoes and their specialized co-adapted bird dispersal agents in their continental source area on the western Pacific rim. When the mistletoe fruits become exclusively available to more generalist feeders, dispersal may be less efficient but extend over longer distances...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{completion of}} the rainy season and nesting of granivorous birds between October and November in the Sudano-sahelian region of Senegal often results in very extensive bird damage to cereal crops. This occurs from both increased bird populations, due {{to the presence of}} juveniles as well as from their accompanying change in diet from insects to seeds. The damage is caused by several species of birds, most notable the Red-billed Dioch (Quelea quelea) and the Village and Black-headed Weavers (Ploceus cuculiatus and Ploceus capitalis). The Buffalo Weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) and the <b>Glossy</b> <b>Starling</b> Lamprotornis chalybaeus) also are at times serious crop depredators. Traditionally, farmers employ many different frightening techniques to chase or scare birds from their crops. The methods provide at best only temporary relief and require considerable time and energy. A possible solution to the bird problem involves the use of chemical repellents applied directly to the ripening grain. The purpose of the trial reported here was to evaluate methiocarb or Mesurol [4 -(methylthio) - 3, 5 xylyl N - methylcarbamate] as a bird repellent on ripening sorghum. The study was undertaken {{as a part of the}} Regional UNDP/FAO Project “Research into the Control of Grain-eating Birds,” aimed at the development and improvement of control techniques to prevent or reduce bird damage to cereal crops. The effectiveness of methiocarb as a nonlethal bird repellent has been demonstrated on several types of crops, among them cherries (Guarino, et al., 1974), blueberries (Bollengier, et al., 1973), sorghum (Mott and Lewis, 1975) and rice (DeHaven, et al., 1971). Trials by DeGrazio and DeHaven (1974) on wheat and rice in eastern Africa also have shown promise. Likewise, the Quelea Project has obtained some success with it against Passer Iuteus, Quelea quelea, and ploceus capitalis when applied to both ripening millet and rice (Bruggers, 1975, 1977) ...|$|R

40|$|The Red-billed Quelea (Quelga quelaa), {{because of}} its {{widespread}} destruction of grain crops throughout its range in Africa, {{is one of the}} most studied and written about granivorous bird species. Less publicized are more local bird pests in Africa which may be equally Important. The Village Weaver, (Ploceus cucullatus), for example, is a pest in many countries, while some other Ploecids with limited destructive habits create local problems. Significant crop losses also occur where there are large populations of Golden Sparrows (Passer luteus), House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), Red Bishops (Euplectes oryx), Doves (Streptopelia spp.), <b>Glossy</b> <b>Starlings</b> (Lamprotornis chalybaeus), Parakeets (Psittacula spp.), and some waterfowl (Mackworth-Praed and Grant, 1952; Pans Manual No. 3, 1974; Park, 1974). Crop losses from local bird pests were reported in early February 1975 to the Sudan Plant Protection Bird Control Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. A mechanized farm scheme in Khartoum North had large concentrations of Red Bishops roosting in maize and feeding on an early-maturing wheat variety (Mexicana). Small flocks of Golden Sparrows and House Sparrows also were present. Bird damage was clearly visible, especially at the corners and along the edges of the ripening wheatfields. Ground spraying with Queletox (60 % a. 1. Fenthion) on roosts of the Golden and House Sparrows was conducted along hedge rows of acacia (Acacia mellifera) located at the north end of the farm. Although the spray killed large numbers of roosting birds, damage con- tinued as the wheat matured. Pilot field trials were thus organized to test the effectiveness of other crop protection techniques. Because birds fed throughout many blocks of wheat which matured at different periods, it was felt that several different experiments could be conducted without Interfering with each other. The control techniques Included an acoustical repellent, a chemical repellent, a chemical frightening agent, and a trap.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesClimate change poses a {{major threat}} to living organisms, with maximum {{temperatures}} expected to continue to rise over the next few decades. Hot desert environments are particularly at risk because they experience high environmental temperatures, scarce vegetation, low productivity and unpredictable water sources. Endotherms such as birds face the challenge of maintaining a stable body temperature while avoiding dehydration. This study was carried out in the southern Kalahari, in South Africa's Northern Cape, where about 50 % of bird species (36 species) depend on free-standing drinking water. Livestock farms within this area provide artificial water points, which benefit birds as well as livestock. This study determined the role of shade and cover in the use of these artificial water points by birds. An experiment was conducted at six waterholes using the Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) design. After an initial baseline was established, three waterholes were shaded while the other three were left unshaded. Camera traps were used to record the pattern and intensity of water use by bird species at different times of the day and at varying air temperatures. A total of 36 bird species drank at the water holes, but data analysis was confined to the ten most abundant species. Of the ten, six species responded to the presence of shade/cover, with four species reacting positively (Cape <b>Glossy</b> <b>Starling</b> Lamprotornis nitens, Red - headed Finch Amadina erythrocephala, Black - throated Canary Serinus atrogularis, and Laughing Dove Spilopelia senegalensis), four showing no significant change in drinking patterns, and two showing a decrease in visitor numbers when the site was shaded (Cape Turtle - Dove Streptopelia capicola, Namaqua Dove Oena capensis). This suggests that providing shade at waterholes is not a universal {{solution to the problem of}} increasing heat stress experienced by birds coming to drink. Certain species such as the Laughing Doves and Cape Turtle-Doves avoided waterholes during the warmest time of the day while the Namaqua Doves were frequent visitors at this time. However, the Laughing Dove took advantage of the shade provided at midday (warmest temperatures) as their numbers increased. The Red-headed Finch and Black-throated Canary also increased at water holes with temperature irrespective of the time of day. These patterns imply that the provision of shade modifies the behavior of some bird species in response to predation risk or heat stress. These species utilized shade at different times of day and with varying intensities as temperatures rose...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Biodiversity and Conservation) Of the ~ 9, 920 extant bird species, 1, 253 of {{them are}} threatened. The decline of birds, {{particularly}} the House Sparrow and the starlings, over about {{the last three decades}} have been well-documented. In Great Britain, the numbers of House Sparrows have declined by as much as 60 %, the starlings by 41 % and the Turtle Doves by 71 %. In South Africa, the numbers of Cape Turtle Dove and the Laughing Dove have declined by 10 %. A difference also exists between the numbers decline in the urban and the rural areas {{in other parts of the}} world, with the overall declines being greater in the rural areas. Bird counts were performed for two weeks in the winter and two weeks in the summer of two consecutive years (2012 and 2013). These counts (using a point count method) were performed in an urban area (Auckland Park) and a rural area (Vaalwater). These two areas fell in two provinces namely Gauteng and Limpopo. In this study, the density indices of four bird species were determined in Gauteng (urban-) and Limpopo (rural) Provinces. Data obtained from the Avian Demographic Unit (ADU) of the University of Cape Town (UCT) for two national counts, SABAP 1 (1987 - 1992) and SABAP 2 (2007 - 2012), were statistically analysed. The numbers were compared for each species between the two provinces and an assessment of whether the overall indices of density had declined in the last 26 years made. After determining the declines, three reasons were investigated. These are: interspecific competition through a behavioural study, climate changes variations by weather service data analysis, and air pollutions by macrophage enumeration. The behavioural studies were performed in the same areas where the counts were done and the survey observed the relationship between the birds of interest and other invasive species like the Indian Mynas. These observations were done for 30 minutes daily at various sites, on the Auckland Park Campus of the University of Johannesburg and on the farms in the Vaalwater area. Temperature, rainfall and humidity data were obtained from South African Weather Service for the time that corresponds to the two bird counting (atlas) projects. By performing descriptive statistics on the climate data for the two provinces, a deduction could be drawn as to whether or not the weather patterns influenced the indices of density of the birds. The macrophage enumeration was conducted after the birds were captured with the aid of mist nets, lavage on the lung-air sac system performed and the cells stained. The numbers of macrophages in the urban birds were compared to the numbers in the rural ones. Comparison was made between the different species to determine which species were most affected by high levels of air pollution. Bird counts showed that higher numbers of Laughing Doves, Cape Turtle Doves and Cape <b>Glossy</b> <b>Starlings</b> occurred in the Vaalwater area compared to Auckland Park, while the House Sparrows were the only species that occurred in higher numbers in the urban area. The long term data analysis indicated that the House Sparrows and Laughing Doves declined between the two atlas projects (SABAP 1 and SABAP 2) in both provinces while the Cape <b>Glossy</b> <b>Starlings</b> increased in both areas. The Cape Turtle Doves increased in Gauteng and decreased in Limpopo between the two bird counting projects. The behavioural study showed that competition between native and invasive species like the Indian Myna, Hadida and Egyptian Goose over food resources possibly contributed to the declines in the numbers of birds. Even though the House Sparrows are also an invasive species, no aggressive behavior was noticed from them towards the other species. Weather might be an influential factor as the temperatures in Gauteng increase with 0. 1 °C and in Limpopo it increased by 0. 45 °C when the conditions were compared for the atlas project timeframes; 1987 - 1992 and 2007 - 2012. The rainfall decreased in these timeframes in both provinces, (Gauteng from 497. 3 mm to 441. 7 mm and Limpopo from 799. 9 mm to 451. 3 mm) while the humidity was higher during the second timeframe (69. 1 kg/mᵌ) than the first (67. 5 kg/mᵌ) in the Gauteng Province and the opposite was true for the humidity levels in Limpopo (73. 8 kg/mᵌ against 71. 4 kg/mᵌ). Under such circumstances plant growth and ultimately the food source of the birds should have decreased. The macrophage study indicated that air pollution might not be a major factor in the declines as the numbers of macrophages normalized with body mass for all the species in the urban areas were significantly higher than the rural birds’ macrophage numbers. However, as higher number of birds were present in the urban area (according to the atlas data analysis), air pollution cannot be the foremost reason for the bird number declines. It can, however, be a contributing factor along for example with parasites. The specific cause of the bird number declines is still uncertain. A combination of factors appears to be involved...|$|R
