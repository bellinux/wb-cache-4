He calls for students to listen and sing along to melodies on tape until they can reproduce the melody without the tape. It is essential, according to Blake, that a student do this before touching an instrument, as imitating the mechanics of a performance alone does not develop one's ear.|$|E

These materials do not differ geochemically but they do differ in their influence on the amount of mineral nitrogen observed in alpine lakes and streams. Improvements to the carbon-nitrogen dynamics portion of the ARM indicate that the Emerald Lake watershed is nearing nitrogen saturation.

A complete CCS cycle requires safe, reliable and cost effective solutions for the transmission of CO 2 from the capturing facility {{to the location of}} permanent storage. This publication presents a detailed review of the integrity risks posed to dense-phase CO 2 pipelines in the form of internal corrosion. To begin, the current worldwide experience in handling dense-phase CO 2 and the anthropogenic <b>stream</b> <b>compositions</b> expected from the different combustion techniques currently available are discussed. The anticipated compositions are then related to a number of tentative CO 2 <b>stream</b> <b>compositions</b> available in open literature proposed by research institutes and pipeline operators. In subsequent sections, early laboratory and field corrosion experience relating to natural dense-phase CO 2 transport for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are summarised along with more recent research efforts which focus on identifying the role of anthropogenic impurities in the degradation processes. For each system impurity, the reaction rates, mechanisms and corrosion product composition/morphology expected at the steel surfaces are discussed, as well as each component’s ability to influence the critical water content required to initiate corrosion. Potential bulk phase reactions between multiple impurities are also evaluated in an attempt to help understand how the impurity content may evolve along a long-distance pipeline. The likelihood of stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking is discussed and the various corrosion mitigation techniques which exist to control degradation to acceptable levels are reviewed. Based on the current research performed in the context of impure dense-phase CO 2 corrosion, issues associated with performing laboratory experiments to replicate field conditions and the challenges such limitations present in terms of defining the safe operating window for CO 2 transport are considered...|$|R

40|$|In {{industrial}} {{fuel gas}} preparation, {{there are several}} compositional properties that must be controlled within specified limits. This allows client plants to use the fuel gas mixture safely without having to adjust and control the composition themselves. The variables to be controlled are the Higher Heating Value (HHV), Wobbe Index (WI), Flame Speed Index (FSI), and Pressure (P). These variables are controlled by adjusting the volumetric flow rates of several inlet gas streams of which some are makeup streams (always available) and some are wild streams that vary in composition and availability (by-products of plants). The inlet streams need to be adjusted in the correct ratios to keep all the controlled variables (CVs) within limits while minimising {{the cost of the}} gas blend.

40|$|Studies of {{scramjet}} combustor scaling {{have been}} extended to include testing of a 'small' combustor, thereby allowing comparison with results obtained in a 'large' combustor of nearly identical configuration. The scale of the two combustors varied {{by a factor of}} 5. It was anticipated that the combustion process would scale as the product of pressure with length if the temperature, the Mach number, the velocity, the free <b>stream</b> <b>composition</b> and the equivalence ratio were the same. To achieve this while allowing for the necessary difference in pressure the two models were tested with different shock tunnel nozzles. The large was tested in a M = 8 nozzle, with an intake consisting of a pair of opposing wedges preceding the model, which produced shocks to reduce the Mach number to approximately 3. 4 before the flow entered the model inlet. It was then expanded to raise the Mach number again. The small model was tested in a M = 4 nozzle, with the nozzle flow passing directly to the inlet of the model. The wedge intake for the large model was adjusted to yield similar combustion chamber Mach number for both models. Then, by matching the stagnation enthalpy, it was possible also to match the temperature and the velocity. The free <b>stream</b> <b>composition</b> was matched by operating at the same nozzle supply pressure. Wall pressure distributions were measured along each of the ducts. The pressure is normalized with respect to the pressure measured at the point opposite to the injector exit, and the distance downstream of the exit is normalized with respect to the height of the duct. It can be seen that, when normalized in this manner, both ducts produce quantitatively similar pressure distributions, confirming the initial hypothesis that the combustion process would scale as the product of pressure with length...|$|E

These differential pressure elements are typical instrument installed in the wellhead of production wells in Urucu field (Petrobras/Brazil). To deliver composition and rates four steps were done: 1) a multi-rate well test - an experimental procedure carried out in real operation conditions. 2) modeling of multiphase flow expansion process through cage trim valves. 3) performance and validation of multiphase flow through orifice plate meters {{by the use of}} homogeneous and slip models. 4) tuning and metering procedures for coupling the valve and orifice plate models. The last investigation developed a full field production optimization procedure honouring pressure and routing constraints to be applied in multiple wells. Essentially, the research performed in this thesis is an experimental work followed by numerical modeling. Model errors and performance validation were calculated on the basis of measured data from a multi-rate well test. This field scale experiment consisted in a sequential step response test followed by a transient and a steady state period “a priori” to each next step.
