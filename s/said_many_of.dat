5|$|Zakuani was a right-footed {{player who}} {{preferred}} {{being on the}} left of the field. He played on the left wing in a 4–4–2 formation with Arsenal; later he was a forward in college before converting to a winger professionally. Zakuani said he played with a style he learned at Arsenal's youth academy and that he tried to emulate the style of former winger Robert Pirès. Zakuani often sought advice from former Arsenal star Fredrik Ljungberg when they played together in Seattle. Zakuani was a quick, agile player who liked to take defenders one-on-one. While coaching him at Akron, Porter <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Zakuani's goals came after long runs that beat multiple players.|$|E
5|$|In his own 2003 thesis, Lieutenant Colonel Victor J. Bond {{said the}} 2nd Ranger Company's {{performance}} in Korea had been exemplary, {{in spite of}} racial discrimination against it. The troops, who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company, quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers. Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea, noting the company did not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E

But Fowler also <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the jokes remain too obvious and juvenile and that the supporting characters are being underused; he said the fact that Aneka has spent the last few episodes having sex with Longshaft was particularly offensive.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not {{completely}} aware of what other sketches would {{be included in the}} film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear).

25|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of the {{beginning}} of the 2011 revolution, protests again erupted in cities across the country, following occasional skirmishes between protesters and police in Cairo the day before. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Tahrir Square during the day, with clashes between police forces and protesters occurring around the city at the Interior Ministry headquarters, state media offices and the presidential palace. Security forces fired tear gas at protesters trying to force their way into the presidential palace and state television offices. In the city of Suez, five people were killed by gunfire – four protesters and one security trooper. Protests also took place in Alexandria, Ismailia, Damanhur, and Port <b>Said,</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> which were focused on local government buildings. Tear gas use by police was reported in Alexandria, while protesters in that city and Suez burned tires. By the end of 25 January, about 280 protesters and 55 security personnel had been injured across the country.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to spending cuts, Romney and the legislature {{relied heavily on}} fee increases to help balance the budgets throughout Romney's term, more aggressively pursuing a revenue source that the legislature {{had already begun to}} draw upon to close a deep deficit during the year prior to Romney’s election. The state of Massachusetts raised $500 million in new revenue during Romney’s first year in office from fees, more than any other state surveyed. Romney proposed 33 new fees along with increases in 57 existing fees, resulting in higher costs for birth certificates, new car purchases, driver’s learning permits, firearms permits, professional licenses, and billboards advertising, as well as for many state services. He also increased a state gasoline fee originally intended for cleanup of contamination around underground fuel storage tanks. The two cents per gallon increase made for a total effective state gasoline tax of 23.5 cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in additional revenue (surpluses of $40 million over the costs of the cleanup program). Opponents <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the fees posed a hardship on those who could least afford them, such as fees for the state to provide certification of blindness and a photo identification card for the blind. The proposal also called for a $50 fee for tuberculosis tests and a $400 fee for those who tested positive (the tuberculosis fees were rejected by the legislature).|$|E

500|$|Ramsey Isler of IGN called [...] "Whale Whores" [...] an {{entertaining}} episode, {{but said the}} episode could have provided more meaningful satire and did not explain the whaling issue very well, especially considering the show's target audience was probably unfamiliar with it. Isler praised some of the individual jokes revolving around the Japanese attacks, and called Cartman's [...] "Poker Face" [...] rendition a classic South Park moment, but dismissed the Enola Gay twist as [...] "stupid". Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said [...] "South Park swung and missed" [...] with [...] "Whale Whores". Delgado <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the jokes were random and [...] "weird", particularly the Enola Gay twist and the Japanese kamikaze attacks.|$|E
500|$|Ingela Ratledge of TV Guide favorably {{described}} the episode as {{the exact opposite}} of award show segments that reverentially pay homage to the year's departed celebrities, calling it [...] "a wonderfully tasteless farewell." [...] Sue Bergerstein, an arts and celebrity writer with Examiner.com, called [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] a [...] "new low" [...] for South Park, adding [...] "It's not only tasteless but this episode just adds to the sadness currently experienced by all the mourning relatives." [...] Newsweek writer Joshua Alston said few of the jokes in [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] were funny, and so the mocking of celebrities [...] "in the absence of laughs, felt tasteless and unnecessary". Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the episodes seemed rehashed and predictable, especially those targeting Michael Jackson and children's beauty pageants. Sepinwall added he liked the Chipotle subplot, but commented, [...] "Overall, 'Dead Celebrities' was a misfire." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. The Independent reported, [...] "designer Paul Costelloe moved {{to meet the}} demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." [...] Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, [...] "ou can see why men {{wanted to get the}} look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no means your standard telly hunk, had on lady viewers … and decided it must {{have something to do with}} the clobber. So it is that Britain's latest men's style icon is a fictional asexual sociopath first seen onscreen hitting a corpse with a horse whip.

500|$|While {{the fans}} {{hoped for a}} Canada-Soviet Union final, analysts ranked the Soviets as only the fourth best team {{entering}} the tournament. [...] They chose to leave most of its elite players home for reasons that remain unclear. [...] Officially, Soviet officials <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> their players were suffering from fatigue, though goaltender Vladislav Tretiak later claimed the omissions {{were the result of}} a power struggle between Olympic coach Boris Kulagin and Canada Cup team coach Viktor Tikhonov and that the former sought to undermine the latter by forcing him to coach a weaker team. The Soviets downplayed the importance of the tournament, stating their true focus was the World Championships and the Winter Olympics. As a result, they sent a much younger, [...] "experimental" [...] team to Canada. Valeri Kharlamov, {{considered by many to be}} their best forward, also did not play in the series; at the time of the tournament, he was recovering from serious injuries suffered in a car accident.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was {{and said she was}} [...] "not that important", {{suggesting}} Latinos [...] "get over it". Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans [...] "didn't understand what all the fuss was about". This was echoed in the Corpus Christi Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. Educators who had observed the reactions said, [...] "the emergence of an icon in a minority culture can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos". Melicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand [...] "the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be costed to taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers about the media interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the people complaining about the media exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.|$|E
500|$|Sestak {{insisted he}} would not make a final {{decision}} for several months. On May 4, he met with Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, which fueled speculation that he was seeking labor support for a campaign. Meanwhile, Joe Torsella, {{the former president of}} the National Constitution Center, had planned on running for the Democratic nomination and initially announced Specter's party change would not affect his decision to run. However, Torsella announced on May 14 he was dropping out of the race because Specter's decision changed the political landscape, and he wanted to avoid a campaign that [...] "would probably be negative, personal, and more about Senator Specter's past than our common future". It had been reported that Governor Rendell, for whom Torsella previously worked as an aide, pushed for Torsella to step aside so Specter could run unopposed, but Torsella's staff denied those claims. Despite Torsella's departure, Sestak continued to consider entering the race and began gaining support from the Democratic party's more liberal factions like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which began a [...] "Draft Sestak" [...] campaign fund. Sestak became further encouraged to run after taking a tour of all 67 Pennsylvania counties to meet with party leaders and discuss such issues as jobs, the economy and health care. Sestak said that the leaders voiced serious concerns to him about the direction of the country and, although his lack of name recognition was a problem, Sestak <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the people he encountered voiced support for him.|$|E

500|$|A soundtrack album {{consisting}} of hip hop and R songs {{was released on}} April 23, 2002, through Artemis Records. Eglee explained that he and Cameron began {{with the idea that}} they could do a [...] "hip hop youth ensemble thing", noting that [...] "hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [...] in the world" [...] and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of Dark Angel the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as Fort Apache: a place that for white America, defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would {{come to be known as}} Hip Hop.... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. [...] Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and neo soul artists whose lyrics typically [...] "focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality." [...] It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it [...] "seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character". Birchmeier <b>said</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the songs were [...] "quite impressive" [...] and that it [...] "exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack".|$|E
