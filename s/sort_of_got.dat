25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew pretty much what I was doing, and they <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> a bit heavier".|$|E

500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{would say}} that I got into jazz when I got into Woody Herman's band because that band was sorta jazz-oriented. They had records. It was the first band I ever joined where the musicians carried records on the road... Duke Ellington records... Woody Herman discs [...] Charlie Barnet V-Discs... That's the first time I <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> into jazz. The first time I sort of felt that I was {{anything}} remotely connected with jazz.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E

50|$|Conceptually, the {{allocation}} rules seem important. There is lot of spatial autocorrelation in urban land uses; it’s driven by historical path dependence: this <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing <b>got</b> started here and seeds {{more of the}} same. This autocorrelation was lost somewhat in the step from “by hand” to analytic models.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody {{except her}} parents ever loved poor Atossa, that's certain, not even her husband," [...] averred Mrs. Lynde. [...] "She was his fourth wife. He'd <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> {{into the habit}} of marrying. He only lived a few years after he married her. The doctor said he died of dyspepsia, but I shall always {{maintain}} that he died of Atossa's tongue, that's what. Poor soul, she always knew everything about her neighbors, but she never was very well acquainted with herself. Well, she's gone anyhow; and I suppose the next excitement will be Diana's wedding." ...|$|E

It was about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> it into my head that, if I climbed up that tree, I'd very likely {{be able to see}} into that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington should be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact, for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms downstairs. But I guess I'd got the hump from standing so long in the rain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I started up.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't a hunch, Shorty. Bright just <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> on my {{imagination}} {{for a couple}} of twists. He told me more in one minute with those eyes of his than I could read in the books in a thousand years. His eyes were acrawl with the secrets of life. They were just squirming and wriggling there. The trouble is I almost got them, and then I didn't. I'm no wiser than I was before, but I was near them." [...] He paused and then added, [...] "I can't tell you, but that dog's eyes were just spilling over with cues to what life is, and evolution, and star-dust, and cosmic sap, and all the rest--everything." ...|$|E

Say, I don't want to scare you, Nelly, but, if you ask me, that show they're putting out down there is a citron! I don't think Ike's got a cent {{of his own money}} in it. My belief is that he's running it for a lot of amateurs. Why, say, listen! Joe and I blow in there to see if there's {{anything}} for us, and there's a tall guy in tortoise-shell cheaters sitting in Ike's office. Said he was the author and was engaging the principals. We told him who we were, and it didn't make any hit with him at all. He said he had never heard of us. And, when we explained, he said no, there wasn't going to be any of our sort of work in the show. Said he was making an effort to give the public something rather better than the usual sort of thing. No specialities required. He said it was an effort to restore the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition. Say, who are these Gilbert and Sullivan guys, anyway? They get written up in the papers all the time and I never met any one who'd run across them. If you want my opinion, that show down there is a comic opera!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Dusty Springfield {{was on a}} {{stop-over}} in New York City {{en route}} to Nashville to make a country music album with the Springfields in 1962, {{when she heard the}} Exciters' [...] "Tell Him" [...] playing while taking a late-night walk by the Colony Record Store on Broadway. The song helped Springfield decide to embark on a solo career with a pop/soul direction. She'd recall: [...] "The Exciters <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> you by the throat...out of the blue comes blasting at you “I know something about love”, and that’s it. That’s what I wanna do." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} without the full participation of Jason Isbell's regular backing band The 400 Unit, with Isbell noting: [...] "It really {{came to the}} nature of the songs more than anything else. It's a very personal record for me. And I had gone into the studio with the intention of making more of a solo, acoustic album. But Dave Cobb, the producer, and I both <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> bored with that idea and we decided to bring a band in for some things." [...] The 400 Unit band members Chad Gamble and Derry deBorja appear on drums and keyboards, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|P.S. Eliot disbanded in 2011. The band {{felt that}} they had done {{everything}} creatively that they wanted to do. [...] "We all got to a point where we wanted different things out of making music and everything we wanted to do from when we started we had definitely accomplished," [...] Katie said in 2013. [...] "I was kind of in the driver’s seat for every decision that we made, and I wrote all the songs ... It <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> a point where it didn’t seem like that was working out for my band mates and they didn’t seem like they were having too much fun doing that, and especially Allison." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} about the album Dhani stated [...] "I {{started off with}} a few demos and Oli had a few demos.

I went back to England to engineer it. After I <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>got</b> all our ducks in a row, it became clear what we had. Oli came out and we recorded some stuff, and I stayed with Paul Hicks and kind of produced the whole thing from an album point of view. We worked on the consistency of the sound." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the first}} four games of the 1903 World Series, Boston was down 1-3 to the Pittsburgh Pirates. (It was a best-of-nine series; five wins were needed to win the series.)

There are stories that the Royal Rooters actually traveled to Pittsburgh and hired a band to play [...] "Tessie" [...] to annoy the Pirates on their home field.
