5|$|Anfield {{comprises}} 54,074 seats {{split between}} four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is a single-tiered and the Main Stand a three-tiered. Entry {{to the stadium}} is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> rather than the traditional manned turnstile.

5|$|Since 1 July 2010, a {{smart card}} system has {{provided}} frequent travelers with multi-ride (eight trips) or periodic tickets. THSR's contact-less <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> allow the cardholder to travel between specific stations {{within a given}} time period for {{a certain number of}} rides. The card is sold in either registered (name-bearing) or non-registered form. Only adult tickets are available in this format, and cannot be used for rides between Banqiao and Taipei.|$|E

This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market. The EZ-Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 {{as a replacement for}} the original TransitLink farecard, while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smartcard market on 9 October 2009.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe wide use of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> {{automatic}} fare collection (AFC) {{systems in}} public transit makes it popular to analyse public transit user behaviour based on <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data. Most smart-card-based researches are time-related, but <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data time is not always reliable because <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> systems are usually off-line and lack of maintenance in China, and <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data of different buses often shares different time references. This paper explores the application of dynamic time warping to unify time reference of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data. Based on {{the analysis of the}} relationship between boarding time in <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data and arrival-departure time in automatic vehicle location (AVL) data, a <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data time reference unification algorithm was proposed. The results indicate that the algorithm can work out reliable time offsets by numerical calculation and runs well with integral automatic vehicle location data. Due {{to the fact that the}} time reference of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> data for each bus changes daily, the best way to put an end to <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> time reference problem is to make <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> systems online, such as combining <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> readers with automatic vehicle location systems...|$|R

5|$|Belgrade has an {{extensive}} public transport {{system based on}} buses (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and trolleybuses (8 lines). It is run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta, in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The BusPlus ticketing system based on contactless <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a S-train network, BG Voz, now run by the city government (previous commuter railway network, Beovoz, was abolished around 2013).

Travel by coach is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the central bus station.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic toll collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E
5|$|The A3 is a {{partially}} tolled motorway {{based on the}} vehicle classification in Croatia. The westernmost section of the motorway, spanning the Bobovica interchange and the Bregana border crossing, is tolled at Bregana toll plaza using an open toll collection system; the motorway sections east of Ivanja Reka interchange are tolled using a closed toll collection system, integrated with the A5 motorway as the two connect at the Sredanci interchange, forming a unified toll collection system. As of October 2010, Bregana toll plaza charges 5.00kuna (0.68euro) to passenger cars and 20.00kuna (2.74euro) to semi-trailer trucks. The toll charged along the A3 route between Ivanja Reka and Lipovac varies depending on the distance travelled and ranges from 3.00kuna (0.41euro) to 105.00kuna (14.38euro) for passenger cars and 10.00kuna (1.37euro) to 350.00kuna (47.95euro) for semi-trailer trucks.

Lack of technological knowledge on {{the capability of}} the <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> utility for managing identification system and unclear of the right architecture used to support the applications can be the factors for this. This study has examined the disciplinary approaches and the characterization of devices on the <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> implementations, to develop a rubric for {{risks and benefits of}} the full deployment of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> to humans and the organizations. This study designs a feasible process model for <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> applications deployment for Malaysia National Park or the official name is ‘Taman Negara’. The dynamic innovation process using the contactless <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> has been examined on the <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> applications focusing more on the pervasiveness of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> implementation supporting tour environment. The findings of this study are crystallized into frameworks for the full deployment guidelines of <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> utilization for individuals and organizations.
