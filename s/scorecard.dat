Kentikian finished the year by scoring another unanimous decision win, this time against Thai Teeraporn Pannimit, to retain her WIBF, WBA and WBO Female Flyweight titles.

On April 30, 2013, Ryan came {{out in favor of}} same-sex couples adopting children. Ryan said he had always supported civil unions, and that if the US Supreme Court declares the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, then he believes it will become a federalist issue for states to decide same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} fight, Margarito moved up in weight class for a rematch with Daniel Santos, who possessed the WBO junior welterweight title. The fight {{took place on}} September 11, 2004 and ended in a {{technical}} decision victory for Santos after Margarito was cut over the right eye by an unintentional headbutt in round six. After round nine it was ruled Margarito could not continue, so the fight was decided on the scorecards and Santos led 8685, 8784 on two cards while Margarito was ahead 8685 on the third <b>scorecard.</b> After the loss, Margarito moved back down in weight to defend his WBO welterweight title against Sebastian Lujan on February 18, 2005. He won the fight by technical knockout in the tenth round {{and set up a}} fight against Kermit Cintron, who was in attendance for Margarito's fight with Lujan. On April 23, 2005, Margarito defeated the less experienced Cintron, knocking him down four times en route to a technical knockout victory in the fifth round at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Margarito's next fight took place on February 18, 2006, when he defeated Manuel Gomez by technical knockout in just 74seconds in Las Vegas.|$|E

50|$|Credit <b>scorecards</b> are {{mathematical}} models which {{attempt to}} provide a quantitative estimate of {{the probability that a}} customer will display a defined behavior (e.g. loan default, bankruptcy or a lower level of delinquency) with respect to their current or proposed credit position with a lender. <b>Scorecards</b> are built and optimized to evaluate the credit file of a homogeneous population (e.g. files with delinquencies, files that are very young, files that have very little information). Most empirically derived credit scoring systems have between 10 and 20 variables. Application scores tend to be dominated by credit bureau data which typically amounts to over 80% of the predictive power from closer to 60% in the late 1980s for UK <b>scorecards.</b> Indeed there has been an increasing trend to minimize applicant or non-verifiable variables from <b>scorecards</b> which has increased the contribution of the credit bureau data.|$|R
