40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{some key}} technologies in laser path generation including contour <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> and internal <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> for stereolithography. To generate the contour <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> the cross-sectional contours must be offset a distance inward solid {{area in the}} course of machining parts because of the size of laser light spot. A simple calculating method of offset contours and a modified algorithm of detecting self-intersection points are presented. To generate the internal <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> an algorithm of sub-regional <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> generation is presented. The algorithm divides complex sectional contours into some simple non-hole sub-region, the <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> in every sub-region is continuous and the sub-regions are scanned in turn. At the same while, the <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> is optimized in two ways. The first one is that the joining path between the regions is optimized, which is effective on decreasing the vacant path.

50|$|The {{goal was}} to obtain the {{greatest}} imaging area in the smallest cylindrical volume using a consumer flatbed scanner. Typical flatbed scanners image an area of about 220 x 300 mm (660 cm2), so a system had to be found which could be reconfigured to fit inside a sealed transparent capsule. There are two basic imaging methods in modern flatbed scanners. From the 1980s to the late-1990s the market was dominated by systems that could capture an image from any depth of field. Most such digital imaging devices used a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) array. In a CCD, discrete dots of photosensitive material produce a specific charge based on the intensity of light hitting it. A CCD does not detect colour. In this technology, a scene is illuminated, a narrow band of reflected light from the scene passes through a slit (to eliminate light coming from other directions), is then concentrated by an array of mirrors (typically folded into a box) into a prism typically a few centimetres in length. The prism splits the light into its constituent colours. Small CCD arrays are carefully placed {{at the point where}} the primary colours are sharply focused. The separate colour intensities are combined to composite values and recorded by the computer (or scanner electronic assemblies) as a line of pixels. The moving scan head then advances a short distance to gather the next line of the scene. Thus resolution in one axis is determined by CCD array size and focused optics, while the other axis’ resolution is determined by the smallest reliable step the scan head advancing motor can make. The optical assemblies of this type of scanner are fairly robust to vibration, but the traditional light source (a cold cathode tube of balanced colour temperature) is not. It was therefore replaced with an array of solid-state white light emitting diodes (LEDs). Another advantage of this replacement is that the sources could be alternated between white light and ultraviolet (UV) of about 370 nm wavelength. This UV light source allowed detection of visibly fluorescing materials (typically tracer minerals or hydrocarbons) by the prototype.A suitable scan head model that could be reconfigured to fit within an 80 mm diameter cylinder was located, and the scanner’s standard stepper motor was modified to fit within the same space. The entire unit was then mounted on a stainless steel pivot and rotated by a spring-loaded friction wheel pressing against the inner wall of the cylinder. Since the perimeter of the cylinder (250 mm) was smaller than the typical <b>scan</b> <b>path</b> (300 mm) the motor gearing was reduced to improve along-path scan resolution, the resulting change in image geometry was relatively easy to correct in the image capture software. The resulting assembly is shown in Figure 8.|$|E
40|$|Merged {{orthogonal}} scan is a scan {{technique for}} data path logic. The orthogonal <b>scan</b> <b>path</b> data flow follows the normal data path data flow and is orthogonal {{to the data}} flow of a traditional <b>scan</b> <b>path.</b> This shift {{in the direction of}} data flow during scan permits much of the merged orthogonal <b>scan</b> <b>path</b> to be shared with the functional logic and interconnect, thereby reducing the <b>scan</b> <b>path</b> overhead. This work describes how a merged orthogonal <b>scan</b> <b>path</b> can be inserted into data path logic in order to minimize the <b>scan</b> <b>path</b> overhead.

Cheng and Yao (2001) found that the forced cooling can significantly reduce the total forming time in a multi-pass laser bending process. They also found that the forced air cooling does not have any harmful effect on micro-structural and mechanical properties of the workpiece. Shen et al. (2011) studied the effect of forced cooling on laser bending of steel plates using finite element based numerical simulations. The forced cooling was applied either on top or bottom or on both the surfaces. It was moving simultaneously with laser beam by an offset of about one second. The forced cooling did not {{have a significant effect on}} the bend angle and edge effect. Chen et al. (2004) observed that in a curvilinear laser bending, the deformation occurs on one side of the laser <b>scanning</b> <b>path</b> along which the rigid constraint is lower. Zhang et al.

However, following the response modulation hypothesis psychopathic individuals are capable of adequate emotional responsiveness when the affective information is their primary attentional focus. This study aims to explore this latter hypothesis by examining the <b>scan</b> <b>paths</b> of individuals with psychopathic traits. More specifically, we will explore whether students with higher psychopathy scores have different <b>scan</b> <b>paths</b> when detecting facial emotion expressions compared to students with lower scores on that psychopathy scale. Twenty first-year students will be selected on psychopathic traits based on an initial screening using the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale III. Ten higher and ten lower scoring individuals will complete the UNSW Facial Emotion Task. They are instructed to recognize the emotions of sets of facial expressions on a computer monitor. During this task their <b>scan</b> <b>paths</b> will be registered by means of eye-tracking The primary outcome measures are the order in which different facial cues are inspected and the time devoted to these cues. Secondary outcome measures include response time and response accuracy in the emotion recognition task. If the response modulation hypothesis is correct, then students with similar allocations of attention to facial cues (as measured in the <b>scan</b> <b>paths)</b> should exhibit similar responses in the emotion recognition task. Differences between psychopathy groups on the latter task should be correlated with differences in <b>scan</b> <b>paths.</b> If this is confirmed, the next step will be to measure emotion recognition while selectively manipulating allocation of attention to facial cues. The latter will be accomplished by using a moving window-moving mask paradigm to force/prevent the processing of specific cues by different psychopathy groups...|$|R

A detailed assessment of K. 's face-processing skills showed a deficit in structural encoding, most pronounced in the processing of facial features within the face. In addition, eye movement recordings revealed that K.

Following multiple baseline assessments, training focused on teaching K. to reliably recognize a set of familiar face photographs by directing visual attention to specific characteristics of the internal features of each face. The training significantly improved K. 's ability to recognize the target faces, with her performance being flawless immediately after training as well as at a follow-up assessment 1 month later.
