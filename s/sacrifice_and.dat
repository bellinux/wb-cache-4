5|$|A forced {{variation}} {{that involves}} a <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> usually {{results in a}} tangible gain is called a combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E

The heterodox offerings of Panchamakara– wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and coitus– along with {{mainstream}} offerings such as flowers, light, incense, etc., are prescribed for her worship. A fire <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> repetition of her stotra (hymn of praise) or her nama-stotra (name-hymn) are also prescribed in her worship. The Shakta Pramoda has her sahasranama (thousand name-hymn) {{as well as a}} compilation of her 108 names in a hymn.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{opened by}} British Field Marshal Earl Haig in 1925, the {{memorial}} site {{is one of}} only two National Historic Sites of Canada located outside of Canada.

As a result, it has become a Newfoundland symbol of <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> a source of identity.|$|E

Each Veda has been subclassified into four major text types - the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, <b>sacrifices</b> <b>and</b> symbolic-sacrifices), the Brahmanas (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies <b>and</b> <b>sacrifices),</b> <b>and</b> the Upanishads (text {{discussing}} meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge).|$|R

5|$|There {{also are}} various altars and sculptures used as {{decoration}} in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff {{compared to the}} naturalistic grace {{of the art of}} some other Maya sites.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1919, the Commission {{had spent}} £7,500, and this figure rose to £250,000 in 1920 as {{construction}} of cemeteries and memorials increased. By 1921, the Commission had established 1,000cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections, and burials. Between 1920 and 1923, the Commission was shipping 4,000headstones a week to France. In many cases, the Commission closed small cemeteries and concentrated the graves into larger ones. By 1927, when the majority of construction had been completed, over 500cemeteries had been built, with 400,000headstones, a thousand Crosses of <b>Sacrifice,</b> <b>and</b> 400 Stones of Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human <b>sacrifice,</b> <b>and</b> religious ritual.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Drava spent six days shelling airfields near Mohács in Hungary and fought off a small flotilla of Hungarian gunboats. On 12 April, she {{was attacked by}} Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of the Luftwaffe. The anti-aircraft gunners on the ship claimed three enemy aircraft, but nine of the Stukas scored hits. Most of these had little effect, but the last bomb dropped straight down Dravas funnel and exploded in her engine room, killing 54 of the crew, including her captain, Aleksandar Berić. Only 13 of the crew survived. She was raised and scrapped by Hungary during their occupation of parts of Yugoslavia. Berić was posthumously awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star for his <b>sacrifice,</b> <b>and</b> {{the base of the}} Serbian River Flotilla at Novi Sad is named after him.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E
5|$|Hubert is Asbel's younger brother. He is fostered {{into the}} Oswell family to secure Asbel's {{succession}} to Lord. Hubert resents Asbel for deserting Lhant, perceiving the act as spiting his <b>sacrifice,</b> <b>and</b> his parents for abandoning him. He overcomes his anger when he reunites {{with his family}} seven years later. Due to his capabilities, he is appointed the lieutenant of the Strahta military. He is voiced by Mikako Takahashi {{as a child and}} Takahiro Mizushima as an adult. In the English dub, he is voiced by Steve Staley. Hubert ranked on the fifth Tales character popularity poll and fell from the rankings afterwards. He makes a cameo in Tales of Hearts R dressed as the Sony mascot Kuro.|$|E

During each month as a man, Ila turned to pious ways and performed austerities under the guidance of Budha. In the ninth month, Ilā gave birth to Pururavas, who grew to become the first king of the Lunar dynasty. Then, as per the advice of Budha and Ila's father Kardama, Ila pleased Shiva with a horse <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> Shiva restored Ila's masculinity permanently.|$|E

5|$|The Maya civilization {{developed}} {{within the}} Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers {{a region that}} spreads from northern Mexico southwards into Central America. Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide. The Mesoamerican area {{gave rise to a}} series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems. The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human <b>sacrifice,</b> <b>and</b> a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{demolished}} by 30 September 1937 {{for the construction}} of Via della Conciliazione. Its art was given to the Capitolo di San Pietro and then to the Museo Petriano; some chapel frescoes are on display at the Museo di Roma. Elements of the facade, including the 17th-century travertino portal decorated with cherubs, are in the comune storehouse at the Bastione Ardeatino. The two relics (of Isaac's <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> the presentation of Jesus in the temple) were placed in the church of the Santi Michele e Magno, the national church of the Dutch in Borgo, during the early 1990s; the latter is now the church's main altar.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} <b>sacrifice</b> <b>and</b> deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E
