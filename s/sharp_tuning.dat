40|$|It is {{well known}} that failure to treat severe {{congenital}} hypothyroidism leads to profound auditory disability, and {{it has been suggested that}} an intracochlear defect, or defects, associated with the condition diminishes the efficacy of an active, physiologically vulnerable nonlinear transduction process commonly referred to as cochlear amplification. We address this question directly by tracking the development of threshold–frequency (tuning) curves and two-tone suppression in hypothyroid, Tshr mutant mice born to hypothyroid dams and comparing those findings with findings observed in euthyroid mice. Like <b>sharp</b> <b>tuning,</b> two-tone suppression is a product of transduction nonlinearity and is a useful indicator of the functional status of cochlear amplification. In contrast to euthyroid mice that acquire <b>sharp</b> <b>tuning,</b> normal two-tone suppression, and adultlike sensitivity by the end of the third postnatal week, as shown in earlier studies, hypothyroid mice remained grossly insensitive to sound throughout life. In addition, tuning was generally broad in hypothyroid mice, tuning curve “tips” were frequently missing, and two-tone suppression was rarely observed. However, unlike tip thresholds, tuning curve “tail” thresholds, a feature that reflects the functional status of passive elements of transduction, acquired normal values over a roughly 2 -month postnatal time period. These observations collectively suggest that active transduction micromechanics, at least in the frequency region studied here, are profoundly affected by thyroid hormone and support speculation that abnormal outer hair cell function may be the cause of the primary, enduring peripheral auditory defect associated with profound, congenital hypothyroidism in the Tshr mutant mouse...|$|E
40|$|The {{sharpness}} of cochlear frequency tuning in humans is debated. Evoked otoacoustic emissions and psychophysical measurements suggest <b>sharper</b> <b>tuning</b> in humans than in laboratory animals [15], {{but this is}} disputed based on comparisons of behavioral and electrophysiological measurements across species [14].

We compare our results to data obtained with the same paradigm in cat and chinchilla [16], and find that CAP-Q 10 values in human are ~ 1. 6 x higher than in cat and chinchilla and ~ 1. 3 x higher than in monkey. To estimate frequency tuning of single auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) in humans, we derive conversion functions from ANFs in cat, chinchilla, and monkey and apply these to the human CAP measurements.

The Mexican hat profile of connectivity which they assume leads to a more broadly tuned inhibition, which suppresses the mean, and to a <b>sharper</b> <b>tuning</b> of excitatory input, which amplifies the modulation.

40|$|In the {{mustache}} bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus), {{the cochlear}} microphonic (CM) recorded from {{the round window}} is sharply tuned at 61 kHz and shows a prominent transient response to a tone burst at about 61 kHz (i. e. its amplitude increases exponentially {{at the onset of}} the stimulus and decreases at its cessation). In terms of the time constant (I-I + 0 - 3 ms) and the resonance frequency (6 I*I + 0 - 43 kHz) of this transient response, the Q of this system, assumed to correspond to a second-order filter, is 204 + 57. Peripheral neurones sensitive to 61 kHz have a very sharp excitatory area (or tuning curve). The Q of a tuning curve markedly increases with the rise in best frequency up to 61 kHz and decreases beyond 61 kHz. The Q value of a single neurone with best frequencies between 60 - 76 and 61 - 75 kHz is 210189. If the assumption that the CM is directly related to the mechanical motion of the basilar membrane is correct, the very <b>sharp</b> <b>tuning</b> curves of single neurones at about 61 kHz could be simply due to the mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane. Since this animal predominantly uses a 61 kHz sound for echolocation and peripheral auditory neurones show a low threshold and extremely <b>sharp</b> <b>tuning</b> at about 61 kHz, its peripheral auditory system is specialized for the reception and fine-frequency analysis of the principle component of orientation sounds and echoes. Sharply tuned neurones can code a frequency modulation as small as o-oi%, so that the wing beat of an insect would be easily coded by them. Unlike the CM, Nx is tuned at 64 kHz. This difference in best frequency is simply due to the properties of a sharply tuned resonator and Nlt and not due to a mechanism comparable to lateral inhibition...|$|E

The tectorial membrane (TM) of the mutants lacks striated-sheet matrix, {{which is likely}} to decrease longitudinal elastic coupling. Mechanical and neural tuning curves recorded in mutants are slightly less sensitive, although more sharply tuned.

New behavioral measurements designed to minimize the influence of nonlinear effects such as suppression agree with the emission-based values.

40|$|SummaryThe {{organization}} of {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) into functional maps makes individual cells operate {{in a variety of}} contexts.

We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much <b>sharper</b> <b>tuning.</b> Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells.
