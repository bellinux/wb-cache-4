What the Dog Saw bundles together Gladwell's favourite articles from The New Yorker since {{he joined the}} magazine as a staff writer in 1996.

25|$|The manorial records offer a good {{opportunity}} to study the geographical distribution of the plague. Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England, though a place like East Anglia, which had frequent contact with the Continent, was severely affected. On a local level, however, there were great variations. A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population. The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality, since the rolls only record the heads of households, normally an adult male. Here the IPMs <b>show</b> <b>us</b> that the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly.|$|E

500|$|To the English {{artist and}} critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who {{did as he}} thought best [...] "with {{complete}} indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public". Fry described El Greco as [...] "an old master who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the way".|$|E

500|$|Andre Dellamorte of Collider called Item 47 [...] "silly". William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> everything that it wants to - we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an article}} {{analyzing}} Collins's {{relationship with his}} fanbase, Middlebury College Assistant Professor Louisa Ellen Stein argued that GISHWHES was a [...] "co-authored transmedia experience" [...] that [...] "play with [...] power, erotics, and [...] emotional excess present in Collins' fandom." [...] Citing participants' independent efforts to coordinate teams {{using a variety of}} online platforms, Stein suggested that [...] "GISHWHES may lack the overt language of industrial reconfiguration found in the Divine Kickstarter Project [...] But through its satire and dadaist play, it more fully models the potential for a congregation of authors, both official and unofficial, to direct fannish and creative investment into digital participation." [...] Stein further argued that [...] "decentralized projects like Gishwhes, with creators who fully immerse themselves in the surrounding digital cultures, <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the potential for future transmedia creative authorship in millennial culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Close-Up, for example, {{contains}} {{scenes from}} the real-life trial of a man charged with fraudulently impersonating a film director. To make the film, however, Kiarostami coaxed the antagonists to re-stage scenes occurring between them, including the arrest. While such a technique clearly precludes labeling the film as a documentary, by re-staging events between the deceiver and the deceived Kiarostami implicitly poses questions about the validity and significance of what the audience sees. Because these are the actual participants in a drama played out in criminal court, it dawns on the audience that these re-stagings {{are also part of}} the real life of these people, especially since both the impersonator and the family he fooled were interested in working in cinema. If these re-enactments constitute a kind of [...] "evidence", this is less because they <b>show</b> <b>us</b> what took place to cause the arrest than because the audience is witness to a scene in which the actors are in fact continuing the story of their confrontation and/or reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|The villain in the story, Mad Wayne, {{had been}} dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses. Carter elaborated, [...] "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, {{this is what}} I was {{interested}} in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction {{in a moment of}} a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, {{has to do with the}} character Wayne." [...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E

500|$|Advertisements {{are used}} to attract {{customers}} to a business’ products or services. In doing so, they are also making statements regarding race, social class, gender, values, and [...] family. They not only describe these social categories, they prescribe behaviors or show one {{how it is that}} they should act in accordance with social ideals or norms. According to Belk and Pollay, “not only do [...] <b>show</b> <b>us</b> the ideal life, they instruct us [...] how to live.” Through targeting specific groups of people for products and services, advertisements both reflect changes of social norms and are changers of social norms regarding acceptable behavior. Some argue that the image of family only plays a symbolic role by reflecting the current cultural values. Advertisements may not only reflect changes in social norms, but also be asserting that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, sociologists have challenged the public to study ads containing images of the family not just as marketing messages but also as vehicles for behavior and attitudes towards society.|$|E
500|$|R.E.M.'s early {{breakthrough}} success {{served as}} an inspiration for other alternative bands. Spin referred to the [...] "R.E.M. model"—career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. Spin's Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, [...] "They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd {{figured out how to}} buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream." [...] Steve Wynn of Dream Syndicate said, [...] "They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was Sonic Youth or the Replacements or Nirvana or Butthole Surfers. R.E.M. staked the claim. Musically, the bands did different things, but R.E.M. was first to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> you can be big and still be cool." [...] Biographer David Buckley stated that between 1991 and 1994, a period that saw the band sell an estimated 30 million albums, R.E.M. [...] "asserted themselves as rivals to U2 for the title of biggest rock band in the world." [...] Over the course of its career, the band has sold over 85 million records worldwide.|$|E
500|$|In Interstellar, Nolan {{explored}} {{the laws of}} physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. Reality is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M. Dawson of Left Field Cinema noted that the existential crisis of conflicted male figures [...] "struggling with the slippery nature of identity" [...] is a prevalent theme in Nolan's work. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than {{the way in which we}} absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. [...] "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found." [...] According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these [...] "created realities" [...] also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, [...] "They <b>show</b> <b>us</b> how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray." [...] McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. He has also noted that retroactive causality populates many of Nolan's films.|$|E

500|$|One of Aden's {{most notable}} storylines {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles {{to cope with the}} sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the [...] "taboo issue". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline [...] "one hundred percent justice" [...] because there are people, [...] "more than we probably realise" [...] in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic. Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though [...] "the huge rebellion years" [...] and the subsequent attempts to [...] "reconnect with those people who had betrayed you." [...] Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used [...] "haunting" [...] techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to <b>show</b> <b>US</b> agents his acting abilities.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>Show</b> <b>us</b> {{what you can}} do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
