The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze natural cold pressed oils as potential cosmetic products. Material and methods. Cold pressed oils obtained from selected seeds and fruit stones were analyzed, including: chokeberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> blackcurrant <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> elderberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> raspberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> apricot <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> tomato <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> strawberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> broccoli <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Nigella sativa <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> hemp <b>oil,</b> safflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Silybum marianum <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and coconut oil. 80 adult volunteers assessed the cosmetic properties of the analyzed oils. Each of the volunteers tested 2 to 4 different oils, by applying them on the skin. In addition, patch tests with all analyzed oils were performed on 23 individuals. Results. The majority of tested oils were positively evaluated by the participants: in the opinion of the participants, oil extracted from safflower had the best appearance (100 % positive opinions), coconut oil had the best smell (70 % positive opinions), while black currant <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> showed the best absorbency (85 % positive opinions). No irritation was observed within the analyzed product group, albeit one allergic reaction to apricot <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was observed with patch testing. Conclusions. Based on the achieved results, it could be suggested that natural cold pressed oils can be applied to the skin as cosmetics.

40|$|Background: Studies of the biogeographic {{distribution}} of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants are fundamental {{to understanding the}} mechanisms of adaptive evolution in plants as <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is the primary energy source needed for germination and establishment of plants. However, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content as an adaptive trait in plants is poorly understood. Here, we examine the adaptive nature of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in 168 angiosperm families occurring in different biomes across the world. We also explore the role of multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition in plant adaptation in a phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic context. Result: It was observed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in tropical plants (28. 4 %) {{was significantly higher than}} the temperate plants (24. 6 %). A significant relationship between oil content and latitude was observed in three families Papaveraceae, Sapindaceae and Sapotaceae indicating that selective forces correlated with latitude influence <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content. Evaluation of the response of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition to latitude and the correlation between <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition showed that multiple <b>seed</b> traits, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition contribute towards plant adaptation. Investigation of {{the presence or absence of}} phylogenetic signals across 168 angiosperm families in 62 clades revealed that members of seven clades evolved to have high or low <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content independently as they did not share a common evolutionary path. Conclusion: The study provides us an insight into the biogeographical distribution and the adaptive role of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants. The study indicates that multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and the fatty acid composition of the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> determine the fitness of the plants and validate the adaptive hypothesis that <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> quantity and quality are crucial to plant adaptation...|$|R

The fatty acid (FA) composition {{was determined by}} GC-FID analysis after transesterification into the corresponding methyl esters. α-Linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) was the main unsaturated fatty acid in flax <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (56. 2 % of total FA), oleic acid (C 18 : 1) dominated in rapeseed and sesame <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> (65. 3 and 43 % of total FA, respectively), and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) was the dominant compound in sunflower and pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> (59. 2 and 59. 5 % of total FA, respectively). The volatile flavour compounds were determined using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) using a DVB/Carboxen/PDMS fibre, coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In total 97 volatile compounds were detected revealing a very complex aroma profile of the oils, composed of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes, esters, furans, pyrazines, sulphur compounds and terpenes. Among them, aldehydes presented the highest proportion of the overall volatiles in rapeseed oil (76. 8 % of the total volatiles), followed by sesame <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (25 % of the total volatiles), pumpkin seed (5. 45 % of the total volatiles), flax <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (2. 5 % of the total volatiles) and sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (0. 95 % of the total volatiles).

40|$|ABSTRACTThe pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> {{obtained}} from Cucurbita pepo {{has been shown}} to be useful for the treatment of nocturia in patients with urinal disorders in several western countries. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> from Cucurbita maxima on urinary dysfunction in human overactive bladder (OAB). Forty-five subjects were enrolled in this study. An extract of pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> from C. maxima (10 g of oil/day) was orally administrated for 12 weeks. After 6 and 12 weeks, urinary function was evaluated using Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). Pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> from C. maxima significantly reduced the degree of OABSS in the subjects. The results from our study suggest that pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> extracts from C. maxima as well as from C. pepo are effective for urinary disorders such as OAB in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{formulation}} of omega- 3 emulsion using rubber (Hevea Brasiliensis) <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> {{based on the}} best performance of the emulsion in terms of higher viscosity, smaller droplet size, lower moisture content and slightly acidic pH value supported by degree of creaming in varying the type and composition of emulsifier used. Rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> contains significant value of alpha-linolenic acid which {{plays an important role}} in maintaining human health. Therefore, {{formulation of}} rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion is important to become a new source of omega- 3 emulsion instead of fish <b>oil.</b> Rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was mixed with distilled water and nonionic emulsifier which were lecithin and span 80 by homogenizer. From the analysis conducted, the best formulation was the emulsion with 50 % of distilled water, 6 % of lecithin and 47 % of rubber <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeeds of Nigella sativa L. (black cumin {{or black}} seeds) {{are widely used}} in {{traditional}} Islamic medicine and for culinary purposes worldwide. Nigella <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is becoming popular {{in and out of}} the Islamic world. Composition of Nigella <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is known to be location-dependent. We investigated the composition of Nigella <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> prepared by solvent- or cold press-extraction of Nigella seeds grown in Morocco. Oil extraction yield was 37 % and 27 % when solvent or cold press extraction methods were used, respectively. In terms of oil major components, composition of Nigella <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> from Morocco is similar to that from other Mediterranean countries known for their Nigella seed-oil quality...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted {{for a period}} of 28 days to observe the effect of plant extracts on recovery of fish diseases. The {{experiment was}} carried out in mini pond (1. 75 decimal) behind the Fisheries Faculty in BAU, Mymensingh. Twelve hapas (3 × 2 × 1. 5 sq. ft.) and five studies were conducted with control hapa with 3 treatments and two replicates each. Four medicinal plant products were collected and prepared. In study 1 fishes were treated with Neem <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil,</b> study 2 with Kalojira <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil,</b> study 3 with Neem Leaf Extract, study 4 with Mahogoni <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> and the control hapa was provided with normal feed. The treatments were practiced as 2 ml, 4 ml and 6 ml per kg feed. At the beginning of the experiment, fishes had red spots on dorsal and caudal region, scale missing, large abrasions and black to grayish spots. In Kalojira <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> (study 2) treated fish, spots and lesions were totally recovered in T 2 and T 3 whereas in T 1 there were traces spots {{at the end of the}} experiment. However, in Neem <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> and Neem Leaf fine extract treated fish (study 1 and study 3), injury, abrasions and lesions were almost healed up in T 3 (6 ml/kg feed) and moderate recovery in T 2 and T 1. In Mahogoni <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> (study 4) treated fish, ulcers and lesions were reduced in size but existed distinctly in all the treatments at the end of the experiment. In control study (study 5) injury and abrasions had no recovery but remained almost similar till the end of experiment. Thus it was found that Kalojira <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> performed best recovery (90 - 95 %) followed by Neem <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> (78 - 84 %), Neem Leaf fine extract (70 - 75 %) and poor performance was observed with Mahogoni <b>Seed</b> <b>Oil</b> extract (35 - 40 %). So, kalojira <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was the best performed herb and T 3 (6 ml/kg feed) was the best dose followed by T 1 and T 2...|$|R
