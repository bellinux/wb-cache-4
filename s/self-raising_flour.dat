60|$|He {{went down}} to the Reese River mines about that time and {{presently}} he lost an election bet in his mining camp, and by the terms of it he was obliged to buy a fifty-pound sack of <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> and carry it through the town, preceded by music, and deliver it to the winner of the bet. Of course the whole camp was present and full of fluid and enthusiasm. The winner of the bet put up the sack at auction {{for the benefit of the}} United States Sanitary Fund, and sold it. The excitement grew and grew. The sack was sold over and over again for the benefit of the Fund. The news of it came to Virginia City by telegraph. It produced great enthusiasm, and Reuel Gridley was begged by telegraph to bring the sack and have an auction in Virginia City. He brought it. An open barouche was provided, also a brass band. The sack was sold over and over again at Gold Hill, then was brought up to Virginia City toward night and sold--and sold again, and again, and still again, netting twenty or thirty thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Gridley carried it across California and sold it at various towns. He sold it for large sums in Sacramento and in San Francisco. He brought it East, sold it in New York and in various other cities, then carried it out to a great Fair at St. Louis, and went on selling it; and finally made it up into small cakes and sold those at a dollar apiece. First and last, the sack of flour which had originally cost ten dollars, perhaps, netted more than two hundred thousand dollars for the Sanitary Fund. Reuel Gridley has been dead these many, many years--it is the old story.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Bell reputedly {{developed}} the world's first <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> in Longhorsley village shop. Bell founded a wholesale grocery business near the Tyne Quays in Newcastle in the 1880s. One {{of his best}} selling brands was a <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> he called Bell's Royal. A common misconception is that Bell's Royal became Be-Ro because {{after the death of}} King Edward VII it became illegal to use the name Royal. Indeed, it was because an American company, trading under the name of Royal's Baking Powder, was too similar to the Bell's Royal name that it was changed. The Be-Ro trade mark patent was filed in 1906 whereas King Edward VII died on 6 May 1910. The name Be-Ro, chosen by Thomas Bells' wife, had been existence a decade before the trade mark was applied for, and registered, under the Trade Marks Act of 1905.|$|E

50|$|The Company {{was founded}} by Thomas Bell as a grocery and tea company in Longhorsley north of Newcastle in 1875. Thomas had experimented with rising agents on flour in baking and from that {{produced}} the world's first <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour.</b> He founded the Bells Royal works which sold the Bell's Royal Flour. Following the death of Edward VII, Bell decided to merge Bell and Royal into one word which is where Be-Ro came from. Thomas Bell started {{in his own right}} in small premises in the yard of the Black Boy Hotel adjoining the Groat Market in the centre of Newcastle. As well as manufacturing baking powder and <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> he produced a health salt which he later discontinued. He also packed and marketed dried fruit, cereals, tea and coffee using such names as T.B. Royalty, Black Diamond and Belsun. He registered the Be-Ro name under the Trade Marks Act 1905.|$|E
50|$|They are {{commonly}} {{made from a}} mixture of golden syrup, flour, ginger, cream, sugar, butter and lemon juice. A variation on the recipe included bicarbonate of soda, egg and <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> instead. The snaps are cooked on a moderate heat and are baked briefly as a flat disc that is then rolled while still hot and soft. The whipped cream can be sweetened with brandy or vanilla.|$|E
5000|$|A sweet {{fruit and}} nut bread eaten at Christmas time. The term pan dulce means [...] "sweet bread" [...] in Spanish, but its origins {{may lie in}} Italy with the Genoese pandolce or Portuguese sweet bread. Its main {{ingredients}} can include lard, margarine, sugar, <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour,</b> blanched almonds, raisins, sultanas, pine nuts, candied peel, eggs, aniseed and anisette among others. It is sometimes decorated with hundreds and thousands just like the bollo de hornasso.|$|E
50|$|Jones {{was born}} in Monmouth, Wales and {{established}} a bakery in Broadmead, Bristol. He was granted a patent for <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> in 1845, {{and by the end}} of 1846 its runaway success led to him being appointed purveyor of patent flour and biscuits to Queen Victoria. He was granted a patent in the USA on 1 May 1849, and in 1852 the first gold medal for the new flour was issued to a Chicago firm using the Bristol formula.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{technique}} for leavening bread {{is the use}} of gas-producing chemicals. There are two common methods. The first is to use baking powder or a <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> that includes baking powder. The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as buttermilk and add baking soda; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas. Chemically leavened breads are called quick breads and soda breads. This method is commonly used to make muffins, pancakes, American-style biscuits, and quick breads such as banana bread.|$|E
50|$|A {{sweet and}} dry bread {{similar to the}} Spanish hornazo. It is made with <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour,</b> sugar, eggs, butter or {{margarine}} and aniseed. Bollos de hornasso are eaten around Easter just as in Spain, but in Gibraltar they are also popular during Christmas. Gibraltarian hornassos can normally be distinguished from the original Spanish hornazo as they do not tend to be decorated with hard-boiled eggs (however, Gibraltarian families of Spanish descent may still decorate them in this manner). It usually glazed with beaten egg and sometimes decorated with hundreds and thousands.|$|E
5000|$|At {{one time}} the wheat came into London Docks and then was {{transferred}} to 100 ton sailing barges which would then take it to Whitstable. Then it was transferred to special wagons and sent by rail to the mill siding. The siding was taken away and then the wheat was brought in by road.Two of the most well known patent brands of flour were [...] "Emazone", a <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour,</b> probably named after an Emma Pledge, and [...] "Manna", a 100% wholemeal bread flour ground on the millstones at East Hill mill.|$|E
50|$|The {{bread is}} made by mixing flour (either white or self raising), yeast (if not using <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour),</b> butter, mixed dried fruit (such as raisins, {{currants}} and sultanas), mixed spices and an egg. Some recipes favour soaking the dried fruit in tea overnight before the baking. This mixture is then proven to allow fermentation to take place. After an initial period, the air is knocked out of the mixture and it is allowed to prove once more. This period of preparation {{can take up to}} two hours, including the resting time for the bread mixture. It is then baked in an oven. Bara brith is traditionally served at tea time, alongside tea. It is normally sliced with butter spread on one side.|$|E
5000|$|Bara brith, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "speckled bread" [...] (the literal {{meaning of the}} original Welsh-language name), can be either a yeast bread enriched with dried fruit or made with <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> (no yeast). It is traditionally flavoured with tea, dried fruits and mixed spices, and is served sliced and buttered at tea time. A decrease in popularity of it led to supermarket Morrisons removing it from their shelves in 2006, {{and a year later}} a survey showed that 85% of teenagers in the UK had never tried it. It has been subsequently championed by celebrity chefs such as Bryn Williams, and is known to be favoured by Charles, Prince of Wales. Several variations on bara brith have been made, including changing it into a chocolate and into ice-cream.|$|E
5000|$|Rank {{was born}} on 22 or 23 December 1888 at Kingston upon Hull in England into a Victorian family environment, which was {{dominated}} by his father Joseph Rank who had built a substantial flour milling business. He was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. Joseph {{is reported to have}} told his son Arthur that he was [...] "a dunce at school" [...] and that the only way that he could succeed in life would be in his father's flour mill. J. Arthur ventured on his own with Peterkins <b>Self-Raising</b> <b>Flour,</b> but when that business failed he returned to work for his father. That was the business (Joseph Rank Limited) that he later inherited and which became known as Rank Hovis McDougall (now owned by British food conglomerate Premier Foods).|$|E
50|$|Beer bread can be {{made with}} simply flour, beer, and sugar. Some bottled beers, {{especially}} craft beers, may intentionally have visible live, but dormant, yeast sediment {{at the bottom of the}} bottle. However, many mass market beers have the live yeast filtered out. Without sufficient leavening from the beer, a loaf of beer bread will be fairly dense and heavy unless an additional leavening agent, e.g., baking soda and/or baking powder, or baker's yeast and sugar, is added. <b>Self-raising</b> <b>flour</b> may be used because it is a mixture of flour and leavening agent. Beer bread without a leavening agent is very sturdy and tends not to lose moisture if it is overcooked. The only consequence of overcooking tends to be a thicker crust. Pre-packaged Beer Bread mixes may also be purchased with the dry ingredients and leavening agents already included.|$|E
50|$|Mustering is {{done with}} horses or {{vehicles}} including all-terrain vehicles (ATV), {{and some of the}} large cattle stations use helicopters or light aircraft to assist in the mustering and surveillance of livestock and their watering points. Cattle mustering in the Outback and the eastern ‘Falls’ country of the Great Dividing Range often necessitates days camping out in isolated areas and sleeping in a swag (bedroll) on the ground with limited food choices. Damper is a traditional type of bread that was baked by stockmen during colonial times, or nowadays when the bread supply has been exhausted. It is made with <b>self-raising</b> <b>flour,</b> salt and water and is usually cooked in a camp oven over the embers of a fire. In these areas the days in the saddle are often very long as the cattle have to be mustered and then driven to yards or a paddock where they can be held. After the stock have been yarded they may then require drafting prior to branding, shearing or whatever procedures are required or have been planned.|$|E
