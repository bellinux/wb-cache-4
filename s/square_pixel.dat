5000|$|This {{was arguably}} the world's first high-definition {{television}} system, and, by today's standards, {{it could be}} called 737i (as it had 737-lines active) with a maximum theoretical resolution of 408×368-line pairs (which in digital terms can be expressed as equivalent to 816×736 pixels) with a 4:3 aspect ratio (and thus a slightly wide effective [...] "pixel aspect ratio" [...] of 6:5, <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> recording needing approx 980x736 instead). It was used only in France by TF1, and in Monaco by Tele Monte Carlo. However, the theoretical picture quality far exceeded {{the capabilities of the}} equipment of its time, and each 819-line channel occupied a wide 14 MHz of VHF bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|A {{radiometer}} was {{on board}} ATS-6, {{mounted on the}} earth-facing panel. This instrument was (for the time) of very high resolution. It operated on two channels: infra-red (10.5 to 12.5 µm) and visible light (0.55 to 0.75 µm). Images taken with the radiometer covered the whole earth disk, with a resolution of 1,200 lines of 2,400 pixels each (11 km <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> in infra-red, and 5.5 km square in visible light). The IR detector was passively cooled at 115K, and the visible light detector maintained at 300K. A complete image of earth's disk was transmitted to ground every 25 minutes. Several hundreds images were taken and transmitted, until a mechanical component of the radiometer failed, {{two and a half}} months after launch.|$|E
50|$|Many {{display and}} image-acquisition systems are, for various reasons, {{not capable of}} {{displaying}} or sensing the different color channels at the same site. Therefore, the pixel grid is divided into single-color regions {{that contribute to the}} displayed or sensed color when viewed at a distance. In some displays, such as LCD, LED, and plasma displays, these single-color regions are separately addressable elements, which have {{come to be known as}} subpixels. For example, LCDs typically divide each pixel vertically into three subpixels. When the <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> is divided into three subpixels, each subpixel is necessarily rectangular. In display industry terminology, subpixels are often referred to as pixels, as they are the basic addressable elements in a viewpoint of hardware, and hence pixel circuits rather than subpixel circuits is used.|$|E

Anamorphic DVD transfers store the information as 5:4 (PAL) or 3:2 (NTSC) <b>square</b> <b>pixels,</b> which is set to expand to either 16:9 or 4:3, which the television or video player handles. For example, a PAL DVD with a full frame image may contain a video resolution of 720×576 (5:4 ratio), but a video player software will stretch this to 1024×576 <b>square</b> <b>pixels</b> with a 16:9 flag in order to recreate the correct aspect ratio.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{the diamond}} pixels {{used on the}} DLP {{projection}} system provide some unusual benefits/tradeoffs. In a nutshell, the diamond pixels make computer graphics at native resolution a more [...] "grainy" [...] (by a tiny amount) at native resolution but, at compressed resolutions, much better than compression on a <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> grid. Movies displayed at native resolution have no noticeable difference, but movies at 1080p are exceptionally accurate (for not being [...] "true" [...] 1080p). When projecting a 1920x1080 sized computer graphical user interface (GUI), the text remains readable and is overall surprisingly faithful to what a full 1080p display would produce. The diamond pixel layout achieves this effect using a property of human vision and recognition similar in spirit, although not mathematically, to the psychoacoustics used to compress MP3s. No wobulation is used; this effect is purely enabled by {{the shape of the}} pixel.|$|E
5000|$|Another variant, {{called the}} W Quad, uses a {{checkerboard}} with 4 subpixels per pixel, adding a white subpixel, or more specifically, replacing {{one of the}} green subpixels of Bayer filter Pattern with a white subpixel, to increase the contrast and reduce the energy needed to illuminate white pixels (because colour filters in classic [...] striped panels absorb more than 65% of the total white light used to illuminate the panel). As each subpixel is a square instead of a thin rectangle, this also increases the aperture with the same average subpixel density, and same pixel density along both axis. As the horizontal density is reduced and the vertical density remains identical (for the same <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> density), it becomes possible to increase the pixel density of about 33%, while maintaining the contrast comparable to classic [...] or [...] panels, taking profit of the more efficient use of light and lowered absorption levels by the colour filters.|$|E
5000|$|Some recent TV and {{computer}} displays {{are starting to}} include yellow as a fourth primary color, often in a four-point <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> area, so as to achieve brighter pure yellows and a larger color gamut. Even the four-primary technology does not yet reach the range of colors that the human eye can see from light reflected by illuminated surfaces (as defined by the sample-based estimate called the Pointer Gamut), with 4-primary LED prototypes providing typically about 87% and 5-primary prototypes about 95%. Several firms, including Samsung and Mitsubishi, have demonstrated LED displays with five or six [...] "primaries", or color LED point light sources per pixel. [...] A recent academic literature review claims a gamut of 99% can be achieved with 5-primary LED technology. While technology for achieving a wider gamut appears to be within reach, other issues remain; for example, affordability, dynamic range, and brilliance. In addition, there exists hardly any source material recorded in this wider gamut, nor is it currently possible to recover this information from existing visual media. Regardless, industry is still exploring {{a wide variety of}} [...] "primary" [...] active light sources (per pixel) with the goal of matching the capability of human color perception within a broadly affordable price. One example of a potentially affordable but yet unproven active light hybrid places an LED screen over a plasma light screen, each with different [...] "primaries".|$|E

40|$|The {{square and}} {{rectangular}} {{shape of the}} pixels in the digital images for sensing and display purposes introduces several inaccuracies in the representation of digital images. The major disadvantage of <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> shapes is the inability to accurately capture and display the details in the objects having variable orientations to edges, shapes and regions.

40|$|Today is {{the world}} of digital imaging which is used in many {{applications}} like forensic imaging, medical imaging, computer graphics etc. The digital images are represented and stored {{in the form of}} <b>square</b> <b>pixel.</b> For most of the applications in image processing, the images are displayed using square pixels. The various improvements in technologies like CCD and increasing processing capabilities of graphic devices give arise to hexagon pixels which are becoming attractive for various practical applications. Hexagon pixel is advantageous over <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> because of its, higher sampling efficiency, equidistance, less aliasing effect, greater angular resolution, higher symmetry, consistent connectivity. Edge detection on spiral architecture has features of fast computation and accurate localization. In this paper, firstly picture quality of image using hexagonal pixel structure is reviewed.

40|$|In most {{applications}} of image processing data is collected and displayed in square pixels. Hexagonal pixels offer {{the advantage of}} greater rotational symmetry in addition to close packed structure and a nearly circular pixel. We compared the image quality of images using square pixels with that of images employing hexagonal pixels. The comparison was done using various images, each considering a different aspect of geometry (i. e., lines at different angles, curves, etc.). The <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> images were constructed using the average of a square area of smaller square pixels. Hexagonal pixel images were constructed using two techniques. The first one was called the “two-template approach”, wherein two different templates were {{used to create a}} close packed hexagonal image from smaller square pixels. The second approach was called the “sixneighbor approach ” which creates a rectangular template using the six neighbors of a hexagonal pixel. An Euclidean distance measure was used to compare the <b>square</b> <b>pixel</b> and hexagonal pixel images. A brief explanation of the algorithm and the results are provided in the paper. Based on our results obtained using the Euclidean distance as a quality measure, we conclude that contrary to our intuition and their widespread use in nature (retinas and ommatidia), hexagonal pixels do not offer any advantage over conventional square pixels...|$|E

We present experimental results on a pattern recognition task (face detection) over a large image database, using both square and hexagonal pixels. Comparison of the results in the two cases confirms the consistent performance of the generalised ranklets. ...|$|E
