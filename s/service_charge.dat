Following the tour, the band brought a lawsuit against Ticketmaster that accused them of being a monopoly whose anticompetitive practices allowed markup prices of more than 30%. The band's intention was to get ticket prices lowered for its fans. Pearl Jam's plans for a 1994 summer tour were cancelled {{as a result of}} a Ticketmaster boycott.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of the bank was devised by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, in 1694. The plan of 1691, which had been proposed by William Paterson three years before, had not then been acted upon. (It is worth noting though, that 28 years earlier, in 1636, Financier to the king Philip Burlamachi had proposed exactly the same idea in a letter addressed to Sir Francis Windebank.) He proposed a loan of £1.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The Royal Charter was granted on 27 July through {{the passage of the}} Tonnage Act 1694. Public finances were in such dire condition {{at the time that the}} terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> of £4,000 per annum for the management of the loan. The first governor was Sir John Houblon, who is depicted in the £50 note issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.|$|E
500|$|By 1994, Pearl Jam was [...] "fighting on all fronts", as its manager {{described}} the band at the time. Reporter Chuck Philips broke {{a series of}} stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas [...] in order to perform. Pearl Jam’s efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded {{that it was hard}} to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster’s exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, “The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.” ...|$|E

5000|$|As we have seen, if {{the banks}} were {{permitted}} to retain as earning assets what private and Government bonds and notes they now have as backing for their demands deposits, {{there would be no}} immediate change in the earnings of the banks. However, as business continued to increase, there would be greater demands for the services of commercial banks in the demand-deposit departments. The banks might then be pressed to find additional income to compensate them for the additional work required. They would presumably be able to obtain this income through <b>service</b> <b>charges.</b> According to the “Service Charge Survey of 1938” of the Bank Management Commission of the American Bankers Association, <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> are “a first essential to safe and sound banking.” In this Survey, an analysis of earnings from <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> in 1937 reveals that, while those <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> amounted to only 4.5 per cent of the total gross earnings of commercial banks, yet, in a number of instances, they actually made all the difference between profit and loss.
