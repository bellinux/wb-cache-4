If my brothers or whoever wants to come and work in government, they shouldn't be allowed to work in government. If you want {{to pass a law}} that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E

The government should do this for both gay couples and straight couples and, leave marriage {{in the hands of}} the Church and other religious entities.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasoning}} is increased activity leads to increased learning, {{which leads to}} lower costs, {{which can lead to}} lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. According to BCG, the most effective business strategy was one of striving for market dominance in this way. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was claimed that if you cannot get enough market share to be competitive, you <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that business and concentrate your resources where you can take advantage of experience effects and gain dominant market share. The BCG strategists developed product portfolio techniques like the BCG Matrix (in part) to manage this strategy.|$|E

25|$|Sambhāvanā (Hindi: सम्भावना, meaning Competency): Sambhāvanā or {{competency}} is vividly {{described in}} the first ten verses of the canto. Aṣṭāvakra is brimming with confidence as he approaches Mithilā. Mithilā is replete with scholars versed in the Vedas and all the six Āstika schools. The twelve-year olds Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu run into Janaka, who {{is on his way}} to the court. Janaka asks his guards to get the handicapped boy out of his way. Aṣṭāvakra responds by saying that Janaka <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his way instead, as he (Aṣṭāvakra) is a Brāhmaṇa versed in the scriptures. Pleased with his brilliance, Janaka tells Aṣṭāvakra that he is free to roam anywhere in Mithilā. However, Janaka's gatekeeper does not let Aṣṭāvakra into the court, and tells him that only the learned and wise elders deserve to be in Janaka's court. Aṣṭāvakra makes the gatekeeper speechless by his definition of elders – only those grown in knowledge are the elders. The gatekeeper now lets him into an assembly consisting of sages like Yājñavalkya, Gārgī and Maitreyī. Aṣṭāvakra openly challenges Bandī for a scriptural debate. Janaka asks Aṣṭāvakra to satisfy him first in debate, and poses him six cryptic questions, which Aṣṭāvakra answers convincingly. Janaka offers him Bandī, who knows within himself he will lose to Aṣṭāvakra, but decides to openly debate. Bandī mocks Aṣṭāvakra's deformities and the assembly laughs. Aṣṭāvakra chides both Bandī and the assembly and declares his intention to leave the assembly.|$|E
2500|$|Jurisdiction was a {{major issue}} for Farmer. The NLRA {{permitted}} the Board to exercise jurisdiction only over those businesses engaged in substantial interstate commerce. Farmer believed that the Board had interpreted [...] "interstate commerce" [...] and [...] "substantial" [...] far too broadly, and that the NLRB <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the business of regulating the labor relations of local small businesses. The appointment of Rodgers to the Board did not, however, give Farmer the majority he wanted. Farmer believed that the Act only covered businesses with 25 or more employees, while Rodgers believed that the Act reached only those businesses with large cash flows. Beeson was skeptical of both plans because he wanted employers to be protected by the Taft-Hartley Act, and felt that state labor law did not provide this level of protection.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{needs to}} {{know there is a}} degree of dissatisfaction among the public. I think people want to see that EastEnders is {{populated}} by many different ethnic groups. Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and that was such a wasted opportunity. My son said I <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> EastEnders because it wasn't doing me any good as an actress or as a black woman...I have got to speak out so that things can change." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} further that the {{appellant}} had taken no steps whatsoever {{to see that}} the animal did not <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its cage while he was engaged in repairing it. He must have foreseen the likelihood of the animal making an attack upon somebody <b>should</b> it <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cage. The court held, therefore, that the appellant had been rightly convicted.|$|R

I {{suppose you}} have a notion I <b>should</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way of that dirt," [...] said Captain MacWhirr, {{speaking}} with the utmost simplicity of manner and tone, and fixing the oilcloth {{on the floor with}} a heavy stare. Thus he noticed neither Jukes' discomfiture nor the mixture of vexation and astonished respect on his face.|$|R
2500|$|It was reported, however, {{that the}} rescue {{operation}} was [...] "chaotic". BBC journalist Zeesha Zafar reported that [...] "there were fewer rescue workers there than {{one would have}} expected. A majority of them {{were members of the}} anti-terrorism police. Most of them just stood around, gazing at the burning debris, and looking as though there was not much that they could do." [...] He stated that a police officer threatened to baton charge rescuers if they did not [...] "move quickly". Zafar reported that [...] "just when the rescuers were shuffling to get to work, a policeman in plain clothes announced that an army helicopter was coming in to pour water on the fire, and that everyone <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. The work stopped. The helicopter came, circled on the spot a couple of times, and went away. No water." [...] Zafar went on that it [...] "was distinctly obvious that there was no co-ordination between the workers of different departments such as the police, the rescue department, the Capital Development Authority and the military ... Rescuers operated in a chaotic manner, scouring through the debris that was not on fire ... During the two hours that I stayed at the scene, I saw rescuers collect three separate loads of body parts which they tied up in shrouds. There was no telling how many people they belonged to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese pursuit {{crossed the}} Mekong {{in the path}} of the fleeing Burmese on 24 July 1967, and marched south to Ban Khwan. After a {{preliminary}} skirmish, negotiations in the empty village began between the parties, with no result. A helicopter flew in from Ban Houayxay carrying the provincial RLA commander. He bore a message from General Ouane; both sides <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Laos. In return, Khun Sa's men received orders from him via radio to remain on station. The Nationalist Chinese demanded $250,000 as the price for their departure. A firefight between the Burmese and the Chinese followed on 29 July, using small arms, [...]50 caliber machine guns, 60mm mortars, and 57mm recoilless rifles. The following day at noon, as the fighting continued, six AT-28s of the Royal Lao Air Force bombed the battlefield. Unbeknown to the combatants, the Lao general had also received permission from Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma to fly the 2nd Paratroop Battalion to Ban Houayxay. From there they marched northward to block the southern exit from the battlefield. On the north side of Ban Khwan, a couple of RLA infantry battalions marched southward to block that egress. Two river patrol launches were sent to contest any crossing of the Mekong. As this occurred, the AT-28s from Luang Prabang struck four or five times daily for two days running, bombing both sides indiscriminately, men and mules alike.|$|E

6000|$|... "And what a fairy scene {{it was at}} the spread!" [...] said Mrs. Pasmer, {{turning to}} Boardman. She had already talked its splendours over with Mavering the same evening. [...] "I thought we <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Hall; but when we did <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window upon that tapestried platform, and down on the tennis-ground, with Turkey rugs to hide the bare spots in it--" [...] She stopped as people do when it is better to leave the effect to the listener's imagination.|$|R

60|$|This he said, but {{everybody}} knew {{he liked to}} go for his own pleasure too. So Harry would bring Grandpa his cane and hat, and away they would go down the crooked path through the field.

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} that, Peter," [...] cried the young man, gayly--"I should think all that. For one, I <b>should</b> choose to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. The path you travel is your own, and all wise men {{will leave you}} to journey along it in your own fashion." ...|$|R
