5000|$|There were {{needs to}} use a new more {{efficient}} communications protocol set and to make available a more efficient and reliable remote printer and display terminals. To satisfy such needs, IBM 3767 serial printer and IBM 3770 communications system (including a line printer) became available {{as part of the}} [...] "Advanced Communications Function" [...] (ACF) announcement which included the new <b>System</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Architecture</b> (SNA) and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) communications protocol set, followed by another announcement in July, 1975, which included IBM 3760 Data Entry Station and the new models of IBM 3270 display stations, and IBM 3790 communication system.|$|E
50|$|Prior to OSI, {{networking}} {{was largely}} either government-sponsored (ARPANET in the US, CYCLADES in France) or vendor-developed and proprietary standards (such as the <b>System</b> <b>network</b> <b>architecture</b> (SNA) of IBM and DECnet of Digital Equipment Corporation). An Experimental Packet Switched {{system in the}} UK circa 1973, also identified the need to define higher level protocols. The NCC (UK) publication 'Why Distributed Computing' which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. OSI was hence an industry effort, attempting to get industry participants to agree on common network standards to provide multi-vendor interoperability. It was common for large networks to support multiple network protocol suites, with many devices unable to interoperate with other devices {{because of a lack}} of common protocols. However, while OSI developed its networking standards, TCP/IP came into widespread use on multivendor networks for internetworking, while on the local network level both Ethernet and token ring gained prominence.|$|E

40|$|Panel {{discussion}} {{examines the}} numerous data networking technologies {{available in the}} early 1980 s and discusses why the TCP/IP approach, as implemented in the NSFNET, became the dominant form of internetworking by the 1990 s. IBM’s <b>System</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Architecture</b> (SNA) had originally dominated the commercial world; DECNET, from Digital Equipment Corp, was widely used in the scientific and research communities; and telephone companies and firms such as Tymnet and Telenet offered network-based computer access via X. 25. Other protocols, such as MMDF, RSCS and UUCP, were used to transfer electronic mail and files. In addition, a worldwide data networking standards activity, commonly known as OSI, was supported by {{almost all of the}} world’s governments (including the U. S.) and telephone companies. Thus the TCP/IP-based Internet did not develop in a clean-slate environment.

40|$|A power system, {{being one}} of the most complex {{distribution}} systems, consists of objects spread over the system with separate address spaces and remote method calls. In this paper, we will focus {{on one of the most}} important distributed object platforms, the CORBA. Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is an object-oriented standard for distributed object systems, which is implemented using the Object Request Broker (ORB) specification of the Object Management Architecture (OMA). CORBA architecture consists a client object, a server object, an IDL Stub, an IDL Skeleton and an ORB. CORBA makes the communication between these various components possible through the use of a method involving twelve steps of invocations. This paper aims to show how the process modelling of the CORBA invocations can be done in the OPNET environment. Then the designed model will be used to simulate switch-based multilevel power <b>system</b> <b>network</b> <b>architecture</b> with TCP and UDP protocols to clearly show the need for a trade-off mechanism between reliability and transmission delay constraints of a real-time power system communication networ...|$|E
