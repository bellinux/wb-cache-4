5000|$|Damask ( [...] ; دمشق) is a {{reversible}} {{figured fabric}} of silk, wool, linen, cotton, or synthetic fibres, with a pattern formed by weaving. Damasks are woven with one warp yarn and one weft yarn, usually with the pattern in warp-faced satin weave {{and the ground}} in weft-faced or <b>sateen</b> <b>weave.</b> Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.|$|E
50|$|Woven filters have a {{definite}} repeated pattern. Low energy cleaning {{methods such as}} shaking or reverse air allow for woven filters. Various weaving patterns such as plain weave, twill weave, or <b>sateen</b> <b>weave,</b> increase or decrease the amount of space between individual fibers. The size of the space affects the strength and permeability of the fabric. A tighter weave corresponds with low permeability and, therefore, more efficient capture of fine particles.|$|E
40|$|In this research, thermal {{and water}} vapor resistance, {{components}} of thermal comfort of 65 / 35 and 33 / 67 % polyester/ cotton (PES/CO) blend fabrics woven with 2 / 2 twill, matt twill, cellular and diced weaves, which {{are commonly used}} for clothing, were determined. The results indicate that both the fabric construction and the constituent fiber properties affect thermal comfort properties of clothing woven fabrics. Cellular weave, which is derivative of <b>sateen</b> <b>weave</b> and diced weave, which is compound weave, has the highest thermal resistance appropriating for cold climatic conditions. On the other hand, the 2 / 2 twill weave and matt twill weave, which is derivative of <b>sateen</b> <b>weave,</b> depicted the lowest water vapor thermal resistance, making it convenient for hot climatic conditions. Besides, fabrics woven with 65 / 35 % PES/CO blend yarns have higher thermal resistance, so they are suitable for cold climatic conditions. Fabrics woven with 33 / 67 % PES/CO blend yarns have lower water vapor resistance, so they are convenient for hot climatic conditions...|$|E

In the shallow dark window-space heaps of sleazy <b>sateens,</b> badly <b>woven</b> galateas, canvas shoes {{designed}} {{for women with}} bulging ankles, steel and red glass buttons upon cards with broken edges, a cottony blanket, a granite-ware frying-pan reposing on a sun-faded crepe blouse.|$|R
50|$|Driving power {{included}} 11 water turbines with {{a combined}} horsepower of 8,550, and supplementary steam engines of 700 horsepower were employed. Seventy per cent of the spindles were used in making yarns for sale principally among weavers in the St. Petersburg and Moscow textile districts. A specialty of the mill was 90s ply yarn, made from Egyptian yarn, for the rubber-tire manufacturers. The range of yarns produced was wide, running from 3s to 90s, and about 330,000 of the spindles were mules. The woven textile consisted mainly of print cloth in various types of construction and <b>sateens,</b> both <b>woven</b> from 34s warp and 38s weft. Practically all the goods were shipped to a factory in Moscow, in which the firm had a large interest.|$|R
40|$|Weaving buildings? Crocheting a room? Is it {{possible}} with the technological breakthroughs in hybrid or composite materials {{that we may be}} able to reconsider the construction of space and how woven and nonwoven techniques could be used to deal with form and function? In order to innovate with this relationship, links need to be made between the parallel worlds of textile design and architecture. Each discipline looks to the other for conceptual inspiration but until now does not converse in order to pursue large possibilities. If the material breakthroughs allow for textile design to function at the scale of a building then terms such as twill, <b>sateen,</b> and plain <b>weave</b> could be added to beam, column and slab.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} - the {{development}} of textile screen printed sensor for enuresis alarm system, using different concentrations of graphite in paste and various width of traces (3, 5, 7 mm). The most optimal parameters of concentration (22 %) and width (7 mm) of traces, which were printed on <b>sateen</b> <b>weave</b> cotton fabric, are found by measuring the resistivity and the change of voltage in time during dropping the salty dilution. The more graphite concentration and width, the less resistivity is observed...|$|E
40|$|Zorka Ságlová {{was born}} in Humpolec on 14 August 1942. Between 1961 and 1966 she studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague in the textile studio of Antonín Kybal. From informel {{paintings}} she moved to structures created out of basic geometrical elements based on a particular textile structure - <b>sateen</b> <b>weave.</b> In 1968 she exhibited her works at the New Sensitivity, an exhibition presenting new tendencies of constructive art, and she {{became a part of}} this important phenomenon in Czech art. Her latest objects presented at this exhibition led her to the idea of the viewer as an active participant on the creation of her artworks. This resulted in four actions taking place in the open landscape and an event called Hay, straw in the prestigious Gallery of Václav Špála in 1969. For this work she was largely critisized by the communist media as well as the Czech artistic community. This all led to her isolation in the 70 's and 80 's. From 1976 she created a series of tapestries. During this work she discovered a rabbit/hare as her emblematic symbol for a long period. She started to collect all relevant information about its significance in various cultures. In 1984 she returned to painting. She updated her structures based on <b>sateen</b> <b>weave</b> by using thousands of rabbit silhouettes instead of [...] ...|$|E
