Lewthwaite states that in early 2007 he compiled and supplied an estimate of the total scheme cost to Mr Donnelly (the economist) and Mr MacFarlane (the farm management consultant) for their use in providing the economic analysis. The estimate was $NZ409.6 million for a <b>scheme</b> <b>area</b> of 60,000 hectares, or $6,826 per hectare irrigated.|$|E

40|$|Location {{management}} {{deals with}} how to track mobile users within the cellular network. It consists of two basic operations: location update and paging. The total cost of location management {{is the sum of}} the location update cost and the paging cost. There are many location management <b>schemes,</b> Location <b>Areas</b> and Reporting Centers are two classical and popular location management schemes. To the best of our knowledge, no performance comparison between Reporting Centers and Location Areas has been reported in the literature. The paper compares the performance of the Location <b>Areas</b> <b>scheme</b> and the Reporting Centers scheme. The motivation for the study is that the location areas can be derived from a given set of reporting centers such that the location update cost difference between the Reporting Centers scheme and the Location <b>Areas</b> <b>scheme</b> is small whereas the paging cost in the Reporting Centers scheme is larger than that in the Location <b>Areas</b> <b>scheme.</b> Given a set of reporting centers, this paper shows how to derive the location areas from the reporting centers, and compares the performance of Location Areas and Reporting Centers schemes under various mobility models and incoming call arrival rates. Simulation results show that the Location <b>Areas</b> <b>scheme</b> greatly outperforms the Reporting Centers scheme in most cases although the Reporting Centers scheme performs a little bit better than the Location <b>Areas</b> <b>scheme</b> in some extreme cases...|$|R

Great Northern Highway is the only sealed road linking the region {{to the rest of the}} state, and via Victoria Highway, the rest of the country; therefore, it is particularly important for defence, freight, and tourism. Freight needs include transportation of minerals to the ports at Derby and Wyndham for the mining industry, cattle to ports or abattoirs, and produce to markets (including to the Wyndham port for export) for the agricultural industry based around the Ord River Irrigation <b>Scheme</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|For many years, Western Australia used a zonal {{electoral system}} for {{both houses of}} parliament. In most Australian jurisdictions, each state {{electorate}} represents an approximately equal number of voters. However, in Western Australia, until 2008 an MP represented 28,519 voters in greater Perth (the Metropolitan Region <b>Scheme</b> <b>area)</b> or 14,551 country voters. At the 2006 census taken on 8 August 2006, 73.76% of Western Australia's residents lived in and around Perth, but only 34 of Western Australia's 57 Legislative Assembly seats, representing 60% of the total, were located in the metropolitan region. There has been strong support over time in some quarters for the principle of one vote one value, particularly from the Australian Labor Party who were at particular disadvantage under the system. Up until 2005, reform had proceeded gradually—the most dramatic changes had occurred with {{the enactment of the}} Electoral Districts Act 1947 and the Acts Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 1987, the latter of which raised the number of metropolitan seats from 29 to 34.|$|E

Out {{of the total}} area of 19,500 acres of reclaimed land 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920 are known as new reclamations, which were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring an 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block (Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major reclamations during this period.|$|R

The impact which the extent of farm fragmentation has on padi productivity, irrigation, mechanization, and the neglect of parcels located at a distance from the farm house for the three size categories of farms [...] one-parcel, two-parcel, and three-or-more-parcel farms [...] is evaluated by the use of the chi-square test. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{climatology}} of cyclones with a {{focus on}} their relation to wind storm tracks in the Mediterranean region (MR) is presented. Trends in the frequency of cyclones and wind storms, as well as variations associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic/West Russian (EAWR) and the Scandinavian variability pattern (SCAND) are discussed. The study is based on the ERA 40 reanalysis dataset. Wind storm tracks are identified by tracking clusters of adjacent grid boxes characterised by extremely high local wind speeds. The wind track is assigned to a cyclone track independently identified with an objective <b>scheme.</b> <b>Areas</b> with high wind activity – quantified by extreme wind tracks – are typically located south of the Golf of Genoa, south of Cyprus, southeast of Sicily and west of the Iberian Peninsula.
