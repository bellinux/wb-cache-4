40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} relationship graphs between {{neutron flux}} thermal and the thermal currents of <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> and also determining the sensitivity value of <b>self-powered</b> <b>detectors.</b> The <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> used {{was made of}} Rhodium emitter. The neuron flux thermal {{was obtained from the}} difference between the total neutron flux and the fast neutron flux. The measurement of the neutron flux on the <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> produced outputs in the form of currents. To obtain the neutron flux thermal, the method used was a material activated process, in this case, a gold foil (Au- 197) activated process. The gold foil activation was done in two ways, the foil activation without Cadmium wrapping and one with Cadmium wrapping. The gold foil activation without Cadmium wrapping was to obtain the total neutron flux and the activation of gold foil with Cadmium wrapping was to gain the fast neutron flux. After obtaining the neutron flux thermal, the data fitting using Micro cal Origin 6. 1 was performed to get the relationship graphs between the neutron flux and the output currents. From the resulted equation of the data fitting, the value of sensitivity could be determined with I as the output current of the <b>neutron</b> self <b>detector</b> and as the neutron flux thermal. Research results showed that the relationship between output currents of <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> and <b>neutron</b> flux thermal produced a linear relationship with the equation I = (- 5, 111593, 51596) 10 + (3, 734470, 382681) 10.

40|$|Abstract- The {{background}} current {{produced by}} a rhodium <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> (RSPND) with an integral background lead has been investigated to determine {{its relationship to the}} neutron flux seen by the detector. The background current and steady state flux were measured at the core midplane for all fuel assemblies, and good linearity was seen. Under transient conditions, the background current, when delayed fission product decay contributions are included, follows the flux reasonably well although with a slight lag. This opens the possibility of using the RSPND during transient conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Safety and {{reliability}} {{are one of}} the key objectives for future Generation IV nuclear energy systems. The neutron flux monitoring system forms {{an integral part of the}} safety design of a nuclear reactor and must be able to detect any irregularities during all states of reactor operation. The work in this thesis mainly concerns the detection of in-core perturbations arising from unwanted movements of control rods with in-vessel <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> in a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Feasibility study of <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> (SPNDs) with platinum emitters as in-core power profile monitors for SFRs at full power is performed. The study shows that an SPND with a platinum emitter generates a prompt current signal induced by neutrons and gammas of the order of 600 nA/m, which is large enough to be measurable. Therefore, it is possible for the SPND to follow local power fluctuations at full power operation. Ex-core and in-core detector locations are investigated with two types of detectors, fission chambers and <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> (SPNDs) respectively, to study the possibility of detection of the spatial changes in the power profile during two different transient conditions, i. e. inadvertent withdrawal of control rods (IRW) and one stuck rod during reactor shutdown (OSR). It is shown that it is possible to detect the two simulated transients with this set of ex-core and in-core detectors before any melting of the fuel takes place.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 A <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> (SPND) is {{a device}} that, {{coupled with a}} current meter, {{provides}} a readout proportional to neutron population. This thesis discusses the design parameters of an array of such devices, their characteristics, {{and the use of}} these devices as a <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> spectrometer (SPNS) to provide information about the energy distribution in a neutron radiation field. Neutron absorption in an appropriate material produces subsequent beta emissions. In a SPND, some of these beta particles will cross a non-conducting region and stop in a collector material. A net exchange of charge between these regions can be read as a current flowing between the emission region and the collector region. One potential SPNS design was modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation of the device's interaction with a radiation field. The Monte Carlo program used predicts the beta flux which is proportional to the current that would be produced by an actual device. Various beta emitting materials were considered for this device, and a sensitivity study of each was included. The design considered is comprised of a concentric set of these cylindrical SPND detector elements which, in themselves, are currently available technology...|$|R

Under normal operating conditions, we showed that rhodium emitter {{can be used for}} 2 cycles of pressurized water reactors (PWRs) with lifetime of 4. 35 years, whereas silver can be used for 5 cycles of PWRs with lifetime of 8. 04 years. Three sensitivity tests were performed for rhodium and silver about (1) the emitter size, (2) the fuel assembly burnup, and (3) the emitter temperature variations. From the test results, we observed that the lifetimes of rhodium and silver emitters remained 2 and 5 cycles long, respectively.

40|$|A new calculational {{model of}} {{detector}} sensitivity, which {{is defined as}} the ratio of electric current to <b>neutron</b> flux, for <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> (SPND) is presented in this paper. Since Warren developed a sensitivity calculation model based on a multi-step analytic approach in 1972, {{there have been a lot}} of researches aimed at improving the accuracy of his model by partially employing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in some of the calculation steps. However, there still exist assumptions such as mono-energy neutron in those models which could increase the uncertainty of the calculated detector sensitivity. In this paper, a new model which overcomes those limitations is developed by adopting the MC method more thoroughly and thereby reducing the number of calculation steps. The verification of the new method has been performed by comparing the results against the ones from the existing methods and measured data. A detailed analysis of SPND depletion by ORIGEN-S and BETA-S codes has shown that the proposed model can predict accurately the measured depletion data in a commercial pressurized water reactor (PWR) plant. close 0...|$|R
40|$|A {{calibration}} {{technology of}} the <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> (SPNDs) using a large vertical irradiation hole of HANARO is developed. The 40 Rh-SPNDs are installed on the polycarbonate plastic support, and the gold wires with the same length as the effective length of the rhodium emitter of the SPND are also installed to measure the neutron flux on the SPND. They are irradiated at a low reactor power, and the SPND current is measured using the pico-ammeter. The external gamma-rays which affect the SPND current response are analyzed using the Monte Carlo simulation for various irradiation conditions in HANARO. It is confirmed {{that the effect of}} the external gamma-rays to the SPND current is dependent on the reactor characteristics, and that it is affected by materials around the detector. The current signals due to the external gamma-rays can be either positive or negative, in that the net flow of the current may be either in the same or the opposite direction as the neutron-induced current by the rhodium emitter. From the above procedure, the effective calibration methodology of multiple SPNDs using the large hole of HANARO is developed. It could be useful for the calibration experiment of the <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> in the research reactors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a computer program}} for calculating the signal current of a large surface prompt-response <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> (SPND). The program is an improved version of a program developed by Al-Dabagh / 2 /, which was designed for calculating the current only from the emitter of a SPND. In addition to the emitter current the improved program calculates the insulator current and the collector current, and combines these three currents into a current for the complete detector. This detector current accounts for an electric potential inside the insulator and the balancing currents generated hereby. The basic theory and the organisation of theimproved program is described in the paper, with a listing of the source program presented in the appendix. Calculations performed for 80 SPNDs show a significant contribution of the insulator to the detector current. The insulator current may exceed the current from a very thin emitter. This causes a depletion of electrons in the insulator and results in a positive potential. Nevertheless, the emitter thickness proves to be the more important design parameter. The components of the detector current due to. Compton and photoelectric effects as well as discrete and continuum radiations were determined in an investigation. The comparison with a measured value shows the computer program provides useful results, {{but even in the}} improved program some deficiencies are recognized.

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and the ATR Critical (ATRC) {{facilities}} lack real-time {{methods for}} detecting thermal neutron flux and fission reaction rates for irradiation capsules. Direct {{measurements of the}} actual power deposited into a test are now possible without resorting to complicated correction factors. In addition, {{it is possible to}} directly measure minor actinide fission reaction rates and to provide time-dependent monitoring of the fission reaction rate or fast/thermal flux during transient testing. A joint Idaho State University /Idaho National Laboratory ATR National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF) project was recently initiated to evaluate new real-time state-of-the-art in-pile flux detection sensors. Initially, the project is comparing the accuracy, response time, and long duration performance of French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) -developed miniature fission chambers, specialized <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> (SPNDs) by the Argentinean National Energy Commission (CNEA), specially developed commercial SPNDs, and back-to-back fission (BTB) chambers developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).

40|$|Neutron {{detection}} is {{an important}} aspect of materials protection, accounting, and control for transmutation (MPACT). Currently He- 3 filled thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>detectors</b> are utilized in many applications; these detectors require high-voltage bias for operation, which complicates the system when multiple detectors are used. In addition, due to recent increase in homeland security activity and the nuclear renaissance, {{there is a shortage of}} He- 3, and these detectors become more expensive. Instead, cheap solid-state detectors that can be mass produced like any other computer chips will be developed. The new detector does not require a bias for operation, has low gamma sensitivity, and a fast response. The detection system is based on a honeycomb-like silicon device, which is filled with B- 10 as the neutron converter; while a silicon p-n diode (i. e., solar cell type device) formed on the thin silicon wall of the honeycomb structure detects the energetic charged particles emitted from the B- 10 conversion layer. Such a detector has ~ 40 % calculated thermal neutron detection efficiency with an overall detector thickness of about 200 ?m.

Due to measurements of electrical resistances and capacities, sodium penetrating into the detectors or cables probably seems to be the cause. As tests prior to the installation in the core proved the tightness of all detectors, it is suspected that small cracks have developed in the detector casings or in the outer cable sheaths during their exposure to the hot coolant. Two ionization chambers did not show these faults.

40|$|The Reactivity Initiated Accident Scoping Test (RIA-ST) was {{successfully}} completed August 30, 1978. The test was introductory to the RIA Series 1 tests and {{was designed to}} investigate and resolve several anticipated problem areas prior to performance of the first test of the series, Test RIA 1 - 1. The RIA Scoping Test, as performed, consisted of four separate single-rod experiment phases. The first three phases were performed with shrouded fuel rods of 5. 8 wt. % enrichment. They were subjected to power bursts resulting in total fuel surface energies ranging from 205 to 261 cal/q at the axial peak elevation. The fourth phase consisted of a 20 wt. % enriched, shrouded fuel rod which was subjected to a power hurst that deposited a total radially averaged energy of 527 cal/g. The primary objectives of the Scoping Test were defined as follows: (1) Determine the applicability of extrapolating low-power steady state calorimetric measurements and <b>self-powered</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>detector</b> (SPND) output to determine fuel rod energy depositions during a power burst. (2) Determine the enerqy deposition failure threshold for unirradiated fuel rods at BWR hot-startup coolant conditions. (3) Determine the magnitudes of oossible pressure pulses resulting from rod failure. (4) Determine {{the sensitivity of the}} test instrumentation to high transient radiation exposures. In general, the energy deposition values for the Scoping Test derived from the SPND output were 25 % higher than those obtained from the core ion chamber data. Determining which values are correct will require radiochemical analysis of the fuel rods which will take several months. At present, it apoears that the SPND derived energies are in error because of excellent agreement between the calculated and measured power calibration results and the agreement between the predicted failure threshold and that seen using the core ion chamber derived energies. Meeting the second objective was accomplished during the first three test phases by subjecting the fuel rods to energy depositions which bracketed the failure threshold. The failure threshold in terms of total pellet surface energy at the axial flux peak was found to be between 218 cal/g where no rod failure occurred and 256 cal/g where · rod failure did occur. The experiment predictions indicated that the failure threshold would be 262 cal/g at the pellet surface. Only the fourth experiment phase (527 cal/g) resulted in a pressure pulse upon rod failure. The best indication of source pressure was the reading from a 69 MPa EG&G pressure transducer at the flow shroud inlet. This pressure transducer indicated a pressure pulse upon rod failure of 28. 2 MPa with a rise time of 1. 6 ms. The source pressure was attenuated considerably outside the shroud region as indicated by pressure transducers in the upper plenum of the in-pile tube and in the flow bypass region. The maximum pressure indicated outside the flow shroud was 2. 1 MPa. In general, instrumentation sensitivity to radiation was minimal. The most significant instrumentation problem during the power bursts was a false flowrate indication by the flow turbines. This problem is being examined. The Kaman and Bell & Howell pressure transducers showed the least sensitivity to radiation of the pressure measurement devices. The EG&G transducers were most sensitive. The locked linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) gave no indication of radiation sensitivity as its response during the burst was a straight line. The strain gages were very sensitive to radiation, indicating a strain increase of 70 % with the second burst of RIA-ST- 1. The Type S thermocouple did not exhibit significant radiation sensitivity. In addition, the RIA Scoping Test has provided data on the consequences of fuel rod failure during a RIA event at BWR hot startup conditions. Posttest examination of the fuel rods from the first two phases of the test revealed large quantities of UO{sub 2 } fuel missing from the cladding. Fuel rod failures for energy depositions near the failure threshold in previous closed capsule tests without forced coolant flow resulted in only a slight amount of fuel loss...|$|R

It gives a direct current signal proportional to the incident flux of neutrons, due to production of negative beta particles or Compton electrons {{in the heart of}} the device.|$|R

The capability to distinguish between neutrons and gammas is excellent in noble gas based 4-He detectors due to their low electron density and excellent pulse shape discrimination property.|$|R
