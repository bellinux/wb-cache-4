5|$|During her {{tenure in}} the World Wrestling Federation, {{she held the}} Women's Championship once, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> trained wrestler. During the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 1999, she flashed her breasts in what was an early instance of intentional nudity in the WWF. After the event, she was shown nude several more times on other pay-per-views. She is also an ex-wife of wrestler and color-commentator Jerry Lawler, who quit the WWF after Carter was released in early 2001 but returned after their divorce in July 2001. She currently works on the independent circuit under her real name.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensible}} epistemologist {{may not see}} how {{she could}} know that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> Brain In a Vat (BIV); but she doesn’t panic. She sticks with her empirical beliefs, and as that requires, believes that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> BIV. (<b>She</b> does not inferentially base her belief that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> BIV on her empirical knowledge—she rejects that ‘Moorean’ response to skepticism.) Drawing on the psychological literature on metacognition, I describe a mechanism that’s plausibly responsible for a sensible epistemologist coming to believe <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> BIV. I propose she thereby knows that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> BIV. The particular belief-forming mechanism employed explains why she overlooks this account of how <b>she</b> knows <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> BIV, making it seem {{that there is no}} way for her to know it. I argue this proposal satisfactorily resolves the skeptical puzzle...|$|R

Hedgeman was also inspired by her mentors at Howard. To implement her idea, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates {{during the summer of}} 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of Joan of Arc have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that Joan of Arc was not actually burned at the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of Joan of Arc is actually a myth. None of these claims are widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised {{her hand in his}} defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member of}} the church, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E

5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal {{to give her the}} higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E

Her father possessed a Doctor of Medicine from Tufts University School of Medicine and also worked as an athletics coach {{at the start of}} the 20th century at Columbia University and as the athletic director at Swarthmore College from 1902 through 1908. Her mother was a Greek and Latin teacher. Iris attended the 1932 Summer Olympics as a spectator and began competing in swimming the following year, winning numerous local and regional tournaments. When it was too cold to swim, she remained athletically active through cycling. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> member of any club during her first year of competition, but nonetheless placed first in several meets in addition to her participation at the 1933 Southern Pacific Amateur Athletic Union and Pacific Coast championships.|$|E
5|$|Her public profile rose {{even further}} {{when she was}} awarded Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize two months later in December.

At the {{proceedings}} in her honour, Yousafzai stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> member of any political party, but hoped to found a national party of her own to promote education. The prime minister directed the authorities {{to set up an}} IT campus in the Swat Degree College for Women at Yousafzai's request, and a secondary school was renamed in her honour. By 2012, Yousafzai was planning to organise the Malala Education Foundation, which would help poor girls go to school.|$|E

5|$|SMS Greif was an aviso {{built by}} the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine), the only ship of her class. She was built at the Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1885, she was launched in July 1886, and she was commissioned in July 1887. Unlike the other avisos built by Germany, Greif was equipped only with a gun armament. Greif served with the fleet from 1887 until 1911, though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> particularly successful design and so saw little active service, having {{spent most of her}} time in reserve. In 1912, she was reduced to a training ship for engine-room personnel. In 1917, she was hulked for minelayers in Kiel. She was ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921 in Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{participated in}} the Battle of Midway in June 1942, {{although}} they did not see any combat. Mutsu saw more active service than her sister because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> flagship and {{participated in the}} Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of Mutsus aft magazines detonated in June, killing 1,121 crew and visitors and destroying the ship. The IJN conducted a perfunctory investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded {{that it was the}} work of a disgruntled crewmember. They dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking to keep up morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was salvaged after the war and many artifacts and relics are on display in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the House of Commons was petitioned by Craven Berkeley, who had {{previously}} sat as the member of parliament for Cheltenham. He claimed that his step-daughter, Augusta Talbot, {{had been forced to}} join the Franciscan Convent in Taunton as a postulant (the first stage to become a nun), rather than a pupil. Her father had died in 1839 and then her mother, after remarrying, died in 1841, and with the subsequent death of her brother, she was due to inherit £80,000. After the death of her mother, Talbot had been placed in the care of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, her father's half-brother. Berkeley alleged that the Shrewsburys first attempted to marry her to François VII de La Rochefoucauld, and then when she refused, placed her at the Taunton convent against her will. The allegation followed that when Talbot became a nun, her inheritance, which was due to her in June 1852, would become property of the convent, or the greater Catholic church. Berkeley also protested that he and his daughter were not allowed to communicate with Talbot, though Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, the Lord Chancellor, noted that Berkeley had not tried to see Talbot for nine years. Lord Truro contacted Talbot, who stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> postulant, and she was amenable to his plans to remove her from the convent and place her in the care of a new guardian in London. He duly did so, and rejected Berkeley's petition, upon the basis of his previous lack of contact with Talbot.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E
