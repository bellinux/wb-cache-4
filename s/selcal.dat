50|$|The code is {{received}} by any aircraft receiver monitoring the radio frequency {{on which the}} <b>SELCAL</b> code is broadcast. A <b>SELCAL</b> decoder is connected to each aircraft's radio receiver. When a <b>SELCAL</b> decoder on an aircraft receives a signal containing its own assigned <b>SELCAL</b> code, it alerts the aircraft's crew by sounding a chime, activating a light, or both.|$|E
50|$|In {{international}} aviation, <b>SELCAL</b> or <b>SelCal</b> is a selective-calling {{radio system}} that can alert an aircraft's crew that a ground radio station wishes {{to communicate with the}} aircraft. <b>SELCAL</b> uses a ground-based encoder and radio transmitter to broadcast an audio signal that is picked up by a decoder and radio receiver on an aircraft. The use of <b>SELCAL</b> allows an aircraft crew to be notified of incoming communications even when the aircraft's radio has been muted. Thus, crewmembers need not devote their attention to continuous radio listening.|$|E
50|$|An {{individual}} aircraft {{has its own}} assigned <b>SELCAL</b> code. To initiate a <b>SELCAL</b> transmission, a ground station radio operator enters an aircraft's <b>SELCAL</b> code into a <b>SELCAL</b> encoder. The encoder converts the four-letter code into four designated audio tones. The radio operator's transmitter then broadcasts the audio tones on the aircraft's company radio frequency channel in sequence: the first pair of tones are transmitted simultaneously, lasting about one second; a silence of about 0.2 seconds; followed by the second pair of tones, lasting about one second.|$|E
50|$|The current {{rules for}} <b>SELCAL</b> code assignment, with sixteen {{available}} letters/tones, {{limit the number}} of possible allowable codes to 10,920. Additionally, <b>SELCAL</b> codes assigned previously use a subset of only twelve letters/tones. Therefore, more than one aircraft may be designated by the same code.|$|E
50|$|An {{individual}} aircraft {{is given a}} <b>SELCAL</b> code upon application to the <b>SELCAL</b> code registrar, Aviation Spectrum Resources, Inc. (ASRI). The code is technically assigned to the owner-operator of the aircraft rather than the aircraft itself; if an aircraft is sold, the new owners-operators must apply for a new code.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{confusion}} {{from two}} or more aircraft using the same <b>SELCAL</b> code, ASRI tries to assign code duplicates to aircraft that do not usually operate in the same {{region of the world}} or on the same HF radio frequencies. However, aircraft commonly move between different geographical regions and it is now routine for two aircraft with the same <b>SELCAL</b> code to be found flying in the same region. Therefore, air crew always verify both <b>SELCAL</b> and call sign (i.e., aircraft tail registration, or telephony designator and flight identification) to be sure their aircraft is the intended recipient.|$|E
50|$|<b>SELCAL</b> {{details are}} {{defined in the}} latest version of ARINC Characteristic 714A.|$|E
50|$|A <b>SELCAL</b> 32 Expansion Project is {{currently}} under evaluation {{to increase the}} number of possible allowable codes.|$|E
50|$|<b>SELCAL</b> {{operates}} {{on the high}} frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) radio frequency bands used for aircraft communications. HF radio often has extremely high levels of background noise and can be difficult or distracting to listen to {{for long periods of}} time. As a result, it is common practice for crews to keep the radio volume low unless the radio is immediately needed. A <b>SELCAL</b> notification activates a signal to the crew that they are about to receive a voice transmission, so that the crew has time to raise the volume.|$|E
50|$|The code is a {{sequence}} of four letters, written or transmitted as an ordered two sets of two letters each (e.g., AB-CD). The letters are chosen from {{a subset of the}} Latin script comprising A through S, excluding I, N and O. The letters within a given pair are written or transmitted in alphabetical order (e.g., AB-CD is an allowable distinct <b>SELCAL</b> code, as is CD-AB, but CD-BA is not). A given letter can be used only once in a <b>SELCAL</b> code; letters may not be repeated (e.g., AB-CD is allowable, but AA-BC and AB-BC are not).|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} little radar {{coverage}} {{in the middle of}} the Atlantic, aircraft must report in as they cross various waypoints along each track, their anticipated crossing time of the next waypoint, and the waypoint after that. These reports enable the Oceanic Controllers to maintain separation between aircraft. These reports can be made to dispatchers via a satellite communications link (CPDLC) or via high frequency (HF) radios. In the case of HF reports, each aircraft operates using <b>SELCAL</b> (selective calling). The use of <b>SELCAL</b> allows an aircraft crew to be notified of incoming communications even when the aircraft's radio has been muted. Thus, crew members need not devote their attention to continuous radio listening. If the aircraft is equipped with automatic dependent surveillance, (ADS-C & ADS-B), voice position reports on HF are no longer necessary, as automatic reports are downlinked to the Oceanic Control Centre. In this case, a <b>SELCAL</b> check only has to be performed when entering the oceanic area and with any change in radio frequency to ensure a working backup system for the event of a datalink failure.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of addressed digital communications, some real-world analog communications systems performed a function very similar to the fictional CRM-114. Some aircraft radios used <b>SELCAL</b> (selective calling), which muted the receiver unless an assigned tone was received. Ground mobile radios used a similar system called CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Selcal</b> (selective calling) controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between <b>selcal</b> and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of <b>selcal</b> controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE <b>Selcal,</b> also know as ground-air selective calling device, {{has been used by}} land station for selective calling of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique selective calling code, when the selective calling device calls an aircraft, the selective call code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. <b>Selcal</b> code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of selective calling syste...|$|E

Radios are mainly used {{to communicate with}} the aircraft under test in order to give guidance and feedback from ground specialists. Sometimes, however, radios themselves become the subject of the test, requiring a full set of them with all their features and capabilities (Military Modes, HF ALE, <b>SELCAL,</b> etc). Remote control (and audio routing) of these radios is a critical as infrastructures scale over tens of radios, distributed amid different test centers separated by hundreds of kilometers. Addition of a remote touch user interface, MIL COMSEC and TRANSEC modes, automatic audio routing, together with a maintenance free requirement, makes the whole issue far more difficult to manage. Airbus Defense & Space has developed a Smart Radio Control System allowing to profit from those advantages and more benefits: *Intuitive Touch UI *Automatic Audio Routing *Distributed infrastructure (network based) *Autonomous and service free (no one, other than FTC needed to operate it) *Heterogeneous (any radio can be controlled by creating a plug & play library) *Special Modes support (COMSEC, TRANSEC, HF ALE, and <b>SELCAL)</b> Future additions will include, amongst others, VoIP integration and tablet use...|$|E
