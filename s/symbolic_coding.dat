This product received a cover notice in [...] "Sun World" [...] that month, along with a review from new product reviews editor David A. Taylor praising the products remarkable ease of learning and ease of use. An unusual characteristic of this merge tool was its use of colored backgrounds and video game-like color-matching strategies for hinting which branch to accept when merging code conflicts. What was innovative about this approach was that other tools had used <b>symbolic</b> <b>coding,</b> or color-coding of text which put additional cognitive load on the symbolic and linear processing centers of the brain, whereas the color matching utilized graphical and parallel processing centers. The result, verified by product reviewers was a reduction in undetected user errors during the merge task and an improvement in task performance times.|$|E

40|$|A cutting {{sequence}} is a <b>symbolic</b> <b>coding</b> of a linear trajectory on a translation surface {{corresponding to the}} sequence of sides hit in a polygonal representation of the surface. We characterize {{cutting sequence}}s in a regular hexagon with opposite sides identified by translations exploiting the same procedure used by Smillie and Ulcigrai for the regular octagon. In {{the case of the}} square, cutting sequences are the well known Sturmian sequences. We remark the differences between the procedure used {{in the case of the}} square and the one used in the cases of the regular hexagon and regular octagon. We also show how to adapt the latter to work also in the case of the square, giving a new characterization for this case. We also show how to create a dictionary to pass from the <b>symbolic</b> <b>coding</b> with respect to the hexagon to the <b>symbolic</b> <b>coding</b> with respect to the parallelogram representing it in the space of flat tori. Finally we consider the Bouw-Möller surfaces M(3, 4) and M(4, 3) and we use their semi-regular polygons representations to prove our main result, which is a theorem analogous to the central step used to characterize cutting sequences in the previous cases.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-step {{model for the}} <b>symbolic</b> <b>coding</b> and generation of intonation. First, the F 0 curve is reduced {{to a series of}} pitch target points that capture the macroprosodic information of the utterance. Target points are then converted into a sequence of labels. Generation is achieved through the reverse steps. The model is language independent and requires no prior training on the data. We discuss the influence of the number of categories on the precision of fit, and show, by an evaluation on a large multilingual corpus (4 hours 20 minutes of speech, 50 speakers, 5 languages) that a model composed of three ascending and three descending categories, plus a category for small or null movements enables a regeneration of ca. 99 % of points at less than 2 ST than the original. Given that the model is capable of various improvements, it seems a good candidate for practical applications. 1.

5000|$|<b>Symbolic</b> <b>codes</b> {{are used}} to form mental {{representations}} of words. They represent something conceptually, and sometimes, arbitrarily, as opposed to perceptually. Similar to the way a watch may represent information {{in the form of}} numbers to display the time, <b>symbolic</b> <b>codes</b> represent information in our mind in the form of arbitrary symbols, like words and combinations of words, to represent several ideas. Each symbol (x, y, 1, 2, etc.) can arbitrarily represent something other than itself. For instance, the letter x is often used to represent more than just the concept of an x, the 24th letter of the alphabet. It can be used to represent a variable x in mathematics, or a multiplication symbol in an equation. Concepts like multiplication can be represented symbolically by an [...] "x" [...] because we arbitrarily assign it a deeper concept. Only when we use it to represent this deeper concept does the letter [...] "x" [...] carry this type of meaning.|$|R

Multigeneration structure of manifolds, which is the manifestation of complex-domain homoclinic entanglement created by complexified classical dynamics, allows a <b>symbolic</b> <b>coding</b> and it {{is used as a}} guiding principle to extract dominant complex trajectories from all the semiclassical candidates...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{maintains}} that solidarity is the ethical fundament or, {{in a wider}} sense, it is {{the social and cultural}} basis of every society. Solidarity provides with meaning and justification personal and functional relationships, simple or more complex as they may be. Solidarity is originated (and continuously re–originated) on the basis of three different dynamic aspects: - common recognition, through which a collectivity identifies with an "us" both rationally and emotionally perceived, differentiated from the "others"; - reciprocity, which is obtained thanks to the consolidated confidence and trust between the members of a society and thanks also to the open attitude towards social relationships; responsibility, which characterises the concrete duty we have consciously taken towards (and inside) society. At last the author argues that solidarity can be culturally expressed by means of generalised <b>symbolic</b> <b>codes</b> (truth, power, money, love and friendship, art, religion and so on); these codes constitute the cultural structures which signify and rule expectations, social roles, and the representations we have of things, persons and values.

The semiotic approach results in establishing different levels of the edition’s target audience portrayal and revealing the most frequent devices of its representation in derivative names.

The iconic code on the other hand could be motivated or conventional depending on the way the message is brought up to the reader.
