2500|$|The {{cumulative}} recorder makes a pen-and-ink {{record of}} simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it {{for use with}} the Operant chamber as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck. [...] In this device, {{a sheet of paper}} gradually unrolls over a cylinder. [...] Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply <b>sloping</b> <b>line</b> on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use {{with the advent of the}} laboratory computer. [...] Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, Schedules of Reinforcement, is full of cumulative records produced by this device.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{basis for}} the determination of <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> in grid digital elevation models is provided by using the D 8 -LTD method (eight slope directions, least transverse deviation). The D 8 -LTD method's capability to predict consistently exact <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> as the grid cell size goes to zero is shown analytically by applying mathematical analysis methods. The use of cumulative, least transverse deviations {{is found to be}} the key factor allowing for globally unbiased approximations of <b>slope</b> <b>lines.</b> The D 8 -LTD method's properties are also demonstrated numerically by using digital elevation models of a synthetic sloping surface obtained from the Himmelblau function. It is shown that <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> obtained from the D 8 -LTD method can approximate the exact <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> as close as desired by selecting a grid cell size that is small enough. In contrast, the standard D 8 method is found to produce significantly biased results even when small grid cells are used. The D 8 -LTD method outperforms the D 8 method over a wide range of grid cell sizes (up to 20 m in this application), beyond which grid cell size becomes too large to validly represent the underlying sloping surface. It is therefore concluded that the D 8 -LTD method should be used in preference to the standard D 8 method in order to obtain <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> that are only limited in reliability by the detail of topographic data, and not by the accuracy of the slope direction method applied.

Clearly, if to {{ornament}} the already hollowed profile, b, we cut deep incisions into it, we shall so far weaken it at the top, that it will nearly lose all its supporting power. Clearly, also, if to ornament the already bulging profile c we were to leave projecting pieces of stone outside of it, we should nearly destroy all its relation to the original <b>sloping</b> <b>line</b> X, and produce an unseemly and ponderous mass, hardly recognizable as a cornice profile. It is evident, on the other hand, that {{we can afford to}} cut into this profile without fear of destroying its strength, and that we can afford to leave projections outside of the other, without fear of destroying its lightness. Such is, accordingly, the natural disposition of the sculpture, and the two great families of capitals are therefore distinguished, not merely by their concave and convex contours, but by the ornamentation being left outside the bell of the one, and cut into the bell of the other; so that, in either case, the ornamental portions will fall between the dotted lines at e, Fig. V., and the pointed oval, or vesica piscis, which is traced by them, may be called the Limit of ornamentation.|$|E

The continuum is at first like a smooth, <b>sloping</b> <b>line.</b> Speakers in close proximity tend to unify their speech, creating a stepped line out of the sloped line. These steps are the dialects. Over the course of time, some steps become weak and fall into disuse, while others preempt the entire continuum. As example Schmidt used Standard German, which was defined to conform to some dialects and then spread throughout Germany, replacing the local dialects in many cases.|$|E

5000|$|When {{determining}} the reaction caused at a support, the support is {{replaced with a}} roller, which cannot resist a vertical reaction. Then an upward (positive) reaction {{is applied to the}} point where the support was. Since the support has been removed, the beam will rotate upwards, and since the beam is rigid, it will create a triangle with the point at the second support. If the beam extends beyond the second support as a cantilever, a similar triangle will be formed below the cantilevers position. This means that the reaction’s influence line will be a straight, <b>sloping</b> <b>line</b> with a value of zero at the location of the second support.|$|E
