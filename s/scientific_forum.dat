40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to discuss {{theoretically}} the power relationships that materialize themselves in practices carried out by researchers in <b>scientific</b> <b>forums,</b> based on the Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of production, reproduction and distinction in the scientific universe. We assume that events are instances of reproduction of scientific activity in which power relationships are intend to maintain and perpetuate positions attained. We conducted a literature review on the nature, size, functions and organization of <b>scientific</b> <b>forums</b> as instruments that enable the production and dissemination of knowledge. We point out that ideological components are determinant of unequal relationships between the dominant and dominated in the <b>scientific</b> <b>forums,</b> while ratifying the dynamics of social reproduction. We discuss how power relationships develop in the acts and discourses that constitute researchers' practices during <b>scientific</b> <b>forums,</b> particularly the scenic resources of actions and the scientific effects of representations of domination...|$|R
