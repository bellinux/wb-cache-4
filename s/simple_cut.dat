60|$|The {{subject of}} {{bleeding}} {{is involved in}} great obscurity, and the systematic examination of the motions in the juices of tropical climbers by resident observers, offers a fertile field to the naturalist. I have often remarked that if a climbing stem, in which the circulation is vigorous, be cut across, it bleeds freely from both ends, and most copiously from the lower, if it be turned downwards; but that if a truncheon be severed, {{there will be no}} flow from either of its extremities. This is the case with all the Indian watery-juiced climbers, at whatever season they may be cut. When, however, the circulation in the plant is feeble, neither end of a <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> will bleed much, but if a truncheon be taken from it, both the extremities will.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{following}} the beginning the deviation from {{a policy of}} functionality, engineers returned to the single-vault design. First tested in the Kharkov Metro (hence the name), the design is initiated with a <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> and cover as a column tri-span after the walls are mounted (and reinforced). The pit {{is filled with the}} excavated earth, up to the depth of the vault keystone, shaped into a half-cylinder. From there a metallic armature is placed on the earth, and on it, concrete blocks. Once set, the earth under the completed vault is then re-excavated and work on the station platforms can begin. The exact shape of the dome depends on the hydro-geological conditions of the surrounding location. If hydro-isolation is not required, the walls that erected the dome are incorporated into the design and the appearance is that of a vault lying on top of them. If hydro-isolation is required, the vault extends {{all the way to the}} bottom and the station appears like a half-cylinder. In presence of high water pressure from the soil, the walls are not only left outside, but also the vault is forced into a backwards curvature, making the station even more cylindrical.|$|E
50|$|Other water {{dogs are}} {{multipurpose}} hunters. Standard Poodles {{fall into the}} water dog category because they originally were used by wealthy Germans to hunt ducks; they predate most types of water dogs. Today there are kennels in the United States and Canada that have revived the breed for this purpose, with the dogs proving adept hunters at flushing bobwhite quail and common pheasant and achieving very high ranks in competitions, sometimes beating the more popular Labrador Retriever. They are highly intelligent, second only to Border Collies in rank in overall aptitude, and hunters must be very specific in indicating what they want when giving commands: they cannot be trained by conventional means and require very concrete signals to indicate what is desired so they won't attempt to solve the puzzle themselves and forget to follow all the checkpoints. They are excellent swimmers whose coat requires a simple bath after a swim and a <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> about an inch off the skin rather than the impractical show clips; they have a gentle temperament and an eagerness to learn that makes them very easy to train and like most water dogs {{they live in the}} house with their master and his family. Portuguese Water Dogs are medium-sized dogs that will retrieve just about anything from the water and have a strong instinct to swim, plus they will guard whatever quarry a hunter keeps: they are one of the only water dogs that were bred to hunt fish.|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{hundreds}} of facet arrangements that have been used, the most famous is probably the round brilliant cut, used for diamond and many colored gemstones. This first early version of {{what would become the}} modern Brilliant Cut {{is said to have been}} devised by an Italian named Peruzzi, sometime in the late 17th century. [...] Later on, the first angles for an [...] "ideal" [...] cut diamond were calculated by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919. Slight modifications have been made since then, but angles for [...] "ideal" [...] cut diamonds are still similar to Tolkowsky's formula. Round brilliants cut before the advent of [...] "ideal" [...] angles are often referred to as [...] "Early round brilliant cut" [...] or [...] "Old European brilliant cut" [...] and are considered poorly cut by today's standards, though there is still interest in them from collectors. Other historic diamond cuts include the [...] "Old Mine Cut" [...] which is similar to early versions of the round brilliant, but has a rectangular outline, and the [...] "Rose Cut" [...] which is a <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> consisting of a flat, polished back, and varying numbers of angled facets on the crown, producing a faceted dome. Sometimes a 58th facet, called a culet is cut on the bottom of the stone to help prevent chipping of the pavilion point. Earlier brilliant cuts often have very large culets, while modern brilliant cut diamonds generally lack the culet facet, or it may be present in minute size.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{standard}} faro shuffle, {{an idealized}} riffle shuffle, divides the deck into two equal portions, and perfectly interlaces them. The <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> takes one card {{from the top}} {{to the bottom of}} the deck. It is known that for decks of even size, the faro shuffle and <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> generate all possible permutations, while if the deck is of odu size, only a small fraction are available. This paper considers a generalized faro shuffle wherein the deck is divided into n rather than 2, portions and these portions are “interlaced” together. It is shown that the generalized faro shuffle and the <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> generate either the symmetric group of the deck, the alternating group of the deck, or in one special case, only a small fraction of the possible permutations. Whether the symmetric group or alternating group is generated depends on the parity of the <b>simple</b> <b>cut</b> and the generalized faro shuffle as group operations...|$|E

50|$|A fiberotomy {{involves}} the detachment of the fibers that attach the tooth {{to the bone}} via the gum. The fibers act much like twisted rubber bands and releasing {{the tension between the}} fibers and the tooth reduces the forces that attempt to pull the tooth back to its original position. It is performed near the completion of the orthodontics and is shown to be effective in preventing the relapse of teeth. To perform this procedure, the area around the tooth is numbed and <b>simple</b> <b>cuts</b> are made along the gum to sever the fibers; this procedure is painless as long as the patient takes an analgesic after the numbing has worn off.|$|R

Kite flying is associated with injuries ranging from <b>simple</b> <b>cuts</b> to grave lacerations or head trauma.
