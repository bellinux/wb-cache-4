5|$|In {{addition}} to the disparity in population, {{there was also a}} great disparity between the fighting capabilities of the armed forces of the two countries. In 1977, Vietnam was estimated to have 615,000 soldiers and 900 tanks, supported by a 12,000-member air force with 300 combat aircraft, including one squadron of light bombers. In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles, and limited air capability. Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam’s border regions. In January 1978, Kampuchean forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in Hà Tiên Province. On 27 January 1978, Vietnam <b>started</b> <b>calling</b> on the Kampuchean military along the border regions to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|Tute {{originated}} in Italy. The game {{belongs to the}} same family as Brisca and has similar rules in gameplay and final count of points. The {{name of the game}} originated from the Italian word Tutti (all), the declaration that a player announces when holding the four kings. The game spread to Spain during the 19th century, brought back by Spanish troops who returned from missions in Italy. As the popularity of the game increased, its name was modified over time by Spanish speakers, who <b>started</b> <b>calling</b> the game Tute. The game {{became one of the most}} popular in Spain, leading to the later appearance of regional variations of the game.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{privatisation}} of British Rail in 1997, {{services were}} franchised to Wales & West, {{which was in}} turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express.

5|$|The War of Chioggia erupted {{between the}} old-time rival Republics of Venice and Genoa in 1378, and it soon {{involved}} Venice's neighbours. King Louis took Genoa's side; and Ragusa—subordinate to Hungary, and Venice's competitor in the Adriatic—did so as well. The Venetians, having taken Kotor in August 1378, {{made an effort}} to have Tvrtko join the war on their side, which caused panic in Ragusa. Tvrtko, however, offered the Ragusans help in fighting Venice, which they initially refused. The death of George I of Zeta warranted Tvrtko's involvement in Serbian affairs, which reduced his ability to take an active part in the conflict. The Ragusans <b>started</b> <b>calling</b> for the destruction of Kotor, whose officials promised to renounce fealty to Venice and return to Louis. Kotor failed to fulfill this promise, but instead promised fealty to Tvrtko, who laid claim to the city as part of his Nemanjić ancestors' heritage. The political climate was ideal, since he was to take Kotor from his overlord's enemy. The Ragusans were furious, and an embargo ensued. Tvrtko defended Kotor from Ragusa, but was betrayed in June 1379, when the city overthrew its Venetian governor and submitted again directly to Louis.|$|E

25|$|Under Angelo Bruno's reign (1959–1980) {{the family}} enjoyed {{an era of}} peace and prosperity.

A complex dispute involving disgruntled subordinates and territory claims by the Genovese crime family of New York City led to Bruno's murder in 1980.
