40|$|The main {{intention}} of writing {{this paper is}} to enable the students, computer users and novice researchers about <b>spoofing</b> attacks. <b>Spoofing</b> means impersonating another person or computer, usually by providing false information (E-mail name, URL or IP address). <b>Spoofing</b> can take on many forms in the computer world, all of which involve some type false representation of information. There are a variety of methods and types of <b>spoofing.</b> We would like to introduce and explain following <b>spoofing</b> attacks in this paper: IP, ARP, E-Mail, Web, and DNS <b>spoofing.</b> There are no legal or constructive uses for implementing <b>spoofing</b> of any type. Some of the outcomes might be sport, theft, vindication or some other malicious goal. The magnitude of these attacks can be very severe; can cost us millions of dollars. This Paper describes about various <b>spoofing</b> types and gives a small view on detection and prevention of <b>spoofing</b> attacks...|$|R
30|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) <b>Spoofing</b> attacks {{threaten}} {{technologies that}} our modern society depends on. To successfully develop defensive mechanisms against these attacks, methods {{to model the}} attacks and subsequently distinguish them from normal GPS operation must be developed. This paper primarily details the step-by-step implementation of a low-cost GPS <b>spoofing</b> and high-level <b>spoofing</b> data collection apparatus to model a simplistic <b>spoofing</b> attack that could be implemented with limited resources.

30|$|The last type {{is closely}} related to a <b>spoofing</b> signal; these {{parameters}} include the frequency difference between a <b>spoofing</b> signal and a local replicate carrier (fe'), the phase difference between a <b>spoofing</b> signal and local replicate code (τS), the phase difference between an authentic signal carrier and a <b>spoofing</b> signal carrier (ϕ[*]−[*]ϕ'), and the ratio of the <b>spoofing</b> signal amplitude versus the authentic signal amplitude (η). The <b>spoofing</b> device always prefers that the first three parameters are close to 0, which is very difficult to achieve due to various reasons such as measurement error and device cost. Only η is a controllable parameter for the <b>spoofing</b> device. Therefore, η is the most important parameter for generating a <b>spoofing</b> signal and is the focus of numerous anti-spoofing attack studies. The spoofing-signal ratio (η) is defined as the ratio of the <b>spoofing</b> signal amplitude to the authentic signal amplitude. Based on the above assumption and the parameter analysis method, the lower limit of η required for successful <b>spoofing</b> in various conditions is deduced in the following sections.|$|R

3000|$|Anti-spoofing {{refers to}} the {{operation}} of employing a certain measure or technology to detect and eliminate a GNSS <b>spoofing</b> signal or to hinder the ability of an attacker to <b>spoof</b> a target. Current anti-spoofing technology relies on two approaches. The first approach is to distinguish authentic and <b>spoofing</b> signals via comparison. A GNSS interface specification is publicly available, and a navigation signal generated by a <b>spoofing</b> device cannot be identical to an authentic signal. As the simulation accuracy of a <b>spoofing</b> signal increases, the cost increases as well. Therefore, the <b>spoofing</b> signal can be identified by finding {{the difference between the}} <b>spoofing</b> signal and the authentic signal. The second approach is to detect signal abnormality during <b>spoofing.</b> For power suppression <b>spoofing,</b> an alarm is generated by detecting power abnormalities. For a receiver-spoofer, a warning is generated by detecting correlation distortion in the code loop. Based on the two approaches, this study on anti-spoofing measures focuses on the following aspects: [...]...|$|R

On January 22, 1995, in an article entitled, ―New form of attack on computers linked to Internet is uncovered, John Markoff of the New York Times reported on the TCP/IP protocol suite's security weakness known as IP <b>spoofing.</b> The IP <b>spoofing</b> security weakness was published by S.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that <b>spoofed</b> all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E

5|$|Netflix {{had ordered}} two seasons of 13 episodes when {{it made its}} {{original}} commitment to the series in 2011. According to Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley, production of the first season brought $140 million {{in the form of}} 2,200 jobs and transactions with 1,800 vendors to the Baltimore metropolitan area economy and the Maryland General Assembly expanded its Film Production Tax Credit so that season two could have similar impact over the course of 150 days of filming. Like the first season, the second season was largely filmed in the Baltimore area. Although production was publicized as being in Baltimore, Season 1 had based production in Harford County, Maryland, and season 2 also had its production office in Edgewood and a Joppa sound stage.

40|$|Abstract: Objective- Automatic face {{recognition}} is now {{widely used in}} applications ranging from de-duplication of identity to authentication of mobile payment. This popularity of {{face recognition}} has raised concerns about face <b>spoof</b> attacks (also known as biometric sensor presentation attacks), where a photo or video of an authorized person’s face {{could be used to}} gain access to facilities or services. While a number of face <b>spoof</b> detection techniques have been proposed, their generalization ability has not been adequately addressed. We propose an efficient and rather robust face <b>spoof</b> detection algorithm based on Image Distortion Analysis (IDA). Design/Methodology/Approach- Four different features (specular reflection, blurriness, chromatic moment, and color diversity) are extracted to form the IDA feature vector. An ensemble classifier, consisting of multiple SVM classifiers trained for different face <b>spoof</b> attacks (e. g., printed photo and replayed video), is used to distinguish between genuine and <b>spoof</b> faces. The proposed approach is extended to multi-frame face <b>spoof</b> detection in videos using a voting based scheme. We also collect a face <b>spoof</b> database, MSU Mobile Face <b>Spoofing</b> Database (MSU MFSD),using two mobile devices (Google Nexus 5 and MacBook Air) with three types of <b>spoof</b> attacks (printed photo, replayed video with iPhone 5 S and iPad Air). Limitations- It is difficulty in separating genuine and <b>spoof</b> faces, especially in cross-database and cross device scenarios. Practical implications- The system ensures user privacy and provides better security. Originality- Two public-domain face <b>spoof</b> databases (Idiap REPLAY-ATTACK and CASIA FASD), and the MSU MFSD database show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in <b>spoof</b> detection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{countermeasures}} to mitigate {{damage caused by}} <b>spoofing</b> attacks in Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In our model, an attacker <b>spoofs</b> someone else’s address (the victim’s) to absorb packets from the network intended for that victim. Address <b>spoofing</b> is arguably a very severe attack in DTNs, compared to other known attacks, such as dropping packets. Without a Public Key Infrastructure in DTNs, providing protection against this attack is challenging. We propose SPREAD (countermeasure against <b>SPoofing</b> by REplica ADjustment), a solution that assesses evidence of <b>spoofing</b> and offers countermeasures designed for quota-based multi-copy routing protocols. Our solution relies on reducing the weight of packet copies, charged to the routing quota, when these packets are given to a node suspected of <b>spoofing.</b> The weight reduction increases as <b>spoofing</b> evidence mounts against a node. The approach is designed to probabilistically maintain {{the same number of}} packet copies in the network as would be the case in the absence of attacks, despite the actual occurrence of <b>spoofing.</b> We show that SPREAD makes DTNs robust against <b>spoofing</b> attacks, does not overburden the network, and limits the overall overhead within a certain bound.
