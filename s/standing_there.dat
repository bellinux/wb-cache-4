5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks <b>standing,</b> <b>there</b> is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing {{on the part of the}} individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Jason first {{appeared}} outside of {{film in the}} 1982 novelization of Friday the 13th Part 3 by Michael Avallone. Avallone chose to use an alternate ending, which was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending, Chris, {{who is in the}} canoe, hears Rick's voice and immediately rushes back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> with a machete, and he decapitates her. Jason next appears in print in the 1986 novelization of Jason Lives by Simon Hawke, who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and 1988. Jason Lives specifically introduced Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, a character that was slated to appear in the film but was cut by the studio. In the novel, instead of being cremated, Elias has Jason buried after his death.|$|E

5|$|Sixty {{villages and}} about 40 churches were {{destroyed}} in the southwest Salmas Plain and the surrounding mountainous regions. In the zone of heaviest damage (bounded by the villages of Kohneh Shahr, Payajuk and Zaviehjuk) all the homes and {{all but one of}} the churches were destroyed. To the east of this area, the large village of Dilman reportedly had 1,100 casualties, but seismologists J. S. Tchalenko and M. Berberian questioned the reliability of this figure. In smaller villages, survivors provided an accurate count of those lost because they remembered the victims by name, but in a village of 18,000, survivors were unable to grasp the extent of the losses. Only two homes remained <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> and the village was renamed Salmas and moved to a new location to the west.|$|E
5|$|Van Peebles {{and several}} key crew members were armed {{because it was}} {{dangerous}} to {{attempt to create a}} film without the support of the union. One day, Van Peebles looked for his gun, and failed to find it. Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box. When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police, who fire a gun next to both of his ears, it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop. While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels, one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over. The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it. In response, Van Peebles snapped his fingers, and his crewmembers were <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> with rifles. The bikers stayed to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man <b>standing.</b> <b>There</b> was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E

5|$|Six of the 12 {{films have}} been adapted into novels—Friday the 13th 1 – 3, Jason Lives, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason—with Friday the 13th Part 3 being adapted twice. The first novel was Michael Avallone's 1982 {{adaptation}} of Friday the 13th Part 3; Avallone had previously adapted Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Shock Treatment. The author {{chose to use}} an alternate ending, one that was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the conclusion for his adaptation. In the alternate ending, Chris, {{who is in a}} canoe, hears her boyfriend Rick's voice and immediately runs back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> with a machete and decapitates her. The next book was not published until 1986, when Simon Hawke adapted Jason Lives. Hawke would also adapt the first three films into novels, and his adaptation of the original Friday the 13th was published in 1987, with novelizations of Part 2 and 3 both being published in 1988. Hawke's first adaptation, Jason Lives, introduced the character of Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, who was supposed to appear in the film before being cut by the studio. The book explains how Elias has Jason's body buried, instead of the planned cremation, after his death in The Final Chapter.|$|E

The Jewish community soon began moving into the surrounding areas of Dhoby Ghaut, Waterloo Street, Prinsep Street, Selegie Road and Wilkie Road.

Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, than no chance at all with someone she cannot love. The Emperor agrees to let Virgil and Johanna wed.|$|E
25|$|The hill is {{believed}} to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE. Assuming colocation with the biblical Mount Zion, its southern section would have been walled at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, in around 1850 BCE, by Canaanites who established a settlement there (or in the vicinity) named Jebus. Jewish tradition identifies it with Mount Moriah where the binding of Isaac took place. According to the Hebrew Bible, the Temple Mount was originally a threshing-floor owned by Araunah, a Jebusite. The prophet Gad suggested the area to King David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to YHWH, since a destroying angel was <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> when God stopped a great plague in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Early Chinese {{migrants}} to Jamaica brought elements of Chinese folk religion with them, most {{exemplified by the}} altar to Guan Yu which they erected in the old CBA building and which remains <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> even as the CBA moved its headquarters. However, {{with the passage of}} long decades since their ancestors first migrated from China, traditional Chinese religious practises have largely died out among Chinese Jamaicans. Some traditional practises persisted well into the 20th century, most evident at the Chinese Cemetery, where families would go to clean their ancestors' graves during the Qingming Festival in what was often organised as a communal activity by the CBA (referred to in English as Gah San, after the Hakka word 嫁山); however, with the emigration of much of the Chinese Jamaican community to the North American mainland, the public, communal aspect of this grave-cleaning died out, and indeed it was not carried out {{for more than a decade}} before attempts by the CBA to revive it in 2004.|$|E

After Henry takes off, Emma is visited by Ingrid, who tells her that she should embrace her true self, but Emma takes off after the conversation, and heads to Gold's Pawn Shop, where Gold, sensing Emma was in the place by the way the items were coming to life, offered her a chance to rid herself of her powers, and gives her a location as to where to meet him; unknown to Emma, Gold has other plans for her. Back at the loft, David, Mary Margaret, Killian and Elsa ponder their next plan by planning another search, when Henry arrives and tells them he found her, but failed to help her regain control of her magic.|$|E
25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline <b>standing</b> <b>there.</b> She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon shining through the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E
25|$|Wolverhampton has {{a number}} of live music venues; the largest {{occasionally}} used being the football ground, Molineux Stadium, which was used for a Bon Jovi concert in 2003, but the biggest indoor venue regularly used is Wolverhampton Civic Hall, with a standing capacity of 3,000. Second to that is Wulfrun Hall (part of the same complex as the Civic Hall, which is owned and operated by the City Council) which has a standing capacity of just over 1,100. The Civic Halls complex also has a newer venue, The Slade Rooms (named after the 1970s rock band), which has a capacity of approximately 550 <b>standing.</b> <b>There</b> are also a number of smaller venues with capacities of between 100 and 250, although the longest-established of these, the Wolverhampton Varsity, is now closed, as is the Little Civic. Other venues include the Light Bar in Fryer Street, the 'Numa Bar' and the Dog & Doublet (next to the old Little Civic), although the situation in this area of entertainment remains fluid. The 18th-century St John's Church is a popular venue for smaller scale classical concerts. The city is also home to Regent Records, a choral and organ music recording company, and Wolf Town DIY, an independent record label that primarily releases punk and alternative music by underground artists. The Midland Box Office is the primary sales point for most of Wolverhampton's venues and is situated in Queen Square, it is manned by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic staff.|$|E
