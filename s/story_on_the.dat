5|$|During 1962 Sykes was {{approached}} by the Russian-American composer Nicolas Nabokov, who was interested in making an opera from the Pinfold <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of a libretto provided by Sykes. Waugh gave his approval to the idea, and in March 1962 met with Nabokov. Discussions continued during the following months, before the project was abandoned in the summer.|$|E

5|$|After {{working for}} The Mirror {{for about a}} year, Hickok {{obtained}} {{a job with the}} Associated Press in 1928, where she became one of the wire service's top correspondents. Her November 1928 <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sinking of the SS Vestris was published in the New York Times under her own byline, the first woman's byline to appear in the paper. She also reported on the Lindbergh kidnapping and other national events. By 1932, she had become the nation's best-known female reporter.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E

Reading it, they realize {{it is from the}} Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor—and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It is found to be an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.|$|E

5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, while {{orbiting}} the Earth during a routine space mission with his crew, Colonel John Jameson and his ship are {{hit by a}} meteor shower. John struggles to get the ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at Cape Canaveral. The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man is a hero or a menace. Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, vibrating black goo {{on the bottom of the}} shuttle.|$|E

5|$|Radio City Music Hall's {{management}} {{refused to}} screen Citizen Kane for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that The American Weekly would run a defamatory <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller. Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst {{and refused to}} show the film. In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit {{if they did not}} release the film. Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{front page of the}} Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based the <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable {{of which was the}} death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E
