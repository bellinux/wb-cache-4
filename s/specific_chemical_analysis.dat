40|$|The {{study was}} a {{comparison}} of bioassay and HPLC analysis of artesunate (ARTS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in plasma. ARTS and DHA in plasma samples from patients treated with ARTS were quantified by HPLC and expressed as DHA. DHA-equivalents in the same plasma samples were measured using a standardised parasite culture technique. DHA concentrations estimated by both methods were highly correlated (bioassay = 0. 96 x HPLC + 11. 0; r(2) = 0. 92). At high concentrations (> 12 000 nmol/l) bioassay sometimes overestimated DHA. Bioassay of active drug in plasma correlates well with <b>specific</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> by HPLC.

40|$|For {{practical}} chromatographers it {{is extremely}} difficult to judge the merits and limitations of new technological developments. On the other hand, it is nearly impossible for those at the forefront of technology to judge the implications of their efforts for all specific applications of chromatography. Both chromatographers and researchers can be aided by a classification of the numerous specific applications into a few well-defined categories. In this paper, we propose such a classification of all chemical analysis by chromatography into three generic types of applications, viz. target-compound analysis, group-type separation, and fingerprinting. The requirements for each type are discussed in general terms. The classification scheme is applied to assess the benefits and limitations of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) and the possible additional benefits of using multivariate-analysis (MVA) techniques for each type of application. The conclusions pertaining to the generic types of applications are indicative for the implications of new developments for <b>specific</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> by chromatography. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Quadrupole {{ion trap}} mass {{spectrometry}} (QIT MS) {{is a powerful}} and commonly-employed method for the specific analysis of mass, composition, and structure of gas-phase ionic chemical species. Useful {{for a wide variety}} of tasks, applications of ion traps include environmental monitoring, surface analysis (including depth profiling and imaging), ion thermochemical property elucidation, protein and DNA sequencing, and high-resolution chemical separations (through ion soft-landing). Though the principles of QIT MS have been known for over half a century, innovations in instrumentation and applications continue. As new needs for <b>specific</b> and sensitive <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> arise, so also do new and more efficient analytical devices and methods of analysis. Such a trend is exemplified through the construction of a dual-source QIT mass spectrometer (described herein) capable of multi-source chemical analyses for the purposes of enhanced proteomic sequence coverage and for the strictly-controlled comparison of the structural differences in ion populations generated by different ionization techniques. Furthermore, as mass spectrometry becomes increasingly commonplace outside the bounds of the analytical laboratory, demand for capable researcher equipment is also increasing. Advances in instrument performance, such as can be had through enhanced power efficiency and the enabling of <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> of high mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) species (e. g., proteins), will open new doors to in situ <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> hand-portable mass spectrometers. Hence, research into new mass analyzer designs and methods of fabrication using stereolithography apparatus (SLA) for the purpose of creating enhanced-performance mass spectrometers are accordingly described in the text of this dissertation. ...|$|R

40|$|A broad {{screening}} programme, {{covering the}} most general phytochemical groups of compounds, was developed {{on the basis}} of Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). A total of 46 TLC systems, comprising 26 derivatization reagents, 3 stationary phases, and 4 mobile phases, were included. The TLC systems were classified according to the groups of phytochemical compounds detected: Alcohols and phenolic compounds; Carbohydrates; N-containing compounds; Organic acids and lipids; P-containing compounds; S-containing compounds, and Terpenoids. Furthermore, one group of TLC systems detected compounds from several of the mentioned groups. The screening programme was applied in the screening of potatoes (S. tuberosum L.), peas (P. sativum L.), kale (B. oleracea L.), carrots (D. carota L.), and apples (M. domestica Borkh.), cultivated with combinations of organic and conventional methods for plant protection and nutrient supply, for phytochemical differences (biomarkers). Distinctive phytochemical {{differences were found between the}} differently cultivated samples of these crops. In peas and carrots only one biomarker was found. In peas the biomarker was related to the soil conditions, while the biomarker in carrots was related to the use of pesticides. In potato, two biomarkers related to the use of pesticides were found. Three biomarkers were found in kale. Two of these could be related to the use of pesticide, while the last was related to either fertiliser or soil conditions. Several biomarkers were found apples, but a relation to the cultivation methods was not clear. Three of the biomarkers in apples could be related to either the use of pesticides or fertiliser, while no conclusions could be drawn from the other biomarkers found. The results of the screening programme form the basis for a potential development of a kit to detect whether crops are organically- or conventionally cultivated. Furthermore, the results from this part and other parts of the project "Organic food and health – a multigenerational animal experiment" provide basis for the selection of which secondary compounds to quantify by <b>specific</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis,</b> isolate, and/or structure elucidation. ...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceuticals {{that are}} {{intended}} for human use are frequently detected in the aquatic environment. This is predominantly from the excretion of pharmaceuticals by patients, in their urine and faeces, which subsequently enter sewage treatment plants. Sewage treatment provides a final opportunity for pharmaceutical removal, prior to discharge into the environment, however, removal is often incomplete. Once in the environment, pharmaceuticals {{have the potential to}} cause effects on aquatic organisms. Sewage treatment plants, that are designed to meet statutory discharge consents for nutrients, are increasing in number. These plants, capable of biological nutrient removal, are understudied for the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals. This thesis presents research findings on the behaviour, fate and removal of selected pharmaceuticals in a bespoke laboratory rig, and in operational biological nutrient removal sewage treatment plants. Pharmaceuticals possessing a broad range of physical and chemical properties were selected for this research, they included: salicylic acid, caffeine, propranolol, diclofenac and carbamazepine. Sensitive chromatographic methods were developed to quantify the analytes in a laboratory sequencing batch reactor rig and in operational plants. Radiolabelled 14 C isotopes of salicylic acid, caffeine, propranolol and diclofenac were dosed into the laboratory rig. The compounds exhibited different behaviours during a simulated sewage treatment process. Salicylic acid and caffeine produced the highest amount of biodegradation, with 25. 2 % and 14. 5 % of the radiolabel mineralised to 14 CO 2 in the rig. However, parent degradation is likely to have been higher, since neither compound could be detected in the effluent by <b>specific</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis.</b> These findings were replicated in the operational sewage treatment plants, with > 97 % removal of both pharmaceuticals, in all three plants investigated. Propranolol and diclofenac were less affected by biodegradation processes, and produced 3. 7 % and 0. 2 % mineralisation, respectively, in the laboratory rig. Furthermore, 33. 8 % of the radioactivity associated to 14 C propranolol was detected in the rig solids. These compounds showed insignificant removal from two operational plants; 6. 8 % and 20. 9 % (propranolol) and - 0. 9 % and - 39. 4 % (diclofenac). Monitoring of operational plants showed that concentrations of propranolol were highest in the activated sludge tanks at all three sites. This supports the findings from the rig, that propranolol interacts with the sludge, which might be more significant in plants with lower sludge wastage rates, such as sequencing batch reactors. This could have implications for the terrestrial environment, and therefore, terrestrial risk assessments should be refined accordingly. Monitoring of the operational sewage treatment plants highlighted the widespread presence, and recalcitrant behaviour, of carbamazepine during biological sewage treatment. Future work should focus on investigating the mechanisms of removal, of this pharmaceutical in the laboratory sequencing batch reactor. This work highlighted the problems biological systems face in effectively removing recalcitrant pharmaceuticals. Advanced wastewater treatment should be considered, if complete removal is desired.

Such monitoring were performed using in the water sediment’s traps to collect the suspension materials, the atmospheric sampling was carried out by installing dedicated deposimeters. On the Accesa lake there were made seasonal water monitorings and the system was studied by a carrot of sediment to a depth of 800 cm. <b>Specific</b> <b>chemical</b> and isotopic <b>analysis</b> were then conducted on these samples, performed at the Institute of Geosciences and Earth Resources (IGG) of the National Research Council in Pisa laboratories.
