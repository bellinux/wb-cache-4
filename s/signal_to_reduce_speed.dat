5000|$|Torpedo (US): A small {{explosive}} device {{strapped to the}} top of the rail to alert an approaching train of danger ahead. A torpedo creates a loud noise upon contact with a locomotive wheel, <b>signaling</b> the engineer <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> <b>to</b> 20 mph or less; the train cannot resume its original speed until it has traveled at least a mile beyond where it encountered the device. Traditionally used in pairs to ensure that the sound registered with train crews, torpedoes today are essentially obsolete as modern locomotive cabs' soundproof construction renders the devices useless.

50|$|Speed/event {{recording}} devices {{indicated that the}} Conrail locomotives were moving at approximately 60 mph when their brakes were applied for an emergency stop, after they had passed the trackside signals. This was, Gates later claimed, {{when he realized that}} he did not have a wayside <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> proceed north at the interlocking. He was, however, moving too fast to stop before passing the signal indicating he should stop clear of the main track on which #94 was approaching. Had Gates reacted either <b>to</b> an approach <b>signal</b> instructing him <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed,</b> or <b>to</b> the stop <b>signal</b> itself in a timely fashion, or had the brakeman called out the state of the signals as he was supposed to do, it was likely the Conrail engines could have stopped short of the switch.|$|R
50|$|An Electronic Trailer Sway Control was {{introduced}} that {{integrated into the}} standard StabiliTrak system. This can detect the occurrence of trailer sway that {{may be caused by}} improper trailer weight balance or excessive vehicle speed. If the trailer begins to sway, StabiliTrak will apply brakes individually, independent of the driver controlling the brake pedal, to assist stabilizing the vehicle. Under these conditions a light will flash <b>to</b> <b>signal</b> the driver <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> vehicle <b>speed.</b> If trailer sway continues, the system will <b>reduce</b> engine torque <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the <b>speed</b> of the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Speeding {{is still}} common {{practise}} on many roads {{and contributes to}} {{a significant number of}} crashes. Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) systems aim <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeding</b> in a more or less intrusive manner. This is promising, however, the acceptability of ISA systems is still very low. Another promising approach to_reduce speeding is by improving the credibility of speed limits. A driving simulator study is conducted to investigate the effect of credibility, with or without using an open informative and warning ISA. The results show that both ISA and credibility of speed limits are effective measures <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeding.</b> Non-ISA users appear to be more sensitive for the credibility of speed limits than ISA users.

50|$|The track's layout {{has changed}} {{slightly}} {{from its original}} layout. It appears that the curve prior to where the pits are now was tightened {{to create a more}} pronounced corner ahead of the pits, and perhaps <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeds</b> on the racing line going past the new pit exit. On {{the opposite side of the}} lake, where start/finish used to be located, a chicane has been added at the first high speed bend along that stretch. Also, on the initial descending run along the lake, there has been another chicane added <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeds</b> into the following corner that has limited run-off. Therefore, the original course had slightly shorter length of 6.186 km (3.844 mi).|$|R
5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> and shorten his turn radius, {{rather than the}} standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|R
