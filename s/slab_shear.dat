40|$|An {{explanation}} is {{provided for the}} slab behaviour in composite beams at web holes where the concrete slab carries heavy vertical shear. This {{is based on the}} truss concept, and requires consideration of shear studs in the hole region as vertical tension members. According to this, a structural action between the concrete slab and shear connectors for carrying or transferring vertical shear to the steel beam was clearly identified. On the basis of the slab behaviour identified, truss idealizations capable of determining the <b>slab</b> <b>shear</b> carrying capacity in a rational manner were developed. Then, the ultimate strength for composite beams at web holes was formulated including the truss idealizations. Another ultimate strength analysis accounting for the <b>slab</b> <b>shear</b> carrying capacity in a simple manner, which was also developed during this research project, is given. This provided the fundamental solution procedure for the plastic analysis used. A series of nine tests was carried out with particular attention being directed to the verification of the proposed truss analogy. The major test parameters included the configurations of the studs in the hole region, the width of the concrete slab and stud detailing near the high moment end of the hole. The ultimate strength predictions were made by the two methods developed, and compared with previous and present test results...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the response of slab-column connections containing various types of shear reinforcement when subjected to the combination of gravitational and lateral cyclic loads. The three test specimens were full-scale representations of exterior slab-column connections of a prototype apartment building in Korea. The control specimen had no shear reinforcements, while the other specimens had CS-Bar and SS-Bar as shear reinforcements. The control specimen failed due to the punching shear around the slab-column connection at 4. 0 % drift. None of the specimens with shear reinforcement experienced punching shear failure up to 4. 4 % drift. The two types of <b>slab</b> <b>shear</b> reinforcements proved to be equally effective in resisting punching shear failure of these connections subjected to relatively low levels of gravity load.

Traditional methods in prediction of load varying capacity of bridges are usually {{based on the}} design blueprints and may not reflect the bridge condition as is. In this paper, the nonlinear finite element analysis, incorporating the model updating technique, is used to predict the behaviour of a 30 -year-old slab-girder bridge. The original finite element model based on the design drawings is updated by modifying the stiffness parameters of the girders, <b>slab,</b> <b>shear</b> connectors and bearings so that the vibration properties of the model match the field vibration measurement data. The updated model represents the present condition of the bridge better than the original model {{that is based on}} the design blueprints.

Various works {{have been carried out}} to study the behavior of these structures and increase the lateral stiffness. The advances in three-dimensional structural analysis and computing resources have allowed the efficient and safe design of increasingly taller structures. Tall buildings are being increasingly designed with structural system comprising of flat slab or flat plate system and shear wall with or without perimeter beams. The behavior of this system under lateral loads is dependent on numerous parameters such as the height of the building, floor plate size, size and location of the shear wall, flat slab spans. The flexural stiffness of floors may have some influence on the lateral response of the structure. Under lateral loading floor and roof systems in reinforced concrete buildings act as diaphragms to transfer lateral loads to the vertical lateral force resisting system.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of existing solid slab bridges in the Netherlands is under discussion for two reasons: 1) the increased traffic loads and volumes and 2) {{the fact that}} the majority of the existing bridges were built before 1976, and are thus reaching the end of their original life span. Upon assessment according to the governing codes, a large number of slab bridges are found to be shear-critical. However, the shear capacity as prescribed by the codes is based on experiments on beams in shear. Slabs subjected to concentrated loads (such as truck wheel load) are assumed to have additional capacity as a result of transverse load redistribution. This thesis studies the {{capacity of}} slabs under concentrated loads close to supports. A literature review, resulting in a <b>slab</b> <b>shear</b> database with 215 experiments from the literature, is used to study the mechanisms at work in one-way and two-way shear. For this research, 156 experiments were carried out on 38 half-scale bridge deck specimens. The experimental results are studied by means of a parameter analysis. To determine the capacity of slabs in shear subjected to concentrated loads, two methods are proposed in the thesis: 1) the Modified Bond Model, a new theory to determine the capacity of slabs subjected to concentrated loads; and 2) by using a code extension proposal that results from probabilistic calculations following the safety philosophy of the Eurocodes. Finally, the link to the assessment practice is made by formulating recommendations, improving the Quick Scan assessment tool of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, and then applying this to cases of existing solid slab bridges.

The texture and surface moisture condition of the HCU just before receiving concrete topping may affect the overall strength of the slabs when the concrete topping and the HCU act compositely during service. This paper presents the experimental study on shear-flexure capacity of composite slabs using HCU and concrete topping. Full scale three point load test are carried out on 14 composite slab specimens with different surface roughness and surface condition of the HCU before casting the concrete topping. The surface roughness considered is smooth and rough, while the moisture conditions are dry, ponded and optimum wet. The effect of the longitudinal joint between the HCU panels is also considered.

40|$|The {{strength}} of the composite deck slab depends mainly on the longitudinal shear transfer mechanism at the interface between steel and concrete. The bond strength developed by the cement paste is weak and causes premature failure of composite deck slab.

Development of embossment patterns requires an advanced technology which makes the deck profile expensive. Fastening studs by welding weakens the joint strength and also escalates the cost.
