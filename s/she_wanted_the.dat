5|$|After Wilson's {{temporary}} departure during Houses fifth season, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times immediately {{stated that}} <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> character {{to return to}} the show. Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that Dr. House's relationship with Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), who temporarily replaced Wilson, was far more natural than House's relationship with Wilson. Critics from TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, Blog Critics and USA Today, all found Leonard's performance in the season 4 finale worthy of an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} and costume design {{to reflect the}} themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink picket fence were filmed in Palmdale, California.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Tour was {{the debut}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The tour {{supported}} her first two studio albums, Madonna (1983) and Like a Virgin (1984). Although initially planned {{for an international}} audience, the tour was restricted to the United States and Canada. Warner decided to send Madonna on tour after Like a Virgin became a success. After an official announcement on March 15, 1985, Madonna and her team began production plans. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> tour to be a reflection of her own self and collaborated with designer Maripol for the costumes.|$|E

5|$|When O'Brien {{finally decided}} to write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too much into her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E
25|$|On December 16, 1893, the British Minister to Hawaii {{was given}} {{permission}} to land marines from HMS Champion {{for the protection}} of British interests; the ship's captain predicted that Liliuokalani would be restored by the U.S. military. In a November 1893 meeting with Willis, Liliuokalani indicated that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> revolutionaries punished and their property confiscated, despite Willis' desire for her to grant amnesty to her enemies.|$|E

When Bronte were relegated Taylor moved to Knowsley United, who became Liverpool Ladies shortly after losing the FA Women's Cup final to Doncaster Belles in 1994. Taylor had joined Knowsley United in preference to the dominant Doncaster Belles because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> challenge of playing for a developing club.|$|E
25|$|Лоза (The Vine, 1923) {{contained}} 23 poems, which trace Parnok's {{life from}} her physical {{birth to her}} spiritual rebirth in Sudak. The poems trace her first awakening to poetry, her frustration at being unable to express herself as <b>she</b> <b>wanted,</b> <b>the</b> new ideas planted by Tsvetaeva, her failure {{to be able to}} write seriously without being distracted by love interests and life, and finally her recognition and acknowledgement that poetry was her true vocation. Her poems, were like her children, her legacy, requiring spiritual nurturing, rather than purely words inspired by sexual passion.|$|E
25|$|Asle Helgelien {{arrived in}} La Porte and told Sheriff Smutzer that he {{believed}} his brother had met with foul play at Gunness' hands. Joe Maxson came forward with information {{that could not be}} ignored. He told the Sheriff that Gunness had ordered him to bring loads of dirt by wheelbarrow to a large area surrounded by a high wire fence where the hogs were fed. Maxson said that there were many deep depressions in the ground that had been covered by dirt. These filled-in holes, Gunness had told Maxson, contained rubbish. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> ground made level, so he filled in the depressions.|$|E

25|$|Harlem Duet is {{considered}} to be a precursor to Shakespeare's Othello. The location is set on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X Boulevards. Sears choose this location because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> audience to grasp the concept of race in the country, and the familiar streets were more tangible to the North American Audience. The story follows main characters Othello and Billie and there withering marriage as Othello begins to lean towards a white identity mostly because of his affair with a character named Mona, who is a white woman. The story paints a picture of the white dominated North America.|$|E
25|$|When the manga began serialization, Arakawa was {{considering}} several major plot points, including the ending. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> Elric brothers to recover their bodiesat least partly. As the plot continued, {{she thought that}} some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes. Arakawa said the manga authors Suihō Tagawa and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs; she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them. She found that the easiest of the series's characters to draw were Alex Louis Armstrong, and the little animals. Arakawa likes dogs so she included several {{of them in the}} story. Arakawa made comedy central to the manga's story because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimize sad scenes.|$|E
25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if {{she might be able to}} respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E

25|$|Having {{no plans}} {{of working with}} {{producers}} or professional writers, Lavigne wrote much of the album with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, {{with whom she had}} developed a friendship in the summer of 2003. Kreviazuk, whose husband Raine Maida's band Our Lady Peace opened for Lavigne's concert in Europe, introduced herself at an after-party for the SARS benefit concerts held in Toronto in June 2003. The following day, Lavigne and Kreviazuk ate lunch together, during when Lavigne shared how <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> development of the album to be. They wrote songs for almost three weeks at Maida's warehouse in Toronto. Kreviazuk invited Lavigne to continue working in a Malibu, California house she shared with Maida, which contained a recording studio. Many of the tracks in the album were recorded in Malibu.|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, Diehl-Armstrong {{confided to}} a state trooper that she had {{information}} about the Wells' case and after meeting with FBI agents, said she would tell them everything she knew if she was transferred from Muncy State Penitentiary to a minimum-security prison in Cambridge Springs. During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb and said that Rothstein was the mastermind of the plot and that Wells had been {{directly involved in the}} plan. In late 2005, Kenneth Barnes, an ex-television repairman in jail on unrelated drug charges and friend of Diehl-Armstrong, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. Barnes told investigators that would tell them the whole story in return for a reduced sentence. He told them that Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> money to pay Barnes to kill her father, whom she believed was wasting her inheritance.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
