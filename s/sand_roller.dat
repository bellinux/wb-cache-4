5|$|The Snake River below Shoshone Falls {{is home to}} thirty-five native fish species, {{of which}} twelve are {{also found in the}} Columbia River and four of which are endemic to the Snake: the relict <b>sand</b> <b>roller</b> (Percopsis transmontana) of the Percopsidae family, the shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), the maginated sculpin (Cottus marginatus), and the Oregon chub (Oregonichthys crameri). The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins. The lower Snake River also {{supports}} seven species of Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus). There are also high, often localized levels of mollusc endemism, especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and middle Snake River. The mollusc richness extends into the lower Columbia River and tributaries such as the Deschutes River.|$|E

50|$|Percopsis transmontana, the <b>Sand</b> <b>roller,</b> is {{a species}} of percopsiform fish endemic to the Columbia River {{drainage}} in the northwestern United States. This species grows to a length of 9.6 cm TL. Sand rollers can live up to 6 years in slow-moving, sandy-bottomed streams and rivers among vegetation. Their diet includes flies and Trichoptera, although juveniles also {{have been known to}} eat crustacean zooplankton.|$|E
40|$|During May-September 1995, we {{replicated}} {{an earlier}} (1984 - 85) study of fishes in shoreline habitats of the John Day Reservoir, Columbia River, to investigate fish assemblage structure at several {{spatial and temporal}} scales. A total of 37, 400 resident fishes representing 24 taxa was collected in 359 beach seine hauls. Fish catch composition during 1984 and 1985 was very similar, but was greatly different from catch in 1995. During 1984 - 1985, four native taxa (chiselmouth, northern pikeminnow, suckers, and <b>sand</b> <b>rollers)</b> constituted more than 90 % of the combined main-channel catch, with introduced taxa comprising only 1. 3 % of the main-channel catch. In contrast, during 1995 only 37. 7 % of the main-channel catch comprised chiselmouth, northern pikeminnow, suckers, and <b>sand</b> <b>rollers,</b> while 33. 9 % were introduced taxa, primarily sunfishes and yellow perch. This shift in catch composition was greatest in the lower reservoir where the 1995 catch was 61 % introduced taxa. Although changes in species composition of near-shore reservoir fish assemblages over the 10 -yr period appeared to be substantial, we are unsure of annual variability since we have only one season of sampling for comparison with the earlier study. The differences we observed could be a long-term response to reservoir aging, a short-term reaction to annual differences in hydrologic and thermal regimes, or simply the naturally varying reproductive success of some speciesBarfoot et al "Resident fish assemblages in shallow shorelines of a Columbia River impoundment.

40|$|In {{the rear}} of the Japanese firing line there was much work to be done, work for which trained {{soldiers}} were not necessary, the work of coolies. There were, for instance, the eighteen eleven-inch mortars, with their enormous gun-carriages, to be hauled into place, and men had to do it, because it is impossible to get a hundred mules or oxen to tug with concerted action. Eight hundred of these students got into harness to drag one gun over the <b>sand</b> on <b>rollers,</b> silent, {{in the shade of the}} night, lest a noise might draw a shell from the forts of Port Arthur frowning in the background of the picture. The students were also used to carry the wounded to the hospitals at Dalny on stretchers, and to tend them, or to carry provisions from Dalny to the encampments of the soldiers in the firing line. Their services were rendered free, as they received no compensation beyond their food and a place to sleep.

The reason might be that a thin layer of fine <b>sand</b> acted as <b>rollers</b> for the rolling of the gravel, leading to the reduction of effective friction resistance during the movement; the interactions between particles became more complicated than they just acted as a single-row roller to lubricate the gravel when excessive amount of fine sand was involved. These rollers threw into disarray so that the particles might be either blocked or forced into sliding. Furthermore, {{from the point of view}} of energy, the energy was consumed significantly due to interegranular friction when excessive amount of fine sand was involved that the gravel was embedded in a matrix of fine sand.|$|R
