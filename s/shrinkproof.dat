40|$|Comparative {{studies have}} been made of three types of {{treatments}} which utilize diisocy-anates for stabilization of wool yarns and fabrics, {{and it has been}} shown that the procedures which utilize the technique of interfacial polymerization as developed by Whitfield et al. is most effective. The procedures of interfacial formation of polyurea upon fiber surface were studied in detail, and it was found that the employment of ethylene diamine, which had not hitherto been used as a diamine component, resulted in the best <b>shrinkproof</b> effect. The electron microscopic study revealed that the fibers treated by this procedure were masked uniformly by the polyurea resin. The conditions of treatment were varied, and the influence of these conditions upon the uptake and <b>shrinkproof</b> effect was studied. The uptake of from 2 to 5 % was sufficient to make the yarns and fabrics practically unshrinkable. The mechanical properties and the moisture regain of the fibers were not significantly affected by the treatment. The anti-scale coefficient of friction decreased by the treatment, and therefore the directional frictional effect decreased. This would be the main factor of producing the <b>shrinkproof</b> effect...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{environmentally}} friendly and affordable <b>shrinkproofing</b> treatments for wool tops the chlorine-/Hercosett-treatment represents {{the state of the art}} so far. The aim of the research project was the development of a plasma-supported <b>shrinkproofing</b> treatment for wool. As a result of interdisciplinary work between industrial enterprises and research institutions a new process has been developed based on a plasma treatment at atmospheric conditions followed by the application of an AOX-free resin which has been tailored for the plasma treated fibre surface. This process can be carried out continuously on wool top and guarantees that the treated material will be fully machine washable. This opens up the exciting new possibility to the wool industry of having an environmentally friendly <b>shrinkproofing</b> process of wool in the near future. (orig.)

40|$|Wool fibres {{have been}} treated with {{low-temperature}} plasma (LTP) with oxygen, nitrogen and gas mixture (25 : 75 hydrogen/nitrogen). It is observed that the chemical composition of wool fibre surface varies differently with the different plasma gases used. The surface chemical composition of the different LTP-treated wool fibres has also been evaluated with FTIR-ATR, XPS and saturated adsorption value. The results reveal that the surface chemical and physical compositions of wool fibre change on LTP treatment. The change in compositions might affect the wool dyeing and finishing processes such as <b>shrinkproofing</b> treatments. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Fourier transfonn (FT) Raman, Raman {{microspectroscopy}} and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{have been}} used for the structural analysis and characterisation of untreated and chemically treated wool fibres. For FT -Raman spectroscopy novel methods of sample presentation have been developed and optimised for the analysis of wool. No significant fluorescence was observed and the spectra could be obtained routinely. The stability of wool keratin to the laser source was investigated and the visual and spectroscopic signs of sample damage were established. Wool keratin was found to be extremely robust with no signs of sample degradation observed for laser powers of up to 600 m W and for exposure times of up to seven and half hours. Due to improvements in band resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, several previously unobserved spectral features have become apparent. The assignment of the Raman active vibrational modes of wool have been reviewed and updated to include these features. The infrared spectroscopic techniques of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and photoacoustic (P A) {{have been used}} to examine <b>shrinkproofed</b> and mothproofed wool samples. <b>Shrinkproofing</b> is an oxidative chemical treatment used to selectively modifY the surface of a wool fibre. Mothproofing is a chemical treatment applied to wool for the prevention of insect attack. The ability of PAS and A TR to vary the penetration depth by varying certain instrumental parameters was used to obtain spectra of the near surface regions of these chemically treated samples. These spectra were compared with those taken with a greater penetration depth, which therefore represent more of the bulk wool sample. The PA and ATR spectra demonstrated that oxidation was restricted to the near-surface layer of wool. Extensive curve fitting of ATR spectra of untreated wool indicated that cuticle was composed of a mixed protein conformation, but was predominately that of an a. -helix. The cortex was proposed to be a mixture of both a. helical and -pleated sheet protein conformations. These findings were supported by PAS depth profiling results. Raman microspectroscopy was used in an extensive investigation of the molecular structure of the wool fibre. This included determining the orientation of certain functional groups within the wool fibre and the symmetry of particular vibrations. The orientation ofbonds within the wool fibre was investigated by orientating the wool fibre axis parallel and then perpendicular to the plane of polarisation of the electric vector of the incident radiation. It was experimentally determined that the majority of C=O and N-H bonds of the peptide bond of wool lie parallel to the fibre axis. Additionally, a number of the important vibrations associated with the a-helix were also found to lie parallel to the fibre axis. Further investigation into the molecular structure of wool involved determining what effect stretching the wool fibre had on bond orientation. Raman spectra of stretched and unstretched wool fibres indicated that extension altered the orientation ofthe aromatic rings, the CH 2 and CH 3 groups of the amino acids. Curve fitting results revealed that extension resulted in significant destruction of the a-helix structure a substantial increase in the P-pleated sheet structure. Finally, depolarisation ratios were calculated for Raman spectra. The vibrations associated with the aromatic rings of amino acids had very low ratios which indicated that the vibrations were highly symmetrical...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to examine, if wet {{processing}} of wool e. g. chlorination, chlorine/Hercosett treatment and reactive wool dyeing, generates modified lipids, which might contribute to skin irritation. Therefore, the composition of solvent extractable cell membrane lipids of industrially processed wool {{has been compared to}} that of raw white wool top. To assess possible modifications of the cell membrane lipids, several chromatographic techniques, mainly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas-Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry coupling (GC/MS), have been used. In the cases where modified lipid components were detected in the solvent extractable lipids of industrially processed wool, the solubility of the modified lipid components in artificial sweat solutions was analyzed. Due to their amino function sphingolipids are possible targets for modification by reactive dyeing. However, since comparatively little is known about their chemical composition in wool, the sphingolipids were extracted from the wool by chloroform/methanol and characterized by GC/MS. As a consequence of the high oxidation potential of free chlorines, the chlorination treatment in the <b>shrinkproofing</b> process of wool leads mainly to the formation of hydroxy fatty acids, but not to the formation of chlorinated lipids. 9, 10 -Dihydroxy stearic acid represents {{the main part of the}} reaction products when the lipid reference oleic acids is subjected to chlorination. It was only detected in the ethanol-soluble lipids of the wool samples which had been chlorinated in model laboratory experiments, but not in the lipid fractions of wool samples with industrial chlorination or Hercosett-treatment TLC revealed that the lipid fractions of wool samples, which had been dyed with reactive dyestuff combinations (consisting of Lanasol, Remazol and Realan dyestuffs) contain UV active and coloured compounds. In one case a yellow component was detected which is directly derived from a dyestuff (Realan Golden yellow RC 84 %), in another case a lipid compound modified by the applied dyestuffs was detected. GC/MS analyses of chloroform/methanol-soluble sphingolipids showed that the free ceramides of wool consist mainly of nonhydroxy acid (C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 20 : 0 C 22 : 0, C 24 : 0) amidified sphinganine- and sphingosine related ceramides. Sphinganine was found to be the main long-chain base in the free ceramides of wool. A similar composition for the long-chain bases is described in the in the literature for the ceramides of human hair. In contrast to the ceramides of human hair, the ceramide fraction of wool do not contain alpha-hydroxy fatty acids. To analyze the chloroform/methanol-soluble cerebrosides of wool by GC/MS the amide-linked fatty acids and the glycosidic carbohydrates were released by acid methanolysis. A methyl galactoside was determined to be present as the basic carbohydrate compound of the cerebrosides in wool. No major changes were observed in the qualitative composition of ceramides after dyeing of wool...|$|R
