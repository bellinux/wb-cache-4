500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's <b>standard</b> <b>response</b> to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} two new voltage-mode (VM) {{universal}} filters employing three plus-type differential voltage current conveyors (DVCC+s) and grounded passive elements are presented. The first proposed filter is a single-input five-output (SIFO) circuit which can realize simultaneously {{all of the}} <b>standard</b> <b>responses,</b> i. e. low-pass (LP), band-pass (BP), high-pass (HP), all-pass (AP) and notch (NH) from the same configuration. The second proposed circuit is a three-input single-output (TISO) universal filter for realizing <b>standard</b> <b>responses</b> depending on {{the selection of the}} input signal from the same topology. Both of the proposed filters have the advantage of a high input impedance, which enables easy cascading to obtain higher order filters. The proposed filters are simulated using the SPICE program to verify the theoretical analysis...|$|R

2500|$|In 1968, {{the record}} company EMI formed a new company called EMI Films, headed by {{producers}} Barry Spikings and Michael Deeley.

The spec script was about people who go to Las Vegas to play Russian roulette. [...] "The screenplay had struck me as brilliant," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "but it wasn't complete. The trick would be {{to find a way to}} turn a very clever piece of writing into a practical, realizable film." [...] When the movie was being planned during the mid-1970s, Vietnam was still a taboo subject with all major Hollywood studios.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued by several {{philosophers}} that a deflationary conception of truth, unlike more robust conceptions of truth, cannot properly account for the nature of moral discourse. This is due to what I will call the “quick route problem”: There is a quick route from any deflationary theory of truth and certain obvious features of moral practice to the attribution of truth to moral utterances. The <b>standard</b> <b>responses</b> to the quick route problem are either to urge accepting a conception of truth more robust than deflationism (Boghossian 1990), or to revise deflationary accounts in order to block straightforward attribution of truth to moral utterances (Field 1994). I contend that neither of these <b>standard</b> <b>responses</b> is well-motivated, for it is a merit of deflationary accounts rather than a defect that such accounts present a quick route to moral truth...|$|R

40|$|In lieu of {{traditional}} training of examiners to identify cerebral palsy on a neurologic examination at age 1 year, we proposed {{an alternative approach}} using a multimedia training video and CD-ROM we developed after a two-step validation process. We hypothesized that use of CD-ROM interactive training will lead to reliable and valid performance of the neurologic examination by both pediatric neurologists and nonpediatric neurologists. All examiners were asked {{to take one of}} six interobserver variability tests found on the CD-ROM on two occasions. In the first interobserver variability evaluation, 89 % (531 of 594) of the responses agreed with the gold <b>standard</b> <b>responses.</b> Following annotated feedback to the examiners about the two items that had a 60 % correct rate, the correct response rate rose to 93 % (114 of 123). In the second interobserver variability evaluation, 88 % (493 of 560) of the responses agreed with the gold <b>standard</b> <b>responses.</b> Following annotated feedback to the examiners about the four items that had a 70 % correct rate, the correct response rate rose to 96 % (104 of 108). Interactive CD-ROM examination training is an efficient and cost-effective means of training both neurologists and non-neurologists to perform structured neurologic examinations in 1 -year-old children. It provides an effective means to evaluate interobserver variability, offers a route for feedback, and creates an opportunity to reevaluate variability, both immediately and at periodic intervals...|$|R
40|$|This is the publisher’s final pdf. The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Pion Publishing {{and can be}} found at: [URL] durations in a range of standard durations are typically overreproduced and long durations underreproduced (‘Vierordt’s Law’). This contextual distortion may result from each trial assimilating the central tendency of the preceding series. We examine whether responses as well as standard durations contribute to this distortion. Two experiments using nonequal-setting ratio tasks are described. On equal-setting ratio tasks the means of the <b>standards</b> and <b>responses</b> are nearly equal, but in half-setting and double-setting <b>standards</b> and <b>responses</b> differ. In both experiments a central tendency of <b>standards</b> plus <b>responses</b> better predicted the indifference interval than did the mean of the standards alone. The coefficients of variation were larger for all double-setting conditions than for half-setting at the same response durations, suggesting pooling of the trial variance with the central tendency’s variance. Longer equal-setting reproductions were generated by randomly intermixing equal-setting with double-setting than by intermixing with half-setting. Thus, assimilation of a central tendency that includes both <b>standards</b> and <b>responses</b> can account for the location of the indifference intervals (‘Vierordt’s Law’), for the response variation and for the additive effect we observed where two entire response curves (for equal-setting) were shifted relative to each other by the influence of nonequal-setting trials...|$|R
