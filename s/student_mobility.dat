40|$|This paper {{advances}} theorising around student geographies {{in higher}} education (HE). It extends recent work, which has problematised the primacy of social class and binary thinking about <b>student</b> <b>mobilities,</b> and presents local/non-local experiences and im/mobility as a defining dualism. Drawing on a qualitative longitudinal study of women’s experiences during and on completion of HE, the following explores {{the ways in which}} a more diverse and constantly negotiated set of mobility practices emerge relationally, in the stratified field of HE, and through shifting personal and emotional attachments. Theoretically, the paper develops a new approach to <b>student</b> <b>mobilities,</b> synthesising Bourdieu’s dominant notions of field with relational theories pertaining to mobilities (e. g. Adey, 2009), emotion (e. g. Holmes, 2010) and personal life (e. g. Mason, 2004; Smart, 2007). Such an approach makes it possible to move beyond the binary thinking that has become entrenched in policy and academic debates about <b>student</b> <b>mobilities,</b> and recognise a broader range of movements, flows, stops and starts that emerge relationally, emotionally and temporally as students and graduates move into and through HE. It is argued here that, given the policy emphasis on accelerated and flexible HE provision (BIS, 2016), a gradational view of <b>student</b> <b>mobilities</b> is more important than ever...|$|R
25|$|IFMSA {{has always}} focused on <b>student</b> <b>mobility</b> and {{exchange}} {{as well as}} conference and workshop organization. The first conferences were the Student International Clinical Conferences, which were quite successful in the 1950s. Various summer schools have been organized through the years, starting in 1963 in Denmark, the UK and Scandinavia. Other conferences have discussed medical education, drugs and AIDS and HIV issues. In the 1960s projects were organized to help less advantaged students in developing countries the Book Aid project, which sought to send medical books from wealthier nations and the Equipment Appeal, which promoted the shipping of surplus medical equipment to these countries.|$|E
25|$|The school {{also runs}} {{exchange}} programmes with the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Fuqua School of Business, Kellogg School of Management, Stern School of Business and Yale School of Management {{as part of}} its MSc in International Management and an undergraduate student exchange programme with the University of California, Berkeley in Political Science. It also participates in Key Action 1 of the European Union-wide Erasmus+ programme, encouraging staff and <b>student</b> <b>mobility</b> for teaching, although not the other Key Actions in the programme. The School {{is a member of the}} Association of Commonwealth Universities, the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs, the European University Association, the G5, the Global Alliance in Management Education, the Russell Group and Universities UK, and is often considered part of the 'Golden Triangle' of British universities.|$|E
25|$|If Scotland {{became an}} {{independent}} state, {{students from the}} rest of the UK would be in the position in which students {{from the rest of}} the EU are. A University of Edinburgh study found that this would cause a loss in funding and could potentially squeeze out Scottish students. The study suggested three courses of action for an independent Scotland: introduce tuition fees for all students; negotiate an agreement with the EU where a quota of student places would be reserved for Scots; or introduce a separate admissions service for students from other EU member states, with an admission fee attached. It concluded that the EU may allow a quota system for some specialist subjects, such as medicine, where there is a clear need for local students to be trained for particular careers, but that other subjects would not be eligible. The study also found that their third suggestion would run against the spirit of the Bologna agreement, which aims to encourage EU <b>student</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E

Second part focus on qualitative research among selected companies and quantitative research among <b>students</b> about <b>student</b> <b>mobilities</b> and their impact on employment. The results of the thesis provide information about relationship between studying abroad and future career prospects and can serve as an overview for students who are deciding whether to go study abroad or not as well for employers to have better awareness about their possible candidates´ expectations.

40|$|The Bologna Process {{aimed to}} build a European Higher Education Area {{promoting}} <b>student's</b> <b>mobility.</b> The adoption of Bologna Declaration directives requires a self management distributed approach to deal with <b>student's</b> <b>mobility,</b> allowing frequent updates in institutions rules or legislation. This paper suggests a computational system architecture, which follows a social network design. A set of structured annotations is proposed in order to organize the user's information. For instance, when the user is a student its annotations are organized into an academic record. The academic record data is used to discover interests, namely <b>mobility</b> interests, among <b>students</b> that belongs the academic network.

40|$|The role of education’s {{quality in}} {{determining}} international students’ choice of study destination was discussed by several studies. However, it only {{seems to have}} gained a huge prominence recently by constituting a theme in the quality management field involving empirical studies. In spite of such prominence the theme does not seems to provide sufficient empirical evidence forging a nexus between quality assurance practices, training needs and international <b>student’s</b> <b>mobility.</b> This research work therefore attempts to fill this gap by examining how the search for quality education and training needs satisfaction play role in international <b>student’s</b> <b>mobility.</b> Six dimensions of quality assurance in education were identified through extensive literature reviewed, three dimensions of training needs were equally revealed by the literature. Nine hypotheses were thus developed using these dimensions with the view to explain the relationship among the variables involved. The primary {{data for this study}} was obtained through a cross-sectional survey of International students in University Utara Malaysia with the aid of questionnaires, where a total of 150 respondents were selected randomly. Partial Least Squares (PLS) method was adopted in analysing the collected data with smartPLS 2. 0 to determine the relationship involved. The result supported the relationship between organizational needs, Tangibility of facilities, Nature of service delivery and international <b>student’s</b> <b>mobility,</b> while the other six relationships were not supported...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{individuals}} are choosing to study abroad although, like other manifestations of globalisation, the sources and destinations of these migratory flows are highly uneven. Within the context of ongoing debates about the motives for overseas study, the reproduction of class advantage, and countries' competitive advantage for internationally mobile students, this paper seeks to improve understanding of these variations. We situate international <b>student</b> <b>mobilities</b> within a theoretical framework which connects recent work in geography, emphasising the differentiation advantage derived from foreign study, with insights more commonly applied to labour migration which emphasise costs and benefits. Our findings, based on a statistical analysis of a large sample of country pairs, {{call into question the}} central importance commonly ascribed to countries' university quality in shaping the <b>mobilities</b> of international <b>students.</b> Far more influential is income in destination countries, together with relational ties created by colonial linkages, common language and pre-existing migrant stocks. Unique to the literature, we not only demonstrate important differences in the determinants of international <b>student</b> <b>mobilities</b> between developed and developing countries, but also between different sub-groupings of developing countries. Indeed, an important insight from our study is that it may be useful to move beyond binary classifications, and to deploy more refined country categorisations in seeking to understand contemporary corporeal mobilities...|$|R
