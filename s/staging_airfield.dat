5|$|The {{attack on}} 15 September {{followed}} {{a series of}} raids conducted against Tirpitz by Royal Navy aircraft carriers between April and August 1944 that sought to sink or disable the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord in the far north of German-occupied Norway, so that she no longer posed a threat to Allied convoys travelling {{to and from the}} Soviet Union. While the first of these raids was successful, the other attacks failed due to shortcomings with the Fleet Air Arm's strike aircraft and the formidable German defences. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to the RAF's Bomber Command. Avro Lancaster bombers from the Command's two elite squadrons flew to their <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> in the Soviet Union on the night of 11/12 September, and attacked on 15 September using heavy bombs and air-dropped mines. All of the British aircraft returned to base, though one of the Lancasters later crashed during its flight back to the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|RAF Ascension Island was re-garrisoned by the RAF in 1982 {{and used}} {{extensively}} as a <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> during the Falklands War. A series of long-range bombing raids {{was carried out}} from there under the name Operation Black Buck.|$|E
50|$|Related to the United States {{diplomatic}} {{activities in}} Brazil, United States military teams {{were active in}} Liberia to acquire <b>staging</b> <b>airfields</b> to transit ferried aircraft from Brazil through British Colonies in Central Africa {{en route to the}} Middle East. Liberia, having a long relationship with the United States, made available a number of airports and port facilities. Monrovia became a key staging point on the route from Brazil, which continued onto Egypt.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1945, while {{supporting}} {{the invasion of}} Okinawa, the BPF had sole responsibility for operations in the Sakishima Islands. Its role was to suppress Japanese air activity, using gunfire and air attack, at potential kamikaze <b>staging</b> <b>airfields</b> {{that would otherwise be}} a threat to US Navy vessels operating at Okinawa. The British fleet carriers with their armoured flight decks were subject to heavy and repeated kamikaze attacks, but they proved highly resistant, and returned to action relatively quickly. The USN liaison officer on [...] commented: [...] "When a kamikaze hits a US carrier it means 6 months of repair at Pearl [...] When a kamikaze hits a Limey carrier it's just a case of 'Sweepers, man your brooms'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dikson Airport (Аэропорт Диксон) [...] {{is a small}} {{airport in}} Russia located 5 km west of the urban-type {{settlement}} of Dikson on a small island. It primarily services small transport aircraft. Central Intelligence Agency reports from 1952 released under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the USSR was using Dikson as a <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> for Tupolev Tu-4 (Bull) aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The 368th was a {{group of}} Ninth Air Force's 71st Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command. [...] Chilbolton {{continued}} to be retained by the USAAF for use by transports as a <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> for cargo operations to and from the Continent and it was not returned to the RAF until March 1945 by which time most of the C-47 groups had been transferred to forward stations in France.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} was {{not used}} during Operation Husky (invasion of Sicily). It {{appears to have been}} a <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> for Operation Avalanche (invasion of Salerno, Italy). Since there were no airborne parachute landings during the Salareno invasion, it likely ferried supplies and personnel. Once Allied ground forces were on mainland Italy, the American use of the airfield appears to have ended; the 316th moved on to another airfield at Borizzo Airfield, Sicily.|$|E
50|$|By 13 September, enough {{construction}} {{had been}} completed at Adak to justify movement of operations from Fort Glenn AAF on Umnak to the new airfield which was 400 miles closer to the Japanese forces on Kiska. The 250-mile distance from Adak allowed multiple combat sorties each day to be carried out, weather permitting. This was particularly true for the fighters, which were now within easy striking range of enemy targets. Previously, only the long-range P-38s {{had been able to}} reach Kiska from Fort Glenn AAF, and only with great difficulty. The Japanese forces on Attu, (430 miles from Adak) however, remained only within the range of the B-24 Liberators, although the P-38s could fly escort missions. With the movement of combat operations to Adak, Fort Glenn and also Fort Randall AAF at Cold Bay became support and <b>staging</b> <b>airfields</b> supporting the front line.|$|R
50|$|In {{the naval}} {{operations}} surrounding the battle, both sides lost considerable numbers of ships and aircraft, including the Japanese battleship Yamato. After the battle, Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop <b>staging</b> areas, and <b>airfields</b> in proximity to Japan {{in preparation for}} the planned invasion.|$|R
25|$|The 62d Wing {{was moved}} to Nha Trang Air Base in January 1965 where {{expansion}} of its air units could be supported more easily, leaving behind a detachment of support aircraft. Pleiku Air Base was then managed by the VNAF 92d Base Support Group and the base {{was used as a}} <b>staging</b> and emergency <b>airfield.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{airport was}} {{commissioned}} during the First World War in 1917-18 for the RFC/RAF. The old buildings were renovated during the Second World War, {{when it was}} used as a <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> by the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was transferred to the Indian Government when the British left. Due to brisk traffic, new terminal buildings featuring facilities of refreshment, retiring rooms, restrooms, book stalls and visitor's galleries were constructed in 1953.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was located}} near the Railhead on the main railroad line to Chittagong. It {{was used by the}} 1st Combat Cargo Group as a supply point and <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> for resupply airlift drops over Burma from 15 May until June 1945. It was also used by the 128th Army Communications System Squadron as a radio relay station. Other Douglas C-47 Skytrain and Curtiss C-46 Commando-equipped transport units used the airfield until it was closed at the end of September 1945.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} a large flying {{training}} school during World War II, {{as well as a}} transport <b>staging</b> <b>airfield.</b> During the Rashid Ali rebellion in 1941 the airfield was besieged by the Iraqi Army encamped on the overlooking plateau. On 2 May 1941, British forces from the airfield launched pre-emptive airstrikes on Iraqi forces throughout Iraq and the Anglo-Iraqi War began. The siege was lifted by the units based at Habbaniya, including pilots from the training school, a battalion of the King's Own Royal Regiment flown in at the last moment, Number 1 Armoured Car Company RAF and the RAF's Iraq Levies. The subsequent arrival of a relief column (Kingcol), part of Habforce sent from Palestine, then a British mandate, combined with the Habbaniya units to force the rebel forces to retreat to Baghdad.|$|E
5000|$|... 1942 - February a final {{decision}} was reached regarding the A, B, and C routes for a northern Highway. It will connect the North West <b>Staging</b> Route <b>airfields</b> and bypass the Northern Trench for the joint Canada-Alaska Highway Alcan Highway, alternately Alaska Highway. The three routes had {{been the subject of}} considerable economic competition between governments and communities since the Klondike Gold Rush. The A route was a Stikine option similar to Highway 37 of today. The B route favors the Trench option. The C route following the airfields east of the Rocky Mountains and then crossing to the west near the Liard River is the chosen route.|$|R
25|$|Following VJ Day, the 309th {{moved to}} Japan, where its {{personnel}} systematically destroyed Japanese military aircraft and equipment {{for which the}} United States had no use. it supported aircraft that <b>staged</b> through Chitose <b>Airfield</b> on their return to the United States. It also flew surveillance flights with North American P-51 Mustangs over northern Honshū and Hokkaido. The wing was inactivated in Japan during in late March 1946.|$|R
25|$|After {{moving to}} Darwin in the Northern Territory in April 1944 the {{squadron}} {{became part of}} No. 76 Wing RAAF along with Nos. 20 and 42 Squadrons. On 10 May 1944, Squadron Leader L.M. Hurt took over as commanding officer, but was soon replaced by Squadron Leader P.J. McMahon in July. After this, they operated almost exclusively in the mine laying role. Operating alongside the other Catalina squadrons, No. 43 Squadron conducted mine laying operations throughout South East Asia, venturing {{as far as the}} Philippines, Hong Kong and the Chinese coast. Aircraft from the squadron flew up to 25 hours on such missions, often <b>staging</b> through <b>airfields</b> as far away as Morotai.|$|R
50|$|In 1956-57, at {{the request}} of SWRD Bandaranaike, the Royal Air Force handed over its bases in Ceylon to the Royal Ceylon Air Force. The loss of RAF Negombo meant that a {{replacement}} staging post was needed between its bases in the Middle East and Far East and the location was virtually limited to Gan. Hence Royal Air Force Station Gan became established in the late 1950s as a stopover on the reinforcement route to the Far East Air Force based in Singapore. The previous reinforcement route had passed through countries that had formerly been British territory but were now independent, and sometimes hostile nations. RAF Mauripur, to the west of Karachi, by then a Pakistan Air Force station, had RAF personnel attached for <b>staging</b> <b>airfield</b> purposes up until 1956, when the staging role between the Middle East and Far East fell to RAF Gan.|$|E

50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was developed}} into a major base used by both the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy units in the Vogelkop Peninsula, <b>staging</b> to other <b>airfields</b> to the south Aru and Kai Islands or east to New Guinea. The Japanese built a second 'hardtop' runway creating two strips of 4,530' and 2,660' respectively. Naval troops constructed 15 bomber and 24 fighter revetments with more under construction. The base largely escaped any Allied bombing until mid-1943.|$|R
50|$|After V-E Day, was {{assigned}} to Air Transport Command (ATC) Green Project which was the movement of troops from Pisa <b>Airfield</b> <b>staging</b> area in Morocco. B-17s were dearmed with flooring and seats for 25 passengers installed. Crew consisted of Pilot, co-Pilot, Navigator and Flight Engineer. Carried passengers from Pisa to Port Lyautey Airfield, French Morocco where ATC transports moved them across the Atlantic or to Dakar for movement via South Atlantic Transport Route. Inactivated in Italy in September 1945.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 September 1944: Long-range {{navigation}} {{over large}} areas of the ocean was difficult for large aircraft with a full-time navigator and extremely difficult for single-seat ﬁghters. The Navy was frequently called upon by the Army Air Forces to provide seaplane escorts for ﬁghter groups making long transits between island bases. The presence of amphibious Navy aircraft also ensured a quick rescue in the event of ditching. VP-54 conducted such a mission on 22 September, escorting the Western Caroline Air Force from Emirau to Peleliu <b>Airfield,</b> <b>staging</b> through Hollandia and Owi Airfield.|$|R

Surveying teams from the United States were sent and assessed the availability of the existing facilities in terms of runway lengths, as well as repair and refueling facilities.|$|R
25|$|The attack force <b>staged</b> {{through an}} <b>airfield</b> on Kendari, {{spending}} the night of 16 January there, refueling and taking off {{in the early hours}} next morning. Two targets had been assigned: the B-17s were to attack shipping in Menado Bay, while the LB-30S bombed an airport in the vicinity. However, their orders were so unclear that the LB-30 crews could not be sure where the airport was and they had to spend fifteen or twenty minutes searching before they finally found the field at Langoan, beside a lake, about 20 miles south of Menado. Almost in the instant that the last plane reported its bombs away, they were hit by five Zeros, and for six minutes the three LB-30s were under fire. They managed to shoot down one of the Zeros before themselves escaping into the weather; but two of the aircraft had been fatally hurt.|$|R
50|$|III./KG 54 was {{the only}} one of the three Gruppen to take part in Fall Rot, the final phase of the Battle for France.

It then proceeded to support the advance into Normandy and Brittany from 5-19 June. It attacked troop and communication targets as well as airfields at Abbeville, St Omer and Norrent-Fontes from the 5-15 June in the Orleans area on 16 June. By this time III./KG 54 was operating at the limits of its range, from bases in Germany, and were forced to <b>stage</b> to forward <b>airfields</b> in France to operate.
