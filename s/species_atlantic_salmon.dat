Sufficient toxicogenomics data at the molecular/cellular level for understanding the effects and modes of toxic action (MoAs) of radionuclide is still lacking. The current article introduces transcriptomic data generated from a recent ecotoxicological study, with the aims to characterize the MoAs of a metallic radionuclide, deplete uranium (DU) in an ecologically and commercially important fish <b>species,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar). Salmon were exposed to three concentrations (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0  mg/L) of DU for 48  h. Short-term global transcriptional responses were studied using Agilent custom-designed high density 60, 000 -feature (60  k) salmonid oligonucleotide microarrays (oligoarray). The microarray datasets deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO ID: GSE 58824) were associated with a recently published study by Song et al. (2014) in BMC Genomics.

The calculations are illustrated for alternative sets of calibration data. To obtain close and relevant fits, the approach fundamentally relies on having accurate and fully representative subcomponent distributions. Firmer inferences can be made if the component data sets correspond closely to the target information in both time and space. Given carefully chosen suites of component data, robust population composition estimates with narrow confidence intervals were obtained. General principles are stated, which indicate when such methods might work well or poorly...|$|E

40|$|Hosts can utilize {{different}} types of defense against the effects of parasitism, including avoidance, resistance, and tolerance. Typically, there is tremendous heterogeneity among hosts in these defense mechanisms that may be rooted in {{the costs associated with}} defense and lead to trade-offs with other life-history traits. Trade-offs may also exist between the defense mechanisms, but the relationships between avoidance, resistance, and tolerance have rarely been studied. Here, we assessed these three defense traits under common garden conditions in a natural host–parasite system, the trematode eye-fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum and its second intermediate fish host. We looked at host individuals originating from four genetically distinct populations of two closely related salmonid <b>species</b> (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon,</b> Salmo salar and sea trout, Salmo trutta trutta) to estimate the magnitude of variation in these defense traits and the relationships among them. We show species-specific variation in resistance and tolerance and population-specific variation in resistance. Further, we demonstrate evidence for a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. Our results suggest that the variation in host defense can at least partly result from a compromise between different interacting defense traits, the relative importance of which is likely to be shaped by environmental components. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering different components of the host defense system when making predictions on the outcome of host–parasite interactions...|$|E

Concern has been raised that farmed fish now contain lower LC omega- 3 content than wild-harvested seafood due {{to the use of}} oil blending in diets fed to farmed fish. However, we observed that two major Australian farmed finfish <b>species,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar) and barramundi (Lates calcifer), have higher oil and LC omega- 3 content than the same or other species from the wild, and remain an excellent means to achieve substantial intake of LC omega- 3 oils.

For Atlantic salmon, LC omega- 3 content decreased ~ 30 %– 50 % between 2002 and 2013, and the omega- 3 /omega- 6 ratio also decreased (> 5 : 1 to < 1 : 1). Australian consumers increasingly seek their LC omega- 3 from supplements, therefore a range of supplement products were compared. The development and future application of oilseeds containing LC omega- 3 oils and their incorporation in aquafeeds would allow these health-benefitting oils to be maximized in farmed Australian seafood.

However, human activities, such as river regulation, represent potential threats to fish migration by changing environmental parameters {{that will have}} impact on their metabolism. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the changes in the swimming energetics of a salmonid <b>species,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar L.), caused by short-term temperature variations that usually result from the operation of hydroelectrical dams. Intermittent flow respirometry in swim tunnels allows to obtain high resolution data on oxygen consumption of swimming fish which can reflect aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. This method was used to compare the metabolic rates of oxygen consumption before, during and after sudden thermal change. Control (no temperature variation) and experimental (temperature variation of approximately 4 °C in 1 h) swimming trials were conducted to achieve the following objectives: (i) quantify the variations in oxygen consumption associated with abrupt temperature decrease, and (ii) assess if the tested fish return quickly to initial oxygen consumption rates. Main results revealed that Atlantic salmon smolts show a strong response to sudden temperature variation, significantly reducing the oxygen consumption rate up to a seven-fold change. Fish quickly returned to initial swimming costs shortly after reestablishment of temperature values. Results from this study can be used to evaluate the species-specific effects of the applied operation modes by hydroelectrical dams and to increase the success of conservation and management actions directed to fish species inhabiting regulated rivers...|$|E
40|$|Although {{life history}} {{variation}} in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has been examined in scores of scientific papers, {{the most remarkable}} features of the species ' life history have been ignored in the literature. This paper examines marine growth and pre-spawning fasting in Atlantic salmon, two traits which set Atlantic salmon radically apart from other fish <b>species.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> pre-fishery abundance in the Northwest Atlantic has decreased markedly since the 1980 s due to increased marine mortality (Cairns 2001). Understanding the life history strategies behind the Atlantic salmon's growth and fasting patterns {{may be the key}} to explaining the species ' decline. Juvenile Atlantic salmon grow at rates typical of other stream fishes, but growth rates increase dramatically after sea entry. Salmon in the Northwest Atlantic increase in weight 75 -fold between river exit and return after 1 sea winter, and> 200 -fold between river exit and return after 2 sea winters. These growth rates are two orders of magnitude faster than those of other fish (herring, mackerel, capelin) which occupy the same pelagic habitat (Fig. 1). Atlantic salmon typically return to natal rivers in early summer (early run) or in fall (late run). Adult Atlantic salmon stop feeding before they enter rivers, and continue to fast during their time in fresh water. The pre-spawning fast typically lasts about five months in early run fish. Late-run fish spend the summer at sea. Although they have the opportunity to feed during the pre-spawning summer, late-run fish are not larger than early-run fish (Fig. 2). This suggests that they either have a slower overall growth trajectory, or that they do not eat during the pre-spawning summer.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{analysis and}} fieldwork investigating how the effect spatial distributions and spatial relationships have on {{population growth in}} two anadromous salmonid <b>species,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> and brown trout. The thesis looks at how the spatial distribution of spawning within a river can shape the distribution of juveniles within a river throughout their freshwater stage, and investigates how habitat characteristics, ranging in spatial scale from micro-habitat to catchment, affect population productivity. Increased knowledge of how spatial relationships can affect population production is important both for theoretical understanding of population dynamics and management of these economically and culturally important species. Salmon and trout spawn 100 s to 1000 s of eggs in discrete gravel nests, and the preferred sites for spawning are often are patchily distributed within rivers, often with multiple females spawning in the same area. The densities experienced by newly emerged juveniles are often high, and can be reduced either by mortality or by juveniles dispersing to areas with fewer competitors. This implies the potential for patchy spawning distributions to limit productivity via local density dependent mortality and/or by limiting the river area accessible to juveniles. Questions regarding this were investigated in three separate studies where the spatial distribution of year classes were followed over one or more life stages ranging from eggs, to juveniles in their third year. The results showed a close spatial relationship between spawning and juveniles during the first year, and although dispersal increased with age, the initial distribution was partly retained throughout the riverine stage. The relationships between productivity and microhabitat, river morphology and catchment properties were analysed using three large datasets. Both large and small scale properties of the environment effect productivity, and insights from this analysis will improve management when assessing production potential of rivers.

Proposed fish passage between basins would reunite populations of native potamodromous fish and allow anadromous fish of Deschutes River origin access to the upper basin. We assessed the potential redistribution of host-species-specific genotypes (O, I, II, III) of the myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta that could occur with fish passage and examined the influence of nonnative fish on genotype composition. To determine the present distribution of the parasite genotypes, we exposed eight salmonid species—three native and five stocked for sport fishing—in present and predicted anadromous salmonid habitats. We monitored fish for infection by C. shasta and sequenced a section of the parasite ribosomal DNA gene from fish and water samples to determine parasite genotype. Genotype O was present in both upper and lower basins and detected only in steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. Genotype I was spatially limited to the lower basin, isolated predominately from Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, and lethal for this species only. Genotype II was detected in both basins and in multiple species, but only as a minor component of the infection. Genotype III was also present in both basins, had a wide host range, and caused mortality in native steelhead and multiple nonnative <b>species.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> Salmo salar and kokanee O. nerka were the least susceptible to infection by any genotype of C. shasta.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera) has declined widely {{during the past}} century, and new conservation initiatives are needed. This thesis focused {{on the relationship between}} M. margaritifera and its salmonid host required for reproduction of this species. First, by exposing fish experimentally to glochidium larvae of M. margaritifera, different M. margaritifera populations were shown to demonstrate strong differences in their ability to parasitize different salmonid <b>species.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> was clearly a better host for mussels in large river channels, whereas in small headwater tributaries brown trout was the best, or the only suitable, host. These findings provide a previously unrecognised explanation for the collapse and the lack of recruitment especially of the salmon-specific M. margaritifera populations; a high proportion of large salmon rivers were dammed for hydropower production in the 1960 s, which prevented the migration of salmon and thus left M. margaritifera without the appropriate host in these rivers. Furthermore, an invasive salmonid, brook trout, was widely introduced to small tributaries above the dams in the past, but in this study was shown to be an unsuitable host for M. margaritifera. Thus, and due to the tendency of brook trout to replace native brown trout, the spread of brook trout is an additional threat to M. margaritifera. An indication of local adaptation of M. margaritifera, i. e. higher infectivity in sympatric salmonid host strain than in allopatric populations of the same species, was also detected. Finally, a new, non- destructive approach to search for M. margaritifera populations, involving electrofishing and quick visual examination of the gills of captured salmonids, revealed the occurrence of 3 previously unknown populations. The results of this thesis highlight the importance of taking into account the roles of salmonid fish in future efforts to search, protect and restore freshwater pearl mussel populations...|$|E

The aim of the current study was to test this hypothesis. A biochemically defmed in vitro culture system was developed that would allow collection of the secreted/excreted products of the copepodid larvae of L. salmonis, and avoid their contamination by metabolites of the host from their collection, in vivo. Available tissue culture methods proved inadequate in supporting copepodid culture because of the louse requirement for a seawater maintenance medium that was osmotically unsuitable for cultured cells. Tissue engineering technologies developed in the construction of human living skin equivalents were successful in the development of an Atlantic Salmon Skin Equivalent (ASSE). ASSE is a novel organotypic tissue culture substrate that was constructed from Atlantic salmon fibroblasts (AS- 6) and primary cultures of Atlantic salmon epithelial cells. Cells were supported in a matrix of collagen fibres, acid extracted from the tails of rats, and combined using a layering technique to create a substitute salmon skin. ASSE has a fibroblastic dermal equivalent overlaid by an epidermis-like layer and a layer of collagen, and was maintainable in a seawater media. During its development, the cells within ASSE showed signs of differentiation that included stratification, increased fibronectin production by cultured fibroblasts, and the formation of a basement membrane-like layer at the junction of the dermis and epidermis. In this environment, ASSE allowed the survival of copepodid larvae for an average of 12 days, a period approximately 5 days longer than that of their free-swimming counterparts. Furthermore, cultured copepodids were observed feeding, exhibiting the normal range of settlement behaviours, and also showed increases in their length. However, metamorphosis to the chalimus I stage did not occur and was not stimulated by the supplementation of ASSE with salmon mucus, salmon peptone or DL methionine. Nevertheless, copepodid maintenance on ASSE allowed the collection of the compounds they released into the culture media. These were assayed for their effects on the immunological functioning of salmon macrophages. These assays demonstrated that the chemotaxic ability of macrophages was significantly reduced following treatment with louse culture supernatants. (LCS), as was their phagocytic ability.

Besides the annual seasonal variation and a linear trend, the method revealed mid time-scale (approximate to 10 years) and long time-scale (approximate to 30 years) variation. The 10 -year quasi-cyclical component of the temperature time series appears to be connected with a similar feature in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> abundance.

40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative trait locus (QTL) {{studies show}} that {{variation}} in salinity tolerance in Arctic charr and rainbow trout has a genetic basis, even though both these species have low to moderate salinity tolerance capacities. QTL were observed to localize to homologous linkage group segments within putative chromosomal regions possessing multiple candidate genes. We compared salinity tolerance QTL in rainbow trout and Arctic charr to those detected in a higher salinity tolerant <b>species,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon.</b> The highly derived karyotype of Atlantic salmon allows {{for the assessment of}} whether disparity in salinity tolerance in salmonids is associated with differences in genetic architecture. To facilitate these comparisons, we examined the genomic synteny patterns of key candidate genes in the other model teleost fishes that have experienced three whole-genome duplication (3 R) events which preceded a fourth (4 R) whole genome duplication event common to all salmonid species. Results Nine linkage groups contained chromosome-wide significant QTL (AS- 2, - 4 p, - 4 q, - 5, - 9, - 12 p, - 12 q, - 14 q - 17 q, - 22, and − 23), while a single genome-wide significant QTL was located on AS- 4 q. Salmonid genomes shared the greatest marker homology with the genome of three-spined stickleback. All linkage group arms in Atlantic salmon were syntenic with at least one stickleback chromosome, while 18 arms had multiple affinities. Arm fusions in Atlantic salmon were often between multiple regions bearing salinity tolerance QTL. Nine linkage groups in Arctic charr and six linkage group arms in rainbow trout currently have no synteny alignments with stickleback chromosomes, while eight rainbow trout linkage group arms were syntenic with multiple stickleback chromosomes. Rearrangements in the stickleback lineage involving fusions of ancestral arm segments could account for the 21 chromosome pairs observed in the stickleback karyotype. Conclusions Salinity tolerance in salmonids from three genera is to some extent controlled by the same loci. Synteny between QTL in salmonids and candidate genes in stickleback suggests genetic variation at candidate gene loci could affect salinity tolerance in all three salmonids investigated. Candidate genes often occur in pairs on chromosomes, and synteny patterns indicate these pairs are generally conserved in 2 R, 3 R, and 4 R genomes. Synteny maps also suggest that the Atlantic salmon genome contains three larger syntenic combinations of candidate genes that are not evident in any of the other 2 R, 3 R, or 4 R genomes examined. These larger synteny tracts appear to have resulted from ancestral arm fusions that occurred in the Atlantic salmon ancestor. We hypothesize that the superior hypo-osmoregulatory efficiency that is characteristic of Atlantic salmon may be related to these clusters. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{the life}} cycle as farmed animals there are {{numerous}} situations where fish are subjected to handling and confinement. Netting, weighing, sorting, vaccination, transport and, at the end, slaughter are common events under farming conditions. As research animals fish may also undergo surgical procedures, ranging from tagging, sampling, and small incisions, to larger operations. Under these varying situations treatment with anaesthetic agents might be {{necessary in order to}} ensure the welfare of the fish. Anaesthetic protocols for new species that are introduced to research or cultivation are generally based on protocols developed for the more established species. In Norway the anaesthetic protocols for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), which were introduced to fish farming in the 1980 ’s, have thus been based on protocols used for salmonid <b>species.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar) has been farmed since the 1960 ’s and is the most important species in Norwegian fish farming. The main objective of the current investigation was to gain more knowledge regarding the effect of anaesthetic agents in farmed fish, with special emphasis on Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut. Large variations in response to anaesthetic agents exist both between and within fish species. Factors such as body weight, water temperature and acute stress may be important for the response and were studied in the current investigation. The anaesthetic agents benzocaine, metacaine (MS- 222), metomidate hydrochloride, isoeugenol, 2 - phenoxyethanol, and quinaldine were used. In Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut the agents were studied with regards to efficacy, assessed as induction and recovery times as well as reaction to handling under anaesthesia. In Atlantic salmon pharmacokinetic properties of the agents were examined. Both in Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut large differences in efficacy between the different anaesthetic treatments were found. Induction and recovery times varied both in relation to body weight and in relation to water temperature. The main trend observed in Atlantic cod at high water temperature was shorter induction and recovery times for all weight groups and treatments. Whereas in Atlantic halibut higher water temperature resulted in shorter induction times, longer recovery times, and increased responsiveness to handling. Atlantic halibut of large body size displayed longer induction times, shorter recovery times, and reduced responsiveness to handling in comparison with fish of smaller body size. However, in Atlantic cod no uniform trend was found in the relationship between the size of the fish and anaesthetic efficacy. In Atlantic cod induction and recovery times were found to increase with increasing body weight for benzocaine and MS- 222. For metomidate the recovery time increased with increasing weight whereas there were no weight related differences in induction time. No differences in either induction or recovery times associated to body weight were found for 2 -phenoxyethanol. The pharmacokinetic study in Atlantic salmon showed that the anaesthetics were rapidly eliminated and that elimination was related to the water soluble characteristics of the agents. The recovery times were shorter in fish that were given artificial gill ventilation. In the assessment of the importance of acute stress prior to anaesthesia of Atlantic cod {{it was found that the}} stress resulted in significantly shorter induction time and prolonged recovery time, as well as deeper anaesthetised fish. The anaesthetic dosage had to be reduced in order to avoid mortality in fish anaesthetised subsequent to acute stress. Anaesthetic protocols for fish have generally comprised one single agent, whereas protocols of human and veterinary medicine comprise combinations of several drugs, each one contributing with effects needed in the anaesthesia. Stress prior to anaesthesia may result in abnormal reactions, as seen in Atlantic cod in the current study, and may require dosage adjustments of drugs both for induction and maintenance. Pre-anaesthetic sedation is therefore commonly used in order to avoid stress and is an integrated part of the veterinary protocols. In the current study, protocols comprising combinations of two anaesthetic agents, one agent to induce sedation followed by one agent to induce anaesthesia, were tested in Atlantic cod and Atlantic halibut. In both species combination anaesthesia allowed a reduction of the dosages used for inducing anaesthesia. In Atlantic cod combination anaesthesia resulted in markedly reduced recovery times compared to agents administered individually. In Atlantic halibut combination anaesthesia had no effect on the induction times in small fish in comparison with individual agents, but resulted in significantly shorter recovery times and reduced responsiveness to handling. In Atlantic halibut of large body size combination anaesthesia gave rise to shorter induction times than individual administered agents whereas no uniform trend was observed in recovery times and no differences in responsiveness to handling were noticed. Anaesthetic agents are commonly used in fish farming to avoid stress during various farming practices. While several studies report that anaesthetic agents are effective in reducing the stress associated with confinement and handling, there are also reports indicating that the exposure to anaesthetics may in itself induce a stress response, measured by increased levels of cortisol. In order to examine stress induced by exposure to anaesthetic agents the release of cortisol to water following anaesthetic exposure was examined in Atlantic cod, Atlantic halibut and Atlantic salmon. In this examination the fish were not subjected to any concomitant handling in connection to anaesthesia or sampling. The plasma cortisol concentration during anaesthesia was examined in Atlantic salmon, however this examination included some degree of handling. All of the anaesthetics tested induced a release of cortisol to water in all three species, with maximum release rates measured 0. 5 - 1 hour post exposure. This also complied with the plasma cortisol levels measured in Atlantic salmon. MS- 222 elicited the highest cortisol release rates while benzocaine caused a bimodal response where the initial peak in cortisol release rate was followed by a second and smaller peak. Metomidate induced the lowest release of cortisol of the agents tested in both Atlantic halibut and Atlantic cod, but resulted in a bimodal response in Atlantic salmon where the initial increase in cortisol release was followed by an even larger increase. The stress induced in Atlantic salmon by isoeugenol resembled that of MS- 222, but did not reach the same elevated level. Over all the cortisol release was most profound in Atlantic salmon followed by Atlantic halibut and Atlantic cod. Based on the findings in the current study it is recommended that anaesthetic protocols should always be tested on a few fish under prevailing conditions in order to ensure an adequate level of depth while avoiding overdosing. This recommendation applies whether one single agent or a combination of agents are used although it was found here that protocols comprising combinations of agents provide wider margins of safety. While exposure to anaesthetic agents was found to elicit a stress response, displayed as increased levels of cortisol, the amount of cortisol released in response to anaesthesia was low compared to what is reported following strong stressors such as handling and confinement. Stress caused by anaesthetic agents may however represent an extra load during otherwise stressful circumstances...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Somatolactin (Sl) is a fish {{specific}} adenohypophyseal {{peptide hormone}} related to growth hormone (Gh). Some species, including salmonids, possess two forms: Sl alpha and Sl beta. The somatolactin receptor (slr) {{is closely related}} to the growth hormone receptor (ghr). Sl has been ascribed many physiological functions, including a role in sexual maturation. In order to clarify the role of Sl in the sexual maturation of female <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar), the full length cDNAs of slr, Sl alpha and Sl beta were cloned and their expression was studied throughout a seasonal reproductive cycle using real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR). Methods <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> Sl alpha, Sl beta and slr cDNAs were cloned using a PCR approach. Gene expression of Sl alpha, SL beta and slr was studied using RTqPCR over a 17 month period encompassing pre-vitellogenesis, vitellogenesis, ovulation and post ovulation in salmon females. Histological examination of ovarian samples allowed for the classification according to the degree of follicle maturation into oil drop, primary, secondary or tertiary yolk stage. Results The mature peptide sequences of Sl alpha, Sl beta and slr are highly similar to previously cloned salmonid forms and contained the typical motifs. Phylogenetic analysis of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> Sl alpha and Sl beta shows that these peptides group into the two Sl clades present in some fish <b>species.</b> The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> slr grouped with salmonid slr amongst so-called type I ghr. An increase in pituitary Sl alpha and Sl beta transcripts before and during spawning, with a decrease post-ovulation, and a constant expression level of ovarian slr were observed. There was also a transient increase in Sl alpha and Sl beta in May prior to transfer from seawater to fresh water and ensuing fasting. Conclusion The up-regulation of Sl alpha and Sl beta during vitellogenesis and spawning, with a subsequent decrease post-ovulation, supports a role for Sl during gonadal growth and spawning. Sl could also be involved in calcium/phosphate mobilization associated with vitellogenesis or have a role in energy homeostasis associated with lipolysis during fasting. The up-regulation of both Sl alpha and Sl beta prior to fasting and freshwater transfer, suggests a role for Sl linked to reproduction that may be independent of the maturation induced fasting. </p...|$|R
