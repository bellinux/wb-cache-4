The company discontinued testing at its Newark location while attempting to resolve the issues. Theranos announced plans to appeal the decision by regulators to revoke its license to operate a lab in California and other sanctions. In April 2017, Theranos reached a settlement with CMS agreeing {{to stay out of}} the blood-testing business for at least two years in exchange for reduced penalties.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of the Chinese economy in the late 80s has placed a huge surge in urban transport. This {{prompted}} cities across China to pursue and draft proposals for subway networks with Shanghai and Guangzhou opening their first sections of subway in the 90s. This inspired more cities to propose subway networks. In 1995, the Central Government was alarmed by the high cost and financial debit from these ambitious subway plans and put out a [...] "notice on the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of urban underground rapid rail transit projects". At the time Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Dalian and Shenzhen had advanced proposals waiting to be approved. Wuhan, Chongqing, and Dalian managed to circumvent the moratorium on subway construction by constructing and opening lower cost, surface running, light metros and monorails in the early 2000s.|$|E

However, in the 1990s a series of unrelated food crises created consumer apprehension about food safety in general and eroded public trust in government oversight. A bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreak was the most publicized. In 1998, a de facto moratorium led to the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>approvals</b> <b>of</b> new GMOs in the EU pending the adoption of revised rules.|$|R

40|$|The 1990 Medical Device Amendments to the Food and Drug Act {{have caused}} a {{significant}} change in the regulation of medical software. The 1990 Act replaces the prior emphasis on premarket approvals with an emphasis on postmarket surveillance. Hospitals and other institutional users are now required to report to the FDA product defects that cause injuries or death. They are also required to report product defects to the manufacturer. The Act provides for rapid <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> device <b>approval,</b> recalls <b>of</b> defective products and civil penalties for violators. The combination of these factors may lead to enhanced FDA supervision of the purchase and use of medical software, and particularly an emphasis on finding unregistered producers. In addition, the new Act will have a direct effect on the regulation of software, because it is much better suited to addressing the problem of software quality than the 1976 Act...|$|R

(b) <b>Suspension</b> <b>of</b> other Fundamental Rights Article 359 authorises the {{president}} to suspend the right to move any court for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency. This means that under Article 359, the Fundamental Rights as such are not suspended, but only their enforcement. The said rights are theoretically alive but the right to seek remedy is suspended. The <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> enforcement relates to only those Fundamental Rights that are specified in the Presidential Order. Further, the suspension could be for the period during the operation of emergency or for a shorter period as mentioned in the order, and the suspension order may extend to the whole or {{any part of the}} country.

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression. More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses. Our statistical evidence indicates a 25 percent increase in the probability that an average bank in the two states remains open with the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments. The <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreases noteholders' losses by about 20 cents per dollar of notes. Bank failures; Banks and banking - History; Banks and banking, Central...|$|R

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R

5000|$|The term <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief or willing <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief {{has been}} defined as a {{willingness}} to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.
