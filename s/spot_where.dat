5|$|The wiretap also {{uncovered}} {{the truth about}} Mme M'Barek's visit to the remote <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> her husband's body was found. This was supported when downloaded records from the GPS tracking device in her cellphone provided details that she (or at least her cellphone) had been there two days prior to Shaftesbury's death.|$|E
5|$|A Christmas truce {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} in Frelinghien, France, on 11 November 2008. Also on that day, at the <b>spot</b> <b>where,</b> on Christmas Day 1914, their regimental ancestors {{came out from}} their trenches to play football, men from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers played a football match with the German Battalion 371. The Germans won 2–1.|$|E

If the ball was moving backwards {{with regard to the}} recovering team, it is <b>spotted</b> <b>where</b> it went out of bounds. If the ball was moving forwards, it is <b>spotted</b> <b>where</b> the fumble occurred (the fumble itself cannot advance the ball).|$|R

The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver, and it is very possible that it belonged to Sviatoslav himself.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2. This impact {{left behind a}} black spot in Jupiter's atmosphere, similar in size to Oval BA. Infrared observation showed a bright <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the impact took place, meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter's south pole.|$|E

50|$|Sclerocactus {{are easy}} to cultivate. They are {{generally}} a cold-adapted genus. They grow in very arid areas which are subjected to deep cold in <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> water flows irregularly or depressions where water can accumulate for short period of time. They are most often found growing along washes and arroyos where their seeds {{have been subjected to}} scarification due to water movement, but they oddly also tend to grow along ridges in <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> depressions have formed and can hold water for some period of time.|$|R

Noticing a <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the lasers cease in mid-air, Mulder walks through the force field.

Mulder is abducted with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO's departure.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the cabins}} became a tourist {{attraction}} as early as 1854. In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting {{the idea of a}} monument to mark the {{site of the}} Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family was placed on the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have been, dedicated to the Donner Party. It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.|$|E
5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures {{are hard to come}} by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery {{at the site of the}} battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Harold died.|$|E

5|$|Wainwright {{charged to}} the attack, but the {{submarine}} submerged almost immediately. Upon reaching the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> the submarine had been, the warship located an oil slick and began dropping depth charges which {{failed to achieve}} positive results. Approaching darkness {{and the necessity of}} escorting an Admiralty oiler forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|Warwick {{had been}} such an {{influential}} figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him in terms of power and popularity. Deprived of Warwick's support, the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, which marked {{the downfall of the}} House of Lancaster and the ascendancy of the House of York. Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet, a stone obelisk was raised on the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> Warwick purportedly died.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the following NHL season would be suspended due to a lockout, Samuelsson initially signed with Genève-Servette HC of the Swiss National League A in September 2004. He appeared in 12 games for the club, recording six points. A month after signing in Switzerland, he returned to Södertälje SK of the Elitserien in late October. He recorded 20 points over 29 games as the club qualified for the eighth and final playoff <b>spot,</b> <b>where</b> they were defeated by Färjestad BK in four-straight games. Samuelsson notched six points in ten post-season games.|$|E
5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded <b>spot,</b> <b>where</b> Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned to the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
