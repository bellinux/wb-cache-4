5000|$|This {{focus on}} the {{infantry}} is matched with the doctrine of [...] "Every Marine is a rifleman", a focus of Commandant Alfred M. Gray, Jr., emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine. All Marines, regardless of military specialization, receive training as a rifleman; and all officers receive additional training as infantry platoon commanders. For example, at Wake Island, {{when all of the}} Marine aircraft were shot down, pilots continued the fight as ground officers, leading <b>supply</b> <b>clerks</b> and cooks in a final defensive effort. As a result, a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the NCOs (corporals and sergeants), as compared with many other military organizations. The Marine Corps emphasizes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other military services. Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on [...] "commander's intent" [...] as a guiding principle for carrying out orders; specifying the end state but leaving open the method of execution.|$|R

On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, to the banks of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a shortcut to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal. Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth. Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl. Within two weeks an 11-year-old boy had been found strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, in Rostov before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.|$|E
5000|$|United States Navy decommissioning: One {{possible}} origin is {{from the}} U.S. Navy's Allowance Type (AT) coding system used for logistics. The allowance type code is a single digit that identifies the reason that materiel is being carried in stock. Throughout the life-cycle of a warship, many pieces of equipment are upgraded or replaced, requiring onboard spare parts to be disposed of, and the code is AT-6 for parts designated for disposal. Following World War II, there were {{a great number of}} warships being decommissioned, sold, scrapped, or deactivated and placed in reserve (commonly referred to as [...] "mothballed"). During this process, labor workers would bring up spare parts from the storerooms and the <b>supply</b> <b>clerk</b> would tell them the AT code.

Curry moved from mine to mine in the Upper Peninsula, learning the trade, and was soon in charge of a small iron mine.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, most male African American {{soldiers}} still {{served only}} as truck drivers and as stevedores (except for some separate tank battalions and Army Air Forces escort fighters). African American {{women in uniform}} answered {{the call of duty}} by tending the wounded as nurses, or working as riveters, mail clerks, file <b>clerks,</b> typists, stenographers, <b>supply</b> <b>clerks,</b> or motor pool drivers. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command of white lieutenants to replenish these companies. These platoons would serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 1945, 84% were ranked [...] "very well" [...] and 16% were ranked [...] "fairly well". [...] No black platoon received a ranking of [...] "poor" [...] by those white officers or white soldiers that fought with them. [...] Unfortunately, these platoons were often subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end of hostilities in Germany. [...] Despite their protests, these brave African American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. [...] Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent integration during the Korean War. A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.|$|R

Radar, however, tells Potter that due to what he had put together and Klinger's inability to do the job, he is going to refuse the offered discharge and remain at the 4077th. Potter is disappointed, telling him that he is not making sense. The next morning, Radar is berated by Hawkeye for wanting to stay when he is lucky to be going home.

50|$|Lee {{was born}} in 1949 in Nyack, NY {{and grew up in}} Virginia. His father, Sterling Lee, was a labor lawyer and his mother, Marian Burks Lee, was a {{politically}} active person. With this family background he was aware of progressive politics and civil and workers rights even in his early days. He went to Frostburg State College (Maryland, 1968-1972) and obtained a BA degree in history. While doing his undergraduate study, he was interested in philosophy and later in economics because he found that social questions in the 19th century were mainly examined by economists. After two years of working in Saudi Arabia (a <b>supply</b> <b>clerk</b> position with the Corp of Engineers in Riyadh), he returned to the United States and continued his study at Columbia University in New York City. In 1977 Fred Lee met Alfred S. Eichner who later became his “mentor, dissertation advisor, and friend.” He once noted that the “discovery of Eichner” was “the most important in my academic career.” With Eichner’s encouragement and support, Fred Lee started his PhD study in economics at Rutgers University in 1978, where he was taught by Alfred Eichner, Paul Davidson, Jan Kregel, Nina Shapiro, and Alessandro Roncaglia, among others. After graduating from Rutgers University in 1983, he taught at University of California—Riverside (1981-1984), Roosevelt University (Chicago, 1984-1990), Staffordshire Polytechnic (Stoke-on-Trent, UK, 1990-1991), De Montfort University (Leicester, UK, 1991-2000), and the University of Missouri—Kansas City (2000-2014).|$|E
