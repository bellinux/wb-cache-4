40|$|Computer program compares various control-system {{concepts}} {{for improving}} handling qualities of single-rotor helicopters carrying relatively-large external <b>sling</b> <b>loads.</b> Computer program developed to test {{these and other}} ideas helps to circumvent expensive prototype and field testing. Comparisons between (1) computed data and flight data, (2) simulation-system values and flight test data, and (3) pilot evaluations of simulation and actual-flight conditions are very favorable...|$|R
50|$|Take On Helicopters {{includes}} {{a number of}} tutorials to explain the basics behind flying helicopters. They are presented in order from the easiest to the most advanced. As such, players can familiarize themselves with the cockpit and instruments, start-up and shutdown procedures, basic manoeuvers, lift-off, landing, <b>sling</b> <b>loads</b> and emergency procedures. Furthermore, the game has three different difficulty settings: beginner, trainee and expert. These difficulty settings can be tweaked to create custom presets.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper at}} hand {{addresses}} the positioning control of helicopter <b>sling</b> <b>loads.</b> Due {{to a significant}} decrease in handling qualities caused by the external load, the manual positioning can be hindered. By means of linear quadratic optimal output regulation, the helicopter position as well as the load sway are controlled in an integrated approach. The position control is part of an existing AFCS, which guarantees for the basic helicopter stability. The controllers are developed and tested {{on the basis of a}} comprehensive system simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Hands-on - Students {{are tested}} on 10 of 16 hand-and-arm signals and must {{correctly}} perform {{seven of the}} 10 to receive a [...] "GO". Soldiers must pass both tests {{to move on to}} the <b>Sling</b> <b>Load</b> Phase. They are allowed one retest per exam.|$|E

The three injured crew members pulled the two seriously injured pilots from the burning wreckage before it was destroyed by fire.|$|E
50|$|To {{be awarded}} the Pathfinder Badge, the soldier must {{complete}} Pathfinder instruction in advanced land navigation, advanced scouting, tactical {{air traffic control}} in the field, and the control of parachute operations; the badge is awarded on completing several examinations under field training exercise (FTX) conditions. Examinations include proficiency in <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> rigging and execution, planning and execution of helicopter landing zones (HLZ), air traffic control operations, aerial delivery of troops and supplies, and several others.|$|E

50|$|The Korean War saw {{limited use}} of the Pathfinders by the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team during two combat jumps and operations. The Vietnam War saw the largest use of Pathfinders due to the {{developments}} of helicopter insertion and resupply which were pioneered by the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). Nearly every Army aviation battalion had a Pathfinder detachment and deployed them on nearly every mission. Setting up helicopter landing zones, medevacs, resupply points, and <b>sling</b> <b>loads</b> {{in full view of}} the enemy displayed great bravery and coolness under fire. The most successful missions were those when Pathfinders were in control; however, due to the small size of their units, very little recognition was given to the Pathfinders.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with any}} {{new piece of}} equipment, the Chinook {{presented}} a major problem of [...] "customer education". Commanders and crew chiefs had to be constantly alert that eager soldiers did not overload the temptingly large cargo compartment. It would be some time before troops would be experts at using <b>sling</b> <b>loads.</b> [...] The Chinook soon proved to be such an invaluable aircraft for artillery movement and heavy logistics that it was seldom used as an assault troop carrier. Some of the Chinook fleet was used for casualty evacuation, and due to the very heavy demand for the helicopters, they were usually overburdened with wounded. [...] Perhaps the most cost effective use of the Chinook was the recovery of other downed aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Students {{will gain}} {{technical}} competence on the static load/unload procedures for a UH-60 {{and will be}} able to perform the duties in every position of the <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> hook-up team. Students will demonstrate the knowledge they have been taught during the course during the FTX, during which they are evaluated as a team leader/assistant team leader and ground to air/internal net recorder. Students will demonstrate proficiency in all areas of pathfinder operations and meet all graduation requirements.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{helicopter}} airlift and helicopter <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> {{mission was}} conducted on September 13, 1951 during the Korean War. [...] "Operation Windmill I" [...] was conducted by the United States Marine Corps {{in support of a}} battalion clearing the enemy from a series of ridges around an extinct volcano called [...] "The Punchbowl." [...] In total seven HRS-1 Marine helicopters made 28 flights that delivered 8,550 kg (18,848 pounds) of supplies and evacuated 74 seriously wounded men.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} table {{includes a}} list of helicopter models {{that are designed to}} carry underslung loads. Cargo capacities provided reflect the airframe manufacturer's specifications; when put into practice the actual maximum load capacities may be less, depending on the rating of the cargo hook equipment. For example, if a helicopter model is rated by the manufacturer as having a maximum cargo <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> capacity of 4,000 LB, but the cargo hook equipment is only rated for 3,000 LB, then the pilot can only carry loads weighing 3,000 LB or less.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{to assess the}} gains in helicopter mission payload {{through the use of}} water injection to produce power augmentation in an altitude-hot day environment. Substantial gains are shown for two representative helicopters, the UH-lH and CH- 47 B. The UH-lH payload increased 86. 7 percent for a 50 n. mi. (92. 6 km) radius mission involving two out-of-ground effect (OGE) hover take-offs of 2 minutes each at 5000 ft. (1525 m) 35 C ambient conditions. The CH- 47 B payload increased 49. 5 percent for a 50 n. mi. (92. 6 km) radius mission with <b>sling</b> <b>loaded</b> cargo as the outbound payload and a 3000 lb. (1360 kg) internal cargo on the return leg. The mission included two 4 min. OGE hovers at 6000 ft. (1830 m) 35 C. An improvement in take off performance and maximum performance climb also resulted {{as a consequence of the}} OGE hover capability and higher maximum power available...|$|R
50|$|Wooden boxes or crates are stowed {{on double}} dunnage in the holds and single dunnage in the 'tween decks. Heavy boxes are given bottom stowage. The <b>loading</b> <b>slings</b> are often left on to aid discharge.|$|R
50|$|Kipawo {{provided}} passenger and {{freight service}} {{from the spring}} to the fall across the Minas Basin. Her sailings were scheduled to connect with Dominion Atlantic passenger trains at Wolfville and Kingsport as tides permitted. The ferry used an innovative <b>sling</b> system to <b>load</b> automobiles.|$|R
50|$|This heavy mortar {{is light}} enough to be transported by {{helicopter}} <b>sling</b> <b>load,</b> drop by parachute or carried in an APC such as the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier. It can also be towed as a normal artillery piece or even manhandled if necessary. The wheels on the carriage {{are the same as}} fitted to the M151 Jeep, and have handling rings to aid in manhandling it. All components are made of chrome-plated or stainless steel to resist wear and corrosion. The M-65 is the standard version of this mortar, while the A-7 is the long-range version.|$|E
5000|$|The S-70 {{can perform}} {{a wide array}} of missions, {{including}} air cavalry, electronic warfare, and aeromedical evacuation: several versions are used to transport the President of the United States, which while carrying the President is known as [...] "Marine One". In air assault operations it can move a squad of 11 combat troops and equipment or carry the 105 mm M102 howitzer, thirty rounds of ammunition, and a six-man crew. Alternatively, it can carry 2600 lb of cargo or <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> 9000 lb of cargo. The S-70 is equipped with advanced avionics and electronics, such as the Global Positioning System.|$|E
50|$|C Company, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, {{conducted}} the various training exercises during in July 2003, while in Djibouti including known distance ranges, both in Djibouti and Ethiopia; reflexive fire ranges, both in Djibouti and Ethiopia; AK-47 range for familiarization {{of the weapon}} system; familiarization ranges for shotguns and 9 mm pistols; external <b>sling</b> <b>load</b> training with Heavy Marine Helicopter Company (HMH-461) both day and night iterations to help certify them; its mortar platoon underwent training on the mortar ballistic computer and the plotting board to further their proficiency. They also conducted military to military training in Hurso and provided a security mission in the capital Addis Ababa.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E {{helicopter}} {{was being used}} for the installation of a rotating beacon atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon {{was attached to the}} helicopter for lifting by a chain sling. After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the chain sling from it. As the {{helicopter was}} departing, The hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by the pull of the helicopter the hook freed itself [...] towards the helicopter. The cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled in one of the main rotor blades. The other main rotor blade severed the tail boom which fell free of the helicopter striking the side of the tower {{on its way to the}} ground. The major section of the helicopter then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot's licence was not endorsed for <b>sling</b> <b>loading</b> operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type... to undertake such a job.|$|R
40|$|In November 1936, when I {{arrived at}} Port Kembla, {{accompanied}} by my brother, we were {{shocked at the}} absence of any working conditions. In these days {{there was not a single}} condition in the Port. There was no meal money, no minimum period of engagement, nowhere to have meals, 24 hour shifts, a bull system, brutalisation of labour in many ways by handling pig iron, 80 or 90 pound ingots of pig iron, 90 pound ingots of lead. These all had to be stacked into large buckets, lead into large <b>sling</b> <b>loads,</b> and this work was demanding because the hook was always in single gear, was racing in and out and the hook was always waiting on the men below; and so it means that whilst one tub went out, the other tub commenced being filled by a section of the labour force down below and by the time the other tub came in the tub had to be filled. And so it was continuously in and out with the cargo winches running at full speed. We were able to institute many campaigns on the job itself, either for safety or for insisting on the break down of the workload, and as a consequence we were victimised regularly...|$|R
