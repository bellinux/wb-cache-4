5|$|The {{main problem}} with {{upgrading}} the Wakefield branch was {{the dimensions of}} George Leather's cast iron aqueduct over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. <b>Structural</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete aqueduct was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a little further upstream. The complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used.|$|E

To our knowledge this work constitutes the first formulation of what we call Structural Path Decomposition (SPD). SPD provides noteworthy insight in two instances: first it extracts and ranks those interactions within an economy that are most important in driving change; second it provides a temporal perspective to standard input-output-based Life-Cycle Assessment. In this paper, we develop the mathematical model of SPD and provide two case studies of the most important changes in structural paths in Australia from 1995 to 2005.

5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for <b>structural</b> <b>analysis).</b> The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis is {{the second}} paper of our work on <b>structural</b> {{reliability}} <b>analysis</b> for implicit performance function. The first paper proposed <b>structural</b> reliability <b>analysis</b> methods using multilayer perceptron artificial neural network [Deng, J., Gu, D. S., Li, X. B., Yue, Z. Q., 2005. <b>Structural</b> reliability <b>analysis</b> for implicit performance function using artificial neural network. Structural Safety 25 (1), 25 – 48]. This paper presents three radial basis function network (RBF) based reliability analysis methods, i. e. RBF based MCS, RBF based FORM, and RBF based SORM. In these methods, radial basis function network technique is adopted to model and approximate the implicit performance functions or partial derivatives. The RBF technique uses a small set of the actual data of the implicit performance functions, which are obtained via physical experiments or normal numerical analysis such as finite element methods for the complicated structural system, and are used to develop a trained RBF generalization algorithm. Then {{a large number of}} the function values and partial derivatives of implicit performance functions can be readily obtained by simply extracting information from the established and successfully trained RBF network. These function values and derivatives are used in conventional MCS, FORM or SORM to constitute RBF based reliability analysis algorithms. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate how the proposed RBF based methods are used in <b>structural</b> reliability <b>analysis.</b> The results are well compared with those obtained by the conventional reliability methods such as the Monte-Carlo simulation, multilayer perceptrons networks, the response surface method, the FORM method 2, and so on. The examples showed the proposed approach is applicable to <b>structural</b> reliability <b>analysis</b> involving implicit performance functions...|$|R
