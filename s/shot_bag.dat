50|$|A pocket snake whip can be {{curled up}} {{small enough to}} fit into a large pocket, and ranges in size from 3 feet to 6 feet in length. The pocket snake whip is {{primarily}} a whip for occasional use, such as in loading cattle. Both of these types of snake whips are made with a leather <b>shot</b> <b>bag</b> running approximately three quarters of the length of the whip.|$|E
50|$|Some shorter whips are {{designed}} with a heavy lead or steel ball woven into the pommel, or a <b>shot</b> <b>bag</b> filled with lead shot braided into the body. Other whips have flexible metallic cable or rigid metal rods in the handle. These materials provide mass, making the whip easier to crack during normal use. These weights and rigid pieces also enable the whip to be reversed and used as a bludgeon. As the incorporation of heavy, metallic, sizeable and blunt elements in a whip increases, it shifts towards becoming a flail, morning star or meteor hammer type of mace.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, MATS was {{planning}} an annual, command-wide competition similar to Strategic Air Command’s bombing competition and Tactical Air Command’s William Tell Competition. The {{first of these}} was held at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois 16 - 22 April 1962. Seven wings, the 62d Air Transport Wing, 63d Troop Carrier Wing, 1501st Air Transport Wing, 1502d Air Transport Wing, 1503d Air Transport Wing, 1607th Air Transport Wing, and 1608th Air Transport Wing, each sent one aircraft and two crews to participate. This first official CARP Rodeo consisted of three events: a low-level, daylight, navigational mission, a similar night mission, and second daylight mission following a different route. During each mission the team dropped a 25 ounce <b>shot</b> <b>bag</b> attached to a miniature parachute simulating a 225 pound load. During the night missions a small flashlight taken from Mae West life preserver to aid in recovery. Combat Control teams from the 62d and 63d wings were stationed at the drop zones to recover and score drop accuracy.|$|E

The goal of this effort was to create and validate multi-gage load equations for shear force, bending moment, and torque for two wing measurement stations. For some of the testing the aircraft was supported by three air bags in order to isolate the wing structure from extraneous load inputs through the main landing gear. Thirty-two strain gage bridges were installed on the left wing. Hydraulic loads were applied to the wing lower surface through a total of 16 load zones. Some dead weight load cases were applied to the upper wing surface using <b>shot</b> <b>bags.</b> Maximum applied loads reached 54, 000 pounds...|$|R

60|$|Upon the {{following}} morning we started on our shooting expedition, the party consisting of myself, my servant Scowl, who, as I think I said, hailed from the Cape and was half a Hottentot; Saduko; the merry old Zulu, Umbezi, {{and a number of}} his men to serve as bearers and beaters. It proved a very successful trip--that is, until the end of it--for in those days the game {{in this part of the}} country was extremely plentiful. Before the end of the second week I killed four elephants, two of them with large tusks, while Saduko, who soon developed into a very fair <b>shot,</b> <b>bagged</b> another with the double-barrelled gun that I had promised him. Also, Umbezi--how, I have never discovered, for the thing partook of the nature of a miracle--managed to slay an elephant cow with fair ivories, using the old rifle that went off at half-cock.|$|R
50|$|The Tafas {{massacre}} {{was filmed}} in Ouarzazate, Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film {{as much as}} he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient. One of the second-unit directors for the Morocco scenes was André de Toth, who suggested a <b>shot</b> wherein <b>bags</b> of blood would be machine-gunned, spraying the screen with blood. Second-unit cinematographer Nicolas Roeg approached Lean with this idea, but Lean found it disgusting. De Toth subsequently left the project.|$|R
50|$|Probably no {{invention}} {{connected with}} firearms has wrought such {{changes in the}} principle of gun construction as those effected by the “expansive cartridge case.” This invention has completely revolutionized the art of gun making, has been successfully applied to all descriptions of firearms, and has produced a new and important industry: that of cartridge manufacture. Its essential feature is preventing gas escaping the breech when the gun is fired, {{by means of an}} expansive cartridge case containing its own means of ignition. Previous to this invention shotguns and sporting rifles were loaded by means of powder flasks and <b>shot</b> <b>bags</b> or flasks, bullets, wads and copper caps, all carried separately. One of the earliest efficient modern cartridge cases was the pinfire cartridge, developed by French gunsmith Casimir Lefaucheux in 1836. It consisted of a thin weak shell made of brass and paper that expanded from the force of the explosion. This fit perfectly in the barrel, and thus formed an efficient gas check. A small percussion cap was placed {{in the middle of the}} base of the cartridge, and was ignited by means of a brass pin projecting from the side and struck by the hammer. This pin also afforded the means of extracting the cartridge case. This cartridge was introduced in England by Lang, of Cockspur Street, London, about 1845.|$|R
50|$|Set in the 1930s, Bags, an ex-boxer and Shake, {{his manager}} have {{bottomed}} out as fight trainers. Their latest fighter has lost and fired them. Without {{a home or}} even money for food. Bags tells Shake about getting back into the ring, despite Bags' record of 20 losses by knockout (out of 20 fights). One night, while at a carnival, Shake talks Bags into appearing at a $50 amateur fight. Unbeknownst to them, in the crowd is a local mobster known as Mr. Mike. Spotting opportunity, Mr. Mike arranges for Bags' opponent to take a dive in the round. Bags knocks the other boxer with a right hook, winning the money. Afterwards, Mr. Mike approaches Bags and Shake, introducing himself as a local businessman, and invites them to his mansion for dinner. During dinner, he explains {{that he would like}} to arrange Bags to get a shot at the Heavyweight title. His plan involves arranging Bags to fight the top three contenders for the title, then Bags will have a shot with the Heavyweight champ, known as the Butcher. Believing that Bags' right hook gives him a <b>shot.</b> <b>Bags</b> and Shake agree. What they don't know is that Mr. Mike is using both men as pawns in a plan to get his hands on a old boxing gym so he can tear it down for to build a new property over it.|$|R

We at once abandoned my galley, brought the rowers and the wounded here, and prepared for the fight. As you saw, they ran their two biggest ships alongside us, and for two hours the fight went on. They were crowded with men, who in vain strove to get a footing on our decks.

Two or three further broadsides followed that swept Chesapeakes decks with grape and roundshot from Shannons 32-pounder carronades.

5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round <b>shot</b> and a <b>bag</b> of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|R

60|$|The game {{started with}} a rush. Keene dumped the ball down the third-base line. Blake, anticipating the play, came rapidly in, and bending while in motion picked up the ball and made a perfect snap-throw to McCord, beating Keene by a foot. Prince drove a hot {{grass-cutter}} through the infield, and the Place stand let out shrill, exultant yells. MacNeff swung powerfully on the first ball, which streaked like a flitting wing close under his chin. Prince, with a good lead, had darted for second. It was wonderful how his little, short legs carried him so swiftly. And his slide was {{what might have been}} expected of a famous football player. He hit the ground and <b>shot</b> into the <b>bag</b> just as Raymond got Dean's unerring throw too late. Again the Place rooters howled. MacNeff watched his second strike go by. The third pitch, remorselessly true to that fatal place, retired him on strikes; and a roll of thunder pealed from under the Wayne bleachers. Starke struck at the first ball given him. The Place waiters were not waiting on Ken to-day; evidently the word had gone out to hit. Ken's beautiful, speedy ball, breast high, was certainly a temptation. Starke lifted a long, lofty fly far beyond Homans, who ran and ran, and turned to get it gracefully at his breast.|$|R
6000|$|There is a {{story told}} of him which is worth the repeating. An Englishman who flattered himself that he could speak the vernacular fairly well, paid him a visit and discoursed with a round mouth. The Maharana heard him politely, and turning to a satellite, demanded a translation; which was given. Then said the Maharana:--"Speak to him in Angrezi." [...] The Angrezi spoken by the {{interpreter}} was Urdu as the Sahibs speak it, and the Englishman, having ended his conference, departed abashed. But this backwardness is eminently suited {{to a place like}} Udaipur, and a European prince is not always a desirable thing. The curious and even startling simplicity of his life is worth preserving. Here is a specimen of one of his days. Rising at four--and the dawn can be bitterly chill--he bathes and prays after the custom of his race, and at six is ready to take in hand the first instalment of the day's work which comes before him through his Prime Minister, and occupies him for three or four hours till the first meal of the day is ready. At two o'clock he attends the Mahand Raj Sabha, and works till five, retiring at a healthily primitive hour. He is said to have his hand fairly, firmly upon the reins of rule, and to know as much as most monarchs know {{of the way in which}} his revenues--some thirty lakhs--are disposed of. The Prime Minister's career has been a chequered and interesting one, including a dismissal from power (this was worked by the Queens from behind the screen), an arrest, and an attack with swords which all but ended in his murder. He has not so much power as his predecessors had, for the reason that the present Maharaja allows little but tiger-shooting to distract him from the supervision of the State. His Highness, by the way, is a first-class <b>shot</b> and has <b>bagged</b> eighteen tigers already. He preserves his game carefully, and permission to kill tigers is not readily obtainable.|$|R
40|$|Many animal {{populations are}} {{threatened}} by human activity, including habitat loss and harvesting but recent advances in population ecology show that the age- and sex-structure are important when aiming to understand population dynamics. However, research on population dynamics often focuses on species that experience relatively little human disturbance and human caused mortality is often assumed not to affect population dynamics. An increasing number of studies shows short-term and long-term evolutionary and ecological consequences of harvesting. This has not only implications for the understanding of population dynamics {{but also for the}} management and conservation of species in human-dominated landscapes. This thesis aims to investigate the interaction between the demographic structure and harvesting in a fluctuating species, the red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) using a combination of empirical and theoretical approaches. The relative roles of age-related parasite burden, fecundity and shooting in driving population dynamics are assessed, and empirical data are used to parameterise a model examining the effect of harvesting on the population dynamics. The empirical part of the thesis starts with the investigation of the intensity and distribution of the parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis for three age-classes of red grouse before the breeding season. The intensity of the parasite increased with host age. Parasites in two-year-old grouse were more aggregated than in one-year-old and 3 +-year-old grouse. This has implications for population dynamics because the aggregation of parasites within the host influences mortality rates. Females of the oldest age class (3 +-years-old) were less fecund than younger grouse and interactions with nesting habitat and year were found to affect female fecundity. The age- and sex-structure of shot birds was compared with the age- and sex-structure of the population before shooting. More old birds were <b>shot</b> at small <b>bag</b> sizes but this bias decreased as more birds were shot. Old males were highly susceptible to shooting {{at the beginning of the}} season but susceptibility decreased with number of shooting events. A relationship between bag numbers and population density was found. An age- and sex-structured population model was used to examine the effect of harvesting on red grouse population dynamics. Selective harvest for or against a certain age class led to a skew in the sex ratio of the population and to a decrease in fecundity and therefore to a drop in population size and harvest yield. Parasites and the exclusion of young birds through aggressiveness affected the population dynamics and led to a skew in the harvest rate at which the maximum sustainable yield was attained. Shooting early in the season resulted in a higher yield because individuals were removed from the population before they contributed to the availability of free ranging stages of the parasite. The population model demonstrated that parasites, aggressiveness and harvesting interact and that harvesting is a significant factor in population dynamics. Overall, the current practice of shooting rarely more than 50 % of the population seems to be a good precautionary principle. Uncertainty in the harvesting rate increased the probability of local extirpation of the population. Therefore, reliable estimates of the population, including the age and sex structure, are invaluable parts of red grouse management. This study showed that harvesting and the age and sex structure of the population are important drivers of red grouse population dynamics and an understanding of their interactions is important for sustainable management of red grouse.
