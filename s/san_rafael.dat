5|$|The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) {{caused a}} {{shortage}} of missionaries and instability in the reductions, so no new missions were built during this period. By 1718 <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> was {{the largest of the}} Chiquitos missions, and with 2,615 inhabitants could not sustain a growing population. In 1721 the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suárez and Fr. Francisco Hervás established a split-off of the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> mission, the mission of San Miguel de Velasco. To the south, San Ignacio de Zamucos was founded in 1724 but abandoned in 1745; today nothing remains of the mission.|$|E
5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Interstate Highway System was in the {{planning}} stages, no paved road had yet entered the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> Swell. The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the swell.|$|E

50|$|Rafael José Serapio Villavicencio (1803 - 1858) was {{the second}} son of José Antonio Villavicencio (1777 - 1817) and María Serafina Espinosa (1781 - 1870). Rafael Villavicencio married María Ramona Louisa Armas in 1829. In 1842 Rafael {{received}} the two square league Rancho <b>San</b> Gerónimo. <b>Rafael,</b> Ramona and five children moved to Rancho <b>San</b> Geronimo, and <b>Rafael</b> built a large adobe house.|$|R
50|$|New Century is {{committed}} to being {{a vital part of}} the community and to educational outreach in the communities where it performs. The orchestra provides musical education to 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students in an intensive program at schools in Marin City and <b>San</b> <b>Rafael’s</b> Canal District. In addition to several annual classroom visits by a string quartet, selected students are offered free instrumental music instruction with a goal of having the students on as close of an educational equivalency as possible with their suburban peers.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology {{available at the time}} and the rough terrain of the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been the}} shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Petaluma, a {{similarly}} small town approximately 20 {{miles north of}} <b>San</b> <b>Rafael,</b> became more cooperative and American Graffiti moved there without {{the loss of a}} single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible in the finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began on June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace. Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of B movie producer Sam Katzman in attempting to save money and authenticated low-budget filming methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> de Velasco {{was the second}} mission built out of the six inscribed the World Heritage Site. Founded in 1695 by the Jesuits Fr. Juan Bautista Zea and Fr. Francisco Hervás, it was moved several times. The mission had to be moved in 1701 and 1705 because of {{epidemics}} in the region. In 1719 the mission was moved once more due to fire. Fr. Martin Schmid built the church between 1747 and 1749, which has survived. <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> de Velasco was restored between 1972 and 1996 as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.|$|E

Its 5, 6, and 11 p.m. newscast was broadcast live at <b>San</b> <b>Rafael's</b> Dominican University of California, though the latter newscast {{were used as}} a wrap-up of the debate. The debate between California gubernatorial candidates Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown was moderated by NBC News special correspondent Tom Brokaw. This program was simulcast on several other NBC stations within California including fellow NBC O KNBC and KNSD, {{as well as on}} Hearst Television-owned KCRA-TV and KSBW.|$|R
50|$|A little chapel {{of straw}} and bahareque was built El Sueldo (<b>San</b> <b>Rafael's</b> old name) by Juan Mazo, and the {{brothers}} Juan and Agustín Mira {{for two years}} since 1864; due to the distance from others churches, the Bishop of Medellín, Herrera Restrepo, created the new parish, with José de Jesús Correa as priest. He believed that the chapel and the village was based in a very remote and narrow location. After, the El Sueldo's inhabitants moved their homes near the river; and just there, Correa began a new church in August 1904, with plans drawn by the architect Emigdio Rincón. Nevertheless, {{the end of the}} building was done by the Correa's successors.|$|R

5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|E
5|$|The survey crew {{did not use}} {{the route}} of the {{railroad}} past the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> Reef. However, they did use the route of the railroad across the Wasatch Plateau. The construction crews destroyed two of four tunnels when the bed was widened for the freeway. The two remaining tunnels are visible just south of the freeway and are used by a frontage road.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway the number of visitors to the swell has increased significantly, as the swell can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E

5|$|Ten more {{missions}} {{were founded}} in the Chiquitania by the Jesuits in three periods: the 1690s, the 1720s, and after 1748. In the 1690s, five missions were established: <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and San Juan Bautista (1699). San Juan Bautista {{is not part of}} the World Heritage Site, and only the ruins of a stone tower survive near the present village of (San Juan de) Taperas.|$|E
5|$|The Rocketeer's {{attack on}} the Nazi Zeppelin was filmed near Six Flags Magic Mountain {{amusement}} park in Valencia, California over four months through pick-ups. Remaining visual effects footage took place at ILM's headquarters in <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> and Hamilton Air Force Base. There, they constructed a 12ft scale model of the Zeppelin, which was photographed against matte paintings that resembled 1938 Los Angeles for intercutting purposes. The Zeppelin explosion special effect alone cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{mission in}} the World Heritage Site, that of San Miguel de Velasco, was {{established}} by the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suarez and Fr. Francisco Hervás in 1721. San Miguel was {{an offshoot of the}} mission of <b>San</b> <b>Rafael</b> de Velaso, where the population had grown too large. The mission church was built between 1752 and 1759, probably by Fr. Johann Messner, a collaborator with or student of Fr. Martin Schmid. The church was restored by Hans Roth between 1979 and 1983.|$|E
