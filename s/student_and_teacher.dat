40|$|In this {{empirical}} {{paper we}} consider the problem of communication <b>and</b> interaction between <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> in the classroom, {{looking at it from}} the aspect of the position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> in everyday teaching practice. Namely, we wanted to examine the attitudes of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> related to the position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> on the occurrence of misunderstandings and conflicts in the classroom. The sample on which the study was conducted was made of third grade secondary vocational schools and high schools <b>and</b> their <b>teachers.</b> Dependent variable is descriptive: the position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> as a factor of conflict in communication between <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> divided in to two groups of indicators (first: indicators that help to prevent conflicts-objective subjective position of <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> other: indicators that initiate the sole objective position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> subjective position of the teacher). Research results to some extent, we should give a clearer picture of which segments are different perceptions of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> related to the position as a factor in any conflict and misunderstanding in communication between the direct participants in the teaching process...|$|R

25|$|Opponents {{of the law}} {{claimed that}} the {{government}} didn’t seek advice from the students adequately. They were also unsatisfied that minority ethnic languages would not be taught at institutes of higher education.

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of initiativ es to attract {{secondary}} school students to computer science. cs 4 fn is one such project. It combines a magazine, website and live shows, telling stories about computer science in spirited and creative ways. Here we focus {{on the use of the}} magazine and, using sociolinguistic discourse analysis, we analyze comments from <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> to understand why they have requested (free) subscriptions to the magazine and how they plan to use it. Our analysis shows that both <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> are attracted to the flexibility that cs 4 fn provides, and use it in a variety of learning contexts. We find that the flexibility of the magazine makes it a valuable tool to engage <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> that they use it to further enthuse others (i. e., other <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers).</b> We suggest that cs 4 fn magazine is a powerful form of outreach and that this approach can be widely disseminated within computer science and other academic disciplines, raising the profile of computing to both <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> spreading enthusiasm for computer science...|$|R

25|$|In regards, to education, caring {{refers to}} the {{relationship}} between <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher,</b> not just the person who cares. As educators respond to the needs of students, teachers may see the need to design a differentiated curriculum because as teachers work closely with students, we will be moved by their different needs and interests. The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student’s welfare.|$|E
25|$|In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague, {{to become}} the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois (1820–1883), the exiled Crown Prince and {{grandson}} of Charles X. As a professor of the École Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding {{that only a few}} of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.|$|E

This study was conducted to explore the meanings that GED <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> make of the General Educational Development (GED) certificate. This study specifically explored the social value of the GED for <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers.</b> This study then analyzed empirical research on the performance outcomes of GED acquisition. Empirical research provided a foundation for a comparison of meaning and quantified outcome. The meanings of the <b>students</b> <b>and</b> the empirical outcomes focused narrowly on career, self-esteem and higher education. The perceptions of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> were then compared to see whether the demonstrated performance outcomes of the GED matched the meanings of the GED of a selected group of Illinois GED <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers.</b> The study shows that empirical data on GED performance outcomes contradicts the social value meanings of GED <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> for economic <b>and</b> educational improvement. Self-esteem, a social value for <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> was supported by extant empirical data. The phenomenological study of two stakeholder groups, GED <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> was conducted by unstructured interviews with members of each group (students, teachers). The qualitative inquiry provided a conduit to evoke meanings about the GED credential and its social value to them. Conclusions drawn from the study were that GED <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> place high social value on the GED as a credential for economic mobility, enhanced self-esteem, and success in higher education. However, existing research data on the GED provided sufficient indicators to suggest that GED recipients do not fare as well as high school graduates academically or economically, and that the increasing presence of the GED requires a close scrutiny of its value in the American educational and economic market systems...|$|R

25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{selection}} process used to gain admission to the TAG Magnet; and, since one of the definitions of a TAG student is a national-norm reading score of “80” or higher, the school does not have students who read below grade level. However, since TAG requires an AP course (AP Human Geography) as freshman, the school does have {{students who do not}} read well enough to tackle a college-level course in their first year of high school. These students are referred to the Student Support Team (SST) for review. This leads to a parent-teacher-student conference attended by both the counselor and the principal. Parent, <b>student,</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> agree to work together as they check on progress achieved through tutoring before and after school. In some cases, additional projects are assigned to improve reading skills.|$|E
25|$|The first {{quadripartite meeting}} {{ended with the}} {{students}} reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators. However, Aung Min, a President’s Office Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president {{the responsibility of the}} students' safety until they arrived in Popa in Mandalay Region. The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2009, it was {{proposed}} {{to close the}} Butterfield Elementary campus and combine its students with those at a nearby middle school, to form the Lakeland Village School. On February 11, 2010, the Lake Elsinore Unified School District Governing Board voted to close the campus and {{to proceed with the}} conversion of the Lakeland Village Middle School into a K-8th grade facility. Butterfield closed {{on the last day of}} school on June 3, 2010, after 28 years of service to the Lakeland Village community. The district believed it would save $500,000 through the closure. Most students from Butterfield continued at the new campus. On February 11, 2010, a new principal, Rita Post, was appointed to head the Lakeland Village School, with the then Butterfield principal, Dorri Neal, becoming principal at William Collier Elementary. The district spent approximately $1.5 million to renovate the 5 year old Lakeland Village Middle School to accommodate the K-5th grade students. The entire <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> population (along with the same attendance boundaries) moved 3 miles south to the campus of Lakeland Village Middle School which was renamed Lakeland Village School as it becomes a K-8 school.|$|E
