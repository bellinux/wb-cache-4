The analyzed machine, a 6 slot 4 pole motor, utilizes a segmented stator core structure for ease of coil winding, pre-assembly and facilitation of high slot fill factors (~ 60 %). The impact on the motors torque producing capability and its power factor of these inter-segment air-gaps between the stator segments is investigated through 2 D FEA studies where it is shown {{that they have a}} low impact.

40|$|As {{the cost}} for {{permanent}} magnets are decreasing {{and the quality of}} the magnets are increasing the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) are becoming more popular. The PMSM is superior to induction machines both in torque per kilograms and efficiency. Typical applications for these machines are applications where machine volume or efficiency is important. In order to control a PMSM the rotor position needs to be known. This can be obtained by usage of sensor or by usage of a sensorless control scheme. Sensorless Control schemes typically divide into two categories; schemes that give good controllability from 2 - 5 Hz and schemes that gives good controllability at all speeds including zero speed. The focus for this thesis is sensorless control schemes with good controllability at low and zero speeds. Sensorless control is a multi physics challenge where the machine, inverter and control scheme are equally important for the quality of the drive system. In order to describe the saliency in the machine a new saliency machine model is developed in this thesis. The model includes yoke saturation, teeth saturation and induced currents in magnets. In injection based sensorless control the high frequency flux distribution in the machine is of great interest. In this thesis the frequency dependency in inductance is estimated in two machines by using injection of test signals in a large frequency range. Based on the measurements and the new saliency model the high frequency flux distribution is estimated and the frequency dependency of the saliency is described. A variety of different sensorless schemes are published over the last two decades. As the publications uses different test criteria it is challenging to determine the characteristics for the different schemes: three different control schemes are evaluated in terms of determining the scheme characteristics. A new scheme based on [1, 7] is presented in this thesis. The new scheme enables integration of transient excitation and position estimation in every switching period. The continuous injection based schemes evaluated in this work is rotating high frequency carrier injection [2, 13, 39] and pulsating high frequency carrier injection [3, 26]. The different schemes sensitivity to the inverter non linearity is modelled and evaluated. A comparison of the three schemes is presented. Surface mounted PMSM typically has a small saliency. The saliency in a surface mounted PMSM can be increased in several ways. The last part of this thesis presents a redesign approach for an axial flux PMSM. Several approaches are evaluated in terms of synergy effects with the machine cost and performance.

40|$|This is an {{interpretation}} of my sculptures, developed during two years of creating and living with them, rather than a pre-conceived formula {{to which they were}} made. Initially, none of these ideas were consciously in mind; as time passed I came to understand what meanings and influences were at work. The content of this series has four basic aspects: materials, structural forms, energy and connections. These four intertwine in both obvious and subtle relationships; each is linked to, and incomplete without the others. Each sculpture emphasizes these aspects in varying degrees. The materials are bronze and wood. The inorganic and the organic, firmness and flexibility are combined to produce structural strength. These two particular materials take age and exposure well, becoming more beautiful with time, yielding rich colors and textures. The wood is weathered and cracked, and the bronze carries a heavy patina to impart a reeling of great age. The structural forms are kept within the limits of what I call a ???bronze age??? technology. This is less an historical criteria than a discipline of respect for the virtues and limitations of the metal. Respect for materials requires creating forms particularly appropriate to the materials, using their properties to fullest advantage, but not demanding performance beyond their capabilities. Bronze has strength when in mass, but is weak when light and thin. Therefore the bronze parts are heavy and massive and without such ???iron age??? devices as threads, nuts and bolts. Bronze is too soft to adequately support forms such as these under stress. The sculptures employ toggles, wedges and heavy links because devices such as these exhibit an obvious visual logic in how they work to hold the sculpture together. Nails, dowels, nuts and bolts do not have this blatancy and do not evoke the same visual excitement. The less decorative traditions of Japanese carpentry share this spirit, not attempting to hide or minimalize their attaching members or fabrication, but letting the joints, <b>slots</b> and <b>wedges</b> be seen in their own rugged, functional beauty.

40|$|Thesis MTech(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 Reluctance Synchronous Machines (RSM) have, due {{to their}} rotor geometry, an {{inherently}} high torque ripple. This torque ripple {{is defined as the}} deviation of the minimum and maximum torque from the average value. It is unwanted as it indicates uneven pull on the rotor causing deformation of it and hence different air-gaps along the rotor circumference as well as acoustic noise. In applications such as power steering, robotics and radar positioning systems where high precision movement is vital, oscillating torque will lead to the malfunction of these devices and therefore suppressed the use and development of RSMs. Unlike the Induction machine (IM), the RSM has no copper losses in the rotor, which reduces the operating temperature significantly. With the development of electronic drives the quality of the output torque could be improved by means of accurate current- and flux space phasor control methods with much success and made the RSM a possible replacement for the IM. However, reducing torque ripple by means of purely geometrical changes is still a challenge to the machine designer. This thesis will focus on the reduction of torque ripple while leaving the average torque relatively unchanged by changing the rotor geometry. The rotor changes will take place by means of flux barriers and cut-outs while the stator has either semi-closed <b>slots</b> or magnetic <b>wedges.</b> In this work rotor structures with equal harmonic magnitudes but their angles 1800 apart. will be combined to form one machine and identify how torque harmonics respond. The change in average torque and power factor will be evaluated with all geometrical changes made to these machines throughout this work...|$|R

The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The bearings consist of brass boxes arranged to be lubricated by two rings in each bearing. These rings revolve as the shaft turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The core is firmly bolted to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the <b>slots</b> by thin <b>wedges</b> of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel.

40|$|In {{order that}} the radius and thus ununiform {{structure}} of the teeth and otherelectrical and magnetic parts of the machine may {{be taken into consideration}} the calculation of an axial flux permanent magnet machine is, conventionally, doneby means of 3 D FEM-methods. This calculation procedure, however, requires a lotof time and computer recourses. This study proves that also analytical methods can be applied to perform the calculation successfully. The procedure of the analytical calculation can be summarized into following steps: first the magnet is divided into slices, which makes the calculation for each section individually, and then the parts are submitted to calculation of the final results. It is obvious that using this method can save a lot of designing and calculating time. Thecalculation program is designed to model the magnetic and electrical circuits of surface mounted axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machines in such a way, that it takes into account possible magnetic saturation of the iron parts. Theresult of the calculation is the torque of the motor including the vibrations. The motor geometry and the materials and either the torque or pole angle are defined and the motor can be fed with an arbitrary shape and amplitude of three-phase currents. There are no limits for the size and number of the pole pairs nor for many other factors. The calculation steps and the number of different sections of the magnet are selectable, but the calculation time is strongly depending on this. The results are compared to the measurements of real prototypes. The permanent magnet creates part of the flux in the magnetic circuit. The form and amplitude of the flux density in the air-gap depends on the geometry and material of the magnetic circuit, on the length of the air-gap and remanence flux density of the magnet. Slotting is taken into account by using the Carter factor in the slot opening area. The calculation is simple and fast if the shape of the magnetis a square and has no skew in relation to the stator slots. With a more complicated magnet shape the calculation has to be done in several sections. It is clear that according to the increasing number of sections also the result will become more accurate. In a radial flux motor all sections of the magnets create force with a same radius. In the case of an axial flux motor, each radial section creates force with a different radius and the torque is the sum of these. The magnetic circuit of the motor, consisting of the stator iron, rotor iron, air-gap, magnet and the slot, is modelled with a reluctance net, which considers the saturation of the iron. This means, that several iterations, in which the permeability is updated, has to be done in order to get final results. The motor torque is calculated using the instantaneous linkage flux and stator currents. Flux linkage is called the part of the flux that is created by the permanent magnets and the stator currents passing through the coils in stator teeth. The angle between this flux and the phase currents define the torque created by the magnetic circuit. Due to the winding structure of the stator and in order to limit the leakage flux the slot openings of the stator are normally not made of ferromagnetic material even though, in some cases, semimagnetic <b>slot</b> <b>wedges</b> are used. In the slot opening faces the flux enters the iron almost normally (tangentially with respect to the rotor flux) creating tangential forces in the rotor. This phenomenon iscalled cogging. The flux in the slot opening area on the different sides of theopening and in the different slot openings is not equal and so these forces do not compensate each other. In the calculation it is assumed that the flux entering {{the left side of the}} opening is the component left from the geometrical centre of the slot. This torque component together with the torque component calculated using the Lorenz force make the total torque of the motor. It is easy to assume that when all the magnet edges, where the derivative component of the magnet flux density is at its highest, enter the slot openings at the same time, this will have as a result a considerable cogging torque. To reduce the cogging torquethe magnet edges can be shaped so that they are not parallel to the stator slots, which is the common way to solve the problem. In doing so, the edge may be spread along the whole slot pitch and thus also the high derivative component willbe spread to occur equally along the rotation. Besides forming the magnets theymay also be placed somewhat asymmetric on the rotor surface. The asymmetric distribution can be made in many different ways. All the magnets may have a different deflection of the symmetrical centre point or they can be for example shiftedin pairs. There are some factors that limit the deflection. The first is that the magnets cannot overlap. The magnet shape and the relative width compared to the pole define the deflection in this case. The other factor is that a shifting of the poles limits the maximum torque of the motor. If the edges of adjacent magnets are very close to each other the leakage flux from one pole to the other increases reducing thus the air-gap magnetization. The asymmetric model needs some assumptions and simplifications in order to limit the size of the model and calculation time. The reluctance net is made for symmetric distribution. If the magnets are distributed asymmetrically the flux in the different pole pairs will not be exactly the same. Therefore, the assumption that the flux flows from the edges of the model to the next pole pairs, in the calculation model from one edgeto the other, is not correct. If it were wished for that this fact should be considered in multi-pole pair machines, this would mean that all the poles, in other words the whole machine, should be modelled in reluctance net. The error resulting from this wrong assumption is, nevertheless, irrelevant...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of the stator core design for a surface permanent magnet motor (SPMM) on the cogging torque profile. The objective is to show how the cogging torque of this type of motor can be significantly reduced by implementing an original compound technique by skewing stator <b>slots</b> and inserting <b>wedges</b> in the <b>slot</b> openings. Design/methodology/approach – At the beginning generic model of a SPMM is studied. By using FEA, for this idealised assembly, characteristics of cogging and electromagnetic torque are simulated and determined for one period of their change. Afterwards, actual stator design of the original SPMM is described. It is thoroughly investigated and the torque characteristics are compared with the generic ones. While the static torque is slightly decreased, the peak cogging torque is almost doubled and the curve exhibits an uneven profile. The first method for cogging torque reduction is skewing the stator stack. The second technique is to insert wedges of SMC in the slot openings. By using 2 D and 2 1 / 2 D numerical experiment cogging curves are calculated and compared. The best results are achieved by combining the two techniques. The comparative analyses of the motor models show the advantages of the proposed novel stator topology. Findings – It is presented how the peak cogging torque can be substantially decreased due to changes in the stator topology. The constraint is to keep the same stator lamination. By skewing stator stack for one slot pitch 10 ° the peak cogging torque is threefold reduced. The SMC <b>wedges</b> in <b>slot</b> opening decrease the peak cogging almost four times. The novel stator topology, a combination of the former ones, leads to peak cogging of respectable 0. 182 [*]Nm, which is reduced for 7. 45 times.
