25|$|In {{more recent}} {{nationwide}} surveys, several {{researchers found that}} about twice as many men as women reported having an extramarital affair. A survey conducted in 1990 found 2.2% of married participants reported having more than one partner during the past year. In general, national surveys conducted in the early 1990s reported that between 15-25% of married Americans reported having extramarital affairs. Treas and Giesen {{found that people who}} had stronger sexual interests, more permissive sexual values, lower subjective satisfaction with their partner, weaker network ties to their partner, and greater sexual opportunities {{were more likely to be}} unfaithful. Studies suggest around 30–40% of unmarried relationships and 18–20% of marriages <b>see</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one incident of sexual infidelity.|$|E
25|$|Pauling then {{proposed}} that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was a triple helix; his model contained several basic mistakes, including a proposal of neutral phosphate groups, {{an idea that}} conflicted with the acidity of DNA. Sir Lawrence Bragg had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race to find the alpha helix structure of proteins. Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar nature of the peptide bond. When it was learned at the Cavendish Laboratory that Pauling was working on molecular models {{of the structure of}} DNA, James Watson and Francis Crick were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA. They later benefited from unpublished data from Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis. Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure for the DNA double helix. Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs. During the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the world's best images. They were key to Watson's and Crick's success. Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant Robert Corey did <b>see</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England. Pauling had been prevented from attending because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies. This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was {{at the start of the}} McCarthy period in the United States). Politics did not play a critical role. Not only did Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper. He had ample opportunity to visit Franklin's lab and see her work, but chose not to.|$|E

500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to <b>see</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I <b>see</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 3, but I suppose there are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa. As however only a knowledge of other anatomical particulars, the position and structure of the gills, of the heart etc. can decide the question I have left the family near Trichotropis in accordance with the newest systematic arrangement of Paul Pelseneer (A treatise on Zoology, edited by Ray Lankester, Part V, Mollusca, 1906, p.156) ...|$|E
