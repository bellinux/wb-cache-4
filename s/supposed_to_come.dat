5|$|After {{hearing from}} Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr {{asked him whether}} he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E

On May 9 he summoned {{governor}} Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Meneval to surrender. Meneval, in command of about 70 men and a fort in disrepair, promptly negotiated terms of capitulation. When Phips came ashore the next day, {{it was discovered that}} Acadians had been removing valuables, including some that were government property (and thus were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under the victor's control).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the three species known from remains, several hypothetical extinct Ara macaws were only based on contemporary accounts, but are considered dubious today. Many of these were named by Walter Rothschild in the early 20th century, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, the Martinique macaw (Ara martinicus) was from Martinique island, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Dominica island.|$|E
25|$|The sponsors, who {{had joined}} forces in the {{previous}} tours under the name La Sportive, were now financially stable enough {{to have their own}} teams. Automoto, sponsor of the team with the Pélissier brothers, had commercial interests in Italy, so wanted to have Italian cyclists in the team. Several Italian cyclists were hired, who were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to France. Only one Italian cyclist showed up, Ottavio Bottecchia, who had started as a professional the year before. The sponsor then decided that the marketing plan would not work with only one Italian cyclist, and wanted to send him back. At the last minute, Bottecchia was allowed to stay on the team.|$|E

25|$|With much {{of western}} {{mainland}} Southeast Asia under his control, Bayinnaung now felt {{ready to take}} on Siam. He needed an overwhelming advantage in manpower over Siam because unlike interior Shan states, Siam could not be overwhelmed by the strength of his Portuguese firearms alone. Siam was a prosperous coastal power in its own right, and its forces included Portuguese firearms, ships and mercenaries. On 16 July 1563, he sent an embassy to Siam, demanding one of the four white elephants in possession of the Siamese king as tribute. As expected, King Maha Chakkraphat duly refused. On 1 November 1563, five armies (60,000 men, 2400 horses and 360 elephants) left Pegu to start the campaign. Another army from Lan Na was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down but King Mekuti of Lan Na had revolted.|$|E

However, the PWA was able to drill new wells for only 30 mcm {{at the expense of}} the {{existing}} springs and wells. In the Oslo II Accord, the Israelis are allotted four times the Palestinian portion or 80% of the joint-aquifer resources. However, 94% (340 mcm) of the Western Aquifer was allotted to the Israelis for use within Israel. The allowed quantities have not been adapted after the end of the supposed five years interim period.

Under this model a private operator would design and construct the system, and operate it for 30 years, including the associated demand and commercial risks. The public sector would own the assets finances the project.

25|$|A word of {{explanation}} seems necessary {{with regard to}} the introduction of the new term Archebiosis. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word Biogenesis to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word Biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist , who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word Abiogenesis. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced {{the use of the word}} Biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.|$|E

He also noted the development in Liz and Jenna's friendship, learning that they go [...] "way back" [...] as friends and as a comedy team. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad disagreed, however. She felt that the show had too many storylines and that this episode made it seem as if the show was about the relationship between Liz and Jenna, rather than the storylines introduced in the pilot.

500|$|With {{this basic}} concept in mind, the creators had 3 months {{to define a}} visual {{identity}} and a setting for their game, prior to development. The game would be set in a post-apocalyptic science fantasy world, featuring ruins and relics of a fallen civilization and mankind struggling for survival, something typical in anime at that time. Futatsugi was particularly influenced {{by one of his}} childhood readings, The Long Afternoon of Earth, a science-fiction novel by Brian Aldiss, in which one side of the earth became perpetually hot, the other perpetually cold. The first presentation video featured a green dragon, in line with traditional European/medieval depictions, however the team quickly decided to change it and make it [...] "more sci-fi". In order for the dragon to be more original, it was made blue and covered in a white, bone-like armor.
