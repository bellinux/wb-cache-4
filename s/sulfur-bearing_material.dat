40|$|The {{definitions}} and associated explanations of water-related terms presented here {{are intended to}} provide the reader with a working knowledge of terms that apply to Virginia’s water resources. The list is designed to assist the user in understanding and interpreting water related information that may come from sources as varied as governmental agencies, environmental groups, or the news media. While terms and definitions are fairly consistent, some terminology presented here could be defined differently to describe water resources issues in other locations. A Absorption –the process by which chemicals in gaseous, liquid or solid phases are incorporated into and included within another gas, liquid, or solid chemical. For example, a sponge absorbs water. Acid mine drainage –water draining from areas that have been mined for coal or other mineral ores. The drainage water is acidic, sometimes having a pH less than 2. 0, because of its contact with <b>sulfur-bearing</b> <b>material...</b>|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{of sulfur}} stable isotope ratios (34 S/ 32 S) have {{suffered}} in the past from technical difficulties in analyzing low-S materials reducing their use despite their undeniable scientific interest. The measurement of 34 S/ 32 S ratios is {{a powerful tool for}} deciphering problems such as determining the sources of environmental pollutants, to detect adulteration, tracking the evolution of the redox state of the oceans, and quantifying the role of the bacterial activity in sulfide minerals genesis. We have used an innovative high–precision, easy and rapid method of simultaneous analysis of carbon (13 C/ 12 C), nitrogen (15 N/ 14 N) and sulfur (34 S/ 32 S) isotope ratios as well as elemental concentrations using a new combination of elemental analyzer and isotopic ratio mass spectrometer. This new technique provides multiple isotopic signatures on smaller sample aliquots with high precisions especially for sulfur determinations. The technique described here is Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) on line in continuous flow mode with an Elemental Analyzer (EA) based on “purge and trap ” technology rather than conventional packed-GC gas separation. Emphasis is put on the efficiency of the system to reliably combust sulfur–bearing compounds of both organic and inorganic origin with high conversion yields. This new technique demonstrates the high quality of 34 S/ 32 S measurements for samples with S concentrations lower than 1 wt%. International calibrated references of diverse <b>sulfur-bearing</b> <b>materials</b> were used to calibrate two low (< 1 %) S-bearing phosphorites used as compositional reference material for future us...|$|R

High quality of 34 S/ 32 S determinations is illustrated using various international reference materials. Working calibrated material has been selected and characterized for all three isotopic signatures as well in order to fully use the capacities of the system in future work. The possibilities of such a system to reliably measure S isotopes as well as N and C within the same aliquot of sample opens up new fields of investigation in many domains where multi-isotopic approaches are required...|$|R
40|$|We {{produced}} a geologic/geomorphologic {{map of the}} Chaac-Camaxtli region of Io's leading anti-Jovian hemisphere using regional resolution (186 m/pixel) Galileo imaging data collected during orbit I 27 (February 2000) integrated with lower resolution (1. 4 km/pixel) color data, along with other Galileo imaging and spectral data. This is the first regional map of Io made from Galileo data. Nine color and geomorphologic units have been mapped, and the close proximity of dark and various colored bright materials {{suggests that there is}} an intimate interaction between (presumably) silicate magmas and <b>sulfur-bearing</b> volatile <b>materials</b> that {{produced a}} variety of explosive and effusive deposits in the recent geologic past. This region of Io is dominated by 11 volcanic centers, most of which are paterae that are analogous in morphology to terrestrial calderas but larger in size. Mapping of structural features indicates that most of the active regions occur in topographic lows, and less active or inactive paterae are associated with topographic highs. This indicates that crustal thickness variations influence magma access to the surface. Surface changes in this region since the Voyager flybys (1979) are relatively minor (additional bright and dark flows, color changes), although several active vents have migrated within paterae. This observation, along with the identification of the relatively regular spacing of paterae (approx. 100 - 150 km) along a line, may indicate there are multiple interlacing fractures in the crust that serve as magma conduits from the interior. This connection between volcanism and tectonism may have implications for tidal heating mechanisms and their effect on Io's lithosphere. Some inactive patera floors may be evolving into bright plains material, which, if composed of silicates, might explain the strength of Io's crust to support steep patera walls and tall mountains...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{treatment}} {{technologies for}} the removal of waste carbon, nitrogen, and/or sulfur under anoxic/anaerobic conditions have recently received considerable attention. It has been reported that nitrate and/or reduced N-oxides, such as nitrite (NO 2 -), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which are products of denitrification, suppress methanogenesis. Research was conducted to investigate the effect of N-oxides and sulfide on mixed, mesophilic (35 oC) methanogenic cultures, along with the effect of the type of electron donor on the kinetics and pathway of nitrate reduction. Among all N-oxides tested, NO exerted the most and nitrate exerted the least inhibitory effect on the fermentative/methanogenic consortia. Long-term exposure of a methanogenic culture to nitrate resulted in an increase of N-oxide reduction and a decrease of methane production rates. Sulfide addition to sulfide-free enriched cultures resulted in inhibition of NO 2 -, NO, and N 2 O reduction causing accumulation of these intermediates, which in turn inhibited methanogenesis and fermentation. In nitrate-amended, sulfide-acclimated cultures, nitrate reduction occurred via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA); thus, accumulation of N-oxides was avoided and inhibition of methanogenesis was prevented. The nitrate reduction rates in cultures fed with different electron donors followed the descending order: H 2 /CO 2 > acetate > glucose > dextrin/peptone > propionate. Denitrification was observed in the propionate-, acetate-, and H 2 /CO 2 -fed cultures regardless of the COD/N value. Both denitrification and DNRA were observed in the dextrin/peptone- and glucose-fed cultures and the predominance of either of the two pathways was a function of the COD/N value. Nitrate reduction processes were incorporated into the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM 1) in order to account for the effect of nitrate reduction processes on fermentation and methanogenesis. The extended ADM 1 described the experimental results very well. Model simulations showed that process interactions during nitrate reduction within an overall methanogenic system cannot be explained based on only stoichiometry and kinetics, especially for batch systems and/or continuous-flow systems with periodic, shock nitrate loads. The results of this research are useful in predicting the fate of carbon-, nitrogen-, and <b>sulfur-bearing</b> waste <b>material,</b> as well as in understanding microbial process interactions, in both natural and engineered anoxic/anaerobic systems.
