40|$|The {{leading edge}} region {{of a first}} stage <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> {{experiences}} high heat transfer rates especially near the endwall making it very important {{to get a better}} understanding of the formation of the leading edge vortex. In order to improve numerical predictions of the complex endwall flow, benchmark quality experimental data are required. To this purpose, this study documents the endwall heat transfer and static pressure coefficient distribution of a modern <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> for two different exit Reynolds num-bers (Re ex = 6 x 105 and 1. 2 x 106). In addition, laser Doppler velocime-ter measurements of all three components of the mean and fluctuating velocities are presented for the stagnation plane in the leading edge re-gion. Results indicate that the endwall heat transfer, pressure distribu-tion and flowfield characteristics change with Reynolds number. The endwall pressure distributions show that lower pressure coefficients oc-cur at the higher Reynolds number due to secondary flows. The stronger secondary flows cause enhanced heat transfer near the trailing edge of the vane at the higher Reynolds number.
