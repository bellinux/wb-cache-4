2500|$|The Super Bowl {{controversy}} {{was also}} a subject of humor {{on all of the}} late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he [...] "was happy to see this thing happen... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS". The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a [...] "Department of Wardrobe Security" [...] to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions. On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction. Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener. Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting [...] "I wore them once, they were cute." [...] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation [...] "silly", commenting [...] "In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this." [...] Dean added [...] "I don't find it terribly shocking relative to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has {{a lot of other things}} they should be pursuing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Charming, certainly," [...] said Keriway, [...] "but {{too full}} of the stress of its own little life {{struggle}} to be peaceful. Since I have lived here I've learnt, what I've always suspected, that a country farmhouse, set away {{in a world of}} its own, {{is one of the most}} wonderful studies of interwoven happenings and tragedies that can be imagined. It is like the old chronicles of medieval Europe in the days when there was a sort of ordered anarchy between feudal lords and overlords, and burg-grafs, and mitred abbots, and prince- bishops, robber barons and merchant guilds, and Electors and so forth, all striving and contending and counter-plotting, and interfering with each other under some vague code of loosely- applied rules. Here one sees it reproduced under one's eyes, like a musty page of black-letter come to life. Look at one little section of it, the poultry-life on the farm. Villa poultry, dull egg-machines, with records kept of how many ounces of food they eat, and how many pennyworths of eggs they lay, give you no idea of the wonder-life of these farm-birds; their feuds and jealousies, and carefully maintained prerogatives, their unsparing tyrannies and persecutions, their calculated courage and bravado or sedulously hidden cowardice, it might all be some human chapter from the annals of the old Rhineland or medieval Italy. And then, outside their own bickering wars and hates, the grim enemies that come up against them from the woodlands; the hawk that dashes among the coops like a moss-trooper raiding the border, knowing well that a charge of shot may tear him to bits at any moment. And the stoat, a creeping slip of brown fur a few inches long, intently and unstayably out for blood. And the hunger-taught master of craft, the red fox, who has waited perhaps half the afternoon for his chance while the fowls were dusting themselves under the hedge, and just as they were turning supper-ward to the yard one has stopped a moment to give her feathers a final shake and found death springing upon her. Do you know," [...] he continued, as Elaine fed herself and the mare with morsels of currant-loaf, [...] "I don't think any tragedy in literature that I have ever come across impressed me so much as the first one, that I spelled out slowly for myself in words of three letters: the bad fox has got the red hen. There was something so dramatically complete about it; the badness of the fox, added to all the traditional guile of his race, seemed to heighten the horror of the hen's fate, and there was such a suggestion of masterful malice about the word 'got.' One felt that a countryside in arms would not get that hen away from the bad fox. They used to think me a slow dull reader for not getting on with my lesson, but I used to sit and picture to myself the red hen, with its wings beating helplessly, screeching in terrified protest, or perhaps, if he had got it by the neck, with beak wide agape and silent, and eyes staring, as it left the farmyard for ever. I have seen blood-spillings and down-crushings and abject defeat here and there in my time, but the red hen has remained in my mind as the type of helpless tragedy." [...] He was silent for a moment as if he were again musing over the three-letter drama that had so dwelt in his childhood's imagination. [...] "Tell me <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have seen in your time," [...] was the request that was nearly on Elaine's lips, but she hastily checked herself and substituted another.|$|E

5000|$|Despite his {{retirement}} in 1998, Galanos continued to make his presence known in the fashion world. In 2002, he blasted the fashion industry for catering to only young women with perfect bodies. In an interview with WWD over lunch at the Pierre Hotel in New York he asked the reporter, Eric Wilson, {{shaking his head in}} contempt, [...] "How many women can wear just a patch over their crotch and a bra? Aren't you embarrassed when you see a young girl walking down the street practically naked? Fashion is geared only to young people today," [...] Galanos continued. [...] "All we see is Levi's and bare bellies to the point of nausea. There are no clothes for elegant women. Let's face it, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> see in the paper are absolutely monstrous looking - and I'm not squeamish. God knows I made sexy clothes in my day, but there's a point when you have to say, 'Enough, already'." [...] Of contemporary designers, he admired the work of Ralph Rucci, who shares Galanos' views of the state of fashion {{at the beginning of the}} new millennium. [...] "I think we're in a state of mediocrity," [...] Rucci told design students at the San Francisco Academy of Art University. [...] Beginning in the early 2000s, Galanos attended most of Rucci's shows in New York and Paris. [...] "I thought what he was doing was really terrific," [...] Galanos told Cathy Horyn of The New York Times in 2002, [...] "he has the same kind of concept that I had - beautiful details that you don't see in ready-to-wear." [...] "Ralph Rucci makes clothes like no one else, taking pains to make things that are beautifully finished," [...] he told Harper's Bazaar in 2004. On his side, Rucci considers Galanos a major influence in his work and a continuing inspiration. [...] "If we were in Japan, we'd have an expression and call Galanos our national living treasure," [...] Rucci told a group of distinguished guests that included Nancy Reagan, Betsy Bloomingdale and Peggy Moffitt, at an event honoring Galanos at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills.|$|E

For example, it requires {{you not to}} have contradictory beliefs, and to intend what you believe is a necessary {{means to an end}} that you intend. Suppose rationality requires you to F. Does this fact constitute a reason for you to F? Does it even follow from this fact that you have a reason to F? I examine these questions and reach a sceptical conclusion about them. I can find no satisfactory argument to show that either has the answer 'yes'. I consider the idea that rationality is normative for instrumental reasons, because it helps you to achieve <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> ought to achieve. I also consider the idea that rationality consists in responding correctly to reasons. I reject both. 1. The normative question Rationality requires various things of you. For example, it requires you not to have contradictory beliefs, to believe what follows by modus ponens from things you believe, to intend what you believe to be a necessary means to an end that you intend, and to intend to do what you believe you ought to do. These are only rough formulations, and rough formulations are perhaps enough for this paper. However, for the sake of accuracy, I shall give more formal statements of the requirement that you believe what follows by modus ponens from things you believe, and the requirement that you intend to do what you believe you ought to do.
