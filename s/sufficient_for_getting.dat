40|$|The {{standard}} assumption for proving linear {{convergence of}} first order methods for smooth convex optimization is the strong convexity {{of the objective}} function, an assumption which does not hold for many practical applications. In this paper, we derive linear convergence rates of several first order methods for solving smooth non-strongly convex constrained optimization problems, i. e. involving an objective function with a Lipschitz continuous gradient that satisfies some relaxed strong convexity condition. In particular, {{in the case of}} smooth constrained convex optimization, we provide several relaxations of the strong convexity conditions and prove that they are <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> linear convergence for several first order methods such as projected gradient, fast gradient and feasible descent methods. We also provide examples of functional classes that satisfy our proposed relaxations of strong convexity conditions. Finally, we show that the proposed relaxed strong convexity conditions cover important applications ranging from solving linear systems, Linear Programming, and dual formulations of linearly constrained convex problems.

40|$|Abstract. Machine Translation (MT) is {{the oldest}} {{application}} area of computational linguistics, {{dating back to the}} early years of the Cold War, and MT is one of the biggest application areas for computational linguistics, with technical manuals, office materials, and other communications being translated daily. Unlike the translation of literary texts, where a considerable amount of creativity is required on the part of the translator, Machine Translation is focused on translations which preserve the information content of the source language as much as possible, while rendering it in a natural form in the target language. Its main advantages are economic, particularly when the volume of text is such that humans could not possibly translate it. Lower accuracy translations may be <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> the gist of some foreign language source, whereas for higher-quality results, post-editing of the machine translation by humans is often necessary.

40|$|International audienceThe {{differential}} atmospheric tip-tilt can {{be measured}} using a Polychromatic Laser Guide Star. A two photon excitation has been proposed. It consists in exciting the 4 D 5 / 2 level of mesospheric sodium atoms with two identical lasers operating at 589 nm and 569 nm. With two modeless lasers of 2 × 15 W at the mesosphere level, this scheme will produce a returned flux at 330 nm of about 4 × 10 4 photons/s/m 2. Thanks to our modeless laser, we propose a new method which consists in exciting directly the 4 P 3 / 2 sodium level with one photon excitation, using a single laser operating at 330 nm. This solution was previously rejected probably because of strong saturation problems using single longitudinal mode lasers. We show that 1 W modeless laser at 330 nm can produce the same returned flux at 330 nm. This solution will save at least 400 k€ of equipment. Moreover, our new method is very promising in terms of simplicity but {{also in terms of}} flux because the returned flux above will probably be not <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> a good Strehl ratio.

40|$|Abstract. Matching persons across {{non-overlapping}} cameras is {{a rather}} challenging task. Thus, successful methods often build on complex feature representations or sophisticated learners. A recent trend to tackle this problem is to use metric learning to find a suitable space for matching samples from different cameras. However, most of these approaches ignore the transition from one camera to the other. In this paper, we propose to learn a metric from pairs of samples from different cameras. In this way, even less sophisticated features describing color and texture information are <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> finally <b>getting</b> state-of-the-art classification results. Moreover, once the metric has been learned, only linear projections are necessary at search time, where a simple nearest neighbor classification is performed. The approach is demonstrated on three publicly available datasets of different complexity, {{where it can be}} seen that state-of-the-art results can be obtained at much lower computational costs. ...|$|R

In this work, we propose the first, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, -Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data exhibiting dependencies. The approach is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph of the data in sets of independent data, through the tool of fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on the chromatic number of the dependency graph is <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> it <b>get</b> new bounds <b>for</b> specific settings.

40|$|Despite outperforming {{the human}} in many tasks, {{deep neural network}} models are also criticized {{for the lack of}} {{transparency}} and interpretability in decision making. The opaqueness results in uncertainty and low confidence when deploying such a model in model sharing scenarios, when the model is developed by a third party. For a supervised machine learning model, sharing training process including training data provides an effective way to gain trust and to better understand model predictions. However, it is not always possible to share all training data due to privacy and policy constraints. In this paper, we propose a method to disclose a small set of training data that is just <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> users to <b>get</b> the insight of a complicated model. The method constructs a boundary tree using selected training data and the tree is able to approximate the complicated model with high fidelity. We show that traversing data points in the tree gives users significantly better understanding of the model and paves the way for trustworthy model sharing. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|For {{continuous}} fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMC), {{there is}} an extensive knowledge {{of the influence of}} coupon geometry on the failure mode and the determined resistance in bending tests. In contrast, there are few studies on this topic for short fiber reinforced CMC and no geometry standard for bending tests for such materials exists. In this work, the influence of different sample numbers, coupon geometry and test conditions on the calculated mean and variance of flexural strength has been investigated. Two different short fiber CMCs were examined under four point bending mode. It is shown that a number of five coupons is <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> reliable data. Furthermore it is shown that below a certain specimen cross-section a decrease of the determined strength was observed. The standard deviation and the distribution of rupture stress strongly depended on the specimen geometry size, the fiber length and the loading span width. The correlation of the fiber orientation in the loaded area, of the region of failure initiation and of the measured flexural strength were investigated by high resolution X-ray computer tomography and SEM in order to obtain further insight into the causes of strength scatter in these materials. The presented results will be proposed to a future standard for the bending test of short fiber reinforced CMC materials...|$|E

It is referable to the section Dromiacea on account of having the first pleopods in the female. After our close examination and the much consultation with Dr. I. Gordon and Dr. D. Guinot, the sole ovigerous female was proved to represent not only a new species but also a new genus. In the Dromiacea it bears some unusual features such as {{the absence of the}} vestiges of the uropods, the forwards position of the anterior margins of the third maxillipeds, the absence of the distinct linea dromiidica, the strong backwards extension of the abdomen bending at the fourth segment, and the flattened propodi and talon-like dactyli of the last two legs. Some of those features may be peculiar to the family Homolodromiidae, but the general formation of the carapace is more close to the family Dromiidae to which it is rather tentatively referred.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement in society that innovations, derived from {{improvements in the}} use of technology and science, have significantly improved our lives in the past 100 years (National Science Board, 2007). This qualitative research study explores the description of innovative behavior in engineers or ‘engineering innovativeness. ’ The goal of this exploratory research is to identify the major agreements and understandings, or lack thereof, about how engineers innovate in products, processes and concepts. A purposeful convenience sample of eight expert and award winning engineers and engineering entrepreneurship and innovation educators was used in the study. The research questions were: “What is an innovation?” and “What is the set of individual attributes (key skills, knowledge, attitudes, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors) that enable engineers to translate their creative ideas into practices (innovations) that benefit society?” The interview protocol consisted of open-ended questions for a semi-structured interview. Participants were asked to reflect on their own innovative experiences and those of other engineers with whom they were familiar and identify attributes associated with innovative behavior by engineers. Inductive analysis of the data was done through open coding, construction of a code book, consolidation of emerging themes though collaborative discussions and strength testing of quotes and assertions. All study participants identified an innovation as something new, useful and adopted by a community. The most important innovative behavior attributes of engineers suggested by study participants were: domain knowledge, opportunity recognition, teamwork skills, curiosity, risk taking, and persistence. Creativity as a unique attribute was seen as essential to jump start the innovation process but clearly not <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> an idea successfully introduced into the marketplace. Entrepreneurial behavior was also seen as a critical component of the innovation process supporting implementation of the new idea but not sufficient unto itself for creating a successful innovation. Innovative behavior was perceived by some participants as a process that can be taught or knowledge that can be acquired. Other participants perceived some aspects of engineering innovativeness as relatively fixed personality characteristics, meaning “some engineers have it and some don't. ” Next steps in this research are to pursue interviews with a larger sample of engineering innovators and investigate the innovative behavior of engineers by stages of the innovation process...|$|E
