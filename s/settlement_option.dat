40|$|This Article {{challenges}} {{the conventional wisdom}} that claimants in class action settlement funds and other settlement funds make independent and rational settlement decisions. Cognitive psychologists and behavioral economists have long examined the way people make judgments and choices. Such studies show that decisionmakers routinely change their minds based on their view of the status quo, the timing of the decision, and the presence of seemingly irrelevant choices. Because of these cognitive biases, people will buy things they do not want, save too little for retirement, and make risky choices about their health and well-being based on the timing, context, and framing of the decision. Applying findings from cognitive psychology, I argue that people will make the same kinds of irrational decisions about their <b>settlement</b> <b>options</b> in a large settlement fund. As a result, cognitive biases threaten to undermine many of the stated purposes of large settlement funds-to provide claimants with access, efficiency, and equity superior to what they could obtain in traditional litigation. Accordingly, 2 ̆ 2 fund designers 2 ̆ 2 -judges, lawmakers, and special masters-should adjust settlement procedures to account for cognitive bias.

40|$|Increased {{competition}} from {{banks and other}} financial institutions has forced life insurers to find new and innovative ways to obtain and retain capital. Retained asset accounts are a newer form of life insurance <b>settlement</b> <b>option</b> in which the insurer holds death proceeds in its general account until the beneficiaries are ready to withdrawal the funds. While beneficiaries are compensated with interest on the accounts, the funds {{are subject to the}} financial risk of the insurer and are only partially covered by state guaranty funds. Given the characteristics of the retained accounts, primary interest is the examination of whether the interest rate paid to the owners of retained asset accounts is related to the insurer’s level of risk. In order to better understand these issues, first, one must understand the characteristics associated with an insurer’s decision to obtain capital through this method as well as the level of use of retained asset accounts. In this context, the potential relation of interest paid to beneficiaries and firm risk is discussed. Results show that those insurers associated with greater financial risk compensate the owners of retained asset accounts through the payment of increased interest payment on the funds held in the account.

40|$|Animal {{dispersal}} {{is usually}} studied with capture-mark-reencounter data, which {{provide information on}} realized dispersal but rarely on underlying processes. In this context, the unreliable assumption of all habitat being available is usually made when describing and analysing dispersal patterns. However, actual <b>settlement</b> <b>options</b> may be constrained by the spatial distribution of appropriate patches, so an important task to understand movement patterns is to adequately describe dispersal when the dispersers' options are constrained by the sites {{that are available to}} them. Using a long-term monitored population of the migratory lesser kestrel, we show how randomization procedures can be used to describe dispersal strategies in such situations. This species breeds colonially in discrete patches, most individuals (83 %) disperse from their natal colony, and dispersers tend to move short distances (median= 7. 2 km). Observed patterns (natal dispersal rates and median dispersal distances of birds emigrating from their natal colony) were compared with those expected from two null models of random settlement of individuals: in any colony available in the whole population, or within the subpopulation (cluster of colonies) of origin. Our simulations indicate that philopatry to the natal colony was much higher than expected under both null expectations, and observed distances were much lower than expected in the whole population. When individuals were constrained to settle within their natal subpopulation in the simulations, dispersal distances were longer than expected in females, but were higher or lower in males depending on year. Dispersal was not only constrained by the spatial distribution of <b>settlement</b> <b>options,</b> but specific hypotheses arise that can be helpful to design and conduct further research. These results challenge previous interpretations of observed dispersal patterns, which may not reflect free decisions of individuals but environmental or social constraints. We suggest using simulation procedures as a routine to advance in the understanding of dispersal ecology and evolution. © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design of a model, methods and {{guidelines}} that may assist government agencies in South Africa to find a balance between the objective of biodiversity conservation and increased local economic development in cases of land restitution in protected areas. The data collection that was needed for this study took place from 2007 to 2009 and was limited to seven priority protected areas in Mpumalanga Province. The general model design was established via an extensive literature review and analysis of the legal background and formed the theoretical concept of this thesis. The general model design was used to devise the guidelines for co-management to be used by government agencies in South Africa for the possible implementation of the biodiversity conservation and local economic development mandates in cases of land restitution in protected areas, within their financial and institutional limitations. From the results, it is clear that a consolidated government position, agreed upon by all relevant government stakeholders, assists in keeping the land restitution process in protected areas within the legal framework. Through the analysis of the model design in the seven priority protected areas it was identified that additional information is needed to reach the preferred land claim <b>settlement</b> <b>option</b> per protected area such as the actual tourism record, a socio-economic assessment of the environment in which each protected area is embedded, and financial figures to make projections on current and future net profit calculations. Government should support all the land claim settlement options, as elaborated in the model design, which is not the case at the moment, and most alternative options, other than co-management, are currently still unclear and/or not feasible. This might have serious negative implications for the conservation agency, with the risk of compromising its mandate to manage areas of high biodiversity effectively. The methods that were developed to workshop the generic agreement frameworks with the land claimant representatives proved to assist in the land claimants making an informed choice within the legal framework and to tailor the land claim <b>settlement</b> <b>option</b> and agreements to their specific situation.

Consequently, the ability to assess predation risk when selecting a settlement site can be critical to survival. In this study, pairwise choice trials were used to determine whether larvae of three species of anemonefish (Amphiprion melanopus, A. percula and Premnas biaculeatus) are able to (1) assess the predation risk of potential anemone settlement sites through olfactory cues alone and (2) alter their settlement choices depending on the options available (host or non-host anemone). When predation risk was assessed with host and non-host anemone species independently, all species of anemonefish significantly chose the odor associated with the low-risk <b>settlement</b> <b>option</b> over the high-risk site. Most importantly, all species of anemonefish selected water with olfactory cues from their host anemone regardless of predation risk when paired against non-host anemone odor.

40|$|Final Report, Efficient and Equitable Solution of Indian Reserved Rights, USGS Grant # 14 - 08 - 0001 -G 1320, June 21, 1989. The {{water rights}} claims of many Indian {{reservations}} in the West {{are now under}} adjudication. Frequently, the parties to these adjudications acknowledge that their interests may be better served through negotiated settlements, but they lack comprehensive means for determining mutually acceptable solutions to the conflicts. The research conducted under the title of "Efficient and Equitable Solution of Indian Reserved Rights" (Project # 14 - 08 - 0001 -G 1320) sought to 1) develop a conceptual basis for determining Indian water rights; 2) develop an analytical procedure to provide the information needed to resolve water rights conflicts; and 3) apply this analytical procedure to a test case involving the Gila River Basin in Arizona. The methodological core of the research {{is a set of}} linked models, encompassing historical, hydrologic, economic, psychological, and institutional elements of the conflict. Hydrologic, institutional, and economic analyses of conjunctive management of surface and groundwater supplies were facilitated by the use of MODSIM, a network optimization model. Data from the model enabled the investigators to construct an impact matrix, defining the effect of each possible <b>settlement</b> <b>option</b> on the goals of the parties.

40|$|In this Article, {{we suggest}} that {{litigation}} can be analyzed as {{though it is a}} competitive research and development project. Developing this analogy, we present a two-stage real option model of the litigation process that involves sequential information revelation and bargaining over the surplus generated by early settlement. Litigants are risk-neutral and have no private information. The model generates results that, we believe, have analytic and normative significance for the economic analysis of litigation From an analytic perspective, we demonstrate that negative expected value (NEV) lawsuits are analogous to out of the money call options held by plaintiffs and that every NEV lawsuit is credible if the variance of the information revealed {{during the course of the}} litigation is sufficiently large. This finding helps explain the prevalence of a class of lawsuits that has proved puzzling to traditional, expected value-based modes of litigation analysis. The model also suggests that risk-neutral defendants can act as though they are risk-averse and that risk-neutral plaintiffs can act as though they are risk-seeking because increases in variance can increase a lawsuit 2 ̆ 7 s <b>settlement</b> <b>option</b> value just as it increases a call option 2 ̆ 7 s value without regard to the holder 2 ̆ 7 s degree of risk aversion. Models that presume defendants 2 ̆ 7 relative risk aversion may therefore rely on an unnecessary assumption. Our model also suggests that a lawsuit 2 ̆ 7 s option settlement value is not a monotonically increasing function of the variance of the information revealed during the litigation. In particular, at low levels of variance a lawsuit 2 ̆ 7 s option settlement value may equal its traditional expected value, but as variance increases its option settlement value can display a discontinuity after which its option settlement value becomes a monotonically increasing function of variance. NEV lawsuits can also display 2 ̆ 2 dead zones 2 ̆ 2 - regions of variance over which the claim is not credible even though it is credible over higher or lower levels of variance. Comparative statics analysis also quantifies the extent to which a lawsuit 2 ̆ 7 s settlement value increases as plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s litigation expenses occur later in the litigation process, as the ratio of defendant-to-plaintiff litigation expense increases and as plaintiff bargaining power increases. From a normative perspective, we offer an 2 ̆ 2 impossibility conjecture 2 ̆ 2 suggesting that the mere presence of an irreducible degree of uncertainty endemic to the litigation process can be sufficient to prevent private litigation incentives from equating to socially optimal incentives, even if one adopts all other assumptions necessary to equate private and social incentives. It follows that it may be impossible to articulate normative principles of law through substantive standards that ignore the uncertainty inherent in the litigation process and the procedural environment in which the litigation occurs...|$|E

Migration presented itself {{as an opportunity to}} minimize social risks associated with unemployment, unstable labour markets and a way to provide social protection to the families.

Hawala networks are also used by NGOs and humanitarian aid organizations operating in post-conflict regions, and by diaspora communities looking to provide vital services for family members in their country of origin. IFTS, however, can also be illegitimately used for smuggling, capital flight, or terrorist activities. Formal financial institutions can learn how to better access the remittance market and serve remote or poor communities by learning from the key operational characteristics that make IFTS so successful: speed and efficiency, accessibility and adaptability, affordability, anonymity, cultural sensitivity, and relational contracts. Understanding these operational characteristics can allow for innovative, Hawala-inspired inclusion techniques to be incorporated into the formal infrastructure. Mobile banking, adaptive financial procedures and services, broad integration, and a shift in the banking culture would not only allow for formal financial institutions {{to gain access to the}} lucrative remittance market, but would also improve access to financial services for the poor and underserved...|$|R
40|$|Fat-tailed" {{distributions}} of dispersal distances involve long movements {{that do not}} appear to follow the normal distribution characterizing most short dispersals. Theorists have offered 2 nonexclusive explanations for such distributions. They suggest that the fat tail is a product of a single perturbed dispersal function, or that there may be multiple movement modes that widen dispersal distributions, or kernels, when considered simultaneously. We evaluated dispersal distances in the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) using a 22 -year data set. Results illustrated that dispersal distances differed between juvenile and helper dispersers but not between sexes. Results further showed fat-tailed dispersal distributions in all social and sex classes. Then within juvenile females, we used radiotelemetry to document 2 fundamentally different dispersal strategies: Woodpeckers forayed from a natal area until breeding vacancies were located, and they made jumps to distant locations where birds continued to search for <b>settlement</b> <b>options.</b> Jumping was a behavior that added long-distance movements to the dispersal kernel and fattened the tail of the distribution. Our results are congruent with growing evidence that dispersal of animals typically does not represent a single process and that dispersers may switch between movement modes based on a complex relationship of internal state, landscape characteristics, motion capacity, and navigational ability. Rare and cryptic movement modes such as jumping may also account for the fat tail in the dispersal distance {{distributions of}} other species. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project has been to {{evaluate}} the methods currently used in the sewage treatment plant's sludge management. Method used is literature study. The project has described the different deposition methods used today. Excluded are the methods used to clean the water and stabilize the sewage sludge. The project has examined how waste sludge management is in Sweden, China, the Netherlands and the UK. The intention has been {{to explain how the}} use of the respective deposition method looks and why the participating countries have chosen different deposition methods. Keywords used are Sewage sludge, ReVAQ, Heavy metals, Comparison of countries, <b>Settlement</b> <b>options.</b> Sewage sludge {{is one of the major}} unutilized assets we have, it brings not only economic benefits but also profits from environmental perspective. Sewage sludge contains many useful substances like nitrogen and phosphorus. These substances promote growth of the plants. There are also risks associated with the supply of sewage sludge to agricultural land such as heavy metals supply. There are many different methods of handling sewage sludge. The methods are divided into thermal and non-thermal. The most used deposition method is supply to farmland, combustion, landfill and land cover. Methods used to a lesser degree include wet oxidation and pyrolysis. Sludge management is governed by both EU directives (for EU member states) and the country's own legislation. The conclusions that can be drawn from this project are that there are many different methods of sludge management. New technology is also constantly evolving, which can create new opportunities. Countries in the study have chosen different marketing methods depending on current legislation in the area as well as the country's infrastructure and economic climate...|$|R
