25|$|For <b>single-phase</b> <b>AC,</b> if the {{transformer}} is center-tapped, {{then two}} diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form a full-wave rectifier.

25|$|The first {{attempts}} to use standard-frequency <b>single-phase</b> <b>AC</b> {{were made in}} Hungary {{as far back as}} 1923, by the Hungarian Kálmán Kandó on the line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16kV at 50Hz. The locomotives carried a four-pole rotating phase converter feeding a single traction motor of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100V. The number of poles on the 2,500hp motor could be changed using slip rings to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A few decades after the Second World War, the 16kV was changed to the Russian and later French 25kV system.|$|E

Two scissor-shaped pantographs collect the current of 15 kV / 16.7 Hz from the catenary. Recently, many of these pick-ups have been refitted as modern single-arm pantographs.|$|R
