40|$|Aspirin {{has been}} one of the most widely used drugs in the world since its {{discovery}} more than a century ago. The German chemist, Felix Hoffman, was credited with its discovery in 1897, when he synthesised acetylsalicylic acid, which Hoffman called aspirin. While it was known for centuries that salicylate- containing plants could be useful in the treatment of febrile conditions, such as ague or malaria, it has only been in the last fifty years that the arteriovascular effects of the <b>salicylate</b> <b>derivative,</b> aspirin, have been studied. Forty thousand tons were consumed annually in the first decade of the twenty-first century.

In cul-tured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, HTB (300 M, a concentra-tion reached in clinical use) inhibited phenylephrine (PE) -in-duced protein synthesis ([3 H]leucine uptake), induction of the fetal-type gene atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and sarcomeric disorganization.

40|$|Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a {{condition}} that stimulates an intense inflammatory response. No ideal treatment exists. Triflusal is an antiplatelet <b>salicylate</b> <b>derivative</b> with anti-inflammatory effects. S-adenosylmethionine is a metabolic precursor for glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant. Dextromethorphan is a low-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor inhibitor. There is evidence that these agents modulate some of the pathways involved in I/R physiopathology. Intestinal I/R was induced in rats by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 60 [*]minutes, followed by 60 [*]minutes of reperfusion. Rats either received saline or the drugs studied. At {{the end of the}} procedure, serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), malonaldehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined and intestinal morphology analyzed. I/R resulted in tissue damage, serum TNF-alpha and MDA elevations, and depletion of TAC. All drugs showed tissue protection. Only triflusal reduced TNF-alpha levels. All drugs lowered MDA levels, but only triflusal and S-adenosylmethionine maintained the serum TAC...|$|E

It did not cross-react with other salicylates or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The antiserum has been used in immunoblotting to detect proteins covalently modified by DF in the plasma and livers of rats treated with the drug for 7 days.

The plasma clearance of total (bound + unbound) diflunisal was 10. 2 ml. min- 1 in the control subjects {{and it was not}} affected by cirrhosis (10. 9 ml. min- 1). The plasma protein binding of diflunisal was significantly reduced in cirrhosis; the percentage of unbound diflunisal in plasma was 0. 089 in the controls and 0. 147 in the patients with cirrhosis. Plasma clearance of unbound diflunisal was significantly impaired in cirrhosis: 11. 51. min- 1 in control subjects vs 7. 41. min- 1 in cirrhotics. In cirrhotic patients, the unbound partial clearances to the phenolic and acyl glucuronides were both significantly reduced, by approximately 38 %.

40|$|The plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7 NSK 2 {{produces}} three siderophores when iron is limited: the yellow-green fluorescent pyoverdin, the <b>salicylate</b> <b>derivative</b> pyochelin, and salicylic acid. This Pseudomonas strain {{was shown}} to be an efficient antagonist of Pythium-induced damping-off. The role of pyoverdin and pyochelin in the suppression of Pythium splendens was investigated by using various siderophore-deficient mutants derived from P. aeruginosa 7 NSK 2 in a bioassay with tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). To provide more insight {{into the role of}} pyochelin in antagonism, mutant KMPCH, deficient in the production of pyoverdin and pyochelin, was complemented for pyochelin production. The complementing clone was further characterized by subcloning and transposon mutagenesis and used to generate a pyochelin-negative, pyoverdin-positive mutant by marker exchange. All mutants were able to reduce Pythium-induced preemergence damping-off to some extent. Production of either pyoverdin or pyochelin proved to be necessary to achieve wild-type levels of protection against Pythium-induced postemergence damping-off. Mutant KMPCH inhibited P. splendens but was less active than the parental strain. This residual protection could be due to the production of salicylic acid. Since pyoverdin and pyochelin are both siderophores, siderophore-mediated iron competition could explain the observed antagonism and the apparent interchangeability of the two compounds. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that both siderophores act in an indirect way...|$|E

40|$|UDP-sugars are {{essential}} precursors for glycosylation reactions producing cell wall polysaccharides, sucrose, glycoproteins, glycolipids, etc. Primary mechanisms of UDP sugar formation involve {{the action of}} at least three distinct pyrophosphorylases using UTP and sugar- 1 -P as substrates. Here, substrate specificities of barley and Arabidopsis (two isozymes) UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases (UGPase), Arabidopsis UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (USPase) and Arabidopsis UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine pyrophosphorylase 2 (UAGPase 2) were investigated using a range of sugar- 1 -phosphates and nucleoside-triphosphates as substrates. Whereas all the enzymes preferentially used UTP as nucleotide donor, they differed in their specificity for sugar- 1 -P. UGPases had high activity with D-Glc- 1 -P, but could also react with Fru- 1 -P and Fru- 2 -P (Km values over 10 mM). Contrary to an earlier report, their activity with Gal- 1 -P was extremely low. USPase reacted with a range of sugar- 1 -phosphates, including D-Glc- 1 -P, D-Gal- 1 -P, D-GalA- 1 -P (K-m of 1. 3 mM), beta-L-Ara- 1 -P and alpha-D-Fuc- 1 -P (K-m of 3. 4 mM), but not beta-L-Fuc- 1 -P. In contrast, UAGPase 2 reacted only with D-GlcNAc- 1 -P, D-GalNAc- 1 -P (K-m of 1 mM) and, to some extent, D-Glc- 1 -P (Km of 3. 2 mM). Generally, different conformations/substituents at C 2, C 4, and C 5 of the pyranose ring of a sugar were crucial determinants of substrate specificity of a given pyrophosphorylase. Homology models of UDP-sugar binding to UGPase, USPase and UAGPase 2 revealed more common amino acids for UDP binding than for sugar binding, reflecting differences in substrate specificity of these proteins. UAGPase 2 was inhibited by a <b>salicylate</b> <b>derivative</b> that was earlier shown to affect UGPase and USPase activities, consistent with a common structural architecture of the three pyrophosphorylases.

40|$|Para-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is a {{well known}} anti mycobacterial agent and its mode action is {{believed}} to be linked to interference of the biosynthesis of the siderophore mycobactin. Certain bicyclic aromatics, in which one of the aromatic rings bears hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups ortho to one another have recently been found also to possess antimycobacterial activity (unpublished work) and this is thought to be due to similarities in their structures compared with salicylic acid, a constituent building block in mycobactin. We have therefore used the term bicyclic salicylates to describe such compounds. We propose that "bicyclic salicylates", which are hybrids of PAS and the bicyclic systems previously discovered, could be obtained from the reaction between PAS and other reagents and that these would possess greater antimycobacterial activity and less of the gastrointestinal side effects that are associated with PAS. For example, such compounds could be benzopyridines, benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles and related compounds, in which a nitrogen heterocyclic ring is fused to a benzo ring bearing a hydroxy and a carboxylic acid ortho to one another. In our investigations of such "bicyclic salicylates" we were able to synthesize ~/ quinoline derivatives by reacting PAS, or its methyl ester derivative, with selected c. s-unsanrateo carbonyl compounds following the Doebner von- Miller quinoline synthesis. We were also able to synthesize both kinetic and thermodynamic products of quinolone <b>salicylate</b> <b>derivatives</b> using a modified Conrad-Limpach synthesis, obtaining the 4 -quinolones and 2 -quinolones. Lastly "bicyclic salicylates" based on benzothiazoles were also synthesized from PAS methyl ester following a modified Jacobson synthesis. In all of our studies we observed that the orientation of the cyclisation reactions often favoured the position ortho to the phenolic group of the rr aminosalicylate. In the case of the benzothiazole preparations we often obtained brominated benzothiazoles (from bromination of the product) and so in these heavily substituted products we could not make a final confirmatory statement, in these cases, with respect to the orientation of cyclisation involving the aminosalicylate precursor. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Genes encoding the initial steps in the degradation of <b>salicylate</b> and substituted <b>derivatives</b> were now localized and sequenced. One of the gene clusters characterized (sal) showed a novel gene arrangement, with salA, encoding a salicylate 1 -hydroxylase, being clustered with salCD genes, encoding muconate cycloisomerase and catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase, respectively, and was expressed during growth on salicylate and chlorosalicylate. A second gene cluster (cat), exhibiting the typical catRBCA arrangement of genes of the catechol branch of the 3 -oxoadipate pathway in Pseudomonas strains, was expressed during growth on salicylate. Despite their high sequence similarities with isoenzymes encoded by the cat gene cluster, the catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase and muconate cycloisomerase encoded by the sal cluster showed unusual kinetic properties. Enzymes were adapted for turnover of 4 -chlorocatechol and 3 -chloromuconate; however, 4 -methylcatechol and 3 -methylmuconate were identified as the preferred substrates. Investigation of the substrate spectrum identified 4 - and 5 -methylsalicylate as growth substrates, which were effectively converted by enzymes of the sal cluster into 4 -methylmuconolactone, followed by isomerization to 3 -methylmuconolactone. The function of the sal gene cluster is therefore to channel both chlorosubstituted and methylsubstituted salicylates into a catechol ortho cleavage pathway, followed by dismantling of the formed substituted muconolactones through specific pathways...|$|R

In this thesis apply the methodology to the preparation of new organo-borate materials. Some background and motivation for this work is presented in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we describe some novel phases of organoborate phases including [(C 4 H 10 N 2) (B 6 O 10 H 2) ] with direct B-N connection. The flux approach also {{led to the formation}} of a number of organic salts of polyborate anions. In Chapter 3 metal and organic bis(salicylato) spiroborates have been synthesized with high yield, purity and crystallinity by the flux approach. Since <b>salicylate</b> and its <b>derivatives</b> are asymmetric chelates, the boron centers are chiral. Resolution of the [BS(Sal) 2] anion was effected by using quininium as chiral counter cation. In aqueous media the chiral B center was found to be labile, the rate of scrambling t 1 / 2 is about 40 mins. However. solutions of chirally resolved B(Sal) 2 ions have been found to be indefinitely stable in DMF solution at room temperature. In Chapter 4 hydrothermal boric acid ‘flux’ and solvothermal synthesis of tartratoborates affords simple monomer, cyclic oligomer or chain polymer arrangements. For L-tartrate all three types can be isolated through use of different crystallization conditions, such as solvent, temperature, reagent stoichiometry and the identity of the counter cations. For meso-tartrate two isomeric cyclic tetramers can be fored using K or Na counter ions, that appear to exhibit a templating effect. Nmr shows that the rings are stable in solution. Finally in Chapter 5 we looked at metal-organic framework (MOF) formation using calcium and group 13 elements. The study of calcium tartrate phases was due to the unintended preparation of these from boric acid flux reactions.
