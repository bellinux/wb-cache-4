5|$|This was {{a result}} of the attacks from Midway, {{as well as of the}} morning flight leader's {{recommendation}} of a <b>second</b> <b>strike.</b> Re-arming had been under way for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40, the delayed scout plane from Tone signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to describe its composition. Later evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00.|$|E
40|$|Estimation of an opponent's damage {{preference}} {{is illustrated by}} discussing the sensitivity of stability indices and strike parameters to it and inverting the results to study the sensitivity of estimates to uncertainties in strikes. Costs and stability indices do not generally have the monotonicity and sensitivity needed to support accurate estimation. First and <b>second</b> <b>strikes</b> do. <b>Second</b> <b>strikes</b> also have proportionality, although they are not unambiguously interpretable.

5|$|Yorktowns second strike—utilizing {{the same}} aircraft—returned to Tulagi and began their attack at 12:10 on the Japanese ships, {{many of which}} were now at full steam and {{attempting}} to put distance between themselves and Tulagi harbor. The <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> hit and sank the minesweepers #1 and #2 and severely damaged Tama Maru northeast of Savo Island. Another Japanese seaplane was shot down by a U.S. dive bomber during the <b>second</b> <b>strike.</b> After four F4F-3/3A Wildcat fighters from Yorktown joined the strike, the fighters shot down two more Japanese floatplanes over Florida Island. The four U.S. fighters then strafed Yūzuki, killing her captain and nine others of her crew, and causing moderate damage to the ship. Two or three other Japanese floatplanes were damaged in Tulagi harbor and their crews were killed.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in his will specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E
5|$|At 13:00, Kondo's Advanced {{force and}} Abe's Vanguard force {{warships}} together headed directly towards the last reported {{position of the}} U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a warship gunfire battle. The damaged carriers Zuihō and Shōkaku, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta {{in charge of the}} Zuikaku and Junyō aircraft forces. At 13:06, Junyō launched her <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> of seven torpedo planes and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive bombers, and five Zeros. At 15:35, Junyō launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four bombers and six Zeros.|$|E

40|$|At {{low force}} levels {{stability}} indices depend {{primarily on the}} number of vulnerable missiles and the number of weapons on them. The index reduces to a product of the number of vulnerable missiles and the differences between normalized <b>second</b> and first <b>strikes</b> by vulnerable weapons. As the number of weapons per vulnerable missile decreases, the index rapidly approaches stability. Further reductions in vulnerable and survivable missiles and weapons do not affect stability, although they do reduce first and <b>second</b> <b>strikes.</b> Modest weapon reconstitution degrades stability significantly...|$|R
5|$|Mike Summerbee {{opened the}} scoring on 13 minutes, but Newcastle soon equalised. Neil Young made it 2–1, but again Newcastle equalised. A <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> by Young was {{disallowed}} for offside, and at half-time {{the score was}} 2–2. Straight after half-time Young scored again, and Francis Lee scored a fourth on 63 minutes. A late Newcastle goal set up a nervy finish, but City held on to win 4–3 and secure the title. The win was compounded by a 2–1 victory by Sunderland over Manchester United, giving City the title. Liverpool won one of their remaining games but lost the other, missing their chance to leapfrog United into second by one point.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from {{representing}} Argentina at {{the tournament}} as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches. After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, {{who had won}} the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing. During the first match, he scored the opening goal and assisted another in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals. Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 3 June, she {{launched}} nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only {{six of the}} B5Ns {{and all of the}} Zeros were able {{to make it through the}} bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from Ryūjō from the <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E

25|$|MAD divided {{potential}} {{nuclear war}} into two stages: first strike and <b>second</b> <b>strike.</b> First strike meant the {{first use of}} nuclear weapons by one nuclear-equipped nation against another nuclear-equipped nation. If the attacking nation did not prevent the attacked nation from a nuclear response, the attacked nation would respond with a <b>second</b> <b>strike</b> against the attacking nation. In this situation, whether the U.S. first attacked the USSR or the USSR first attacked the U.S., the end result would be that both nations would be damaged to the point of utter social collapse.|$|E
