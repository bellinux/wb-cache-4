In 1993, six groups of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> were again seen off California (Mangels and Gerrodette 1994; Carretta et al. 1995), and mortality in drift gillnets increased (Julian and Beeson, 1998). Figure 1 summarizes the sighting history of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> off the U. S. west coast. Although the full geographic range of the California/Oregon/Washington population is not known, it may be continuous with animals found off Baja California, and its individuals are morphologically distinct from shortfinned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> found farther south in the eastern tropical Pacific (Polisini 1981). Separate southern and northern forms of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> have also been documented for the western North Pacific (Kasuya et al. 1988; Wada 1988; Miyazaki and Amano 1994). For the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) stock assessment reports, shortfinned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> within the Pacific U. S.

5|$|The <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> {{has also}} been hunted for many centuries, {{particularly}} by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku {{in the north and}} Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s. This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala macrorhynchus) strand or beach along Florida?s coasts {{regularly}} (six {{between the}} period of 2009 and 2015) and typically in mass numbers. Individual strandings can be caused by, or linked to, changes in environmental conditions, pathogens, stressors, as well as anthropogenic reasons, among others. Historically, it is not understood why an entire pod of these animals {{would be forced to}} strand or beach themselves (i. e. mass-strandings), especially when considering that many members of the pod do not exhibit signs of illness or injury. Why do the healthy pod members also strand? Can the healthy animals be isolated and saved? Stranding data for <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> revealed that length and weight have a direct correlation to the medical condition of the animal at the time of stranding and such information could therefore possibly be utilized to increase survivability among the stranded. Length and weight of 24 <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> were used to compute Body Mass Index (BMI) and results show five young whales and multiple females fell below the plotted regression line (r^ 2 = 0. 8699). In order to decipher this, a case is made herein for utilizing BMI as a health indicator to pinpoint individuals that may be deemed suitable candidates for rehabilitation and/or immediately releasable and disassociated from the sick. BMI calculations support the theory of isolating stranded individuals according to varying health status. A BMI range of 39. 0 to 50. 0 for adult males and 41. 0 to 55. 0 for adult female <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> is being suggested. The present study also investigated natural events along both Florida coasts to connect plausible situations in which abrupt changes in oceanographic activity lead to disorientation of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and subsequently sends into motion a stranding scenario. A review of oceanic data and literature within the targeted geographic area supports the idea that sudden changes in sea-surface currents can affect, either directly or indirectly, the behavior of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and increase the probability of a stranding occurrence, whether individually, or in mass numbers. Cyclonic eddies and areas of coastal upwelling and downwelling can be attributed to causing or leading to the catalyst that triggers a mass-stranding of a particularly social species, such as <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> can be {{confused}} with their relatives the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> but there are various differences. As their names indicate, their flippers are shorter {{than those of the}} long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> with a gentler curve on the edge. They have fewer teeth than the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale,</b> with 14 to 18 on each jaw. <b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are black or dark grey with a grey or white cape. They have grey or almost white patches on their bellies and throats and a grey or white stripe which goes diagonally upwards from behind each eye.|$|R
500|$|Long-finned and <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are so similar, it is {{difficult}} to tell the two species apart. They were traditionally differentiated by the length of the pectoral flippers relative to total body length and the number of teeth. The long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> was thought to have 9–12 teeth in each row and flippers one-fifth of total body length, compared to the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> with its 7–9 teeth in each row and flippers one-sixth of total body length. [...] Studies of whales in the Atlantic showed much overlap in these characteristics between the species, making them clines instead of distinctive features. Thus, biologists have since used skull differences to distinguish the two species. The skull of the <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whale</b> has a shorter and broader rostum with a premaxilla that covers more of the maxilla. By contrast, the long-finned <b>pilot</b> <b>whale's</b> skull has a more elongated rostum and a more exposed maxilla.|$|R

40|$|<b>Short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> (Globicephala macrorhynchus) {{generally}} forage on cephalopods in the mesopelagic zone, sometimes diving to over 1000 m {{in depth}} {{in pursuit of}} prey. However, <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and several other species of odontocetes have learned to target longline fishing vessels to depredate (prey upon) hooked fish. These odontocetes may gain energetic benefits due to the high calorie prey and relatively little effort involved in depredation. Each year, hundreds of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> become hooked due to depredation attempts {{and even if they}} break free they can become injured by trailing gear. In order to understand and reduce these interactions, basic questions still need to be answered, including which segments of the population are preying upon hooked fish? Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool used to study trophic interactions and can potentially identify <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> that are depredating on tuna. This requires stable isotope values of the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales,</b> tuna, and cephalopod prey of both the <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> and tuna to enable estimates of trophic relationships. Stable isotope values of cephalopods are lacking in the western North Atlantic. The primary cephalopod prey of <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> are not caught in commercial fisheries, and offshore sampling is logistically and financially difficult. Considering those challenges, this study aims to use SCA of several tuna species to determine if tuna, and which species in particular, can be used as biological samplers to obtain the same deep-water cephalopod taxa that <b>short-finned</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>whales</b> prey upon...|$|R
