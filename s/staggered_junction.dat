Effective oxide thickness (EOT) scaling (using Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 bilayer gate stack) coupled with pulsed I-V measurements (suppressing Dit response) enable demonstration of steeper switching TFET. Introduction: Mixed arsenide-antimonide based lattice-matched heterojunction provides {{a wide range of}} compositionally tunable effective tunneling barrier height (Ebeff), from 0. 5 eV to 0 eV [4, 7].

40|$|Across {{the globe}} {{population}} structures are aging and how older {{men and women}} interact with the transport system is increasingly important in maintaining a good {{quality of life and}} inclusion in society. The paper reviews three issues: the nature of older people’s interaction with the transport system by gender; older people’s attitude to travel; and the involvement of older people as road traffic casualties. Patterns of travel in the UK show that older people are heavily dependent on car use, but in the form of more frequent but shorter journeys than younger people. This is especially so for women over 70 years old who, as passengers, are very reliant on males to drive them. Attitudes suggest that there are few obstacles to public transport use, and most agree that bus travel is good, but convenience means many prefer cars. Involvement of older men and women in serious road traffic accidents show that they have lower killed and seriously injured (KSI) rates than 17 - 24 year old drivers. However, those aged over 70 years exhibit a trend to increasing KSI rates. Analysis of casualty rates of drivers by type of junction, manoeuvre and environmental conditions found that some gender-age groups are overrepresented in certain accident types, including over twice higher serious accidents rates for men, but over representation of older women when driving in poor conditions and turning right and negotiating roundabouts, crossroads and T, Y and <b>staggered</b> <b>junctions.</b> Improvement in engineering design and driver training are suggested together with the need for a greater understanding of the transportation system needs of old and vey old people...|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} the B1436 can be seen clearly on Faden’s {{large-scale}} map (at one inch to the mile) of the county of Norfolk of 1779, which shows that the most part of this road’s route has changed very little over the years, even after the Parliamentary Enclosure of the early 19th century.

40|$|Tunnel FETs are a {{promising}} alternate to MOSFETs for {{low power design}} due {{to the ability to}} scale threshold voltage and hence supply voltage, without increase in OFF currents.

40|$|By {{commission}} of the Swedish Road Administration, VTI has {{carried out a}} study of the literature in order to bring up to date the knowledge concerning the design of road junctions from the standpoint of traffic safety. Mainly junctions of less advanced design and roundabouts have been studied. The measure that has predominated in recent years is to convert junctions into roundabouts. Many studies point out that this is a cost effective measure which reduces both accident risk, injury risk and accident cost. For pedestrians, roundabouts appear to be as safe as other types of junctions, while for cyclists the safety may be either as good as, or worse. It is also shown that reduction of speed has a positive effect on both crash and injury risk. As regards turning lanes, several of the studies confirm earlier results that a left-turn lane is a measure that enhances traffic safety in junctions. New results also points at that even right-turn lanes can reduce both the total number of accidents and the number of injury accidents. Several studies indicate that the angle between the primary and secondary road should be as near 90 ° as possible, the data in this respect are however contradictory. It is further confirmed that two <b>staggered</b> three-way <b>junctions</b> are preferable to one four-way junction...|$|R
50|$|The R555 is a Regional Route in South Africa. Its western {{terminus}} is the unsigned Welgedacht Road {{north of}} Springs, Gauteng.

40|$|Small {{vascular}} units {{consisting of}} an arteriole, its capillaries, and the emerging venule (ACV units) {{were identified in}} the rat omentum and mesentery. They were fixed in situ and processed for electron microscopy either as whole units or as dissected segments. Systematic examination of the latter (in thin sections, {{as well as in}} freeze- cleaved preparations) showed that the intercellular junctions of the vascular endothelium vary characteristically from one segment to another in the microvasculature. In arterioles, the endothelium has continuous and elaborate tight junctions with interpolated large gap junctions. The capillary endothelium is provided with tight junctions formed by either branching or <b>staggered</b> strands; gap <b>junctions</b> are absent at this level. The pericytic venules exhibit loosely organized endothelial junctions with discontinuous low-profile ridges and grooves, usually devoid of particles. No gap junctions were found in these vessels. The endothelium of muscular venules has the same type of junctions (discontinuous ridges and grooves of low profile); in addition, it displays isolated gap junctions of smaller size and lower frequency than in arterioles. The term communicating junction (macula communicans) is proposed as a substitute for gap junctions, since the latter is inappropriate, in general, and confusing in the special case of the vascular endothelium...|$|R
50|$|At the {{roundabout}} the A1065 from Swaffham joins {{from the}} right. Straight across {{is the old}} route of the road called Wells Road which takes you {{into the center of}} Fakenham. The A148 bares left and now by-passes the town swinging around to the north passing the B1105 to Wells-next-the-Sea on the left. Now at 23.5 mi the road comes to another roundabout. The road to the right is A1067 from Norwich which terminates at the island. Straight over the island is the continuing A148.The next stretch of road sees the first speed camera at 24.5 mi from the King's Lynn start point. According to the Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership, the siting of this camera has resulted in only 1% of drivers breaking the speed limit along this section of the road, although before and after accident figures are not available. The Junction right to Kettlestone just past this site has always been a notorious accident Black Spot, as has the <b>staggered</b> cross road <b>Junction</b> at Little Snoring just beyond. At 25.5 mi the road passes through part of Little Snoring and through a cross road junction with Snoring Road. On the right just past the junction is the Green Man Public House. For the next 2 mi the road dips and rise through scenic woodland {{on either side of the}} road crossing the River Stiffkey at Brookhill plantation. On the right at Thursford is another filling station and a restaurant called the Old Forge. Dating from the 14th century the old forge was once a coaching station and many years ago was a resting place for pilgrims making their way to Walsingham Abbey. Today it is a popular seafood restaurant. Now at 27.6 mi since the start, the road emerges from the woodland and reaches a junction where the B1354 sweeps away to the right towards Melton Constable. The A148 swings northeast up an incline over a crossroads and past the Crawfish public house on the left which serves Thai food. The route now inclines and straightens out passing through more woodland before entering an area of open countryside. This long straight takes you to another filling station on the left. Bale Filling station marks 29.3 mi from the start.500m from the garage is the second and last speed camera on the A148. Once again the placing of this camera has been a deterrent to speeding with only 2% of drivers passing this point breaking the speed limit, although again it is not clear whether this has resulted in a reduction of accidents. From the camera's location the road takes a long sweeping bend toward the north east and once again the road is characterised by long straight section across open countryside. At 31.3 mi the road to the left at the crossroads is the B1156 to the village of Langham, the right hand lane leads to the village of Sharrington. 1 mi further on from the crossroads the road narrows in width and enters a section that is undulating and includes some very sharp blind bends. Drivers should be mindful of the fact that this road is used considerably by HGVs and this section should be driven with great care. At 33.3 mi the road passes through the village of Letheringsett. On the right in the centre of the village is the Kings Head Public House which is a fine example of a Georgian Building. Also on this junction is one of two Watermills in the village. The road crosses the River Glaven next to this redundant mill and 100 m further on passes a Brown Tourist sign locating the second Watermill on the right. Letheringsett Watermill is the last remaining watermill in Norfolk to produce flour. From Letheringsett the road inclines towards the Town of Holt reaching the western end of the town center at 34.4 mi. In the past the A148 passed through the center of this Georgian town but today it by-passes the center. At the next roundabout the road turns left on to the bypass. The road to the right is the B1110 to Melton Constable, the road straight over the island is the B1149 to Norwich. The by-pass was built on the old track bed of the Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway. At 35.8 mi the road from the left marks the point were the by-pass rejoins the old route of the A148. Just before this junction is Holt Station on the preserved part of the afore mentioned railway. It is the North Norfolk Railway which runs from Holt via Weybourne to Sheringham. The road now passes through High Kelling and out into the open countryside. Glimpse of the sea can now be seen on the left as the road heads towards the village of Bodham at 37.7 mi.|$|R
