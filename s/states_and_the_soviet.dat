5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes.

5|$|By 1972 the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage.

A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make {{the solution of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E
5|$|The Korean Peninsula {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{since the end of}} World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E

50|$|Having {{lost the}} race to <b>the</b> Moon, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> shifted their {{attention}} to orbital space stations, launching the first (Salyut 1) in 1971. The U.S. responded with the Skylab orbital workstation, in use from 1973 through 1974. With détente, a time of relatively improved Cold War relations between <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> <b>the</b> two superpowers developed a cooperative space mission: the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. This 1975 joint mission was the last manned space flight for the U.S. until the Space Shuttle flights of 1981 and {{has been described as}} the symbolic end of the Space Race. The Space Race sparked unprecedented increases in spending on education and pure research, which accelerated scientific advancements and led to beneficial spin-off technologies.|$|R
5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} {{of a civil}} war between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was supported by external powers, with each of the regimes trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the armistice (ceasefire agreement) was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E
5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs {{formed the basis of}} the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
50|$|By 1919, the White armies were {{in retreat}} <b>and</b> by <b>the</b> start of 1920 they were {{defeated}} {{on all three}} fronts. Many non-Russian peoples had used the disarray to push for national independence. After the German Ober Ost garrisons were withdrawn from the Eastern Front following <b>the</b> Armistice, both <b>Soviet</b> Russian armies and Polish ones moved in to fill the vacuum. Both the newly independent Polish <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government sought territorial expansion in the region.A series of peace treaties were concluded, with <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> recognizing <b>the</b> independence of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland.|$|R

50|$|After the October Revolution of 1917 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{disintegration}} of Russian Empire, {{the lands of}} its Kars Oblast were controlled {{for a short while}} by First Republic of Armenia and, in its northeastern part, by the Democratic Republic of Georgia. In any event Turkish forces soon invaded the area, forming an unrecognized puppet government, before the lands were taken back by the First Republic of Armenia. Incorporation of most of the lands of the former Kars Oblast into Turkey was confirmed by the Treaty of Kars (1921), signed by <b>the</b> unrecognized Turkish <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E
5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer.

At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E

Rorschach and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt admits to being responsible for Blake's murder, Manhattan's exile, Rorschach's framing, and his own assassination attempt, which he staged to divert suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors infused with energy from Manhattan. Rorschach and Dreiberg attempt to stop him, but Veidt subdues them both and reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: the reactors have been detonated, and the energy signatures are recognized as Manhattan's.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev told Mikoyan of {{his idea}} of {{shipping}} Soviet missiles to Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E

Four weeks after Operation Hurricane, the United States successfully demonstrated a hydrogen bomb.

All the while Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. As successful as it was, Operation Hurricane fell short on both counts.|$|E
