The common problem of {{supporting}} the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and a hydraulic pump in the Bricklin SV-1, although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DMC-12 features heavy doors supported by cryogenically preset torsion bars and gas-charged struts. These torsion bars were developed by Grumman Aerospace (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, PA) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.

In fact, the opposite is true: the DMC-12 requires far less clearance than side-hinge doors, and this can be physically demonstrated. This misconception of <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> may stem from a misunderstood location of the hinge point of the doors by persons unfamiliar with DMC-12s. These doors, when opening, only require [...] clearance outside {{the line of the}} car, making opening and closing the doors in crowded spaces relatively easy. Much like the doors fitted to the Lamborghini Countach, the DMC-12 doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

25|$|Now that {{passenger}} cars were lighter, {{they were able}} to carry heavier loads, but the size of the average passenger load that rode in them didn't increase to match the cars' new capacities. The average passenger car couldn't get any wider or longer due to <b>side</b> <b>clearances</b> along the railroad lines, but they generally could get taller because they were still shorter than many freight cars and locomotives. As a result, the railroads soon began building and buying dome and bilevel cars to carry more passengers.|$|R

They are multipurpose; they can provide a margin of <b>side</b> <b>clearance,</b> a refuge for incapacitated vehicles, an emergency lane, and parking space. They also serve a design purpose, and that is to prevent water from percolating into the soil near the main pavement's edge. Shoulder pavement is designed to a lower standard than the pavement in the traveled way and won't hold up as well to traffic, so driving on the shoulder is generally prohibited.|$|E
25|$|This {{construction}} permits free {{expansion and}} contraction of each plate individually under the varying influence {{of heat and}} centrifugal force and possesses {{a number of other}} advantages which are of considerable practical importance. A larger active plate area and consequently more power is obtained for a given width, improving efficiency. Warping is virtually eliminated and smaller <b>side</b> <b>clearances</b> may be used, which results in diminished leakage and friction losses. The rotor is better adapted for dynamic balancing and through rubbing friction resists disturbing influences thereby ensuring quieter running. For this reason and also because the discs are not rigidly joined it is protected against damage which might otherwise be caused by vibration or excessive speed.|$|R

50|$|The {{underpass}} {{is built}} within {{part of the}} former Kingsway tramway subway, which was 20 ft (6.6 m) wide and allowed bi-directional flow because of the fixed rails and relatively narrow width of the trams. The new underpass was built by John Mowlem & Co and opened on 21 January 1964. It is only 17 ft (6.25 m) wide, and consequently normally one-way northbound because of the <b>side</b> <b>clearances</b> required. The headroom is only 12 ft 6 in (3.75 m) due to the tunnel having to pass beneath the bridge abutment by a 1:12 gradient. An electronic 'eye' alerts drivers of tall vehicles and diverts them to an 'escape route' {{to the left of}} the entrance. However, high vehicles do still try to go through and so get stuck occasionally.|$|R
50|$|This wheel {{arrangement}} allows {{entry and}} exit at four points around the vehicle's perimeter. The CityCar {{was designed for}} front entry, which is feasible {{because there is no}} engine in the way. Baggage and emergency entry and exit are at the rear, and there is no side entry and exit. This configuration allows nose-in parking to the curb, and passenger embarkation from the sidewalk rather than from the road, which allows the elimination of the need for <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> between parked vehicles. It also simplifies the vehicle, which does not need to accommodate door openings.|$|E

50|$|As in {{a regular}} road vehicle, the tractor unit is steered through the front wheels by a {{steering}} wheel operated by a human driver, and powered by its rear single or double axle. The following carriages are then steered through the drawbar couplings between the carriages. Simple trains with few carriages or short in overall length may feature single- or double-axle carriages with just front-axle steering only. Larger or longer trains feature four-wheel steering by way of mechanical linkages. Four-wheel steering ensures that longer trains need less <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> while turning, as the carriages are able to maintain the same path, describing a constant radius of arc. This adds to the impression of the vehicle being on rails. The drawbar connections of more complex trains may feature a shock absorber {{to mitigate the effect}} of acceleration or braking.|$|E
50|$|When {{the tunnel}} was finally {{completed}} in September 1862, locomotives and {{freight and passenger}} cars were much smaller {{than they would be}} some forty years later. In engineering the tunnel, it was not anticipated that the tunnel bore, which would initially allow two tracks to pass through it, would restrict the size of the trains in later years. Indeed, to address this issue by 1900 gauntlet track was required, which is an arrangement that permits two tracks that closely overlap to pass through the tunnel together. The advantage of such an arrangement is that it maximized the overhead and <b>side</b> <b>clearances</b> in the roundish tunnel bore. Its chief disadvantage, however, was that this created what was in effect a single-track railroad through the tunnel—a bottleneck—which with numerous trains in both directions inevitably would lead to delays.|$|R

40|$|Using {{scenario}} driven research, a Driver AdvocateTM (DA) [1] {{system has}} been designed to advise the driver about potentially unsafe situations based on information from environmental sensors [2]. DA is an intelligent dynamic system that monitors, senses, prioritizes, personalizes, and sends alerts to the driver appropriate to the moment. This has the potential to sharply decrease driver distraction and inattention. To support the realization of DA, a DA Tool (DAT) has been developed to coordinate with a KQ (previously Hyperion) virtual driving simulator and allow the merging of the simulated driving performance, the enviormental sensors, and the intelligent use of audio, visual, and tactile feedback to alert the driver to potential danger and unsafe driving behavior. DAT monitors the traffic, lane following, forward and <b>side</b> <b>clearances,</b> vehicle condition, cockpit distractions, Infotainment use, and the driver affective behavior. The DAT is designed to be highly configurable, flexible, and user friendly to facilitate creative freedom in designing usability and human factors experiments and rapid prototyping...|$|R
50|$|Bollard pull is a {{conventional}} {{measure of the}} pulling (or towing) power of a watercraft. It {{is defined as the}} force (in tons or kiloNewtons (kN)) exerted by a vessel under full power, on a shore-mounted bollard through a tow-line, commonly measured in a practical test (but sometimes simulated) under test conditions that include calm water, no tide, level trim, and sufficient depth and <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> for a free propeller stream. Like the horsepower or mileage rating of a car, it is a convenient but idealized number that must be adjusted for operating conditions that differ from the test. The bollard pull of a vessel may be reported as two numbers, the static or maximum bollard pull - the highest force measured - and the steady or continuous bollard pull, the average of measurements over an interval of, for example, 10 minutes. An equivalent measurement on land is known as drawbar pull, or tractive force, which is used to measure the total horizontal force generated by a locomotive, a piece of heavy machinery such as a tractor, or a truck, (specifically a ballast tractor), which is utilized to move a load.|$|E
5000|$|This table {{demonstrates}} why alleyways, parking lots, parks, {{and residential}} areas frequently set 5-15 mph speed limits when the <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> {{from the road}} is less than 15 feet. An urban or residential street which permits a maximum speed limit of 25 mph under its very best conditions (roadsides cleared of visual obstructions past a 20-foot maintained right of way), may in practice be unsafe to drive at more than 10 mph within sections with utilized curbside parking. This table also suggests that the safe speed could be greater than a statutory 25 mph posted speed, where roadside clearance is sufficient such that no [...] "foreseeable" [...] object could emerge from the proximate edge of roadside visibility, transect the cleared area, and intercept the lane before the driver could come to a halt. However, wary road design engineers may have differing views of foreseeable intercept speeds than that reflected by the 85th percentile speed chosen by the public. This can have unfortunate consequences where a mass commuting public is unfamiliar with or does not appreciate specific local hazards. Narrow lane widths are purposely used for traffic calming, because careful drivers universally choose their speed depending on the roadway width. Standard horizontal clearances are commonly set by AASHTO guidelines or a jurisdiction's department of transportation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{a serial}} of dry milling {{experiments}} of 6061 aluminium alloy using single edge rhombus micro end mills were performed. The {{purpose is to}} examine the influences of various control factors on tool wear. Control factors under investigation include coating layer, <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> angle, feed rate, and spindle speed. We applied Taguchi method to design the experiment in order to derive an optimum combination of cutting parameters quickly. During the milling test, we fixed depth of cut at 0. 2 mm and width of cut at 0. 50 mm to investigate the correlation among <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> angle, feed rate, spindle speed and coating layer. Upon completion of each milling test, the cutting-edge wear and flank wear were measured in offline by the aforementioned tool microscope. The experimental results show that among the four control factors, <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> {{turns out to be the}} most important one. By using TiCN-coating and setting <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> angle at 10 degree, spindle speed at 6000 rpm, and feed rate at 0. 0125 mm/rev, the micro end mills generate least wear and thus have longer tool life...|$|E

40|$|Hemodialyzer mass transfer-area {{coefficients}} for urea increase at high dialysate flow rates. The dialyzer mass transfer-area coefficient (KoA) for urea {{is an important}} determinant of urea removal during hemodialysis and {{is considered to be}} constant for a given dialyzer. We determined urea clearance for 22 different models of commercial hollow fiber dialyzers (N = ~ 5 /model, total N = 107) in vitro at 37 °C for three countercurrent blood (Qb) and dialysate (Qd) flow rate combinations. A standard bicarbonate dialysis solution was used in both the blood and dialysate flow pathways, and clearances were calculated from urea concentrations in the input and output flows on both the blood and dialysate sides. Urea KoA values, calculated from the mean of the blood and dialysate <b>side</b> <b>clearances,</b> varied between 520 and 1230 ml/min depending on the dialyzer model, but the effect of blood and dialysate flow rate on urea KoA was similar for each. Urea KoA did not change (690 ± 160 vs. 680 ± 140 ml/min, P = NS) when Qb increased from 306 ± 7 to 459 ± 10 ml/min at a nominal Qd of 500 ml/min. When Qd increased from 504 ± 6 to 819 ± 8 ml/min at a nominal Qb of 450 ml/min, however, urea KoA increased (P < 0. 001) by 14 ± 7 % (range 3 to 33 %, depending on the dialyzer model) to 780 ± 150 ml/min. These data demonstrate that increasing nominal Qd from 500 to 800 ml/min alters the mass transfer characteristics of hollow fiber hemodialyzers and results in a larger increase in urea clearance than predicted assuming a constant KoA...|$|R

The model is a cantilever plate which experiences flutter when the flow velocity exceeds a certain threshold. The plate spans the entire wind-tunnel width but clearance inevitably exists between the plate edges and the wind-tunnel side-walls. Such clearance causes three-dimensional flow around the plate. In this work, we quantify the 3 D effect by varying the clearance. A specially-designed partition is used to divide the whole working section into an adjustable one by simultaneously adjusting the upper and lower partitioned wall vertically. The <b>side</b> <b>clearance</b> varies from 0. 1 to 5. 0 mm with an undisturbed clamp-plate system. The result demonstrates that the critical velocity decreases significantly with the decrease of the clearance in this interesting range of the clearance, a phenomenon which has not been investigated systematically in previous literature.
