40|$|The {{scarfing}} processing {{experiment was}} carried out for a steel slab moving at a constant speed with the <b>scarfing</b> <b>torch</b> fixed. The temperature histories inside the slab were recorded by two sets of thermocouples in different depths. A two-step computational model of heat transfer in scarfing processing has been developed in FLUENT. The model features in detail heat conduction from both the hot slag coating and the scarfing reaction to the steel slab surface, and it solves for steady state heat advection in the Step- 1 model followed by the Step- 2 model of transient heat transfer calculation. The combination of these two steps is able to give the complete prediction of a temperature history of 122. 2 sec. The temperature predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The high temperature region (1100 oC ~ 1500 oC) {{is found to be}} mainly located in a depth of 0. 5 mm near the slab surface. The fraction of heat conducted from the hot slag coating into the slab is 5. 4 % while that from the scarfing reaction is 10. 3 %. The simulations clearly explain the measurements and suggest practical implications. Section II. Background Scarfing processing has been used widely to remove surface defects from steel and other semi-finished as-cast products for over 70 years. The first automated scarfing machine used in production was built and installed in 1935. Steel slabs produced from continuous casting often exhibit surface defects, including inclusions, pits and cracks, such as shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive parts or other high-quality-products, these surface defects should be avoided during the casting process or removed during post-processing using the scarfing technique...|$|E
