40|$|AbstractIn Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, {{the lower}} <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> made of SS 316 LN in control plug has cut opening in three {{locations}} {{for the purpose}} of easiness of assembling the sampling tubes through the lower <b>stay</b> <b>plate.</b> These openings are then covered with appropriate cover plates bolted with the <b>stay</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> along with cover plate will be seeing thermal transients during reactor scrams. The thermal transient will cause the membrane stress due to global temperature increase in cover plate and bending stress due to temperature gradient across the thickness. This paper aims the creep and fatigue damages estimation of the <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and covers plate. The material of <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and cover plate is SS 316 LN. The <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and cover plate is analysed using CAST 3 M FE software developed by CAE France. A small square segment including a bolt and portion of junction between <b>stay</b> <b>plate</b> and cover plate is modeled with 8 noded, CUB 8 elements. The fatigue damage for 851 number of thermal transient has been calculated. The creep damage due to the thermal stress has been evaluated. The interaction of creep-fatigue damage has also been evaluated as per RCC-MR code rule and is found within the limit...|$|E

6000|$|The Mukhbir, {{like the}} Palinurus, promised {{a certain amount}} of excitement. Her boiler, I have said, was honeycombed; it was easy to thrust one's fist through it. Mr. David Duguid, the engineer, who on one {{occasion}} worked thirty-six hours at a stretch, had applied for sixty new tubes, and he wanted one hundred and fifty: we began with two hundred and forty; we lost, when in the Gulf, from three to nine per diem, a total of seventy five; and the work of the engine-room and the ship's carpenters consisted in plugging fractures with <b>stays,</b> <b>plates,</b> and wedges. Presently the steam-gauge (manomètre) gave way, making it impossible to register pressure; the combustion chamber showed a rent of eighteen inches long by one wide, the result of too rapid cooling; and, lastly, the donkey-engine struck work. Under these happy circumstances bursting was not to be expected; breaking down was, a regular collapse which would have left us like a log upon the stormy waves. A new boiler might have cost, perhaps, £900, and the want of one daily endangered a good ship which could not be replaced for £9000. I therefore determined upon a [...] "Safer Khoriyyah," [...] that is, steaming by day and anchoring at night in some snug bay. It was also agreed, nem. con., to tow the Sambúk El-Musahhil, in order that, should accidents happen, it might in turn act tug to the steamer; or even, at a pinch, serve us as a lifeboat.|$|R

Plates serve to keep magma in the mantle. Incipient plate boundaries and LIPs form where the lithosphere is extending, probably assisted by magma fracture. New rifts often experience a burst of magmatism, suggesting a fertile shallow mantle. Locations of rifts are controlled by lithospheric conditions, and the volumes of magmas by mantle fertility, ponding, and focusing. Recycled materials melt because of low melting temperatures and the large heat bath provided by the mantle itself. (keywords; LIPs, plumes, hotspots, lithosphere, eclogite...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a dimer bouncing on a vertically oscillated plate. The dimer, composed of two spheres rigidly connected by a light rod, exhibits several modes depending on initial and driving conditions. The first excited mode has a novel horizontal drift in which {{one end of the}} dimer <b>stays</b> on the <b>plate</b> during most of the cycle, while the other end bounces in phase with the plate. The speed and direction of the drift depend on the aspect ratio of the dimer. We employ event-driven simulations based on a detailed treatment of frictional interactions between the dimer and the plate in order to elucidate the nature of the transport mechanism in the drift mode.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} on the results obtained during the scale model landing gear test in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. Noise tests were conducted on different 4 -wheel landing gear configurations with (i) deceleration plates and (ii) splitter plates. The results presented in this report indicate that deceleration plates when attached between the rear wheels downstream of the axle tend to reduce the farfield radiated landing gear noise by up to 4 dB. In {{the course of this}} test best results were obtained by means of an inner wheel deceleration plate in combination with a short lower leg deceleration plate. The installation of an upper leg deceleration plate was not effective in terms of noise reduction. For splitter plates when applied to several gear components different results were obtained. While the wheel splitter plates tend to increase noise levels nearly no effect was measured for splitter plates located at the main strut and the side stay. A slight noise reduction of about 1 dB was documented for both the torque link and the drag <b>stay</b> splitter <b>plate</b> configuration. The noise test on a 2 -wheel landing gear again proved the beneficial effect of an inner wheel deceleration plate on farfield radiated noise. ...|$|R

Methods: An ordinary commercial plate and the patented new health plate were used in the same meal program, and the oil-water retention were calculated for each meals. Results: Oil-water retention in patented dish was significantly more than the ordinary plate. Conclusions: Patented new plate has designed an additional V-shaped grooves which can keep more oil and water <b>stay</b> in the <b>plate,</b> and this new plate can fix vegetable, fruit, protein in the proportion to be a balanced and healthy diet. New plate not only can reduce oil-water in the dish and the proportion of food can clearly teach student s to understand and develop good control their diet behavior...|$|R
50|$|However, in {{orthodox}} or Brahmin Hindu families, menstruating {{women are}} asked {{to stay away from}} domestic activities for a period of 4 days, and even physical intimacy is prohibited. In very conservative Brahmin households, women have a separate room to <b>stay</b> in, separate <b>plates</b> and cutlery, and do not enter the kitchen or any sacred section of the house. Brahmin women who are into activities such as singing, tailoring or art, do not touch their tools for these three days. Any festival or occasion that comes during the woman's time out of the house, is negotiated discreetly. On the third day, after the Brahmin woman takes a ritual bath, she is considered cleansed and may resume her normal routine. This often described as a spiritual practice, but is usually only found in Brahmin families - most other subcultures require the women to carry on as normal.|$|R
40|$|The {{screened}} Coulomb {{interaction between}} uniformly charged flat plates is considered at very small plate separations {{for which the}} Debye layers are strongly overlapped, {{in the limit of}} small electrical potentials. If the plates are of infinite length, the disjoining pressure between the plates decays as an inverse power of the plate separation. If the plates are of finite length, we show that screening Debye layer charges close {{to the edge of the}} plates are no longer constrained to <b>stay</b> between the <b>plates,</b> but instead spill out into the surrounding electrolyte. The resulting reduction in the disjoining pressure is calculated analytically. A similar reduction of disjoining pressure due to loss of lateral confinement of the Debye layer charges should occur whenever the sizes of the interacting charged objects become small enough to approach the Debye scale. We investigate the effect here in the context of a two dimensional model problem that is sufficiently simple to yield analytical results. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|July 31: In {{a battle}} of the top two {{candidates}} for the AL Cy Young Award, Justin Verlander outdueled Angels' starter Jered Weaver for a 3-2 Tigers victory. Verlander again carried a no-hitter late into the game, ultimately losing the no-hitter and shutout with two out in the eighth after surrendering an RBI single to Maicer Izturis, but persevered for his 15th win of the season. Magglio Ordóñez hit a two-run homer off Weaver {{in the third inning}} and <b>stayed</b> near the <b>plate</b> to see if the ball stayed fair. Weaver took it as an attempt to show him up, and jawed at Ordonez in his next at-bat. When Carlos Guillén homered off Weaver later in the game, he danced down the first-base line and stared toward the mound. Weaver threw the next pitch over Alex Avila's head and was ejected from the game. The Tigers (57-51) finished July 13-13, but maintained a 3-game lead over the Indians.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike many {{amplifiers}} {{marketed as}} [...] "Class A", the Prosonic truly {{functions as a}} Class A power amplifier in the [...] "A" [...] position. Class A refers {{to the amount of}} current flowing through the power tubes with zero audio signal, with Class A meaning maximum current flow even with zero signal. This makes the tubes run hotter, and gives the power section even more gain at the cost of tube life and noise. The Class-A designation for guitar amplifiers is often a misnomer; Few amps outside of the heralded Vox AC-30, also with cathode bias, operate in a true Class-A mode it only did so up to ≈21 watts RMS. While the Prosonic featured cathode bias in the Class A mode and fixed bias in the Class AB mode, not all class A tube amplifiers are cathode-biased, and not all fixed biased amplifiers are Class AB.

30|$|In our study, nailing was {{superior}} to plating {{with respect to the}} average post-operative stay of the patients and operating time. The main reason for the longer <b>stay</b> in the <b>plating</b> group in our study was because of the longer delay in surgery in the plating patients. This was due to our tendency to do DCP only when the swelling had completely subsided. In contrast, ILN does not need rigorous subsidence of the swelling. Most of our patients belonged to far-off places where sterile-dressing facilities were not readily available and thus tended to stay till the operative wound was deemed clean. ILN patients had an edge due to their smaller surgical wounds and so were discharged earlier. The shorter stay, with a less invasive method, such as closed nailing, is of great advantage in developing countries where the orthopaedic hospital beds are limited and resources are scarce. For the same reason, the less operating time reported by us is also advantageous. Chao et al. also had shorter operative time in ILN, although the difference was not significant, while Chaudhary et al. had shorter operative time in the plating group [29, 34]. ILN was also associated with significantly decreased blood loss than plating, as has been seen in most of the studies [29]. Although this difference is statistically significant, but in the clinical settings, this difference is marginal.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere is no {{consensus}} on optimal screening procedures for multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) in intensive care units (ICUs). Therefore, we assessed five strategies {{for the detection of}} extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and high-level expressed AmpC cephalosporinase (HL-CASE) producers. During a 3 -month period, a rectal screening swab sample was collected daily from every ICU patient, from the first 24 h to the last day of ICU <b>stay.</b> Samples were <b>plated</b> on MDRE-selective media. Bacteria were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and antibiograms were performed using disk diffusion. MDREs were isolated from 682 / 2348 (29. 0 %) screening samples collected from 93 / 269 (34. 6 %) patients. Incidences of patients with ESBL and HL-CASE producers were 17. 8 and 19. 3 per 100 admissions, respectively. In 48 / 93 patients, MDRE carriage was intermittent. Compared with systematic screening at admission, systematic screening at discharge did not significantly increase the rate of MDRE detection among the 93 patients (62 % vs. 70 %). In contrast, screening at admission and discharge, screening at admission and weekly thereafter, and screening at admission and weekly thereafter and at discharge significantly increased MDRE detection (77 %, p 0. 02; 76 %, p 0. 01; 86 %, p < 0. 001, respectively). The difference in MDRE detection between these strategies relies essentially on the levels of detection of patients with HL-CASE producers. The most reasonable strategy would be to collect two samples, one at admission and one at discharge, which would detect 87. 5 % of the ESBL strains, 67. 3 % of the HL-CASE strains and 77. 4 % of all MDRE strains. This study should facilitate decision-making concerning the most suitable screening policy for MDRE detection in a given ICU setting...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} test methods approach their lower limits as thermal resistance falls below 0. 1 m 2 ⋅K/W. This is {{the minimum value}} specified in ASTM C 518 (ASTM International, 2010 b) while ASTM C 177 (ASTM International, 2010 a) proposes about 0. 06 m 2 ⋅K/W. Nevertheless these are the test methods, along with their ISO equivalents, required by Australasian building codes and directed at many products and materials with thermal resistance on the low side of 0. 1 m 2 ⋅K/W. Alternatives, such as ASTM E 1530 (ASTM International, 2011), cover much lower resistances but require carefully prepared small specimens and very-high contact pressures and are therefore largely unsuitable for both technical and compliance reasons. For these low resistances, the {{insulation test}} methods face large errors because of interface resistance between specimen and the apparatus hot and cold <b>plates.</b> <b>Staying</b> with C 518, the problem can be avoided by using direct measurement of the test specimen surface temperatures, but this is difficult, has its own accuracy issues, and is often impractical for commercial laboratories. This technique is generally {{used in conjunction with}} interface materials such as flexible foam between the specimen and the hot and cold plates, to enhance contact and also provide an access path for temperature sensors. The alternative prospect of using these interface materials to ensure good specimen contact has been studied, in conjunction with a simple two-step thermal resistance determination based on the difference between presence and absence of the test specimen. This article presents results of a study using this difference approach for the measurement of 12 highly conducting materials, including sheets of aluminum, phenolic, HDPE, MgO, bonded rubber and cork granules, PMMA, and compressed wood fiber. For each material, repeated measurements have been performed with four different interface or “buffer” materials: PVC, silicone, EVA, and nitrile. Silicone sponge provides the most uniform results, consistent with a measurably lower hysteresis. The difference technique yielded a lower indicated thermal resistance than direct measurement by between 0. 003 and 0. 01 m 2 ⋅K/W, with some variation depending on the specimen surface characteristics {{and to a lesser extent}} on the choice of buffer. Larger differences were associated with bowed, uneven or roughly surfaced specimens. The difference-technique results have greater variability, but they may be seen as better estimates of the actual specimen resistance, as contact resistance is much lower for soft-surface interfaces. An interface resistance of up to 0. 01 m 2 ⋅K/W is large enough to be of significance in many thermal measurements...|$|R
