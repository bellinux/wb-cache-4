500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was <b>still</b> <b>saying</b> it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of their grandson, Les and Pam confess their {{blackmail}} secret to their friend, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who warns Babe to end the blackmail. However, despite Claudette's warnings, Babe continues to blackmail the Cokers. This sparks tension between Babe and Claudette, who tells Babe that she will be moving back to the square to keep a [...] "closer eye" [...] on her. Badland explained Babe's rivalry with Claudette: [...] "Claudette's sticking up for Les and Pam. She's a fair match for Babe and it's interesting when they go head-to-head." [...] Badland hoped that the feud would last a long time, opining that it was [...] "fabulous", and that [...] "neither [...] will back down easily", and adding that she thought Babe would triumph over Claudette, though admitted she was biased and probably [...] "the only person on Babe's side". An Inside Soap reporter said Babe and Claudette's feud was [...] "exciting" [...] because Claudette is [...] "fearsome" [...] and Babe is [...] "equally terrifying", and suspected that [...] "Cunning Babe [...] be so easily intimidated". A reporter for All About Soap questioned if Babe had [...] "finally met her match" [...] in Claudette, and compared the two women. In terms of cunning, they said that Babe has it [...] "by the bucketload", while Claudette may be [...] "getting soft in her old age" [...] and may not be [...] "sharp enough to take on Babe". They also opined that Claudette had more [...] "fighting strenth" [...] as she continues to come back after a [...] "knock down" [...] and would not go down without a fight, while Babe's craftiness [...] "means she'd easily {{come up with a new}} way to destroy an enemy". They said that Claudette has a [...] "nasty and murderous" [...] history while Babe's past is [...] "chequered" [...] but she had never killed someone, concluding that Claudette would be the winner of the feud, but <b>still</b> <b>saying</b> that they [...] "wouldn't mess with Babe!".|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stone placed Cosby's concert film [...] as number 8 on {{its list}} of [...] "The 25 Best Stand-Up Specials Of All Time", {{acknowledging}} {{the significance of the}} film while <b>still</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Yes, it's damned near impossible to watch anything the tainted comedian has done and not think of the headlines, the heckling, the revelations and what is, by any definition, monstrous behavior." [...] They also placed Cosby at number 8 on their list of 'The Best Stand-up Comics Of All Time', saying [...] "Bill Cosby is not likely to perform again; listening to his records will never have that gentle, sweet sense of nostalgia for anyone; and while it is impossible to disconnect the performer from the man, scrubbing his name from the annals of stand-up would be impossible." ...|$|E
