40|$|The {{children}} and youth unaccompanied by parents or other legal guardians are called <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> or unaccompanied minors in the Czech Republic. The questions of <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> have been met in the Czech Republic {{since the end of}} 90 s, when these questions have begun to be systematically solved together with questions of children social and legal protection. The unaccompanied minors are highly protected because of their age, the situation in which they are and for the reason of international treaties, pacts and conventions and the Czech law. The <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> care system, its progress, description, process and quality with the inclusion of its international and the Czech legal framework, are described in this thesis. The <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> care system (for purpose of this thesis) is process which starts from identification of unaccompanied minors, continue by social and legal protection and institutional care of this {{children and}} is over when they get full age. The main aim of this thesis was to find out how the Czech social and migration policy claims to <b>separated</b> <b>children,</b> if it is sufficient in the using of care system which is provided to unaccompanied minors. There was a case study method to achieve this aim. The case studies helped to describe practical care system and to compare [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} be able to make an {{application}} for asylum, a <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> must first be able to reach the UK. This has become more difficult in the last decade, with immigration officers being placed at ports and Eurostar stations and airline liaison officers being placed at airports to check the travel documens of anyone wishing to travel to the UK. If a young person is not legally able to enter the UK under the immigration rules, they may be turned back before ever formally entering the UK. [...] Assuming that they make it through the immigration controls, the next step is for a person to make a formal asylum application. This application can be made at the port of entry, at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon, or (only for children) at local immigration service enforcement offices.|$|E
50|$|As with British {{children}} in care, though, care itself can take several different forms. If the unaccompanied asylum-seeking child is under 16 {{at the time}} of arrival, he or she is generally placed in foster care.Those who are 16 or 17 {{at the time of}} arrival—the majority of these children—may be placed in foster care, but generally are placed in semi-independent accommodation, i.e. in ‘shared flats or supervised accommodation’.Most unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are supported under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989. Under Section 20, children’s services must financially support young people until the age of 18 regardless of immigration status. The amount of financial support varies according to different local authorities’ policies and placement. Generally speaking, most local authorities have sent returns to the UK Border Agency (now superseded by UK Visas and Immigration) each month informing the agency how many days a <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> has received support.|$|E
40|$|On 21 st September 2010 this Office {{received}} a complaint from a Guardian ad litem (GAL) acting {{on behalf of}} a <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> 1, then aged 13 years, who was in the care of the HSE. This complaint was made through and supported by the GAL’s solicitor. The role of a GAL is to ascertain the child’s wishes and feelings about their care, to formulate an opinion on what is in the child’s best interests and to report both of these to the courts. GALs can only be appointed to children in care by the courts. The GAL informed the Office that the child was permanently excluded from his school in May 2008 due to behavioural issues. The GAL’s legal representative further advised that these behavioural issues needed to be viewed in the context of recent separation from his mother and siblings, a violent family death and inadequate care from his father. Between June and October 2009 the child was in a non-EU state with his father, but returned as a <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> in October 2009. He was subsequently placed in foster care by the HSE. Having been permanently excluded from his school in May 2008, the child did not return to full-time education until March 2010 as no school placement could be found for him, despite applications being made to in excess of 26 schools by the HSE {{with the assistance of the}} GAL and the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB). An application for Home Tuition was made on his behalf by the NEWB and Home Tuition of nine hours per week was provided by the Department of Education and Skills (hereafter the Department) for the majority of the period during which the child was out of school. The GAL and solicitor contend that despite the involvement of the NEWB and the HSE the child remained outside mainstream school for almost two years. This, they contend, is the result of a lack of management of the child’s education by the Department. They contend that a school placement is the child’s right and that policy and procedures should be put in place to ensure that children are not left without this provision...|$|E
40|$|Ireland’s {{approach}} to after-care for ‘aged-out’ <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> is problematic. Currently, upon reaching {{the age of}} 18, most separated young people are moved to ‘direct provision’, {{despite the fact that}} the state can use discretionary powers to allow them to remain in foster care. Direct provision is the system Ireland adopts providing bed and board to asylum seekers, along with a weekly monetary payment. Separated young people in Ireland are in a vulnerable position after ageing out. Entry into the direct provision system, from a legal and social work perspective, is concerning. Utilising direct provision as a ‘form of aftercare’ emphasises governmental policy preferences that privilege the migrant status of aged-out <b>separated</b> <b>children,</b> as opposed to viewing this group as young people leaving care. In this article, utilising a cross-disciplinary approach, we provide the first systematic exploration of the system of aftercare for aged-out <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> in Ireland. In doing so, we posit two core reasons for why the aftercare system for aged-out <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> has developed as it has. First, doing so ensures that the state is consistent with its {{approach to}} asylum seekers more generally, in that it seeks to deter persons from claiming asylum in Ireland through utilisation of the direct provision system. Second, while the vulnerability of aged-out <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> is well-documented, the state (and others) ignore this vulnerability and are reluctant to offer additional aftercare supports beyond direct provision. This is due, we argue, to viewing aged-out <b>separated</b> <b>children</b> as having a lesser entitlement to rights than other care leavers, solely based on their migrant status...|$|R

40|$|The marketisation {{of early}} {{childhood}} education and care (ECEC) offers opportunities to test assumptions {{about the benefits of}} a market framework. In Australia, where marketisation included reshaping, extending, and increasing government subsidies, one major listed company (ABC Learning Limited) emerged to dominate child care. Child care prices increased rapidly to become an election issue, and government subsidies increased. ABC acknowledged its economic dependence on government policy and subsidies. Until its collapse in 2008, ABC was the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest listed child care operator, and operating internationally. ABC 2 ̆ 7 s structured business model <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> care properties (propco) from child care operations (opco). ABC was the opco and leased the child care properties from propcos. As ABC grew and replicated its structured model to other forms of property including intangible assets, the rising child care prices and government subsidies supported a growing array of other enterprises all seeking profitable operations. This paper explains the structured opco-propco model, identifies its interaction with accounting and lessons to be learned from marketisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{decipher}} the means by which the identities of particular people, specifically unaccompanied and <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> asylum-seekers, are socially constructed as risk. Theorized here as "risk identity", this has occurred within a global context increasingly preoccupied with security. Racialized and imbued with ideological notions of citizenship, this preoccupation and the anxieties contained within it, are effectively yet unduly transferred onto individuals, who for a variety of reasons not innately related to security, are seen as undesirable. The "risk identity" classification becomes the means by Which their exclusion is legitimized and perpetuated. The increased movement of unaccompanied and separated children across international borders has occurred within this global context. Positioned largely in opposition to citizens of the industrialized west, unaccompanied and separated children seeking asylum in Canada are constructed as risk in myriad ways. Based on 13 interviews, 9 with stakeholders and 4 with youth, this study highlights four interconnected categories of risk, which serve to construct unaccompanied and separated minors as risk. These are anti-refugee discourse, anti-youth discourse, as it relates to juvenile justice discourse, prejudicial attitudes and the fear of difference, and securitization discourse...|$|E

It deals with the right of the child to have contact with a parent in prison, the actual realization of this contact and its support in Czech and international legal frameworks. In the center of attention is due to the imprisonment of parents and separated families.

Thanks to theoretic knowledge and conclusions the theoretical part is drawn up and implemented by quantitative questionnaire surveys of all childcare institutions in the Czech Republic. Their purpose is to find out whether the child's right to contact with imprisoned parents is carried out, what type of contact is most often implemented, and what obstacles prevent most of the contact. On the basis of quantitative and partly qualitative data, this is assessing the current problem of "Children of imprisoned parents" and in conclusion, there are [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Forced {{migration}} of refugees or trafficked persons {{has emerged as}} one of the critical human rights issues of our time. One aspect of this issue has generated increasing international political and legal concern but has not received adequate scholarly attention: how effective are the legal mechanisms that seek to protect child asylum seekers who are separated from their families because of persecution or trafficking? This question underpins a new, international research project being launched at Harvard University in conjunction with the University of Sydney in Australia and collaborators in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The project is funded by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Preliminary research supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees has already been started in Germany, Austria, Sweden and Norway. The project will explore how the asylum adjudication system within the three countries studied maps its international legal obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees onto its domestic decisions. It will analyze the meaning and application of the “best interests of the child” principle as it applies to both the process and the outcome of the asylum determination system. It will examine how the populations of trafficked and <b>separated</b> <b>child</b> asylum applicants compare between different countries, in terms of nationality of origin, age and gender distribution, and nature of claims. The results of the research will be contributed to a database of decisions on child asylum cases (with precedents and sample pleadings). Roll out meetings with policy makers, NGOs and advocates are envisaged as part of the dissemination of the findings in future. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Separated</b> <b>children</b> seeking {{asylum in}} Europe {{have the right}} to a representative, {{typically}} {{in the form of a}} guardian, and the right to have their best interests taken into account.
