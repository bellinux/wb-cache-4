Initially, its HD feed was shared with sister network Golf Channel in an arrangement marketed as Versus/Golf HD; Golf Channel programming was broadcast during the daytime hours, and Versus programming was broadcast during the evening and primetime hours with some schedule variation during Tour de France coverage. The <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> was replaced by individual HD feeds for both channels in December 2008.|$|E

It was designed for cable as it had local weather information for specific regions; in some areas, it was carried on cable providers 24 hours a day.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a panel VAR {{model to}} improve upon the {{existing}} literature on interregional risk <b>sharing</b> <b>channels</b> (e. g.

First, it endogenizes the output process within a multi-equation framework, capturing the dynamic feedback between output and various risk <b>sharing</b> <b>channels.</b> Second, in contrast to previous research's analysis of static risk sharing {{in the presence of}} exogenous output shocks, it uses impulse response functions to trace the role of each risk <b>sharing</b> <b>channel</b> over time, in the presence of different structural shocks (temporary vs. persistent and output vs. risk <b>sharing</b> <b>channels).</b> Third, the paper extends the risk <b>sharing</b> <b>channels</b> typically analyzed, by considering the consumption smoothing role of changes in the nominal exchange rate and relative commodity prices across regions. As a result, it is able to better address such policy issues as whether public risk sharing has been a substitute or a complement for financial market diversification activities, or whether the risk sharing role of exchange rate movements in Europe has been relatively unimportant...|$|R

The empirical method is applied to the U. S. states, 23 OECD countries, and 15 countries in the European Union from 1960 to 1990. Regarding the dynamic responses of each risk <b>sharing</b> <b>channel</b> to exogenous output shocks, the results suggest that the dynamics are substantially different among different channels. First, most capital market smoothing is achieved on impact while fiscal smoothing is achieved over time. Second, credit market plays a positive role on impact, but a negative role later. Regarding the substitutability of channels, first, fiscal smoothing is fully substituted by credit market channel in the U. S. while only half of capital market smoothing is substituted in OECD and EU countries. Second, fiscal smoothing is not substituted by any other channels in the U. S. while half of fiscal smoothing is substituted by credit market smoothing in the OECD and EU countries. The results also suggest that nominal and real exchange rate movements are very important in analyzing international risk sharing in OECD and EU countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a <b>channel</b> <b>sharing</b> scheme, Neighbor Cell <b>Channel</b> <b>Sharing</b> (NCCS), based on region partitioning of cell coverage for wireless cellular networks. Each cell {{is divided into}} an inner-cell region and an outer-cell region. Cochannel interference is suppressed by limiting the usage of <b>sharing</b> <b>channels</b> in the inner-cell region. The <b>channel</b> <b>sharing</b> scheme achieves a traffic-adaptive channel assignment and does not require any channel locking. Performance analysis shows that using the NCCS scheme leads to a lower call blocking probability and a better channel utilization as compared with other previously proposed channel assignment schemes. Key words: channel assignment, neighbor cell <b>channel</b> <b>sharing,</b> cellular mobile communications. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{first phase}} of HSDPA has been {{specified}} in the 3GPP release 5. Phase one introduces new basic functions and is aimed to achieve peak data rates of 14.0 Mbit/s with significantly reduced latency. The improvement in speed and latency reduces the cost per bit and enhances support for high-performance packet data applications. HSDPA is based on <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> transmission and its key features are <b>shared</b> <b>channel</b> and multi-code transmission, higher-order modulation, short transmission time interval (TTI), fast link adaptation and scheduling along with fast hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). Further new features are the High Speed Downlink Shared Channels (HS-DSCH), the adaptive modulation QPSK and 16QAM and the High Speed Medium Access protocol (MAC-hs) in base station.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} exchange rates and investment in Australian manufacturing between 1988 and 2001. The effects of exchange rates on investment are found to vary positively with the export share of sales and negatively with the share of imported inputs into production, with lower price-over-cost mark-ups increasing the response. For Australian manufacturing, a 10 per cent real appreciation of the Australian dollar leads to an average 8. 0 per cent decrease in total investment through the export <b>share</b> <b>channel,</b> and an average 3. 8 per cent increase through the imported input <b>share</b> <b>channel,</b> {{with most of the}} response occurring through investment in equipment, plant and machinery.
