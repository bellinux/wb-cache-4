40|$|Introduction We {{propose a}} {{conservative}} extension of Oz that adds futures and by-need synchronization. Futures are read-only views of logic variables {{that make it}} possible to statically limit the scope in which a variable can be constrained. For instance, one can express with futures safe streams that cannot be assigned by their readers. By-need synchronization makes it possible to synchronize a thread on the event that a thread blocks on a future. It is used to express dynamic linking and lazy functions. We also introduce variable assignment and distinguish between <b>simple</b> and complex <b>variables.</b> The idea is that programs should distinguish between the use of logic variables for concurrency and the use of logic variables for constraint programming. Variable assignment is an asymmetric operation that eliminates a <b>simple</b> <b>variable</b> by binding it to a given unit. SB's version of Mozart will provide for the distribution of ports, futures, and <b>simple</b> <b>variables.</b> All other stateful units cann...|$|R

40|$|Exhaust nozzles for {{expendable}} supersonic {{turbojet engine}} missile propulsion systems {{are required to}} be simple, short and compact, {{in addition to having}} good broad-range thrust-minus-drag performance. A series of convergent-divergent nozzle scale model configurations were designed and wind tunnel tested {{for a wide range of}} free stream Mach numbers and nozzle pressure ratios. The models included fixed geometry and <b>simple</b> <b>variable</b> exit area concepts. The experimental and analytical results show that the fixed geometry configurations tested have inferior off-design thrust-minus-drag performance in the transonic Mach range. A <b>simple</b> <b>variable</b> exit area configuration called the Axi-Quad nozzle, combining features of both axisymmetric and two-dimensional convergent-divergent nozzles, performed well over a broad range of operating conditions. Analytical predictions of the flow pattern as well as overall performance of the nozzles, using a fully viscous, compressible CFD code, compared very well with the test data...|$|R

This example makes reference only to x(i) and x(i - 1) in the loop (the latter only to develop the new value x(i)) therefore, given {{that there is no}} later reference to the array x developed here, its usages could be replaced by a <b>simple</b> <b>variable.</b> Such a change would however mean a <b>simple</b> <b>variable</b> whose value is changed whereas if staying with the array, the compiler's analysis might note that the array's values are constant, each derived from a previous constant, and therefore carries forward the constant values so that the code becomes [...] print 2, 2; print 3, 6; print 4, 24; ...etc.It would be quite a surprise if the compiler were to recognise x(n) = Factorial(n).|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} effort to {{automate}} guidelines we determined the number and types of clinical variables required to implement two complex clinical guidelines and the adequacy of the electronic medical record (EMR) to capture them. 178 unique variables were required by both guidelines. Variables were classified as simple (existing observation terms in the EMR), calculated (transformations of <b>simple</b> <b>variables),</b> and complex (requiring multiple <b>simple</b> <b>variables</b> and logical rules for combining them). Many variables are unlikely to be instantiated in an EMR without focused efforts to collect them. In addition, many variables required knowledge that was neither provided in the guideline nor referenced. We conclude that, although the EMR contains the necessary variables to implement these guidelines, successful automated implementation requires unambiguous definition of required terms, incorporation of additional knowledge not provided in the guideline and modification of workflow to collect variables not normally captured in routine clinical care...|$|R
