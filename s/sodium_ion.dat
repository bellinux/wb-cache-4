The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> pump rather than a proton pump.)

5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua ions of the formula +, where n is the {{solvation}} number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the <b>sodium</b> <b>ion,</b> forming the octahedral + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E

50|$|Ions {{cross the}} cell {{membrane}} under two influences: diffusion and electric fields. A simple example wherein two solutions—A and B—are {{separated by a}} porous barrier illustrates that diffusion will ensure that they will eventually mix into equal solutions. This mixing occurs because {{of the difference in}} their concentrations. The region with high concentration will diffuse out toward the region with low concentration. To extend the example, let solution A have 30 <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> and 30 chloride ions. Also, let solution B have only 20 <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> and 20 chloride ions. Assuming the barrier allows both types of ions to travel through it, then a steady state will be reached whereby both solutions have 25 <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> and 25 chloride ions. If, however, the porous barrier is selective to which ions are let through, then diffusion alone will not determine the resulting solution. Returning to the previous example, let's now construct a barrier that is permeable only to <b>sodium</b> <b>ions.</b> Now, only <b>sodium</b> is allowed to diffuse cross the barrier from its higher concentration in solution A to the lower concentration in solution B.

40|$|Using {{the ability}} of the nerve fibers to conduct impulses as {{indicator}} of changes in the concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> in the interstitial spaces of nerve an evaluation has been made of the diffusion constant of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions.</b> The calculated minimal value (0. 62 x 10 – 4 cm. 2 /min.) undoubtedly is much too low; nevertheless, it is still so high that as a rule the diffusion of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> is far more rapid than the establishment of excitability changes; therefore, diffusion times need not be taken into account in the interpretation of ordinary experiments. By measurements of the changes in the longitudinal conductivity of nerve which result from changes in the external concentration of sodium chloride an evaluation has been made of the diffusion constant of sodium chloride in the interstitial spaces of nerve. A minimal value for this constant is 1. 4 x 10 – 4 cm. 2 /min. The evidence presented would be compatible with the assumption that the permeability of the connective tissue sheath for <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> decreases slightly after the concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> in the interstitial spaces of the nerve has become negligible; the evidence, however, shows that changes in the permeability of the sheath cannot {{play a significant role in}} determining the temporal courses of the development of inexcitability in a sodium-free medium and of the restoration of excitability by added <b>sodium</b> <b>ions.</b> If a decrease in the permeability of the sheath should take place in a sodium-free medium, the change would be small and would occur after the nerve fibers have become inexcitable; on the other hand the action of a moderate concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> would be sufficient to restore the permeability of the sheath. As measured by the recovery by A fibers of the ability to conduct impulses the restoration by 0. 1 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> of nerve that has been deprived of sodium for 15 to 20 hours, i. e. for several hours after the nerve fibers have become inexcitable, begins after a significant delay, since no A fiber begins to conduct impulses in less than 8 or 10 minutes. The delay is referable to the fact that, before the A fibers can regain the ability to conduct impulses, those changes in their properties have to be reversed, which have taken place in the absence of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions.</b> Usually within 1 minute after <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> are made available to the nerve the polarizability of the membrane by the anodal current begins to increase; the A fibers soon begin to produce unconducted impulses in response to the break of the anodal current; then, they produce unconducted impulses in response to the closure of the cathodal current, and finally they become able to conduct impulses, although at a markedly reduced speed. The C fibers, that become inexcitable in a sodium-free medium later than the A fibers, begin to conduct impulses within 1 minute or 2 after 0. 1 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> are made available to the nerve. Treatment of a nerve, that has been kept in a sodium-free medium, for 15 to 20 hours, with a moderate concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> (0. 015, 0. 02 N), acting for 1 hour or 2, is not sufficient to restore the ability to conduct impulses to more than a few A fibers, but it produces in a relatively large number of fibers a partial restoration, so that when the concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> outside the epineurium is increased by 0. 005 or 0. 01 N a significant number of A fibers begin to conduct impulses within less than 5 seconds. Initially the recovery progresses with great rapidity, but after a small number of minutes the height of the conducted spike remains practically stationary. Increase of the external concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> by a small amount again causes a rapid enhancement of the recovery, but once more, after a few minutes the height of the spike remains practically stationary, etc. A subnormal concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> may restore to all the A fibers the ability to conduct impulses, but only 0. 1 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> are able to produce a complete restoration of the speed of conduction, and only after they have been allowed to act for a considerable period of time. The ability of all the C fibers to conduct impulses may be restored by relatively small concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions,</b> 0. 02 to 0. 025 N. Nerve fibers that have become inexcitable in a sodium-free medium and have been restored by <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> are far more sensitive to the effect of the lack of sodium than the fibers of untreated nerve. Repeated removal and addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> may bring the nerve fibers, especially those of spinal roots, to a state in which the sensitivity to the lack of sodium is exceedingly great; spinal root fibers may then begin to become inexcitable in a sodium-free medium within a few seconds. Treatment of the nerve with 0. 1 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> for 1 hour or 2 is sufficient to bring about a marked increase in the resistance to the lack of sodium. On the other hand keeping a nerve in Ringer's solution or in the presence of 0. 04 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> does not produce a readily detectable increase in the sensitivity to the lack of sodium. Even the resistance of nerve kept in the presence of 0. 025 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> for 23 hours is very high, since after 2 hours in a sodium-free medium more than two-thirds of the initially conducting fibers will be able to conduct impulses. Frog nerve reaches different states of equilibrium with different external concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions.</b> The states are characterized by the degree of effectiveness of the nerve reaction, the speed of conduction of impulses, and the number of conducting fibers. Approximately the same equilibrium state may be reached by (a) leaving the nerve for 20 to 24 hours in the presence of a subnormal concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> and (b) by leaving the nerve in a sodium-free medium for 15 to 20 hours, restoring it with 0. 1 N <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> acting for a short period of time, rendering it inexcitable again in a sodium-free medium, and finally restoring it with a moderate concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions.</b> If, however, the nerve that has been kept in a sodium-free medium for 15 to 20 hours is restored directly by a moderate concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> the state will not be reached, at least not for several hours, which corresponds to equilibrium with that concentration. The role of sodium in nerve physiology is discussed. Sodium participates in at least four processes, (a) The regulation of the concentration of water outside the nerve fibers; (b) the regulation of the total value of the membrane potential; (c) the production of the nerve impulse, and (d) the establishment of the nerve reaction. In so far as processes (c) and (d) are concerned only the sodium present inside the nerve fibers plays a role; the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> outside the nerve fibers is important only because in the absence of interstitial <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> the nerve fibers lose a part of their internal sodium content. The nerve impulse and the nerve reaction may be produced for long periods of time after the concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> outside the nerve fibers has become negligible. A working hypothesis is put forward according to which the internal sodium content and the interstitial concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> are in equilibrium in so far as a different internal sodium content corresponds to each interstitial concentration. The properties of the nerve fibers are determined by the internal sodium content. The change in properties, i. e. in the state of the nerve fibers, results from processes that take place inside the nerve fibers after the interstitial concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>ions</b> and consequently also the internal sodium content have been changed...|$|R

DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species, as greater quantities of some enzymes of this group accelerate the toxin's metabolism into inactive metabolites. (The same enzyme family is up-regulated in mammals too, e.g., in response to ethanol consumption.) Genomic studies in the model genetic organism Drosophila melanogaster revealed that high level DDT resistance is polygenic, involving multiple resistance mechanisms.|$|E

The command from medullary pacemaker is then passed on by spinal electromotor neurons to electrocytes forming the electric organ, which determine the waveform of the EODs based on its morphophysiological properties. As command from pacemaker reaches electric organ, it opens up all the sodium channels, causing net <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> flux in one direction.

25|$|As {{with other}} regions, tubule {{cells in the}} distal {{convoluted}} tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na+/K+-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine is forming) into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively diffuse out the cell through basolateral channels into the interstitial space, and water accompanies them.

25|$|As the {{membrane}} potential is increased, <b>sodium</b> <b>ion</b> channels open, allowing {{the entry of}} sodium ions into the cell. This {{is followed by the}} opening of potassium ion channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's resting potential. The sodium channels close {{at the peak of the}} action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases {{the membrane}} potential or hyperpolarizes the cell. For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70mV. However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell fires, producing an action potential. The frequency at which cellular action potentials are produced is known as its firing rate.|$|E
