5000|$|Abstract length {{varies by}} {{discipline}} and publisher requirements. Typical length ranges from 100 to 500 words, but very rarely {{more than a}} page and occasionally just a few words. An abstract {{may or may not}} have the section title of [...] "abstract" [...] explicitly listed as an antecedent to content. Abstracts are typically sectioned logically as an overview of what appears in the paper, with any of the following subheadings: Background, Introduction, Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions. Abstracts in which these subheadings are explicitly given are often called structured abstracts by publishers. In articles that follow the IMRAD pattern (especially original research, but sometimes other article types), <b>structured</b> <b>abstract</b> style is the norm. (The [...] "A" [...] of abstract may be added to [...] "IMRAD" [...] yielding [...] "AIMRAD".) Abstracts that comprise one paragraph (no explicit subheadings) are often called unstructured abstracts by publishers. They are often appropriate for review articles that don't follow the IMRAD pattern within their bodies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> are {{required}} by many medical research journals in order for submitted manuscripts to qualify for publication. These abstracts are sub-divided, using sub-headings, into clear separate sub-sections. However, <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> are presently not required by most technical journals.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to consider whether or not such <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> can be used effectively in social science journals. METHOD. The paper reviews a selection of studies as carried out by the author and his colleagues to see if <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> written for social science journals are more informative, easier to read, and easier to search than are their traditional equivalents.

40|$|Background. In 1997 four {{journals}} {{published by}} the British Psychological Society - the British Journal of Clinical Psychology, the British Journal of Educational Psychology, the British Journal of Health Psychology, and Legal and Criminological Psychology - began publishing <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts.</b> Aims. The aim of the studies reported here {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of these <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> by comparing them with original versions written in a traditional, unstructured, format. Method. The authors of articles accepted for publication in the four journals were asked to supply copies of their original traditional abstracts (written when the paper was submitted) together with copies of their <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> (when the paper was revised). 48 such requests were made, and 30 pairs of abstracts were obtained. These abstracts were then compared on a number of measures. Results. Analysis showed that the <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> were significantly more readable, significantly longer, and significantly more informative than the traditional ones. Judges assessed the contents of the <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> more quickly and with significantly less difficulty than they did the traditional ones. Almost every respondent expressed positive attitudes to <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts.</b> Conclusions. The <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> fared significantly better than the traditional ones on every measure used in this enquiry. We recommend, therefore, that the editors of other journals in the social sciences consider the adoption of <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess and}} compare the quality of nonstructured and <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> of {{original}} research articles in three medical journals. DESIGN: Blind, criterion-based observational study. SAMPLE: Random sample of 300 abstracts (25 abstracts per journal each year) of articles published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Canadian Medical Association Journal and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1988 and 1989 (nonstructured abstracts) and in 1991 and 1992 (<b>structured</b> <b>abstracts).</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The quality of abstracts was measured against 33 objective criteria, which were divided into eight categories (purpose, research design, setting, subjects, intervention, measurement of variables, results and conclusions). The quality score was determined by dividing the number of criteria present by the number applicable; the score varied from 0 to 1. RESULTS: The overall mean quality scores for nonstructured and <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> were 0. 57 and 0. 74 respectively (p < 0. 001). The frequency in meeting the specific criteria was generally higher for the <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> than for the nonstructured ones. The mean quality score was higher for nonstructured abstracts in JAMA than for those in BMJ (0. 60 v. 0. 54, p < 0. 05). The scores for <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts</b> {{did not differ significantly}} between the three journals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support recommendations that promote the use of <b>structured</b> <b>abstracts.</b> Further studies should be performed to assess the effect of time on the quality of abstracts {{and the extent to which}} abstracts reflect the content of the articles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{sensorimotor}} sequence {{may contain}} information structure at several different levels. In this study, we investigated {{the hypothesis that}} two dissociable processes are required for the learning of surface <b>structure</b> and <b>abstract</b> <b>structure,</b> respectively, of sensorimotor sequences. Surface structure is the simple serial order of the sequence elements, whereas <b>abstract</b> <b>structure</b> is defined by relationships between repeating sequence elements. Thus, sequences ABCBAC and DEFEDF have different surface structures but share a common <b>abstract</b> <b>structure,</b> 123213, and are therefore isomorphic. Our simulations of sequence learning performance in serial reaction time (SRT) tasks demonstrated that (1) an existing model of the primate fronto-striatal system is capable of learning surface structure but fails to learn <b>abstract</b> <b>structure,</b> which requires an additional capability, (2) surface and <b>abstract</b> <b>structure</b> can be learned independently by these independent processes, and (3) only <b>abstract</b> <b>structure</b> transfers to isomorphic sequences. We tested these predictions in human subjects. For a sequence with predictable surface and <b>abstract</b> <b>structure,</b> subjects in either explicit or implicit conditions learn the surface structure, but only explicit subjects learn and transfer the <b>abstract</b> <b>structure.</b> For sequences with only <b>abstract</b> <b>structure,</b> learning and transfer of this structure occurs only in the explicit group. These results are parallel to those from the simulations and support our dissociable process hypothesis. Based on the synthesis of the current simulation and empirical results with our previous neuropsychological findings, we propose a neuro-physiological basis for these dissociable processes: Surface structure can be learned by processes that operate under implicit conditions and rely on the fronto-striatal system, whereas learning <b>abstract</b> <b>structure</b> requires a more explicit activation of dissociable processes that rely on a distributed network that includes the left anterior cortex...|$|R

40|$|National audienceOBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{reliability}} and validity of tests assessing medical students' ability to read medical journal articles critically. METHODS: All third-year students at our medical school (n= 125) took three tests between December 2004 and June 2005 as part of a program to teach critical appraisal of medical literature. Each test required students to write a 250 -word <b>structured</b> <b>abstract</b> and to answer a set of 6 to 8 appraisal questions. Interrater reliability was assessed with the intra-class correlation coefficient for the first test. Validity was assessed 1) by calculating the correlation coefficient between the mean scores on the three critical appraisal tests and 2) by calculating the correlation coefficient between these tests and eight other tests in other subjects that the students took over the same period. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was satisfactory for the overall score (ICC= 0. 72) and for the score for the questions alone (ICC= 0. 73). It was only moderate, however, for the <b>structured</b> <b>abstract</b> test (ICC= 0. 53) and varied markedly from question to question (ICC range: 0. 29 - 0. 86).
