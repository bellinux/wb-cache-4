5|$|In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener, of the Palestine Exploration Fund <b>survey</b> <b>team,</b> {{reported}} uncovering an Arabic inscription {{buried in}} {{the wall of the}} village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they would probably have to repeat the payment.|$|E
5|$|A four-man {{survey party}} from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF arrived on Goodenough Island on 3 January 1943. They {{selected}} Beli Beli Bay as a suitable site for an anchorage. Here, a 5,000ton (14,000 m3) ship could anchor {{half a mile}} (0.8km) offshore {{with some degree of}} shelter from the south-east and north-west. A member of the <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began constructing a jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani. An advance party of 54men from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron arrived on 27 February 1943.|$|E

5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, a <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> {{from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds {{was sent to}} Hiroshima to evaluate {{the effects of the}} blast. From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Indian {{government}} acting for the Bhutanese government, {{conducted a}} feasibility study into {{the viability of}} an international airport near the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu. In the five-year plan (which covers 2008–2013) the sum of BTN 2,826 million had been allocated by the Bhutanese government for development of the new airport. A preliminary survey was conducted by India in May 2006 and the <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu {{would be used for}} domestic flights only.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren {{with orders}} to {{organize}} a <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> {{to report on the}} damage and radioactivity at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A party equipped with portable Geiger counters arrived in Hiroshima on 8 September headed by Farrell and Warren, with Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. This and other scientific missions to Japan would provide valuable scientific and historical data.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|Warren was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He {{was responsible for the}} health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll.|$|E
5|$|During {{her career}} Danton {{was sent to}} Great Britain to honor the {{coronation}} of George V, and later served in World War I as an escort for supply ships and troop transports, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a German U-boat, leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until an underwater <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be Danton. The ship is in remarkably good shape for her age. Danton rests upright on the ocean floor, {{and most of the}} original equipment is reported to be intact.|$|E

5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E

50|$|Franconia Notch is a U-shaped valley {{that was}} shaped by glaciers. The Old Man {{formation}} was probably formed from freezing and thawing of water in cracks of the granite bedrock sometime after the retreat of glaciers 12,000 years ago. The formation was first noted in the records of a Franconia <b>surveying</b> <b>team</b> around 1805. Francis Whitcomb and Luke Brooks, part of the <b>surveying</b> <b>team,</b> were the first two to record observing the Old Man. The official state history says several groups of surveyors were working in the Franconia Notch area {{at the time and}} claimed credit for the discovery.|$|R

25|$|In February 1869 George Woodroffe Goyder, the Surveyor General, and a <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> {{arrived in}} Port Darwin {{to survey the}} new town of Palmerston (now known as Darwin).

25|$|Areas of the Rocky Mountains have {{veins of}} coal {{close to the}} surface of the land, {{providing}} significant and relatively accessible reserves. In 1867, these coal deposits caught the attention of William Jackson Palmer, then leading a <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> planning the route of the Kansas Pacific Railway. The rapid expansion of rail transport in the United States made coal a highly valued commodity, and it was rapidly commercialized.|$|E
25|$|Service on the Mahopac Branch {{continued}} until 1960. The tracks were eventually dismantled {{to and from}} the bridge, but the bridge itself remained. In 1976, a <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> from the Historic American Engineering Record found that it remained in good condition despite the lack of maintenance or use. Its presence on New York City watershed land, where public access is tightly restricted, has helped preserve it as well.|$|E

25|$|He {{was sent}} instead {{to inspect the}} {{shipyard}} facilities in Texas and on the West Coast. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt needed his own reports on what conditions were like in the Southwest Pacific.

From a suggestion by Forrestal, Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> of the Southwest Pacific.|$|E

Wen succeeded in office, rising as chief of the Gansu Provincial Geological Bureau and later as Vice-minister of Geology and Mineral Resources.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} Science {{magazine}} by John Bohannon describes {{some of the}} criticisms, {{as well as some}} responses from the Lancet report's lead author Gilbert Burnham. According to Bohannon and Johnson, the Lancet paper indicates that the <b>survey</b> <b>team</b> avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published Lancet paper is oversimplified.|$|E
