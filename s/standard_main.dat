5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable <b>standard.</b> <b>Main</b> Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E

50|$|The 12 inch 40 caliber naval gun was the <b>standard</b> <b>main</b> {{weapon of}} the pre-dreadnought battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy. Sixty-eight guns {{of the first}} {{production}} run were built in 1895-1906 by the Obukhov Works in Saint Petersburg.

The Russian Navy abandoned German artillery models in favor of Canet and Schneider et Cie. designs, but the Krupp legacy persisted in the Navy's largest guns. The 12 inch 40 caliber became the Navy's <b>standard</b> <b>main</b> gun and was employed on all its pre-dreadnought battleships starting with Sissoi Veliky of the Baltic Fleet and Tri Sviatitelia of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

50|$|Italian 120 {{millimetre}} naval {{guns were}} <b>standard</b> <b>main</b> armament on Italian destroyers and were widely used on various other ships and coastal artillery.

Velocity was later reduced to 920 m per second, which gave a maximum range of 19.6 km at 45° elevation or 18.2 km at 35° elevation. Variants of similar designs were built by Ansaldo, OTO, Vickers, Schneider, Canet and Armstrong. Older and shorter-barreled guns have different ballistics as noted below.|$|E
