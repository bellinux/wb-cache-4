40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to verify empirically the kind of sustainable activity that contributes to the long-term profitability of a company. In many previous empirical studies, the conventional corporate social responsibility (CSR) activity of a company has not always correlated with the corporate performance. The stance in relation to conventional CSR activity was often a derivative activity for a company to carry out business. However, sustainable activities may be regarded as a strategy for finding a new market or raising the competitive advantage. In terms of the research methodology, statistical verification was carried out based on the <b>sustainability</b> <b>statement,</b> the various publicity materials and the financial data released by each company. The same conclusion was drawn from the quantitative and qualitative analyses in {{this research}}. When private enterprises adopt sustainable activities, unlike a simple redistribution of profits, the consumer value, corporate value and social value are expanded cyclically.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to verify empirically that internalising externalities of private enterprises contributes to profitability on a long-term basis. One of the significant transitions of the economic environment globally {{at the beginning of this}} century has been the rapid economic growth of emerging countries. On the other hand, there is apprehension also about various social problems due to the rapid industrialisation of such emerging countries, or improvement in the living standard. Political-economist Malthus (1798) warned of such a drain on resources and energy, and the ravaging of the natural environment at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Present-day Malthusians warn of ruin because of the exhaustion of resources and environmental deterioration resulting from active business activity. This aims to tighten up regulations as "a governmental role" to the so-called "market failure. " Mill (1848) introduced the concept of “stationary state” in the "philosophy of economics. " On the other hand, Robert Solow (1956) highlighted the significance of technological progress as a factor of economic growth. In terms of the positive role of a private company, Porter et al. (2011) called it the strategy of shared-value creation. It is internalisation of the externality on a market transaction. In terms of research methodology, statistical verification was carried out based on the <b>sustainability</b> <b>statement,</b> the various publicity materials and the financial data released by each company.

40|$|AbstractCommercial farming of Atlantic {{salmon in}} Scotland started in 1969 {{and has since}} {{expanded}} to produce > 179, 000 tyear− 1. A government department has published annual statistics and information on the seawater and freshwater sub-sectors of the Scottish salmon farming industry since 1979, and this review collates and discusses metrics covering aspects of production, farm sites and systems, fish performance, socio-economics and environmental pressures. Trends illustrated in this case study of aquaculture development include: initial increases in numbers of farms and companies, followed by decreases due to industry consolidation; increases in average farm size, and productivity of systems and employees; increases in survival, size at age and productivity of fish (yield per smolt, ova per broodstock); reduced dependence on wild stocks for ova. This case study also illustrates the importance of disease management, control of biological processes to overcome natural seasonality (i. e. production of out-of-season smolt), and the international nature of aquaculture. Improvements in fish survival, growth and productivity are attributed to progress in vaccination and health management (including fallowing), husbandry, system design, feed formulation and provision, and introduction of technology and mechanisation. Salmon farming is discussed {{in relation to the}} challenging strategy of “sustainable intensification”. Improved growth and survival over a period of increasing rearing unit size, farm size and output and decreasing relative staff input counters the common assumption that intensification compromises animal welfare. The value of capturing time series data on industry wide metrics is illustrated as it enables identification of trends, underperformance and bench-marking, as well as assessment of resource use efficiency, environmental pressures, and ultimately <b>sustainability.</b> <b>Statement</b> of relevanceThis review is an original collation of a comprehensive set of time series of official statistics on an entire, discrete and regionally important sector of commercial aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{claims that}} {{certifications}} and ecolabels {{are based on}} an inherent contradiction that leads to often unnoticed consequences. Despite the underlying assumption that these mechanisms of corporate governance lead to more transparency in the market, {{it is a matter}} of fact that <b>sustainability</b> <b>statements</b> appear only on some products. As a consequence, labelled goods are transformed into the exceptional and unique. On the other hand, images and statements that highlight the exploitative or unhealthy nature of products – what could be called ‘non-ecolabels’ – are almost non-existent in the market and have been strongly opposed by multinational corporations operating in different sectors (from cocoa to computers). In the absence of mandatory requirements of negative disclosure, violations and exploitations that occur outside of the ‘sustainability sphere’ are invisible and normalized by the multiplicity and complexity of transnational production. Therefore, logos and no-logos must be understood as the two sides of the same exploitative system: two mutually supportive sources of value that depend on each other and foster the reproduction of transnational corporate capitalism...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} recognized that nowadays {{social and environmental}} aspects, and more in general stakeholder-linked issues, are becoming important corporate value drivers. It is also rather {{clear that there is}} a strong relationship between the stakeholder perspective and a number of concepts and practices which stress non-financial aspects of company behaviour, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability (including environmental respect) and corporate governance. Accordingly, these emerging company ideas and attitudes are here collectively referred to as “stakeholder responsible (or oriented) approaches”. Current literature underlines especially the importance and difficulty of the implementation phase of these approaches into concrete company actions, but it seems to largely overlook the impact which the reporting process has on both concepts and company actions. On the basis of an ad hoc theoretical model, the paper aims to provide insights into the “active role” subtly played by stakeholder oriented reporting (e. g. social and <b>sustainability</b> <b>statements)</b> in constructing and reconstructing the underlying ideas and notions as well as company behaviours in this field. Far from being a neutral and “passive” mirror of the stakeholder responsible approach implemented, reporting carries out the decisive and constitutive role to concretise abstract concepts and to visualise company activities, thus substantially contributing to make the “stakeholder philosophy” viable and reliable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} factors {{associated}} with voluntary decisions to assure social, environmental and sustainability reports. Since the market for assurance services {{in this area is}} in its formative stages, there is a limited understanding of the demand for this emergent non-financial auditing practice, which is evolving rapidly across different countries. Drawing from extant literature in international auditing and environmental accounting, we focus on a set of country-level institutional factors to explain the adoption of <b>sustainability</b> assurance <b>statements</b> among an international panel of 212 Fortune Global 250 companies for the years 1999, 2002 and 2005. Consistent with our expectations, our results provide evidence that companies operating in countries that are more stakeholder oriented and have a weaker governance enforcement regime are more likely to adopt a <b>sustainability</b> assurance <b>statement.</b> Further, the demand for assurance is higher in countries where sustainable corporate practices are better enabled by market and institutional mechanisms. Our exploratory findings also indicate that the likelihood of choosing a large accounting firm as assurance provider increases for companies domiciled in countries that are shareholder oriented and have a lower level of litigation. We conclude the paper by suggesting three directions of {{research in the area of}} sustainability assurance that have relevant academic and practical implication...|$|R
40|$|Gilthead {{sea bream}} (Sparus aurata) usually chew their feed before {{swallowing}} it. Under rearing condition, this feeding behaviour generates significant feed {{waste in the}} form of pellet fragments. The study aimed to experimentally quantify feed losses by chewing considering fish weight and the feed pellet size. Gilthead sea bream with a body weight of 28 – 1019 g were fed with differently sized pellets (2 – 8 mm) from a commercial aquafeed gamma. Feed wastes were collected and data were used to create a model able to estimate the waste derived from this particular feeding behaviour. The results pointed to a substantial feed loss, which increased proportionally with fish size as the pellets are larger. Simulations for a complete ongrowing cycle carried out following the aquafeed manufacturer's recommendations with regard to pellet size revealed that feed wastes by chewing represent 8 % of the feed delivered. Alternative feeding regimes based on the use of smaller pellets would lead to a significant reduction in losses (up to 50 %) through chewing. Improving the feeding strategy would help to minimize waste output, increasing gilthead sea bream aquaculture <b>sustainability.</b> <b>Statement</b> of relevance: This study deals with the wastes generated by chewing in the ongrowing of gilthead seabream of different body weight fed with different pellet sizes. This is the only work modelling the losses by chewing phenomenon, also suggesting alternative feeding regimes to improve environmental sustainability of the aquaculture process.

40|$|Recent {{growth in}} {{sustainability}} reporting has {{been followed by}} growth in sustainability reporting assurance. Although sustainability reporting and its assurance are both still voluntary in many countries around the world, like New Zealand, several organisations have already disclosed sustainability reports publicly and also engaged in the assurance process. The aim of this research project is to explore {{the current state of}} sustainability reporting assurance in New Zealand listed companies. The intention is to discover the motivations for, and barriers to, assurance engagement; identify the preferred assurers; and introduce the influential factors for improving the quality of <b>sustainability</b> reporting assurance <b>statements.</b> Mono and multiple methods are implemented in this exploratory research. The research design is divided into four sequential phases. The first phase considers information about the current status of sustainability reporting assurance. The second phase analyses <b>sustainability</b> reporting assurance <b>statements</b> published by companies listed on NZX through content analysis. The last two phases investigate sustainability managers’ and sustainability assurers’ viewpoints about several aspects of sustainability reporting assurance through one-on-one online semi-structured interviews. Using agency theory, signalling theory and stakeholder theory, this research provides insights into motivations for, and barriers to, sustainability reporting assurance engagement from the perspectives of the sustainability assurers and two groups of sustainability reporting organisations – those that have not yet engaged, and those that have already engaged, in the assurance process. The results highlight the characteristics of the preferred sustainability assurers. This research also identifies that while the quality of <b>sustainability</b> reporting assurance <b>statements</b> is increasing, there is still considerable room for improvement. iv A number of potential limitations including subjectivity apply to this research which uses a qualitative approach on a small population of New Zealand listed companies. Despite these limitations, this research still provides some valid insights about sustainability reporting assurance in a voluntary environment. In particular, this research extends previous studies to add to sustainability reporting assurance knowledge by collating the results of several data gathering and data analysis techniques, which examine that area comprehensively. This research provides broader insights into the terms of sustainability reporting assurance since it considers all types of internal and external sustainability assurance as well as two groups of reporting organisations. The findings of this research will practically benefit organisations; sustainability assurers; New Zealand authorities, legislators and standard setters; and other stakeholders by introducing the characteristics of best practice for sustainability reporting assurance in a voluntary sustainability reporting and assurance environment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{presents}} the business case for why Cummins Inc., a 10 -billion-dollar diesel engine and power company, should adopt a sustainability strategy, and provides suggestions {{for how the}} company can incorporate the concept of sustainability into its existing processes. The Four-Question Sustainability Framework, a tool created specifically for this project, is used throughout the report. The five reasons why Cummins should adopt a sustainability strategy are: • Sustainability is part of Cummins’ history. • Sustainability {{is in line with}} Cummins’ vision, mission, and values. • A sustainability strategy will help Cummins address macro-environmental trends. • A sustainability strategy will enable Cummins to reap financial benefits. • A sustainability strategy is necessary for Cummins to remain competitive. We present a case study of Fleetguard’s creation of the Mach filter to demonstrate how the interplay of these factors influenced a Cummins business unit to pursue a new product linked to sustainability. To explain how Cummins can integrate a sustainability strategy, we develop a <b>sustainability</b> vision <b>statement</b> for Cummins. We then draw upon the Four-Question Sustainability Framework to systematically analyze existing processes and suggest enhancements for how the company can become more sustainable. We recommend implementing these changes through four main channels: overall company objectives, planning processes, operational practices, and financial analyses...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between budget processes and environmental sustainability outcomes. Design/methodology/approach– This paper presents a detailed case study of the budget process within a not-for-profit institute of technology (Unitec), based in Auckland, New Zealand. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a sample of Unitec’s staff directly involved with preparation of the 2012 annual budget and Unitec’s environmental sustainability strategies. Other data used included publicly available strategy documents, annual reports, news reports, and environmental <b>sustainability</b> action <b>statements.</b> Data collected was assembled using NVivo software to aid analysis. The qualitative analysis was informed by a Foucauldian critical approach to investigate how power is exercised in Unitec’s budget processes in relation to Unitec’s environmental sustainability strategy (ESS). Findings– Insights into the factors which influence budgetary realities and under-resourced ESS rhetoric are provided. A key finding was that power supporting Unitec’s formal budget process is all-pervasive, through the continuance of ‘business as usual’ whereby ESS was denied standing of equivalence to functions that existed prior to the ESS initiatives. The influence of the ESS was confirmed as less financially entrenched notwithstanding Unitec’s determined efforts to promote environmental sustainability as a core value. The paper concludes that the potentially transformative power of the ESS is currently mendicant to budgetary processes that essentially exclude ESS from the inner core of Unitec. Progress is achievable, however, by ESS quantifying in accounting terms the value or payback of its contribution. Originality/Value– An in-depth analysis shows how the disciplinary power of accounting within budget processes influences an organisation’s environmental sustainability outcomes. Since ‘business as usual’ currently operates as a blockage to sustainability outcomes, the path for correction of that impediment lies within environmental sustainability adopting Accounting-based language or an attack on the legitimacy of ‘business as usual’...|$|R

However, the preparation of sustainability reports varies and external assurance is not currently mandatory for reports. Thus, there is an overall confusion on what information is necessary within a sustainability reporting, {{the purpose is to}} (1) evaluate current sustainability practices and (2) recommend ways sustainability reporting should continue to develop.

Reporting frameworks such as the IFAC Sustainability Framework 2. 0 and the GRI G 3 are currently being used by large companies issuing sustainability reports. These frameworks are considered to be the most prevalent guidelines used by large international companies in this study. As most companies have already spent to increase sustainability initiatives, it is assumed that the cost of preparing a report is marginal. Peer reviewed journals, current business periodicals, and firm white papers were utilized to learn about sustainability reporting and its many subtopics. Along with these sources, the IFAC and GRI websites were extensively utilized for information on current frameworks and upcoming changes.

40|$|Cities are {{engines of}} growth and productivity. In addition, great {{expectations}} are set upon these agglomerations to contribute to development that {{meets the needs of}} the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. Indeed, mainstreaming of sustainability in planning and policy making is inevitable when reﬂected the current and projected pace of urbanization. However, the widely held association between sustainability and density of urban structure is not well-grounded in the existing empirical evidence. This dissertation studies the relationship between urbanization and sustainability from the aspects of environmental and social sustainability. The knowledge about the environmental sustainability is contributed by studying the relationship between urbanity and direct and indirect consumption-based carbon footprints, both together and separately. And the relationships between urbanity and social sustainability are studied using two measures of subjective well-being, namely, happiness and quality of life. The main contribution is to show that just a limited set of measures is sufﬁcient to reveal discrepancies within and between the studied sustainability measures. In addition, a framework of urban sustainability and multiple related factors is constructed to visualize the complexity of the concept. Finally, it is argued that urban sustainability should be understood as a contested concept, inevitably characterized by trade-offs and discrepancies. In other words, {{there seems to be no}} unambiguous urbanization gradient in sustainability. The contribution of the dissertation is two-fold. First, it provides empirical evidence about the relationships between urbanity and the speciﬁc measures studied, using a high-quality data at disaggregated individual or household level. Second, it criticizes the shallow grounds of many urban <b>sustainability</b> <b>statements</b> by showing the limited power of the degree of urbanity, and even more so, the limited leverage of urban policies in determining sustainability outcomes. Even though transportation and housing choices of the residents can be inﬂuenced to some extent, urbanization is a multidimensional and multi-locational process related to deep reaching socioeconomic changes that are harder to inﬂuence. The conclusions of the dissertation call for keeping in mind the wide scope of urbanization, setting the power of planning to its proportion, and moving towards more human-centric approach to urban planning. The aim is not to dispute the importance of sustainable urbanization, but to underscore its complex nature and call for more ambitious urban sustainability policies that are more than rhetoric based on overoptimistic assumptions.

Helsta framlag ritgerðarinnar er að sýna að aðeins þarf fáa mælikvarða til að sýna misræmi innan og milli þegar rannsakaðra mælikvarða um sjálfbærni. Einnig er sett fram myndræn lýsing á venslum sjálfbærni og tengdra þátta til að lýsa því hve hugtakið um sjálfbæra byggð er flókið. Að lokum eru færð rök fyrir því að skilja þarf sjálfbæra byggð sem umdeilt hugtak þar sem sífellt togast á kostir og gallar og ekkert einhlítt svar er til. Framlag ritgerðarinnar skiptist í grunninn í tvennt. Í fyrsta lagi veitir ritgerðin rannsóknarniðurstöður um samband byggðar og sjálfbærnimælikvarðana sem kannaðir eru með ítarlegum og góðum gögnum um einstaklinga og heimili. Í öðru lagi gagnrýnir ritgerðin grunnhyggnar fullyrðingar um sjálfbæra byggð með því að sýna lítil áhrif þátt staðsetningar og sérstaklega lítil áhrif þéttleika byggðar á breytingar í átt að sjálfbærni. Þrátt fyrir að samgöngur og húsnæðisval íbúa verði fyrir einhverjum áhrifum af slíkum stefnum, þá er byggðaþróun margvítt og landfræðilega dreift ferli sem tengist félagshagrænum breytingum sem erfiðara er að hafa áhrif á. Ritgerðin kallar eftir því að tekið sé tillit til hins víða áhrifasviðs byggðaþróunar, að byggðaskipulagi sé beytt í hlutfallselegu samræmi við áhrif þess og að það taki aukið tillit til mannlegra þátta. Ritgerðin dregur ekki úr mikilvægi sjálfbærnihugsunar við byggðarskipulag heldur bendir á hve flókið viðfangsefnið er. Það er þörf á mun metnaðarfyllri sjálfbærniaðgerðum og stefnumörkun sem er ekki bara orðræða byggð á of bjartsýnum forsendum. Fina...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} {{crucial for the}} energy {{industry}} as projects in this industry are extensively large and complex and have significant impacts on the environment, community and economy. It demands the energy industry to proactively incorporate sustainability ideas and commit to sustainable project development. This study aims to investigate how the Australian energy industry responds to sustainability requirements and in particular what indicators used to measure sustainability performance. To achieve this, content analysis of <b>sustainability</b> reports, vision <b>statements</b> and policy statements of Australian energy companies listed in the 2013 PLATTS Top 250 Global Energy Company Rankings and government reports relating to sustainability has been conducted. The findings show that the energy companies extensively discuss sustainability aspects within three dimensions, i. e. community, environment, and economy. Their primary goals in sustainability are supplying cleaner energy for future, and doing business {{in a way that}} improves outcomes for shareholders, employees, business partners and the communities. In particular, energy companies have valued the employees of the business as a one of the key area that needs to be considered. Furthermore, the energy industry has become increasingly {{aware of the importance of}} measuring sustainability performance to achieve sustainability goals. A number of sustainability indicators have been developed on the basis of the key themes beyond economic measures. It is envisaged that findings from this research will help stakeholders in the energy industry to adopt different indicators to evaluate and ultimately achieve sustainability performance...|$|R
40|$|To turn current {{patterns}} of consumption and production in a sustainable direction, solid and understandable market information on the socio-ecological performance of products is needed. Eco-labelling programmes {{have an important role}} in this communication. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate what gaps there may be in the current criteria development processes in relation to a strategic sustainability perspective and develop recommendations on how such presumptive gaps could be bridged. First a previously published generic framework for strategic sustainable development is described and applied for the assessment of two eco-labelling programmes. Data for the assessment is collected from literature and in semi-structured interviews and discussions with eco-labelling experts. The assessment revealed that the programmes lack both an operational definition of <b>sustainability,</b> and a <b>statement</b> of objectives to direct and drive the criteria development processes. Consequently they also lack guidelines for how product category criteria might gradually develop in any direction. The selected criteria mainly reflect the current reality based on a selection of negative impacts in ecosystems, but how this selection, or prioritization, is made is not clearly presented. Finally, there are no guidelines to ensure that the criteria developers represent a broad enough competence to embrace all essential sustainability aspects. In conclusion the results point at deficiencies in theory, process and practice of eco-labelling, which hampers cohesiveness, transparency and comprehension. And it hampers predictability, as producers get no support in foreseeing how coming revisions of criteria will develop. This represents a lost opportunity for strategic sustainable development. It is suggested that these problems could be avoided by informing the criteria development process by a framework for strategic sustainable development, based on backcasting from basic sustainability principles...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability in {{business}} is clearly {{recognized as a}} very important topic which is intensively discussed in theory and practice. (When {{it comes to the}} social and ecological aspects of sustainability, the logistics and transportation industry is often considered one of the prime suspects to be identified as a major polluter reluctant to implement changes and improvements. A workshop was designed and organized in the fall of 2011 to start a discussion on the role that the logistics service industry plays or should play in the sustainability business. The clear objective was to work on the issue – not from the viewpoint of politics and society, not from the viewpoint of industry and the retail sector, and not from that of academia ‐ but from the view of the logistics service providers. In other words, the workshop was designed to help develop a clear statement {{of the role of the}} logistics industry. A statement of the logistics industry’s role as the logistics industry understands it. This short paper recapitulates the red thread of the workshop discussions and ends with a summary. This summary is meant as a first draft of a manifest of the industry regarding their view towards the topic of <b>sustainability.</b> It provides <b>statements</b> in response to four basic questions regarding sustainability. As this manifest is made by a focused, but in size and geography limited group, it is of course not representative. Therefore we would like to encourage everyone from the industry in addition to those from outside the industry to support us with comments. Tell us if and why you agree or not, and how we could improve and augment the statements made...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore the impacts of perceived greenwashing of event sustainability policies and green marketing on attendees' attitudes and behaviours towards consuming sustainably, and perception towards the concept of green events. A case study of Edinburgh's Hogmanay Street Party and Concert in the Garden was chosen to investigate this; labelled a green event due to its <b>sustainability</b> policy and <b>statements</b> of sustainable practices, yet indications of potential greenwashing within its impact assessment. Qualitative methods were used to explore such impacts {{due to the nature of}} the research reliant on attendees' experience at Edinburgh's Hogmanay. Unobtrusive direct observation determined the severity of greenwash occurring, with no evidence found to substantiate claims throughout its policy. Two separate focus groups of 6 and 4 participants each were conducted before the event to explore existing attitudes, behaviours and perceptions towards sustainable consumption and the event's sustainability policy. These were also conducted after the event to explore the impacts of perceived greenwashing by drawing comparisons between dialogues. The results of this study found participants demonstrated scepticism and distrust towards the event's policy prior to the event. Although this study found little impact on participants' attitudes and behaviours towards consuming sustainably outside of events, the confirmed scepticism from perceived greenwashing caused a substantial impact on participants' attitudes and behaviours towards consuming sustainably during the event, and caused distrust towards the concept of green events. Two unexpected themes also emerged, that being the impact of the festival environment on participants' social and moral norms towards consuming sustainably, and a perceived division of responsibility and accountability for waste disposal and environmental impacts between the event organisers and the attendees. This study contributes to an unexplored gap in existing event literature, and provides the foundations for future research exploring event greenwashing...|$|R
40|$|Most {{developing}} {{countries of the}} world are experiencing large-scale migration from rural to urban areas. Many new migrants end up in low-cost or informal areas and slums with attendant environmental concerns. One dimension of improved urban sustainability is the provision of green spaces and trees. Whilst many countries have urban greening programmes for public spaces and streets, few have considered the status and potential contribution of trees from resident's own gardens. This paper reports firstly on the policy environment for urban forestry and greening in South Africa and secondly on the maintenance, use and appreciation of trees on private homesteads of residents of new and older low-income suburbs as well as informal housing areas from three small towns in South Africa. In particular we examine if the most recent centrally planned and built low-income housing schemes (called RDP suburbs in South Africa) have considered and incorporated plans or spaces for urban greenery in peoples’ homesteads. We found that broad environmental and <b>sustainability</b> concerns and <b>statements</b> are common in urban development and housing policies, but specific guidelines for implementation are generally absent. More specifically, urban forestry and tree planting are rarely mentioned in the broader land use and environmental policies other than the national forest act and subsequent regulations, but even there it is relatively superficial. In the study towns the prevalence, density and number of species of trees was lowest in the new RDP suburbs relative to the township and informal areas. Consequently, the contribution of tree products to local livelihoods was also lower in the RDP areas. Yet there were no differences in the level of appreciation of the value and intangible benefits of trees between residents from the three different suburbs. This shows that the failure to plan for and accommodate trees in new low-cost housing developments is missing an opportunity to improve overall urban sustainability and liveability and constraining the potential flows of tangible and intangible benefits to urban residents. Making opportunities for such in older suburbs is challenging because of space limitations and cost implications of retrospective provisions, but incorporation into plans for new low-cost housing development should be possible...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand is {{a country}} rich in {{biodiversity}} and natural resources, steeped in Maori culture and indigenous values, that legislated for sustainable management under the Resource Management Act 1991. Despite the rhetoric of sustainable management, environmental law and governance in New Zealand continue to grapple with persistent challenges: · New Zealand is a significant contributor to global biodiversity but {{has one of the}} highest species extinction rates due to continued habitat loss and invasion by pest species. · While New Zealand has a plentiful supply of clean freshwater, water demand from agriculture and urban growth is increasing and water quality is getting worse with elevated nutrient levels in almost 50 % of rivers and aquifers. · Environmental management is devolved to local authorities that have largely been left in a policy vacuum in the absence of national policy statements or standards. · Political decision making by local authorities on policy statements and plans has been captured by property rights arguments and voluntary approaches to protecting biodiversity on private land, heritage and landscape have been prevalent. · Recognition of Maori interests in resource management, e. g. allocation of natural resources, has not been reflected in practice New strategies are however emerging for promoting environmental justice and using the law to advance <b>sustainability.</b> National policy <b>statements</b> are being gazetted in relation to freshwater management, indigenous biodiversity, and renewable energy. Regional rules have been prepared allowing nitrogen offsetting between properties to provide flexibility for landowners to meet the new regulatory requirements. Co-management of freshwater resources has been enacted to ensure Maori participation in environmental decision-making. Critical thinking has emphasized the role of sustainable management, as an ethical concept that, like justice, our law should seek to embrace, and that will require major structural reforms. My paper will explore the New Zealand experiment in legislating for sustainable management in its domestic, comparative and international context. It will likely conclude that while the current resource management reform programme provides an opportunity to lay some ghosts to rest, the history of ongoing legislative reform indicates that major structural reform is unlikely...|$|R
