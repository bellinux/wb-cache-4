40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} concept for an {{availability}} modeling tool called OpenSESAME (Simple but Extensive Structured Availability Modeling Environment). The tool accepts high level graphical descriptions {{of a given}} system and automatically converts them into Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets which in turn can then be quantitatively evaluated. The input diagrams allow a hierarchical view {{of the system and}} can take into account all aspects which may influence the over-all <b>system's</b> <b>availability.</b> These aspectes include a wide variety of inter-component dependencies. 1 Introduction When designing High <b>Availability</b> <b>Systems,</b> <b>availability</b> models can be used to quantitatively evaluate the <b>system's</b> <b>availability,</b> locate availability bottlenecks or superfluous redundancy and thus find an ideal tradeoff between dependability and costs. To obtain a realistic availability model of a complex system, inter-component dependencies have to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{consider}} a multistate monotone system of multistate components. Following a Bayesian approach, the ambition is {{to arrive at the}} posterior distributions of the <b>system</b> <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval based on both prior information and data on both the components and the system. We argue that a realistic approach is to start out by describing our uncertainty on the component availabilities and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval, based on both prior information and data on the components, by the moments up till order m of their marginal distributions. From these moments analytic bounds on the corresponding moments of the <b>system</b> <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval are arrived at. Applying these bounds and prior system information we may then fit prior distributions of the <b>system</b> <b>availabilities</b> and unavailabilities to the various levels in a fixed time interval. These can in turn be updated by relevant data on the system. This generalizes results given in (Natvig and Eide 1987) considering a binary monotone system of binary components at a fixed point of time. Furthermore, considering a simple network system, we show that the analytic bounds can be slightly improved by straightforward simulation techniques...|$|R

40|$|Treating {{the ship}} as an {{autonomous}} floating vehicle, onboard energy systems {{have to be}} designed to ensure high reliability {{for the safety of}} the ship per se and, also, of the passengers and crew under all operating conditions and emergencies at minimum cost. To date, these objectives have been achieved by strict safety regulations, design simplicity and component redundancies in safety-critical systems at the design stage. However, designing the systems with the current measures, the cost-ineffectiveness of the former approach would suffer. In addition, lack of strict regulations concerning environmental impact and also the relatively low vessel operation costs, lead to energy savings not being considered as driving force in the shipping industry. The recently introduced IMO regulations came into force to address the above objectives, imposing specific requirements during ship design and operation. This paper introduces a novel methodology for improving onboard <b>systems</b> <b>availability</b> and energy efficiency by logical and numerical modelling of the shipboard electrical energy systems during design and operation through the combined assessment of electrical power <b>systems</b> <b>availability</b> and quantitative performance. These, i. e. availability and performance, linked to initial and operating costs allow for multi-objective design optimisation of the electrical power systems...|$|R
