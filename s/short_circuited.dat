It was constantly necessary to remove this sand, as the addition of sea water would leave the conduits filled with wet sand which <b>short</b> <b>circuited</b> the supply. Another problem was that electrical resistance was greater than anticipated and the voltage in portions of the conduit was far less than that generated at Blundell Street – 230V dropped to 210V at the junction with the main line on the Promenade, 185V at Cocker Street and 168V at South Pier (then Victoria Pier).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper studies dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in the pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> conditions in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize different types of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurring in GMAW-P system. The behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> under the influence of different pulsing conditions is also investigated. Findings: It will be shown in the paper that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P occurs in different forms which can be categorized depending upon time of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and phase (peak or base time) of the pulse. Further investigation involves study of the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> with variation of different pulsing parameters. Research limitations/implications: The results show that by varying the pulse parameters, behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P is changed. The pulse parameters can be adjusted to avoid occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P. Future work should concentrate on development of practical indices in terms of pulse welding parameters for quantitative estimation of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence and avoidance. Originality/value: Determination of proper working parameters with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As short-circuiting is common between the welding electrode and the workpiece in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P will be useful. However, in case of aluminum hardly any attempt is made to analyse the dynamic behaviour of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> in GMAW-P.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} several {{methods of}} detecting occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> severity in pulse {{gas metal arc}} welding process (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify the occurrence of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and its severity in GMAW-P process. The investigation is based on the measurement of welding signals specifically current and voltage signals and their synchronization with high speed camera to investigate the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> phenomenon in GMAW-P process. Findings: The results reveal that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> can be detected using signal processing techniques and its severity can be predicted by using statistical models and artificial intelligence techniques in GMAW-P process. Research limitations/implications: Several factors are responsible for <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. The results show that voltage and current signal carry rich information about the metal transfer and especially <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. Hence it’s possible to detect <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> occurrence in GMAW-P process. Future work should concentrate on development of advance techniques to improve reliability of techniques mentioned in this paper for <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> detection and prediction in GMAW-P process. Originality/value: For achieving atomization of the welding processes, implementation of real time monitoring of weld quality is essential.

The LV side of the transformer is <b>short</b> <b>circuited.</b> Now with the help of variac applied voltage is slowly increased until the ammeter gives reading equal to the rated current of the HV side. After reaching at rated current of HV side, all three instruments reading (Voltmeter, Ammeter and Watt-meter readings) are recorded. The ammeter reading gives the primary equivalent of full load current IL. As the voltage applied for full load current in short circuit test on transformer is quite small compared to the rated primary voltage of the transformer, the iron losses in transformer can be taken as negligible here.|$|E
