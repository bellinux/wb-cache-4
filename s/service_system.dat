40|$|In cloud {{computing}} environments, {{one of the}} most important barriers to the adoption of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> is interoperability. Generally, in {{cloud computing}} environments at software as a service level, interoperability refers to the ability of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> on one cloud provider to communicate with software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> on another cloud provider. The current software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments have not been built with interoperability as a primary concern. Software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments are poorly developed to meet the interoperability challenges. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model. During the past few years, at software as a service level, various interoperability frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability between systems. The syntactic interoperability of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> have already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration has been given to semantic interoperability issues. Both syntactic and semantic interoperability are necessary prerequisites to achieve interoperability. Achieving semantic interoperability is a challenge within the world of software as a service in cloud computing environments. Therefore, a semantic interoperability framework for software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments is needed. In this thesis, we develop a semantic interoperability framework for software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments. For this purpose, we illustrate how current technologies, such as service oriented architecture, can represent an adequate foundation for implementing such framework. The capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for semantic interoperability between software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments will be studied and demonstrated. iv In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments, extensive experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. Overall, the effectiveness of semantic interoperability of software as a <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> in cloud computing environments with the proposed framework shows a significant improvement in comparison with the existing models and frameworks...|$|R

5|$|Civil service examinations: In the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the xiaolian {{system of}} {{recruiting}} government officials through formal recommendations {{was the chief}} method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an Imperial Academy to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment. However, {{it was not until}} the Sui Dynasty (581–618) that civil service examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the merchant class (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. The civil <b>service</b> <b>system</b> was implemented on a much larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser gentry families from throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} greater {{emphasis}} was laid upon the civil <b>service</b> <b>system</b> of recruiting officials; this {{was based upon}} degrees acquired through competitive examinations, {{in an effort to}} select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil <b>service</b> <b>system</b> became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This {{can be seen in the}} number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater meritocracy, social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of the nuclear family and considers only three paternal ascendants of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education. One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.|$|E

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>systems</b> are a {{main focus}} of service research; the {{advancement}} of Service Science relies on {{a thorough understanding of}} how <b>service</b> <b>systems</b> work. While the service research literature offers a range of theories to examine <b>service</b> <b>systems,</b> empirical evidence is still scarce. This paper reports a recent study into universities, which are among the most common yet probably the least understood <b>service</b> <b>systems.</b> More specifically, the nature of universities is explored from both external and internal perspectives. The external perspective considers the university as a single entity and analyzes its impacts on the city it resides in. It is found that universities have a significant contribution to localities as a source of employment, expenditure, knowledge and talent supply. Equally, universities rely heavily on the support of local communities. The internal perspective reveals the inner working of universities through case studies. A total of 12 functional domains are identified, including education, research, finance, buildings, utilities, among others, with each providing a wide range of services. A structured method is developed to improve service quality by analyzing value co-creation processes among different stakeholders, such as students, faculties and administrators.
