40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a method for}} quickly <b>selecting</b> a good <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> for an aircraft flying from its base to its mission objective when the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> must be over a geographic area containing hostile radar installations. Several models are developed in detail and then integrated permitting a shortest path algorithm {{to be used to}} find a route from a starting location to a goal that approximately minimizes probability of detection. Fuel, time and distance constraints are incorporated indirectly, but one strong assumption is made: Detections are assumed independent across network edges and among different radars. A test program is written in FORTRAN and run on a desktop PC using a battery of tests to validate the model. Problems designed with predictable paths having zero probability of detection are solved in a few hundred or thousand seconds for the predicted, optimal paths. Results on problems having non-zero probabilities of detection are less conclusive, but indicate that the method has promise. Errors due to computations and assumptions, as well as their bounds, are discussed, as are recommendations for further model development. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

Conflict detection and resolution is a critical capability for the realization of free flight, a new concept of air traffic management that allows pilots to <b>select</b> their own <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> and airspeeds in real time. A particularly demanding situation within this environment occurs when multiple traffic and weather conflicts arise simultaneously. A solution that forms the basis for this thesis is an agent based hierarchical system that attempts to provide optimal and conflict free <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> guidance in these multiple conflict situations. An intelligent executive guidance agent, acting as a high-level arbitrator, receives guidance information from a previously designed lower-level weather agent and a traffic detection and collision avoidance agent. When the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> guidance from the two-lower level agents conflicts, the executive agent arbitrates by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the conflicting guidance. It classifies them as either tactical or strategic in nature, and then prioritizes them according to a pre-defined rule base of conflict priorities. The arbitration function thus acts as a fuzzy controller, and gradually switches the guidance between the weather agent and traffic agent, providing conflict free <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> guidance, as the aircraft flies in and out of dangerous regions. Results of test cases presented in the thesis demonstrate that the approach and algorithm can successfully resolve combined weather and traffic conflicts in real-time, subject to realistic imposed constraints. The severity of conflicting <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> was managed within acceptable levels, and the ultimate recommended conflict free <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> is generally between those originally proposed by the weather and traffic agents. The algorithm does not exhibit any critical failures during cases tested, and proved robust and reliable. The proposed agent based hierarchical system, when integrated with a simplified flight management system coupled with a heading command and hold autopilot, offers an effective and reliable guidance and navigation system for generating safe, alternate <b>flight</b> <b>paths</b> in conflict situations...|$|R

Specifically, GAO reviews the (1) extent of the delay and congestion problems and the contribution of the ATC system to them, (2) progress and problems encountered in FAA's ATC modernization program, and (3) importance of a continued focus on delivering ATC equipment and on human capital issues as policymakers seek to address delays and congestion. GAO found that the national airspace system (NAS) is facing significant capacity problems. Last year, more than 25 percent of nationwide flights were canceled, delayed or diverted. These actions affected 163 million passengers who, on average, were delayed almost an hour. Inefficiencies in the ATC system contribute to the delays and congestion. Modernizing equipment, along with other changes in the ATC system, is expected to help increase the capacity of NAS between 5 and 15 percent. However, improvements from FAA's modernization program have fallen short so far. Although FAA has installed new equipment to provide the necessary platform for fielding modern technologies to improve efficiency, this effort has experienced cost, schedule, and performance problems. As part of this program, FAA has begun to deploy new technologies to achieve free flight, which will enable pilots and controllers to <b>select</b> optimal <b>flight</b> <b>paths,</b> thereby lowering costs and helping to accommodate more flights in the nation's airspace. To ensue that the modernization effort is successful, FAA must institute a performance-oriented culture, which is essential to establishing accountability and coordination throughout the agency.

40|$|Introduction: When {{deriving}} {{an objective}} assessment of piloting performance from flight data records, {{it is common}} to employ metrics which purely evaluate errors in <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> parameters. The adequacy of pilot performance is evaluated from the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> of the aircraft. However, in large jet transport aircraft these measures may be insensitive and require supplementing with frequency-based measures of control input parameters. Method: <b>Flight</b> <b>path</b> and control input data were collected from pilots undertaking a jet transport aircraft conversion course during a series of symmetric and asymmetric approaches in a flight simulator. The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> data were analyzed for deviations around the optimum <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> while flying an instrument landing approach. Manipulation of the flight controls was subject to analysis using a series of power spectral density measures. Results: The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> metrics showed no significant differences in performance between the symmetric and asymmetric approaches. However, control input frequency domain measures revealed that the pilots employed highly different control strategies in the pitch and yaw axes. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that to evaluate pilot performance fully in large aircraft, it is necessary to employ performance metrics targeted at both the outer control loop (<b>flight</b> <b>path)</b> and the inner control loop (flight control) parameters in parallel, evaluating both the product and process of a pilot's performance...|$|R
