5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early <b>self-help</b> <b>books,</b> that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

500|$|The {{communal}} {{understanding of}} redemption and human self-worth {{has changed since}} Newton's time. Since the 1970s, <b>self-help</b> <b>books,</b> psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome {{in order to achieve}} a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, [...] "grace" [...] and the meaning behind the words of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] have become as individual as the singer or listener. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins [...] "When we've been there ten thousand years"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. [...] "Grace", however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the power of God.|$|E
