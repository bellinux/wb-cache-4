50|$|The Baltic Exchange, in London, is the {{physical}} headquarters for tramp <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage.</b> The Baltic Exchange works like an organised market {{and provides a}} meeting place for ship owners, brokers and charterers.

A committee of owners, brokers and charterers are elected to manage the exchange to ensure everyone's interests are represented. With the speed of today's communications the floor of the Baltic Exchange is not nearly as populated as it once was, but the information and networking the exchange provides is still an asset to the tramp trade.|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{trends in}} the {{shipping}} industry have placed mid-sized dry bulk <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> firms in dire straits. For one thing, the market share is divided to a reduced number of <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> firms, in respect of mergers and acquisi-tions (M&A) and, for another thing, the considerable transparency due to the information flow has brought the antagonism a few quarters of a second away. Limited literature and studies exist in relation to this modern matter in the European shipping industry which this thesis makes an effort to cover with a qualitative study. In order for the investigation {{to have a more}} repre-sentative result, the investigation involves interviews of <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> firms that are situated in the UK, Greece, and Sweden. In addition, since the main trends and obstacles are related to M&A and considerable flow of informa-tion, the investigation has adopted an angle towards business intelligence and information technology as well as change management. The outcome of this thesis is several critical success factors that could be applied on the dry bulk <b>ship</b> <b>brokerage</b> sector. These critical success factors are related to Kotter’s change management theory and Kelly’s network economy theory together with Bullen & Rockart’s perspective...|$|E
