New procedures of text composition appeared—first photocomposition and then desktop publishing from digital sources—which were more rational than those using lead types.

Components can be ordered early at normal prices before the demand is revealed, or they can be replenished later at higher prices due to expediting. In addition, the customer pays a price for the final product that is nonincreasing in the delivery lead time to discourage late delivery.
