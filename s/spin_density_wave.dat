His early Fermiology studies using photoemission verified experimentally the Fermi surface nesting mechanism for the <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>wave</b> ground state of chromium and also contributed to our understanding of electronic instabilities in charge density wave materials and surface reconstructions. He also characterized the role of non-adiabatic damping of adsorbate vibrations and the spin-splitting of surface bands by the Rashba (spin-orbit) effect. More recently his interest in probing the microscopic-macroscopic connection has made him a leader in developing tools to study microscopic magnetic fluctuations using coherent soft x-ray beams. His current emphasis is to probe, on the scale of a few domains, intermittent dynamics and memory effects in field- and thermally driven magnetization reversal is highly regarded. Understanding the impact of newly discovered hidden symmetries on these cascades is important to our understanding of microscopic intermittency in a much broader context.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{the dynamics}} of a domain wall {{are affected by the}} presence of <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>waves</b> in a ferromagnetic wire. Domain walls and other scattering centres can cause coherent <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>waves</b> to propagate through a wire when a current is applied. In some cases the spin torque due to these scattered electrons can be enhanced such that it is {{on a par with the}} exchange and anisotropy energies controlling the shape and dynamics of the domain wall. In such a case we find that the <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>waves</b> enhance the current induced domain wall motion, allowing for domain wall motion with smaller current pulses. Here we consider a system involving two domain walls and focus on how the motion of the second domain wall is modified by the <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>waves</b> caused by the presence of the first domain wall.

40|$|Magnetic {{ordering}} of itinerant fermionic systems {{is at the}} forefront of condensed matter physics dating back to Stoner's instability. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which couples two essential ingredients of an itinerant fermionic system, namely spin and orbital motion, opens up new horizons to this long-standing problem. Here we report that the itinerant ferromagnetism is absent in 3 D Fermi gas with a Weyl SOC and various itinerant <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>waves</b> emerge instead, which is deeply rooted in the unique symmetry and spin-momentum locking effect in spin-orbit coupled systems.

We study the interplay between the electronic nematic order and a <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>wave</b> order in the presence of a magnetic field. We show that a cooperation of the nematicity and the magnetic field induces a finite coupling between the <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>wave</b> and spin-triplet staggered flux orders. As a consequence of such a coupling, the magnon gap decreases as the magnetic field increases, and it eventually condenses beyond a critical magnetic field leading to a field-induced <b>spin</b> <b>density</b> <b>wave</b> order.
