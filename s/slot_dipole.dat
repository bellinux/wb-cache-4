40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the design}} aspects and the {{measured}} {{results of a}} novel miniaturized planar antenna are described. Such architectural antenna design is of great importance in mobile military communications where low visibility and high mobility are required. Slot radiating elements, having a planar geometry and capable of transmitting vertical polarization when placed nearly horizontal, are appropriate for the applications at hand. Slot antennas also have another useful property, so far as impedance matching is concerned. Basically, <b>slot</b> <b>dipoles</b> can easily be excited by a microstrip line and can be matched to arbitrary line impedances simply by moving the feed point along the slot. Antenna miniaturization {{can be achieved by}} using a high permittivity or permeability substrate and superstrate materials and/or using an appropriate antenna topology. Here, we demonstrate miniaturization by designing an appropriate geometry for a resonant narrow slot antenna. A very efficient radiating element that occupies an area as small as H IP H H IP H is designed and tested. Simulation results, as well as the measured input impedance and radiation patterns of this antenna, are presented.
