The fixed amounts of flavoured solid foods and liquids used by the original TAMDI are replaced by the portion sizes established by JECFA to assess the SPET (JECFA, 2006 a; World Health Organisation, 2009). The SMK-TAMDI is calculated by summing the highest potential dietary exposure {{for each of the three}} food groups (“Beverages”, “Traditionally smoked food” and “Other solid foods not traditionally smoked”). SMK-EPIC, makes use of the information on the consumption of smoked foods available from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study This studiy carried is among the few cases in which the consumption levels of “smoked meat” were assessed and published (Linseisen et al., 2006). Moreover, the same study provides average consumption levels for the other products susceptible to be smoked, such as “dairy products” (Hjartaker et al., 2002) and “fish and fish products” (Welch et al., 2002). SMK-EPIC calculates the potential cumulative dietary exposure to smoke flavourings from all possible sources using the consumption data for the male population of Potsdam (Germany). Based on the EPIC data this population was used because it represents the most conservative among the presented European cases regarding the consumption of smoked meat, fish and cheese.

Two commercial liquid smoke flavourings (FA and FB) and two types of wood used for cold-smoking wood smoke generation (BS: Beech wood and OS: Oak wood) are investigated. Comparisons were made over a 45 day storage period. Control salmon samples (Cn) (i. e., samples that underwent no smoke treatment of any kind) were characterised by their low colour intensity, firmness, fat release and fibrousness and high adhesiveness, pH, TBARS and TMA values, and a strong amine odour.

5000|$|Large-scale {{cultivation}} of the chestnut tree {{was introduced in}} Corsica during the Genoese domination. Rich in calories, the fruits were plucked (without gloves) and dried, and placed on a wooden grating (a grata) above a fire (u fucone) for one month: this fire, placed on a dry clay base 1 m2 wide and 20 cm thick, smokes also the charcuterie and heats the house. After that, they are ground to produce chestnut flour, which gets an unmistakable <b>smoke</b> <b>flavour</b> from this process. The unplucked chestnuts are eaten by the pigs scratching around in the forest. These are additionally fed with chestnut flour, so that their meat acquires a characteristic taste. Used to prepare polenta (pulenta, pulenda) and cakes, this flour was the basic staple food for the Corsican. The importance of chestnut in Corsican life can be argued {{from the fact that}} during a traditional wedding lunch taking place in 19th century Castagniccia, not less than twenty-two different courses were prepared using chestnuts as main ingredient.Today chestnut flour is a French AOC and a European AOP, under the name [...] "Farine de châtaigne corse-Farina castagnina corsa". At the end of 20th century 85% (1,200 t) of the chestnuts plucked in Corsica were transformed in flour, a unique case among all the French departments.

A 104 -member onsumer panel {{was asked to}} rate its liking for 6 out of 10 prod- ucts in 3 conditions: tasting without information (blind B), infor- mation about meat origin without tasting (expected E), tasting with information (actual A). Odour was higher in FO products (P< 0. 05), whereas elasticity (P< 0. 001) and flavour (P< 0. 05) were perceived as more intense in MO. Storage time influenced fat colour, seasoned flavour and cohesiveness (P< 0. 001) that showed lower intensity with increasing time, whereas <b>smoked</b> <b>flavour,</b> chewiness, bitterness (P< 0. 001), saltiness (P< 0. 05) and rancid flavour (P< 0. 01) increased with storage time. PLS dis- criminant analysis, combining descriptive and consumer liking (explained variance: Factor 1 = 34 % and 57 % for X and Y, respec- tively; Factor 2 = 12 % and 35 % for X and Y, respectively), showed that liking {{was positively correlated with}} fat hue and fat diameter and negatively correlated with bitterness. In addition, PLS allowed to identify attributes more important in products differ- entiation such as meat and fat colour, brightness, fat diameter, seasoned flavour, chilli-odour, bitterness and elasticity.

Both expected liking scores (FO and MO) were higher then perceived liking expressed in blind conditions (P< 0. 001) and above the central point, due to a satis- factory consumer trust in legislation transparency in the case of FO and local processing methods in the case of MO. Expected liking scores were higher for FO than for MO (P< 0. 001). Two products were rated very pleasant with blind scores similar to expected ratings (no disconfirmation). Surprisingly, for all products MO information produced a contrast effect as a consequence of a negative disconfirmation, which means that actual liking moved in the direction opposite to the expectations.

40|$|Smoke derived taint in {{grapes and}} wine {{is an issue}} of {{increasing}} significance and severity for the wine industry internationally. On commencement of this research, insufficient knowledge existed as to the effects of smoke on grapevines and the development of smoke taint in wine, with no substantial published information. This research was undertaken to investigate the effect of smoke exposure to grapevines on the development of <b>smoke</b> aromas, <b>flavours</b> and compounds in final wines. As such, this study pioneers the purposeful application of smoke to grape bunches and field-grown grapevines to establish the direct link between smoke exposure and the development of smoke taint in wine. This research identified key periods of grapevine sensitivity to smoke uptake as: (1) from shoots 10 cm in length to full-bloom (low levels of smoke taint); (2) from berries pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels of smoke taint); and (3) from 7 days post veraison to harvest (high levels of smoke taint). A novel smoke application methodology consisting of a smoke generator and greenhouse-grade tent was developed to facilitate the accurate application of smoke treatments to field-grown grapevines. Smoke treatments were applied to grapevines at key stages during the seasonal growth cycle, on repeated occasions and at a range of densities and durations. Elevated concentrations of guaiacol, 4 -methylguaiacol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, 4 -ethylphenol, eugenol and furfural were detected, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, in wines made from fruit exposed to smoke; whereas these compounds were either not detected or detected in trace concentrations in wines produced from unsmoked (control) fruit. Wine sensory analysis established a difference between smoked and unsmoked wines, with smoked wines exhibiting ‘smoky’, ‘dirty’, ‘earthy’, ‘burnt’ and ‘smoked meat’ aromas. The density and duration of smoke exposure to grapevines was found to affect the chemical composition and sensory properties of wine and repeated smoke applications demonstrated a cumulative effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Waterpipe {{smoking is}} {{becoming}} popular among western students. The {{aim was to}} understand the appeal to students of this form of smoking when other forms of smoking are becoming less common. Methods Waterpipe smokers were identified by snowball sampling and interviewed following a semi-structured schedule in waterpipe cafes and in their homes. Constant comparative analysis was used to derive themes for the analysis. Results Waterpipe smokers saw smoking as an alternative to more expensive nights out in bars. The appeal was related to the communal activity and the novelty of the experience. Respondents had not thought deeply about the health risks and reasoned that if no warnings about waterpipe smoking were apparent (unlike cigarette smoking) then it was probably safe. These observations were reinforced by observations about the mildness of the <b>smoke,</b> the fruit <b>flavours,</b> and beliefs about the filtering of the water. Waterpipe smokers felt no pressure to stop smoking and therefore had not tried to do so, but felt it might be something they did not continue after university. Waterpipe smoking was not linked in students' minds to other forms of smoking except in one individual who was using waterpipe smoking to help quit cigarettes. Conclusion In the absence of public health information, students have fallen back on superficial experiences to form views that waterpipe smoking is less harmful than other forms of smoking and it is currently much more acceptable in student society than other forms of smoking. </p...|$|R
