5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation generally resolves {{when the}} underlying causes are treated, but <b>supportive</b> <b>measures</b> are often required. For instance, if the platelet count drops significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{antibiotics and}} may involve drainage of the buboes or abscesses by needle aspiration or incision. Further <b>supportive</b> <b>measure</b> {{may need to}} be taken: dilatation of the rectal stricture, repair of rectovaginal fistulae, or colostomy for rectal obstruction.|$|R
50|$|Bemegride (trademarked as Megimide) is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} and antidote for barbiturate poisoning as its chemoreceptor agonism increases mean tidal volume, thereby increasing respiration and the concentration of O2 in blood {{although it may be}} theoretically used as a <b>supportive</b> <b>measure</b> in treating any depressant overdose. The drug was first synthesized in 1911.|$|R
50|$|Besides prompt {{antibiotic}} treatment, <b>supportive</b> <b>measure</b> for organ failure (such as cardiac decompensation) {{are also}} important. Another consideration goes to hospital referral; although more severe pneumonia requires admission to an acute care facility, this also predisposes to hazards of hospitalization such as delirium, urinary incontinence, depression, falls, restraint use, functional decline, adverse drug effects and hospital infections. Therefore, mild pneumonia {{might be better}} dealt with inside the long term care facility. In patients with a limited life expectancy (for example, those with advanced dementia), end-of-life pneumonia also requires recognition and appropriate, palliative care.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} polio. The focus of modern {{treatment}} has been on providing relief of symptoms, speeding recovery and preventing complications. <b>Supportive</b> <b>measures</b> include antibiotics to prevent infections in weakened muscles, analgesics for pain, moderate exercise and a nutritious diet. Treatment of polio often requires long-term rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, braces, corrective shoes and, in some cases, orthopedic surgery.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. <b>Supportive</b> <b>measures</b> are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves <b>supportive</b> <b>measures</b> that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{options for}} such {{advanced}} diseases {{are limited to}} systemic chemotherapy, radiation, and <b>supportive</b> care <b>measures.</b> These may include management for shortness of breath due to recurrent, symptomatic malignant pleural effusions.|$|R
40|$|Noninvasive ventilation, {{specifically}} non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation orcontinuous positive airway pressure {{delivered by}} mask, {{has now become}} standard care {{for the management of}} a number of specific causes of acute respiratory failure. Noninvasive ventilation is a <b>supportive</b> <b>measure.</b> In respira-tory diseases, for example, it is an important adjunct to optimal medical care such as bron-chodilator therapy, corticosteroids and controlled oxygen therapy for chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD). The potential benefits of noninvasive ventila-tion for an acute exacerbation of COPD or for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema were recog-nized more than 75 years ago. 1 However, con-cerns about efficacy and safety have been suc...|$|R
40|$|Current {{literature}} was searched {{by using the}} MEDLINE database to find consistent evidence {{regarding the use of}} noninvasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. 18 studies demonstrating that noninvasive ventilation applied by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel-PAP) is safe, and that the two approaches have similar effects and are effective in preventing endotracheal intubation in patients with respiratory distress of cardiac origin, were found. The results support the concept that positive intrathoracic positive pressure must be seen as a nonpharmacological form of treatment of acute pulmonary edema rather than only a <b>supportive</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering <b>supportive</b> <b>measures,</b> giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E

25|$|In case of {{overdose}} or adverse reaction, {{the immediate}} intravenous administration of naloxone (Narcan) {{is a specific}} antidote. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors and other <b>supportive</b> <b>measures</b> should be used as indicated.|$|E
25|$|In overdose, {{the usual}} <b>supportive</b> <b>measures</b> are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or {{malignant}} hyperkalaemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis {{of the cell}} membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab).|$|E
25|$|<b>Supportive</b> <b>measures</b> include {{observation}} of vital signs, especially Glasgow Coma Scale and airway patency. IV access with fluid administration {{and maintenance of}} the airway with intubation and artificial ventilation may be required if respiratory depression or pulmonary aspiration occurs. <b>Supportive</b> <b>measures</b> should {{be put in place}} prior to administration of any benzodiazepine antagonist {{in order to protect the}} patient from both the withdrawal effects and possible complications arising from the benzodiazepine. A determination of possible deliberate overdose should be considered with appropriate scrutiny, and precautions taken to prevent any attempt by the patient to commit further bodily harm. Hypotension is corrected with fluid replacement, although catecholamines such as norepinephrine or dopamine may be required to increase blood pressure. Bradycardia is treated with atropine or an infusion of norepinephrine to increase coronary blood flow and heart rate.|$|E
40|$|Psychiatric {{treatment}} {{still remains}} a challenge. The hurdles in its treatment not only lie on pharmacological shortfalls (selection of appropriate drugs, their dosing and combating the adverse effects), {{but also the}} deep-rooted social 'taboo' related to it. The present article {{is an effort to}} search how spiritualism and religious themes could be adopted as an adjuvant to today's psychiatric management. The reason for such integration is that spiritualism and religious feelings are intimately linked with one's mind. The article tries to extract the influence of 'religion' and 'spiritual' practices in mental health through a review of the relevant studies available in electronic journal databases. Finally, the article proposes a 'biopsychosocial model' that can be implemented as a <b>supportive</b> <b>measure</b> with the present state of psychiatric practice.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} until recent times, the Estonian media policy has mainly been {{interpreted}} as an economic issue {{and it did not}} account for the strategic need to build a comprehensive media field to serve all groups in society. This has happened despite the fact the Estonian media policy is in line with the European Union (EU) media policy, which should ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and media pluralism. Findings of the Estonian case study show that despite these noble aims, Estonia has two radically different information fields: one for Estonian speaking audiences and one for Russian speakers. Events in Ukraine have added to the democratic media policy paradigm a question of national security. Now it is a challenge for the policy makers to unite polarised media fields and how to minimise the impact of Russian propaganda.

25|$|Copper alloy tubes can be {{supplied}} either {{with a bright}} metallic surface (CuNiO) or with a thin, firmly attached oxide layer (aluminium brass).

The protective oxide surface is best achieved when the system is operated for several weeks with clean, oxygen containing cooling water. While the protective layer forms, <b>supportive</b> <b>measures</b> can be carried out to enhance the process, such as the addition of iron sulfate or intermittent tube cleaning. The protective film that forms on Cu-Ni alloys in aerated seawater becomes mature in about three months at 60nbsp&°F and becomes increasingly protective with time.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} nutritional intervention {{and quality of life}} in oncology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrition related symptoms, such as anorexia and weight loss, reflect impaired nutritional status, which is often associated with reduced quality of life. Malnutrition can be related to reduced response or tolerance to cancer treatment. Early nutritional intervention may positively impact on quality of life and enhance clinical response in oncology patients. SUMMARY: Nutritional intervention should be considered as a <b>supportive</b> <b>measure</b> within the global oncology strategy. In curative oncology care, it contributes to reduced postoperative infection rate, better control of cancer-related symptoms, shortened length of hospital stay and improved tolerance to treatment. In palliative care, the nutritional intervention focuses on controlling symptoms, thus improving quality of life. The evaluation of nutritional status should include an assessment of quality of life in order to optimize nutritional treatment for patients' individual requirements. Because of the potentially clinically relevant impact of nutritional intervention on quality of life, nutritional care should be included in any antineoplastic strategy. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
