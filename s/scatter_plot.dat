2500|$|The {{following}} is a <b>scatter</b> <b>plot</b> of actual astronomical northward equinox moments as numerically integrated by SOLEX 11 using DE421 mode with extended (80-bit) floating point precision, high integration order (18th order), and forced solar mass loss ("forced" [...] means taken into account at all times). SOLEX can automatically search for northern hemisphere spring equinox moments by finding when the solar declination crosses the celestial equator northward, and then it outputs that data as the Terrestrial Time day and fraction of day relative to [...] at noon (J2000.0 epoch). The progressive tidal slowing of the Earth rotation rate was accounted for by subtracting ΔT as calculated by the Espenak-Meeus polynomial set recommended at the NASA Eclipses web site to obtain the J2000.0-relative Universal Time moments, which were then properly converted to Revised Julian dates and Jerusalem local apparent time, taking local apparent midnight {{as the beginning of}} each calendar day. The year range of the chart was limited to dates before the year 4400AD—by then ΔT is expected to accumulate to about six hours, with an uncertainty of less than [...] hours.|$|E

2500|$|A Q–Q plot is used {{to compare}} the shapes of distributions, {{providing}} a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. [...] Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions. [...] The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data {{can be viewed as a}} non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions. [...] A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret. [...] Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model. [...] This can provide an assessment of [...] "goodness of fit" [...] that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary. [...] Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other. [...] Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a <b>scatter</b> <b>plot,</b> or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal.|$|E

40|$|Charts are an {{excellent}} way to convey patterns and trends in data, but they do not facilitate further modeling of the data or close inspection of individual data points. We present a fully automated system for extracting the numerical values of data points from images of <b>scatter</b> <b>plots.</b> We use deep learning techniques to identify the key components of the chart, and optical character recognition together with robust regression to map from pixels to the coordinate system of the chart. We focus on <b>scatter</b> <b>plots</b> with linear scales, which already have several interesting challenges. Previous work has done fully automatic extraction for other types of charts, but to our knowledge this is the first approach that is fully automatic for <b>scatter</b> <b>plots.</b> Our method performs well, achieving successful data extraction on 89 % of the plots in our test set.

40|$|To {{detect the}} {{quantity}} theory of money, we follow Lucas (1980) {{by looking at}} <b>scatter</b> <b>plots</b> of filtered time series of inflation and money growth rates and interest rates and money growth rates. Like Whiteman (1984), we relate those <b>scatter</b> <b>plots</b> to sums of two-sided distributed lag coefficients constructed from fixed-coefficient and time-varying VARs for U. S. data from 1900 - 2005. We interpret outcomes in terms of population values of those sums of coefficients implied by two DSGE models. The DSGE models make the sums of coefficients depend on the monetary policy rule via cross-equation restrictions of a type that Lucas (1972) and Sargent (1971) emphasized {{in the context of}} testing the natural unemployment rate hypothesis. When the U. S. data are extended beyond Lucas’s 1955 - 1975 period, the <b>scatter</b> <b>plots</b> mutate in ways that we attribute to prevailing monetary policy rules...|$|R
