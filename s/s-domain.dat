40|$|Considering the {{biological}} importance of heparan sulfate (HS) and the significant activity of its highly-sulfated regions (<b>S-domains),</b> {{the paucity of}} known functions for the non-sulfated NA-domains is somewhat puzzling. It {{has been suggested that}} chain dynamics within the NA-domains are the key to their functional role in HS. In this study, we investigate this hypothesis using state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments at multiple frequencies. To resolve the problem of severe overlap in 1 H-NMR spectra of repetitive polysaccharides from proteoglycans, we have prepared oligosaccharides with the chemical structure of HS NA-domains containing the 15 N nucleus, which has enough chemical shift dispersion to probe the central residues of octasaccharides at atomic resolution using 600  MHz NMR. By performing NMR relaxation experiments at three magnetic-field strengths, high quality data on internal dynamics and rotational diffusion was obtained. Furthermore, translational diffusion could also be measured by NMR using pulse field gradients. These experimental data were used, in concert with molecular dynamics simulations, to provide information on local molecular shape, greatly aiding our relaxation analyses. Our results, which are more accurate than those presented previously, confirm the higher flexibility of the NA-domains as compared with reported data on <b>S-domains.</b> It is proposed that this flexibility has two functional roles. First, it confers a greater area of interaction from the anchoring point on the core protein for the bioactive <b>S-domains.</b> Secondly, it allows multiple interactions along the same HS chain that are dynamically independent of each other...|$|R

This paper discusses {{the development of an}} optimal state estimator for sensing inertial velocity using low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. A low-bandwidth gyroscope is used alone with two low-performance accelerometers to obtain the estimation. The gyroscope has its own limited dynamics and mainly contributes to the low-frequency components of the estimation. The accelerometers have inherent biases and mainly contribute to the high-frequency components of the estimation. Extensive experimental results show that the state estimator can achieve high-performance signals over a wide range of velocities without drifts in both the t- and <b>s-domains.</b> Furthermore, with applications in miniature inertially stabilized platforms, the control characteristic presents a significantly improvement over the existing methods. The method can be also applied to robotics, attitude estimation, and friction compensation...|$|R
40|$|Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the {{etiological}} {{agents of}} cervical cancer, and HPV- 16 {{is the most}} prevalent type. Several HPVs require heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) for cell binding. Here, we analyse the phenomenon that preincubation of HPV- 16 with increasing concentrations of heparin results in partial restoration rather than more efficient inhibition of infection. While corroborating that the HSPGs are cell-binding receptors for HPV- 16, heparin-preincubated virus bound to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via laminin- 332. Furthermore, the interaction of virions with heparin, {{a representative of the}} highly sulfated <b>S-domains</b> of heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs, allowed HPV- 16 infection in the absence of cell surface HSPGs. Therefore, we concluded that specific glycan moieties but not specific HSPG protein backbones are required for infection. The increased binding of an epitope-specific antibody to the viral capsid after heparin binding suggested that initial conformational changes in the HPV- 16 virion occur during infection by interaction with'heparin-like' domains of cellular HSPGs. We propose that HS sequences with specific sulfation patterns are required to facilitate HPV- 16 infection...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHeparan {{sulphate}} (HS) {{is essential}} for normal embryonic development. This requirement {{is due to the}} obligatory role for HS in the signalling pathways of many growth factors and morphogens that bind to sulphated domains in the HS polymer chain. The sulphation patterning of HS is determined by a complex interplay of Golgi-located N-and O-sulphotransferases that sulphate the heparan precursor and cell surface endosulphatases that selectively remove 6 -O-sulphates (6 S) from mature HS chains. In the present study we generated single or dual knock out mice for the two murine endosulphatases mSulf 1 and mSulf 2. Detailed structural analysis of HS from mSulf 1 -/-} fibroblasts showed a striking increase in 6 -O-sulphation, which was not seen in mSulf 2 -/-} HS. Intriguingly, the level of 6 -sulphation in the double mSulf 1 -/-}/ 2 -/-} HS was significantly higher than that in the mSulf 1 -/-} counterpart. These data imply that mSulf 1 and mSulf 2 are functionally cooperative. Unlike their avian orthologues, mammalian Sulf activities are not restricted to the highly sulphated <b>S-domains</b> of HS. Mitogenesis assays with FGF 2 revealed that Sulf activity dampens the activating potential of newly-synthesised HS suggesting an important role for these enzymes in cell growth regulation in embryonic and adult tissues...|$|R

50|$|Class I HMG-CoA reductases {{catalyse}} the NADP-dependent {{synthesis of}} mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). In vertebrates, membrane-bound HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids. In plants, mevalonate is the precursor of all isoprenoid compounds. The reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is regulated by feedback inhibition by sterols and non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate, including cholesterol. In archaea, HMG-CoA reductase is a cytoplasmic enzyme {{involved in the}} biosynthesis of the isoprenoids side chains of lipids. Class I HMG-CoA reductases consist of an N-terminal membrane domain (lacking in archaeal enzymes), and a C-terminal catalytic region. The catalytic region can be subdivided into three domains: an N-domain (N-terminal), a large L-domain, and a small <b>S-domain</b> (inserted within the L-domain).

40|$|We {{reported}} that supplementation of soluble heparan sulfate (HS) to the fluid regenerative neural environment could restore functional, axonal reconnection of the severed nerve with the target muscle (Eur J Neurosci 11 : 1914 - 26, 1999). The HS supplements used were from guinea-pig sciatic nerve and bovine kidney. Both showed similar efficacy in facilitating resumption of conduction velocity and re-myelination. We then {{asked if the}} composition of HS used as supplements differed from those recoverable from post-crush nerve homogenates. Unsaturated disaccharides resulting from digestions of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) extracts {{with a mixture of}} heparitinases I-III were therefore analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC. The HS supplements comprised non-sulfated [ΔHexA-GlcNAc], monosulfated [ΔHexA-GlcNSO 3, ΔHexA(2 S) -GlcNAc, ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6 S) ] and disulfated [ΔHexA-GlcNSO 3 (6 S) ] forms, among which the non-sulfated form was predominant. Both supernatant and pellet fractions of injured nerves similarly indicated predominance of ΔHexA-GlcNAc but these were far lower in amount than those introduced as supplement. Whereas the pellet fractions of crushed nerves indicated ΔHexA-GlcNSO 3 (6 S) that peaked at 14 days post-injury, no 6 -sulfated HS disaccharides were detectable in the supernatant fractions. The results suggest the importance of non-sulfated forms in stabilizing matrix organization and transient enrichment of 6 -sulfated forms of HS in fine-tuning the environment for growth factor-mediated cellular processes. Our HS supplements were therefore timely in providing the required <b>S-domains</b> of HS for tissue reorganization and axonal regrowth (Supported by RGC grant HKU 7249 / 97 M) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of the full angular dependence of the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in a thin film of epitaxial antiferromagnetic NiO, without any ferromagnetic element. The angular dependence of the magnetoresistance was measured in magnetic fields up to 11 T, using three orthogonal angular scans. We find that the total magnetoresistance has contributions arising both from SMR and ordinary magnetoresistance. Due to the particular NiO(001) orientation, and {{due to the fact}} that NiO(111) planes are easy-planes for the antiferromagnetic moment rotation, SMR is observable in all orthogonal planes. The onset of the SMR signal occurs between 1 and 3 T and no saturation is visible up to 11 T. The sign of the SMR is consistent with recent theoretical predictions and our results can be explained more quantitatively by a model considering the field-induced redistribution of <b>S-domains,</b> competing with the destressing energy arising from the interaction of the magnetostrictive NiO layer with the nonmagnetic MgO substrate. From the observed SMR ratio, we estimate the spin mixing conductance at the NiO/Pt interface to be greater than 1 × 10 ^ 14 Ω^- 1 m^- 2, comparable to early works on YIG/Pt systems. Our results highlight the presence of negative SMR in antiferromagnetic thin films, confirming the existence of efficient spin transport and suggesting the possibility of an electrical detection of the Néel vector in this class of materials, even for thin films relevant for applications. Moreover, we show that a careful subtraction of the ordinary magnetoresistance contribution is crucial to correctly estimate the size of the SMR...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) is a CXC {{chemokine}} that is constitutively {{expressed in}} most tissues and {{displayed on the}} cell surface in association with heparan sulfate (HS). Its numerous biological effects are mediated by a specific G protein-coupled receptor, CXCR 4. A number of cells inactivate SDF- 1 by specific processing of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine. In particular, CD 26 /dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), a serine protease that co-distributes with CXCR 4 at the cell surface, mediates the selective removal of the N-terminal dipeptide of SDF- 1. We report here that heparin and HS specifically prevent the processing of SDF- 1 by DPP IV expressed by Caco- 2 cells. The level of processing increases {{with the level of}} differentiation of these cells, which correlates with an increase of DPP IV activity. A mutant SDF- 1 that does not interact with HS is readily cleaved by DPP IV, a process that is not inhibited by HS, demonstrating that a productive interaction between HS and SDF- 1 is required for the protection to take place. Moreover, we found that protection depends on the degree of polymerization of the HS sulfated <b>S-domains.</b> Finally a structural model of SDF- 1, in complex with HS oligosaccharides of defined length, rationalizes the experimental data. The mechanisms by which HS regulates SDF- 1 may thus include, in addition to its ability to locally concentrate the chemokine at the cell surface, a control of selective protease cleavage events that directly affect the chemokine activity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHeparan sulfate (HS) is {{a complex}} {{polysaccharide}} that takes part in most major cellular processes, through its ability to bind and modulate a very large array of proteins. These interactions involve saccharide domains of specific sulfation pattern (<b>S-domains),</b> the assembly of which is tightly orchestrated by a highly regulated biosynthesis machinery. Another level of structural control does also {{take place at the}} cell surface, where degrading enzymes further modify HS post-synthetically. Amongst them are the Sulfs, a family of extracellular sulfatases (two isoforms in human) that catalyze the specific 6 -O-desulfation of HS. By targeting HS functional sulfated domains, Sulfs dramatically alter its ligand binding properties, thereby modulating a broad range of signaling pathways. Consequently, Sulfs play major roles during development, as well as in tissue homeostasis and repair. Sulfs have also been associated with many pathologies including cancer, but despite increasing interest, the role of Sulfs in tumor development still remains unclear. Studies have been hindered by a poor understanding of the Sulf enzymatic activities and conflicting data have shown either anti-oncogenic or tumor-promoting effects of these enzymes, depending on the tumor models analyzed. These opposite effects clearly illustrate the fine tuning of HS functions by the Sulfs, and the need to clarify the mechanisms involved. In this review, we will detail the present knowledge on the structural and functional properties of the Sulfs, with a special focus on their implication during tumor progression. Finally, we will discuss attempts and perspectives of using the Sulfs as a biomarker of cancer prognosis and diagnostic and as a target for anti-cancer therapies...|$|R
5000|$|HS enzymatic {{specificity}} of QSulf1 was first analyzed. QSulf1 enzymatic specificity on 6-O sulfates {{was linked to}} the trisulfated disaccharides (HexA,2SGlcNS,6S) in S domains of HS (HS regions where most of the GlcNS residues are in contiguous sequences) and not NA/NS domains (regions of alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated units; transition zones). Sulf1 and 2 null murine embryonic fibroblasts were generated to test the HS {{specificity of}} mammalian Sulf as opposed to avian Sulf (QSulf). Investigators found mSulf1−/−;mSulf2−/− HS showed overall large increases in all 6S disaccharides. Cooperativity between mSulf1/2 was found because a 2-fold increase in S-domain-associated disaccharides (UA-GlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)) was observed in double knock-out HS as compared with either single knock-out HS alone. [...] However, one difference from mSulf1 is that mSulf2−/− HS shows an increase in 6S almost exclusively within the non-sulfated and transition zones. [...] This sulfation effect on non-sulfated and transition zones is also different from QSulfs, which catalyze desulfation exclusively in <b>S-domains.</b> Although 6S changes were dominant, other small changes in NS and 2S sulfation do occur in the Sulf knock out MEFs, which may be a compensatory mechanism. Further biochemical studies elucidated specificity and localization of human Sulfs 1 and 2. Sulf1 and 2 hydrophilic domains associate with the cell membrane components through electrostatic interactions and not by integration with into the lipid bilayer. In addition to cell membrane association, Sulfs also secreted freely into the media, which contrasts the findings with QSulf1 and 2. Biochemical analysis of HSPGs in Sulf 1 and 2 knockout MEFS reveal enzyme specificities to disulfated and, primarily, trisulfated 6S disaccharide units UA-GlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) within the HS chain, with specific exclusion of monosulfated disaccharide units. [...] In vivo studies, however, demonstrate that loss of Sulf1 and Sulf2 result in sulfation changes of nonsubstrates (UA-GlcNAc(6S), N and 2-O Sulfate), indicating Sulf modulates HS biosynthetic machinery. This was further demonstrated by PCR analysis, showing dynamic changes in HS biosynthesis enzymes after Sulf1 and 2 loss. [...] Also, the authors showed in an MEF model system, that Sulf1 and Sulf2 definitively and differentially modify HS proteoglycan fractions including cell surface, GPI-anchored (glypican), shed, and ECM-associated proteoglycans.|$|R

Equilibrium folding of both S-domains is described by a minimal, three-state folding scheme, U-to-I-to-N.
