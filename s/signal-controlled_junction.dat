40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of applying the multi-period lane-based optimization method to the design of isolated <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions.</b> A site survey was conducted to collect the traffic demand data in three different time periods, capturing the morning peak, off peak and evening peak traffic conditions at one of the busiest junctions in Hong Kong. The details of the existing design parameters, including the lane markings and signal settings and the junction geometries, were also recorded. Junction performance in terms of reserve capacity and total delay is optimized by the multi-period lane-based model, and the results are compared to the existing situations. Significant improvements are observed if the resultant lane markings and signal settings of the multi-period lane-based model are adopted...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} reserve {{capacity}} {{has long been}} used as a useful measure of the operational performance of individual <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction.</b> For Hong Kong applications, this measure has also been incorporated in the Transport Planning and Design Manual for traffic engineers to deign a <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction.</b> Over the years, this concept has been widely extended in the area of traffic control, ranging from individual junction design to network analysis. This paper summarises the state-of-the- art development of the concept of reserve capacity in application to traffic control, namely, the stage-based <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction,</b> phase-based <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction,</b> priority junction, roundabout and signal-controlled network.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} describing an individual <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction</b> is set out. The description is highly flexible {{in terms of}} the kinds of design and signal operation it can represent and, when optimized using linear and convex programming techniques, provides detailed analysis of junction performance. The analysis and its relationship to the geometric layout are described. The techniques described are compared to other techniques of signal optimization and the use of existing software for junction design is discussed. The integration of this analysis with geometric design is discussed as well as software incorporating the analysis to aid engineers in the design of signal-controlled junctions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} reverse {{capacity}} of a whole junction has been used extensively {{in the design of}} <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions.</b> This concept, however, has not been applied to priority junctions and roundabouts, probably because of the complicated demand and supply relationship. When the demands on the approaches to the junction increase, the capacities of those non-priority approaches reduce at different rates. This makes the calculation of reserve capacity of the whole junction not a straightforward task. Using the definition of reserve {{capacity of a}} whole junction in Allsop (1972; Transpn Res. 6, 245 - 255), explicit formulae for the estimation of reserve capacities of priority junctions and roundabouts are derived in this paper. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of these formulae. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} properties of Gipps' car-following model. Certain properties of the model are investigated and the need of specific additions to the model is identified. Gipps' car-following model is rather important as it comprises the traffic model of several traffic simulation packages; and the analysis performed in this study determines the actual dynamics that govern model formulae. First, the relationships for the maximum acceleration and deceleration values the model produces are identified. Results indicate that model relationships are such that a vehicle could end up braking harder than its desired deceleration, hence a constraint has to be set. Furthermore, relationships between vehicle acceleration and speed are established. Second, further additions are proposed to allow the model simulate traffic at <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions.</b> These additions include providing a definition for a queueing vehicle and speed manipulation to achieve the calculated saturation flow of simulated junctions...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimal control}} {{performance}} of a single <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction</b> is investigated. Two existing methods for analysing this control problem are discussed. One of these, a combinatorial method, generates all possible control structures in terms of groupings of streams of traffic to have green together and {{the order in which}} right of way is granted. The other method allows an existing control structure to be optimised by convex programming techniques. Incompatibilities between these two approaches are illustrated and it is shown that they cannot be combined in a satisfactory manner. A new procedure is framed that allows a control structure generated by the combinatorial method to be optimised directly. This procedure is applied to an example junction to illustrate its use. ...|$|E

In particular, the movement characteristics of motorcycles and the way they interact with passenger cars were investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Motorcycle movement affects the movement {{of the rest of the}} traffic and this impact on the operational performance of the junction approach was depicted. First, the way motorcycles move at a <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction</b> approach was described. To achieve this, another type of traffic lane was introduced: the 'notional' lanes, which were defined as corridors between stationary or moving traffic in the marked lanes. Next the movement of passenger cars and motorcycles was represented through vehicle headways and passenger car units. The movement of passenger cars at an approach was analysed and the way this was affected by that of motorcycles was identified. Finally, the performance of the approach was estimated through the start lag and saturation. flow values, emphasising the impact of the movement of motorcycles at the junction...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the capacity implications of installing Advanced Stop Lines (ASLs) {{has been carried out}} by TRL Limited as part of a project entitled Cycling Facilities and Engineering, commissioned by the Charging and Local Transport Division of the Department for Transport. The study included a review of previous research into ASLs in the UK and in the Netherlands; an examination of the theoretical capacity implications of installing ASLs using OSCADY (Optimised Signal Capacity and Delay) the <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junction</b> modelling computer programme and saturation flow formulae; 'before' and 'after' video surveys of modified junctions at four sites in Guildford, Surrey, and questionnaires to examine the attitudes of cyclists. While cyclists generally thought that the ASLs were safer and easier to use than unadapted junctions, concerns were expressed that some drivers did not comply with the new layout. Changes in the length of time between green signals or a longer minimum green time may be required in some circumstances. At the two sites where the number of traffic lanes remained the same there was a slight increase in saturation flow, but at the two sites where a traffic lane was removed large reductions in saturation flow were observed. This report of the study concludes with several recommendations. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a multi-modal, elastic, equilibrium transportation {{model in}} which signal green-times and prices charged to traverse a route (public transport fares, parking charges or road-use charges) are explicitly included. An algorithm is specified which, for a fairly general objective function, continually moves current traffic flows, green-times and prices within the model toward locally optimal values while taking account of users' responses. The directions of movement of current traffic flows, green-times and prices are determined by solving linear approximations to the actual problem. The results of applying a simplified form of the algorithm to a small network model with five routes and two <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions</b> are given. It is proved that under realistic conditions the sequence of (traffic flows, green-times, prices) triples generated by the algorithm does indeed approach those triples which possess a reasonable local optimality property. However the optimal control problem discussed here is non-convex and just a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point is the "answer" sought. ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional design methods {{require the}} lane marking patterns, which are painted on ground showing road users the {{permissible}} turning directions on different approach lanes, as exogenous inputs {{to define the}} traffic stream grouping for analysis. This predefined grouping of traffic movements may restrict the design of signal timings in the optimisation procedures. More recently, a lane-based design method has been developed to relax the lane markings as binary-type control variables in a mathematical programming approach. The lane marking patterns and the signal timings can then be optimised simultaneously in a unified framework. This paper presents an extension work to further relax the numbers of approach lane in traffic arms as new integer variables which can then be optimised to give optimal lane arrangement in various arms of a junction to manage the given traffic demands more efficiently. All well-defined signal timings variables in the phase-based approach {{as well as the}} lane marking and lane flow variables in the lane-based approach together with their governing constraints are all preserved in the new formulation for the reserve capacity optimisation of isolated <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions.</b> Traffic signal control Signal timing optimisation Junction geometric design Lane-based optimisation Mixed-Integer-Programming...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a lane-based optimization method for minimizing delay at isolated <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions.</b> The method integrates {{the design of}} lane markings and signal settings, and considers both traffic and pedestrian movements in a unified framework. While the capacity maximization and cycle length minimization problems are formulated as Binary-Mix-Integer-Linear-Programs (BMILPs) that are solvable by standard branch-and-bound routines, the problem of delay minimization is formulated as a Binary-Mix-Integer-Non-Linear Program (BMINLP). A cutting plane algorithm and a heuristic line search algorithm are proposed to solve this difficult BMINLP problem. The integer variables include the permitted movements on traffic lanes and successor functions to govern the order of signal displays, whereas the continuous variables include the assigned lane flows, common flow multiplier, cycle length, and starts and durations of green for traffic movements, lanes and pedestrian crossings. A set of constraints is set up to ensure the feasibility and safety of the resultant optimized lane markings and signal settings. A numerical example is given to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methodology. The heuristic line search algorithm is more cost-effective in terms of both optimality of solution and computing time requirement...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a lane-based {{optimization}} {{method was}} developed {{for the design of}} isolated <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions.</b> The lane markings are relaxed as binary-type control variables and are integrated into the design framework, in which the lane markings and signal settings can be optimized simultaneously to maximize the overall junction performance. To take into account the time-varying effects of traffic demand, the lane-based optimization method has been enhanced to cater for multi-period demand patterns. To eliminate ambiguity, only a single set of lane markings (also referred to as the permitted movements) can be established on the ground for operation throughout all of the design periods, which implies that during various design periods road users that approach a junction will be guided by the same set of lane markings. In accordance with the specific traffic conditions in different design periods, road users can make their own choice of traffic lane for turning, provided that they do not violate the permitted movement patterns. In the present formulation, the actual lane utilization patterns are referred to as the effective movements. A set of linear constraints is developed to relate all of the lane-based control variables and to prescribe the feasible solution region. The optimization for the usual objective function is formulated as a mathematical program. Standard and heuristic solution methods are derived, and numerical examples are also given for demonstration...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{straightforward}} short term policies to mitigate urban traffic congestion is control through traffic lights at a single junction or network level. Existing approaches for single junction Signal Setting Design (SSD) can be grouped into two classes: Stage-based or Phase-based methods. Both these approaches take the lane marking layouts as exogenous inputs, but lane-based optimisation method {{may be found in}} literature, even though for isolated <b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions</b> only. The Network Signal Setting Design (NSSD) requires that offsets are introduced; a traffic flow model is also needed to compute total delay. All existing methods for NSSD follow a stage-based approach; these methods do not allow for stage matrix optimisation: it is shown that explicit enumeration of stage sequences is only practicable for very small networks. This paper focuses on Network Signal Setting Design introducing the so-called scheduled synchronisation that includes green scheduling, green timing and coordination into one optimisation problem. The paper proposes a stage-based method to solve such a problem, {{as an extension of the}} synchronisation method and the traffic flow model proposed in Cantarella et al. (2015) : first a set of candidate stages is defined for each junction, then the stage sequences, the stage lengths and the offsets are optimised all together. To the authors‚Äô knowledge, no other one-step optimisation method is available in literature for scheduled synchronisation. Results of the proposed method to a small network were compared with those from explicit enumeration of all stage sequences; results for a larger network are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{values of}} the dual {{variables}} in a constrained optimisation problem {{can be used to}} estimate the sensitivity of the optimal value of the objective function to changes in the constraints. Allsop (1972) used standard methods of linear programming to derive expressions for the sensitivity of the reserve capacity at a <b>signal-controlled</b> road <b>junction</b> to various changes in the traffic engineering constraints. That analysis used the assumption that the maximum reserve capacity would be achieved when the cycle time used is maximal. While this normally occurs, some junctions have come to light where a reduction in the cycle time increases the capacity. Allsop's analysis is extended here to account for this possibility. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} years, {{as regards the}} {{functional}} design of at-grade intersections, near to classic layouts (<b>signal-controlled</b> <b>junctions,</b> roundabouts, etc.) a new solution has born: the ‚Äúturbo-roundabout‚Äù. It is a canalized multilane oval intersection with a non-traversable or partially traversable center island and with a spiral circulatory carriageway. This kind of roundabout is also characterized by a predictable lane use: some direction flows are physically separated by curbs. Several roundabouts with spiraling circular carriageways were built in northern Europe (in particular in Netherlands) and they have further allowed to extend the notable advantages of this functional solution against multilane roundabouts, such as: 1) no lane changing on the circulatory carriageway; 2) no need to yield to traffic flow on more than two lanes; 3) low driving speed along the through movement because of raised lane dividers and, consequently, a high reduction of accident risk. In this paper a careful literature review on turbo-roundabouts is proposed. Furthermore, the Authors examine the potentialities offered by the transformation of an existing semi-two lanes roundabout into a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù configuration of a turbo-roundabout. In particular, they also evaluate and compare the performance parameters in the two configurations by using a microsimulation software. The case study roundabout {{is placed in the}} city of Cosenza (Southern Italy) and it is characterized by great problems of congestion during peak hours. Experimental measures of traffic flows (O/D matrixes), critical gaps, queue lengths and approaching and circulating speeds represent input data for calibration procedures. Afterwards, derived calibration parameters are used as input variables for the new configuration of the intersection as a turbo roundabout. The Authors highlight that the conversion of the existing roundabout into a virtual turbo roundabout determine an increase of capacity together with a minimization of the queue lengths...|$|R
40|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the benefits of}} bus priority schemes shows the importance of providing adequate capacity for all streams of traffic. The analysis of capacity at a <b>signal-controlled</b> road <b>junction</b> is extended to cases where stages may be truncated or omitted in some cycles. The problem of finding signal settings which, when implemented with priority, emulate some which are known to provide a given level of capacity when implemented without priority is considered. Two commonly used rules to give priority by selective vehicle detection are analysed in detail and a third is considered briefly to illustrate the flexibility of the methods used. The range of conditions under which these priority methods can be implemented without causing any loss of capacity is quantified. If an additional rule is implemented to prevent priority from being granted too frequently, then this range covers most practical operating conditions. In cases outside this range, consequent losses of capacity can be estimated. A numerical example based upon a real bus priority experiment is provided. ...|$|R
