2500|$|The Face Advantage allows {{information}} and memories to be recalled easier through {{the presentation of}} a person's face rather than a person's voice. Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar {{information and}} result in similar processes of memory recall. During face perception, there are three stages of memory recall that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall. The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces. [...] The stimuli are presented with a between-group design. The participants are asked to <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> face or voice is familiar. If the answer is yes, {{they are asked to}} recall semantic and episodic memories and finally the name of the face or voice. It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity's face to recall information than for those presented with a voice. The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled, information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived. [...] A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.|$|E
