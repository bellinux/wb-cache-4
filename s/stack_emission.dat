In addition to the generation of fine particles, a significant amount of aerosols have been identified in the <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> of FCCUs. To determine the source of these aerosols, samples of fresh and equilibrium (e-cat) type catalysts were heated up to 600 àand mixed with cold samples, simulating the thermal shock and particle fracture, which occurs inside an FCCU when catalyst is added. The thermal shock in the experiments produced fine particles and aerosols, which were captured on filters and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and atomic absorption tests. It was found that significant quantities of metal rich aerosols were generated by the thermal shock. This production of fine particles and aerosols is a new phenomenon that can help explain excessive catalyst emissions from operating FCCUs. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} a series of {{atmospheric}} radioxenon events detected at the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) International Monitoring System site in Melbourne, Australia, between November 2008 and February 2009 was investigated. Backward tracking analyses indicated that the events were consistent with releases associated with hot commission testing of the Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation (ANSTO) radiopharmaceutical production facility in Sydney, Australia. Forward dispersion analyses were used to estimate release magnitudes and transport times. The estimated 133 Xe release magnitude of the largest event (between 0. 2 and 34 TBq over a 2 d window), was in close agreement with the <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> releases estimated by the facility for this time period (between 0. 5 and 2 TBq).

40|$|By {{increasing}} the precipitator efficiency the stack emissions and operating costs can be reduced. During {{the operation of}} a precipitator different load and dust conditions need to be handled. In many applications fuel needs to be switched to lower sulfur contents leading to lower electrical conductivity of the dust. Often, precipitators are to be operated outside their design data. Due to {{the high cost of}} a mechanical precipitator extension, the preferred solution is upgrading the high voltage power supply to achieve the regulating authority’s required <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> limit. Large industrial precipitators with multiple fields can be operated with different types of high voltage supplies for optimum precipitator performance and operation. IGBT inverter based high voltage supplies used in the inlet fields can increase the average corona power significantly. Additionally, the fast flashover reaction helps to increase the average voltage even with high flashover rates. Thus the particle charging and the flashover frequency can be optimized, and particle collecting will be improved even in the following fields. Fine particles can be treated by short pulses generated by IGBT based technology in the outlet fields. Due to the networking features of the different types of hig...|$|E
30|$|A study {{conducted}} by Rozainee et al. [5] shows that the mean particulate concentration emitted from water-tube boilers equipped with and without particulate control equipment was 1.11 ± 0.58 g/Nm 3 and 1.93 ± 1.40 g/Nm 3, respectively, with {{only one of the}} boilers studied met the Department of Environment limits of 0.40 g/Nm 3 whilst others were still violating the standards. From another study by Rashid and Rozainee [6], {{it was found that the}} boilers, using palm waste as fuel at palm oil mills, are producing very much higher levels of dust emission of up to 11.6 g/Nm 3. According to De Kock and Yap [7], many dust collectors are installed without proper design and quality control procedures and many were simply copied from original suppliers. Dust collectors are often installed without verifying the performance during commissioning with only <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> measurements carried out. By gross estimation, dust generated from typical 25 tonnes/h boiler combustion is around 4.5 g/Nm 3. Nowadays, most of the palm oil mill boiler operations are equipped with multi-cyclones to filter out the dust generated. For 60 % of dust collection efficiency on average, it can be forecasted that the emission would be around 1.8 g/Nm 3 after the multi-cyclone, which create an estimated dust load of 450 tonnes/year.|$|E
40|$|This paper relates {{emissions}} from medical waste and other solid waste incinerators, their emission controls and modeled dispersion to environmental and health risk. State regulations for specific pollutants, {{which range from}} numerical <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> rates (unrelated to environmental impact) to those based essentially on environmental impact and health risk, are summarized. The nature and quantity of uncontrolled emissions, {{and the ability of}} available technologies to control them are summarized. Results of modeling analyses are presented for medical, industrial, sludge and municipal waste incinerators of various sizes and types, for various stack heights and site-specific configurations. Estimated ground level concentrations of HCl and Toxic Equivalent Dioxins resulting from modem medical waste incinerators using or not using various emission controls are compared with acceptable ambient concentrations based on health standards. The impact of low stack temperatures resulting from emission controls on dilution and dispersion factors is compared. Small as well as large incinerator systems are found to produce ground level concentrations which are below health standards by large safety factors. Detailed modeling, considering emission control and stack options can be used to find optimal configurations. The reduction of chlorine and metals-bearing materials in the waste may obviate the need for emission control devices...|$|E

40|$|The uptake of Waste-to-Energy (WtE) in India has {{not been}} {{successful}} {{and the majority of}} plants have failed to sustain operations. There is a lack of detailed on-the-ground research examining the causes of plant failures and the issues regarding the WtE supply chain. Thus, this study set out to identify how WtE practices in India can be improved by gathering and evaluating empirical evidence. Local government officers, industry practitioners and academics involved in waste management in India were consulted. Quantitative data were collected on three case study plants: an incinerator, a gasification plant and a plant co-firing waste with coal. The gathered information was evaluated by making a comparison with two European waste incinerators. The major problem with WtE in India has typically been perceived to be poor source segregation; however, the case study plants highlight that severe contamination has been occurring during transport and storage. In comparison to the European incinerators, the WtE plants in India had a low capital cost (around 1 – 2 million €/MW), but total particulate matter emissions were a hundred times higher, ranging from 65 to 75 mg/Nm 3. We conclude with recommendations for delivery contracts, financial incentives and regulations on dumpsites, ash disposal and <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> measurements...|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} control devices (APCDs) are not compul-sory for medical waste incinerators (MWIs) in developing countries. In South Africa, combustion gases are usually vented directly to the atmosphere at temperatures greater than the formation temperature of dioxin. The possibil-ity of dioxin formation outside the incinerator stack has been hypothesized. A plume model has been developed and tested in the wind tunnel with a scale model of an incinerator stack. The plume temperature and trajectory predictions of the plume model were verified within a ± 3 % experimental accuracy. Using South African data, the plume model predicts that the residence time of gases in the temperature range of 150 – 450 ºC in a plume is 1. 3 sec on average for 5 % of a year (18 days) at meteorological conditions resulting in wind speeds of less than 1 m/sec. Two published dioxin formation models were used to as-sess the probability of dioxin formation in the plume. The formation models predict that the average polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) formed in the plume will exceed the <b>stack</b> <b>emission</b> regulations in South Africa of 0. 2 ng/Nm 3 toxic equivalent quotient (TEQ) by between 2 and 40 times.
