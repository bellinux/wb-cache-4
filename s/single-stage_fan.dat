5|$|The CFM56-2 {{series is}} the {{original}} variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it {{is known as the}} F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor driven by a single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is annular.|$|E
25|$|This initial {{version of}} the CF6 has a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> with one core booster stage, driven by a 5-stage LP (low pressure) turbine, {{turbocharging}} a 16-stage HP (high pressure) axial compressor driven by a 2-stage HP turbine; the combustor is annular; separate exhaust nozzles are used for the fan and core airflows. The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300lb/s (590kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500lb (185.05kN).|$|E
500|$|The CFM56 {{features}} a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan,</b> and most variants have a three-stage booster on the low-pressure shaft, with four {{stages in the}} -5B and -5C variants. The booster is also commonly called the [...] "low-pressure compressor" [...] (LPC) as it sits on the low-pressure shaft and compresses the flow initially before it reaches the high-pressure compressor. The original CFM56-2 variant featured 44 tip-shrouded fan blades, {{although the number of}} fan blades was reduced in later variants as wide-chord blade technology developed, down to 22 blades in the latest variant, the CFM56-7.|$|E
40|$|Tradeoffs between {{aerodynamic}} and acoustic {{properties of}} various fan configurations {{led to the}} selection of a variety of fans that produce noise levels in the range of 100 to 120 PNdb. Fan configuration and design pressure ratio required for specific mission operations depend in part on the type of mission to be performed. Noise data obtained for <b>single-stage</b> low speed <b>fans,</b> <b>single-stage</b> high speed <b>fans,</b> and two-stage fan engines are presented in table form...|$|R
40|$|Drive-turbines {{for a given}} set of 20 -inch turbo-fan {{simulators}} are described. The simulators {{had both}} <b>single-stage</b> and two-stage <b>fans</b> that had design pressure ratios as low as 1. 25 and as high as 3. 0. The desired objective {{of the study was}} to be able to drive all of the <b>single-stage</b> <b>fans</b> with one core turbine and to drive all of the two-stage fans with this same core turbine in combination with a duct turbine. The core turbine is described. Included are the design operating conditions, design velocity diagram and a power-speed envelope determined by an off-design performance procedure. Also discussed is the adaption and scaling of an existing turbine design to this particular application...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made to evolve the turbine drive systems for 20 -inch {{turbofan}} engine simulators. The fan designs used in the simulators included single-stage and two-stage configurations that covered {{a wide range of}} rotative speed and power requirement. The objective assumed for the study was to evolve one core turbine design that could drive all of the <b>single-stage</b> <b>fans</b> and, when operated in combination with one duct turbine design, drive all of the two-stage fans. The duct turbine power output is then needed to determine the make-up power required of the core turbine over the range of two-stage fan operating conditions. The duct turbine design analysis is reported and includes the selection of the duct turbine velocity diagram, a description of the blade design, and a determination of its off-design performance. Adjustable stators were found to be quite advantageous to the duct turbine off-design operation. The use of adjustable stators enabled the duct turbine to accommodate fan mass flow at all operating points and caused the duct turbine power output to increase as the total power requirement increased. This in turn resulted in a core turbine make-up power requirement that was not significantly greater than that required for driving the <b>single-stage</b> <b>fans...</b>|$|R

50|$|A new LP spool, {{comprising}} a 58-inch-diameter <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan,</b> with two-stage LP compressor {{driven by}} a three-stage LP turbine, is incorporated into the BR715. The HP spool {{is similar to that}} of the BR710.|$|E

This fan was designed to deliver a bypass pressure ratio of 1. 50 with an adiabatic efficiency of 86. 5 % at a total fan flow of 950 lb/sec. It was tested with and without inlet flow distortion. A bypass total-pressure ratio of 1. 52 and an adiabatic efficiency of 88. 3 % at a total fan flow of 962 lb/sec were actually achieved. An operating margin of 12. 4 % was demonstrated at design speed...|$|R

The fan was designed to deliver a bypass pressure ratio of 1. 50 with an adiabatic efficiency of 87. 0 % at a total fan flow of 950 lb/sec (430. 9 kg/sec). It was tested with and without inlet distortion. A bypass total pressure ratio of 1. 52 and an adiabatic efficiency of 86. 9 % at a total fan flow of 966 lb/sec (438. 2 kg/sec) were actually achieved. An operating margin of 19. 5 % was demonstrated at design speed...|$|R
50|$|Transatlantic service {{needed a}} higher thrust {{version of the}} {{existing}} turbojet and a demonstrator engine with a <b>single-stage</b> front <b>fan</b> attached to the compressor was run. It was difficult to start and operate. This experience led to the aft-fan which didn't compromise {{the operation of the}} gas generator.|$|R
5000|$|Pratt & Whitney first {{attempted}} {{to build a}} geared turbofan starting around 1998, with the PW8000. This essentially was an upgrade of the existing PW6000 that replaced the fan section with a gearing system and new <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan.</b> [...] After several years of development the PW8000 essentially disappeared.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{afterwards}} the ATFI project appeared, using a PW308 core {{but with}} a new gearbox and a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan.</b> It had its first run on March 16, 2001. This led to the Geared Turbofan (GTF) program, which was based around a newly designed core jointly developed with German MTU Aero Engines.|$|E
5000|$|The engine has a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> with 29 {{titanium}} {{blades and}} a Kevlar outer shell, which {{is driven by}} a three-stage turbine. The six-stage low pressure compressor with titanium blades is driven by a single-stage non-cooled low pressure turbine. The seven-stage high-pressure compressor with steel blades is driven by a steel bladed high-pressure turbine.|$|E
50|$|The DV-2 is a two-spool modular {{aviation}} {{turbofan engine}} with a <b>single-stage</b> overhung <b>fan,</b> two-stage LP compressor, seven-stage HP compressor, single-stage HP turbine, and two-stage LP turbine, and an annular combustion system. Maximum power at T-O is 21.58 kN {{with a specific}} fuel consumption of 60 kg/(kN h) (0.593 (lb/lbf h)), at Maximum Rating, Sea Level Static, ISA.|$|R
40|$|The overall aero and {{acoustic}} {{design features}} of eight 6 -foot-diameter, <b>single-stage</b> <b>fans</b> tested in an outdoor acoustic facility are described. A correlation of the acoustic results for subsonic tip-speed fans showed the total sound {{power to be}} proportional to the mechanical power imparted to the fan and the specific work performed on the air to within plus or minus 2 dB. The correlation was relatively insensitive to fan design variables over {{a broad range of}} operating conditions. Maximum perceived noise levels were generally proportional to the sound power levels with both noise levels exhibiting a relatively unique increase with fan pressure ratio when normalized by the delivered thrust. The spectra of broadband noise attributed to the fan exhibited a bimodal characteristic for most of the fans. A predominant mode centered near the blade-passage tone and another at 8 to 16 times the tone frequency...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{studying}} {{the transition of}} annular lift fan aircraft through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The oscillations of lift and drag, the optimization for the figure of merit, and the characteristics of drag, yawing, rolling and pitching moments in transition are studied. The results show that a two-stage upper and lower fan lift system can generate oscillations of lift and drag in transition, while a single-stage inner and outer fan lift system can eliminate the oscillations. The characteristics of momentum drag of the <b>single-stage</b> <b>fans</b> in transition are {{similar to that of}} the two-stage fans, but with the peak of drag lowered from 0. 63 to 0. 4 of the aircraft weight. The strategy to start transition from a negative angle of attack − 21 ° further reduces the peak of drag to 0. 29 of the weight. The strategy also reduces the peak of pitching torque, which needs upward extra thrusts of 0. 39 of the weight to eliminate. The peak of rolling moment in transition needs differential upward thrusts of 0. 04 of the weight to eliminate. The requirements for extra thrusts in transition lead to a total thrust–weight ratio of 0. 7, which makes the aircraft more efficient for high speed cruise flight (higher than 0. 7 Ma) ...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{configuration}} of the PW300 is as follows: <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan,</b> driven by a three-stage low pressure turbine, supercharging a four-stage axial/single-stage centrifugal high-pressure compressor, driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine.

The engine featured a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan,</b> a three-stage low-pressure compressor and an eleven-stage high-pressure compressor coupled to a two-stage high-pressure turbine and four-stage low-pressure turbine. The JT9D-3, the earliest certified {{version of the}} engine, weighed 8608 lb and produced [...] thrust. The original cost of the engine was $800,000 in 1968 ($5.6 million adjusted to 2017).

40|$|A <b>single-stage</b> axial <b>fan</b> {{was built}} and {{tested in the}} shop of the propeller-research tunnel of the NACA. The fan {{comprised}} a simple 24 -blade rotor having a diameter of 21 inches and a solidity of 0. 86 {{and a set of}} 37 contravanes having a solidity of 1. 33. The rotor was driven by a 25 -horsepower motor capable of rotating at a speed of 3600 r. p. m. The fan was tested for volume, pressure, and efficiency over a range of delivery pressures and volumes {{for a wide range of}} contravane and blade-angle settings. The test results are presented in chart form in terms of nondimensional units in order that similar fans may be accurately designed with a minimum effort. The maximum efficiency (88 percent) was obtained by the fan at a blade angle of 30 degrees and a contravane angle of 70 degrees. An efficiency of 80 percent was obtained by the fan with the contravanes removed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceReaching the mid/long-term air {{transport}} emission reduction goals imposed by both European and American standards impose increasing the propulsive systems’ adaptability to various operating conditions, {{in order to}} maximize the aircraft overall efficiency all along the flight mission. This implies the enlargement of the design space of propulsive systems such that it can even be operated equally as a compressor or turbine, which leads to rethink the paradigm of designing turbomachines. The continuity in the definition and characterization of different types of turbomachines should be restored which is proposed through this contribution. Analytical relationships allowing to switch between compressor map, propeller map and map are developed. To minimize the inputs of the maps’ conversion relations, a methodology to extract mean flow features from any characterization map is presented, namely the rotor outlet relative flow angle and mean streamline radius. The application of the characterization maps’ conversion relations ona turbofan’s <b>single-stage</b> axial <b>fan</b> and on a propeller allowed their validation through the physical coherence of the results. The flow features extraction methodology also showed very satisfying results with comparison to experiments. Eventually, the ability of the formalism as a powerful performance analysis tool for all kind of turbomachines is stressed out, which makes it the best candidate for the unified treatment of turbomachines...|$|R
40|$|Throughflow methods still {{represent}} a key tool for turbomachinery designers. In this work, a novel CFD-based throughflow method is proposed and demonstrated for realistic industrial applications: a <b>single-stage</b> axial <b>fan,</b> where {{the performance of}} the method is thoroughly discussed, and a multistage low pressure steam turbine which demonstrates the potential of the code also for transonic flows in a fully three-dimensional configuration. The key feature of the proposed method is that the impermeability condition in bladed regions is prescribed by exploiting some concepts used in immersed boundary methods. The resulting algebraic force model circumvents the introduction of an additional constraint equation in bladed regions, resulting in a highly simplified implementation into an existing CFD code. To account for the effect of aerodynamic losses, further source terms proportional to the local entropy gradient are introduced. To estimate the losses and deviation angles, a number of correlations have been implemented into the code. The code can deal with highly non-ideal flows governed by very accurate (though complex) equations of state, as required for the simulation of low pressure and supercritical steam turbines and, more generally, for turbomachinery operating with dense gases as working fluids. The throughflow solver is coupled with a fully automated blade modeler and grid generator, which can be used to design the geometry of the meridional channel and of the blades and for the generation of triangular as well as quadrilateral meshes of the entire bladed meridional domain...|$|R
50|$|This {{engine is}} a dual rotor, axial flow, high bypass ratio turbofan. The 10-stage {{high-pressure}} compressor is driven clockwise (Aft Looking Forward) by a 2-stage high-pressure turbine. The <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> and 4-stage low-pressure compressor are driven counterclockwise (Aft Looking Forward) by a 7-stage low-pressure turbine. The {{engine control system}} includes a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), which has an aircraft connection for digital communication. An engine monitoring unit (EMU) provides vibration level signals to the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|At high overall {{pressure}} ratios, {{the compression}} system is usually {{split into two}} units; a low-pressure (LP) compressor mounted on one shaft followed by a high-pressure (HP) compressor mounted on the HP shaft and driven by its own (HP) turbine. On civil turbofans, {{the first stage of}} the LP compressor is often a <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan.</b> If the HP compressor pressure ratio exceeds about 4.5:1, then the unit will probably have variable geometry (i.e. variable stators) on the first few stages, to make the surge line on the compressor map more shallow, to accommodate the shallow working line.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of fully three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques, axisymmetric flow models still represent a key tool in turbomachinery design. In this paper, a novel method for the numerical solution of axisymmetric flow models for turbomachinery is presented and demonstrated for two cases, both relevant for the industrial perspective. The key feature of the proposed method is that the flow tangency condition to the blade mean line is enforced with a penalty term, which can also be interpreted as an immersed boundary technique. Differently from the techniques commonly applied for the solution of this kind of flows, the proposed method does not require additional constraint equations to be solved in bladed regions and is therefore very simple to be implemented into existing axisymmetric CFD codes. The techniques employed to deal with flows of high incidence angle (misalignments between the actual flow and the direction imposed by the blade) and to account for the aerodynamic losses and the blade blockage are also thoroughly discussed. The method has been implemented {{as an extension of the}} zFlow code for the numerical solution of the Euler equations in cylindrical coordinates, which is based on an hybrid finite element/finite volume space approximation, an implicit time integration scheme, and can deal with fluids of arbitrarily complex equations of state. The details of the numerical method are fully described in the paper. The performance of the developed code is demonstrated by the results obtained in the simulation of a <b>single-stage</b> axial <b>fan,</b> compared against a fully three-dimensional CFD simulation. The potentialities for more complex transonic flow conditions are finally demonstrated by the calculation of a double-stage low pressure steam turbine...|$|R
40|$|Tunnel {{ventilation}} fans, classically, {{must have}} the ability to both supply and extract air from a tunnel system, with the operator's choice dependent on the tunnel ventilation system's operating mode most appropriate at any given point in time. Consequently, tunnel ventilation fans must incorporate a reversible aerodynamic design which limits the maximum fan pressure rise. This paper presents three high pressure reversible fan concepts. These comprise a two-stage counter rotating <b>fan,</b> a <b>single-stage</b> high speed <b>fan,</b> and a two-stage fan with a single motor and impeller on each end of the motor shaft. The authors consider the relative merits of each concept. The third concept offers the most compact fan, transform, silencer, and damper package size. The authors discuss the mechanical design challenges that occur with a two-stage fan with a single motor and impeller on each end of the motor shaft. They present and consider a selected motor bearing arrangement and casing design for maintainability. Finally, the authors present both prototype fan and full-scale package aerodynamic and acoustic performance, before discussing the challenges presented by high temperature certification in accordance with the requirements of EN 12101 - 3 : 2012...|$|R

The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300 lb/s (590 kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500 lb (185.05 kN).|$|E
50|$|Pratt & Whitney {{designed}} the engine with minimum complexity to significantly reduce maintenance cost and achieve weight and fuel consumption savings. However, tests {{revealed that the}} initial five-stage high compressor based design did not meet promised fuel burn performance. As a result, many of the original customers switched their orders to the rival CFM International CFM56-5. To address the problem, Pratt & Whitney re-certified an updated design utilizing a six-stage high compressor designed by MTU Aero Engines {{in order to achieve}} promised performance. The German company manufactures the high-pressure compressor and the low-pressure turbine. The HP compressor is driven by a single-stage turbine.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} single-stage and a low-speed two-stage fan were designed, fabricated {{and tested}} {{to demonstrate their}} predicted low noise performance for an advanced 0. 85 - 0. 90 cruise Mach number aircraft requiring a 1. 8 - 1. 9 pressure ratio fan. Acoustic tests were made with both unsuppressed and suppressed configurations. The two-stage fan demonstrated that quiet fan technology developed for low-speed <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> is applicable to two-stage designs. The unsuppressed two-stage fan was 3 - 5 dB quieter than the high-speed <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> {{at the same pressure}} ratio. The unsuppressed high-speed <b>single-stage</b> <b>fan</b> demonstrated that significant reductions in inlet noise can be achieved from the sonic blockage caused by supersonic flow in the rotor blading. Both fans demonstrated suppressed inlet noise levels with treated sonic inlets that met advanced technology goals. Suppressed aft noise levels did not meet expectations for either fan. The aft noise problem is attributed to both excessive source noise and ineffective treatment performance...|$|E
