5000|$|According to University of Iceland economists Davíd F. Björnsson and Gylfi Zoega, [...] "The {{policies}} of the colonial masters in Copenhagen delayed urbanisation. The Danish king maintained a monopoly in trade with Iceland from 1602 until 1855, which made the price of fish artificially low - the price of fish was higher in Britain - and artificially raised the price of agricultural products. Instead, Denmark bought the fish caught from Iceland at below world market prices. Although the trade monopoly ended in 1787, Icelanders could not trade freely with other countries until 1855. Following trade liberalisation, there was {{a substantial increase in}} fish exports to Britain, which led to {{an increase in the number}} of sailing ships, introduced for the first time in 1780. The growth of the fishing industry then created demand for capital, and in 1885 Parliament created the first state bank (Landsbanki). In 1905 came the first motorised fishing vessel, which marked an important step in the development of a <b>specialised</b> <b>fishing</b> industry in Iceland. Iceland exported fresh fish to Britain and salted cod to southern Europe, with Portugal an important export market. Fishing replaced agriculture as the country’s main industry. These developments set the stage for the urbanisation that was to follow in the twentieth century." ...|$|E

50|$|Fish {{locomotion}} is {{the variety}} of types of animal locomotion used by fish, principally by swimming. This however is achieved in different groups of fish {{by a variety of}} mechanisms of propulsion in water, most often by wavelike movements of the fish's body and tail, and in various <b>specialised</b> <b>fish</b> by movements of the fins. The major forms of locomotion in fish are anguilliform, in which a wave passes evenly along a long slender body; sub-carangiform, in which the wave increases quickly in amplitude towards the tail; carangiform, in which the wave is concentrated near the tail, which oscillates rapidly; thunniform, rapid swimming with a large powerful crescent-shaped tail; and ostraciiform, with almost no oscillation except of the tail fin. More <b>specialised</b> <b>fish</b> include movement by pectoral fins with a mainly stiff body, as in the sunfish; and movement by propagating a wave along the long fins with a motionless body in fish with electric organs such as the knifefish.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of specialized and commercial fishing {{activity in the}} island archipelago of Lofoten and Vestera°len in northern Norway is a critical foundation from which to understand the subsequent spread of commercial fishing across the north Atlantic region during the medieval and early modern period. One little understood aspect of this development {{is the relationship between}} medieval commercial fishing stations (fiskevaer) and earlier fishing activity. In this article, cultural sediment deposits at Langenesværet, Vestera°len, Northern Norway provide an opportunity to examine this relationship and its implications for current historical models of fishing development in northern Norway and the north Atlantic region. Conventional and AMS radiocarbon dating techniques are used to establish a chronology for the deposits, while activities associated with the sediments are characterized using thin-section micromorphology supported by proton induced X-ray emission spectrometry (PIXE). The results suggest that the site commenced formation as early as ca. 3000 B. C. and that the site was first used for specialized fishing activity from the early centuries A. D. The medieval commercial fiskevaer settlement at Langenesværet was introduced to an area that had a longstanding tradition of <b>specialised</b> <b>fishing</b> activity...|$|E

50|$|The {{result of}} this process is that ice (in its most common form) floats on liquid water, which is an {{important}} feature in Earth's biosphere. It has been argued that without this property, natural bodies of water would freeze, in some cases permanently, from the bottom up, resulting in a loss of bottom-dependent animal and plant life in fresh and sea water. Sufficiently thin ice sheets allow light to pass through while protecting the underside from short-term weather extremes such as wind chill. This creates a sheltered environment for bacterial and algal colonies. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain sympagic organisms such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and <b>specialised</b> <b>fish</b> like the bald notothen, fed upon in turn by larger animals such as emperor penguins and minke whales.|$|R

40|$|The rich {{diversity}} of coral reef organisms is supported, {{at least in}} part, by the {{diversity of}} coral reef habitat. Some of the most habitat <b>specialised</b> <b>fishes</b> on coral reefs are obligate coral-dwelling gobies of the genus Gobiodon that inhabit a range of coral species, mostly of the genus Acropora. However, the role of this specialised pattern of habitat use {{in the evolution of}} coral-dwelling gobies is not well understood. Diversification of coral-dwelling gobies may be driven by the diversification of their host corals (cospeciation), or alternatively, diversification of these fishes may have occurred independently of the diversification of host corals. The cospeciation hypothesis assumes similar timing in evolution of the gobies and their host corals. We used four genes for each group and the available fossil records to reconstruct and date phylogenies for 20 species of Gobiodon from the Indo-Pacific and the Red Sea, and for 28 species of the coral genus Acropora. Our results indicate that Gobiodon diversified mostly in the last ~ 5 My, whereas Acropora corals have consistently diversified since the Eocene, making the hypothesis of cospeciation untenable. The fully resolved molecular phylogeny of the genus Gobiodon is in part at odds with previous analyses incorporating morphological data and indicates that some morphological traits form paraphyletic clades within Gobiodon. Our phylogeny supports a hypothesis in which Gobiodon diversified in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and then radiated recently, with multiple new variants found in the Red Sea...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the western}} Indian Ocean {{suffered}} widespread loss of live coral in 1998 and interest is now focussed on the indirect effects of this coral loss on other components of the ecosystem, in particular fishes. However, {{it is just as}} important to identify changes in fish assemblages at locations that did not suffer coral mortality to understand local versus regional drivers. We surveyed benthic and fish communities on a reef flat in Mauritius five times between 1994 and 2005. The design allowed for comparison through time, along the coast and between inshore and offshore reef locations. The benthic community demonstrates a clear trend along the coast, likely in response to a dredged water ski lane, but little change through time. Branching Acropora colonies dominate much of the live coral and best explain patterns in the fish assemblage (P < 0. 01). Few changes in overall fish species richness through time were identified, and observed changes were within fishery target families rather than species reliant on live coral. Departure from expected levels of taxonomic distinctness suggests degradation in the community associated with the dredged ski lane. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling of the fish assemblage demonstrates a similar pattern to that seen in the benthos; greater differences along the coast (Global R = 0. 34) than through time (Global R = 0. 17) and no trend between reef positions. SIMPER analysis identified two species of Stegastes as the main drivers of trends in the MDS plot and the most dominant of these, S. lividus, appears to be reducing species richness of the remaining fish community. The study highlights Mauritius as a regional refugia of thermally-sensitive corals and <b>specialised</b> <b>fish,</b> suggesting a need for careful management. ...|$|R
40|$|Coral-dwelling fishes {{from the}} genus Gobiodon {{are some of}} the most habitat <b>specialised</b> <b>fishes</b> on coral reefs. Consequently, we might expect that their {{population}} dynamics will be closely associated with the abundance of host corals. I used a combination of log-linear modelling and resource selection ratios to examine patterns of habitat use among eight species of Gobiodon in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. I then used multiple regression analysis to investigate relationships between the abundance of each species of Gobiodon and the abundance of the corals they inhabited. Each species of Gobiodon used one or more species of coral more frequently than expected by chance. The pattern of habitat use exhibited by each species of Gobiodon did not vary among reef zones or among reefs with different exposures to prevailing winds, despite changes in the relative abundances of corals among reef zones. This consistency in habitat use might be expected if the coral species inhabited confer considerable fitness advantages and, therefore, are strongly preferred. For most species of Gobiodon, abundances among reef zones and exposure regimes were correlated with the abundance of the coral species usually inhabited. Therefore, it appears that habitat availability helps determine abundances of most species of Gobiodon in Kimbe Bay. In addition to correlations with habitat availability, the abundances of G. histrio, G. quinquestrigatus, G. rivulatus (dark form) and the group lsquoothersrsquo were also associated with particular reef zones and exposure regimes. Therefore, in these species, reef type appears to influence patterns of abundance independently of coral availability. In contrast to other species of Gobiodon, the abundance of the most specialised species, Gobiodon sp. A, was not closely associated with the abundance of the only coral species it inhabited. This study demonstrates that even for habitat specialised species, the relationship between habitat availability and abundance varies widely and is multiscale...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the forces}} that drive habitat {{selection}} of species in communities is important in both ecology and evolution. In nature, species face variation in competition, predation and physical characters among habitats. Vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) is a <b>specialised</b> zooplanktivorous <b>fish</b> predominantly using deeper water in lakes during summer, while roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) uses mainly the shallow littoral zone {{as well as the}} upper layer of the pelagic zone. To understand mechanisms behind habitat use of these species, I first conducted a predation experiment to investigate their sensitivity to predation by perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). Second, I performed a foraging experiment using different temperature and light treatments. I then used metabolic calculations to estimate energetic costs when foraging. I found no difference between species regarding sensitivity to predation. Vendace was the most efficient forager on zooplankton but also swam faster spending more energy compared to roach. Roach had a comparatively high metabolic rate in the lowest temperature, where their foraging efficiency was lowest. The energy gain ratio at 6 °C was highest for vendace, while it was lowest for roach. In the highest temperature (18 °C) and the lowest light level (1 lux), both species were similar in their energy gain ratio. The relative energy gain ratio provides a mechanism to explain habitat distribution for the two species. An increased understanding of the role of metabolism in combination with biotic interactions and habitat use may help to foresee effects of environmental change for different species...|$|R
