Currently, the number of students at Saudi universities and colleges exceeds one million vis-à-vis 7000 in 1970 (Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Washington).

40|$|Abstract—While {{in recent}} years online social {{networks}} have been largely shaping user experience on the Web, {{only in the last}} year there has been a <b>soaring</b> <b>increase</b> of novel location-based social applications. By allowing users to check-in at places and share their location with friends, these social platforms provide a new facet of user online behavior. In this work we present a measurement study of user activity on a popular online location-based social network with hundreds of thousands of users. We study not only how users connect with friends but also how they check-in at different places. We describe how, while the number of friends appears distributed according to a Double-Pareto law, both the number of check-ins and the number of places per user are better described by log-normal distributions. Moreover, we report how user activity spans decay faster than exponentially and how, over time, users add friends more quickly than they accumulate check-ins and places. Our findings suggest that the difference in the distribution of friends and check-ins/places may be motivated by physical constraints that do not allow users to steadily visit very large numbers of new places, while online friends can be added at virtually no cost. These results shed new light on how users engage with location-based online social networks and prompt many more research questions. I...|$|E

40|$|The aerial {{environment}} is heterogeneous {{in space and}} time and directly influences the costs of animal flight. Volant animals can reduce these costs by using different flight modes, each with their own benefits and constraints. However, the extent to which animals alter their flight modes in response to environmental conditions has rarely been studied in the wild. To provide insight into how a flight generalist can reduce the energetic cost of movement, we studied flight behaviour in relation to the aerial environmental and landscape using hundreds of hours of global positioning system and triaxial acceleration measurements of the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). Individuals differed largely in the time spent in flight, which increased linearly with the time spent in flight at sea. In general, flapping was used more frequently than more energetically efficient soaring flight. The probability of <b>soaring</b> <b>increased</b> with increasing boundary layer height and time closer to midday, reflecting improved convective conditions supportive of thermal soaring. Other forms of soaring flight were also used, including fine-scale use of orographic lift. We explore the energetic consequences of behavioural adaptations to the aerial environment and underlying landscape and implications for individual energy budgets, foraging ecology and reproductive success.

An analysis of the evolution of the count mean diameter in the fine mode (CMDf) in the 8 daily measurements has revealed a decrease of over 25 % in this parameter in the modified measurements when compared with measurements that were not contaminated by aerosols from biomass burning. In contrast, when the aerosol transport time is long, the increases detected in CMDf range between 15 % and 100 % when compared with measurements of air by non-aged aerosol from biomass burning.
