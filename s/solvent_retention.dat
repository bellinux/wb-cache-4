However, the problems of predicting the compatibility of solvents with polymers took over, leading him to overcome the problems of the then-popular Hildebrand solubility parameter by dividing Hildebrand's single parameter into three components: dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding. His 1967 doctoral thesis (Dr. techn.) provided the basis for what came to be called Hansen solubility parameters, or HSPs. In addition to providing a theoretical framework, the thesis provided the first working set of HSP values for common solvents and for a range of commercial polymers, making it of immediate practical use to academia and industry.|$|E

Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing rebar. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as terrazzo flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.Epoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds [...] Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. One of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head.

40|$|Kafirin is a prolamin protein {{unique to}} sorghum grain. To make kafirin viable for {{commercial}} development {{there needs to}} be an optimised extraction process. For this purpose insight is needed into how the process is affected by the extraction temperature, grain/solvent ratio, grain/solvent contact time, and various amounts and types of reducing agents and extraction aids. Such insights are currently unavailable. Significant insights into the extraction of kafirin were gained by performing extractions under various conditions to determine how extraction parameters affected the extraction process. Extraction temperature, grain/solvent ratio, grain/solvent contact time and various amounts and types of reducing agents/extraction aids were tested to determine the optimum extraction conditions. The extraction aids tested were acids (glacial acetic acid, citric acid and phosphoric acid) and metal bisulphite complexes (sodium metabisulphite and potassium metabisulphite) were tested as reducing agents. Using a bench-scale extraction setup, the following important results were obtained. ? With regard to the commercialization of the process aqueous ethanol is the most promising solvent and was used throughout the study. ? The maximum amount of protein after extraction was roughly 45 g of protein for 1 000 g of grain out of a total kafirin content of roughly 62 g. This is an extraction efficiency of 70 - 75 % based on the total amount of kafirin available in the grain. Acids were found to have a limited role in the extraction process and can be excluded. ? The quantity of metalbisulphite complex used played a large role in the extraction process, reducing the yield by about 50 % when absent. The type of metalbisulphite used, however, did not play a role. ? The grain/solvent contact time was deemed {{to be the most important}} factor, with the highest yield occurring somewhere between 10 and 20 min. ? After 20 min the yield decreased due to increased <b>solvent</b> <b>retention.</b> The <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> and increased filtering time associated with the drop in yield were investigated. The weakened hydrogen bonding in the starchy endosperm made it possible for the starchy material to bond to other starchy particles or less likely the solvent, and was most likely the mechanism of <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> and thickening of the slurry. This increased <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> resulted in approximately 50 % of the total solvent being retained; which was discarded with spent grain.

The thesis will provide the company with a greater understanding of how to effectively manage the customerâs demands, and the costs associated with these activities in order to create greater customer value. If optimizing wheat blends is successful, the company will be able to provide similar SRC information to other customers as a value added service. 	(<b>Solvent</b> <b>retention</b> capacity) is a test that provides analytical data that measures three specific physical components within soft wheat flour. Traditionally, wheat flour is sold according to moisture, ash, protein content, and basic dough characteristic data; though this information is important, SRC provides specific flour functionality information that will aid customers. SRC examines the: glutenin characteristics of the flour, pentosan content and gliadin characteristics, and the starch damage from the milling process. These values describe the functionality of the flour and provide information regarding the flourâs ability to absorb water during the mixing process and the flourâs ability to release that water during the baking process. SRC quality endpoints include: reduced mixing and baking times, reduced levels of breakage after baking, and greater overall ingredient consistency throughout all the customerâs commercial bakeries.

C-K 4 -M 2 GlyR {{is one of a}} series of peptides that were prepared by the addition of lysine residues to the N- or C-terminus of the M 2 transmembrane sequence of the brain glycine receptor. This study addresses how such modifications affect physical properties such as aqueous solubility, aggregation, and secondary structure, as well as the ability of the modified peptides to form channels in epithelial monolayers. A graded improvement in solubility with a concomitant decrease in aggregation in aqueous media was observed for the M 2 GlyR transmembrane sequences. Increases in short-circuit current (I(SC)) of epithelial monolayers were observed after treatment with some but not all of the peptides.

Significantly greater test weight, kernel diameter, kernel weight and lower hardness index were detected in soft wheat grown in no-till cropping systems, compared to conventional systems. Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of wheat grain were reduced by no-till cropping systems, partly due to increases in kernel size and weight. Lower protein content, lower SDS sedimentation volume and lower lactic acid and sucrose <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> capacity of no-till wheat may explain higher cookie diameter of no-till wheat. 	Organic wheat tended to have larger kernels; lower phenolic content and total antioxidant capacity of organic wheat was likely due to a decreased proportion of aleurone and pericarp. Lower protein content, lower SDS sedimentation volume and lower <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> capacity were observed in organic soft wheat grown under very low fertility along with higher cookie diameter and sponge cake volume. In hard wheat, increased fertility tended to increase protein content regardless of cropping system and loaf volume of bread was not significantly different between organic and conventionally grown wheat. 	Phytate additions to refined wheat flour at a 1 % level increased mixograph mixing time and water absorption. Dough added with phytates showed lower total SDS-unextractable glutenin polymer content after mixing and fermentation, and HPLC profiles demonstrated that phytates caused a major shift towards lower molecular weight forms of unextractable glutenin polymers. Loaf volume of bread decreased with addition of phytates, probably due, at least in part, to the modified gluten properties; {{it is possible that the}} increased iron chelating capacity of phytates interrupted oxidative cross-linking of glutenins.

In addition to a dramatic reduction in analysis time, the use of salts can also improve the resolution of closely eluted peaks.

The selected solvents or solvent/solvent mixtures used throughout this study were found to induce swelling ratios of 1. 16 (ethanol/ethyl acetate: 25 / 75), 1. 26 (ethyl acetate), 1. 33 (ethyl acetate/toluene: 50 / 50), and 1. 41 (toluene), respectively. Linear correlations were obtained between the MWCO and the swelling ratio induced by each solvent and between the MWCO and the transmembrane pressure. Pore size calculations using <b>solvent</b> flux and <b>retention</b> data confirmed the variable sieving properties of the PDMS membrane in relation to the solvent-induced swelling and applied transmembrane pressure. In addition, the study of the solute-transfer rate through several operating conditions showed that both diffusive and convective transports occurred for the PEG solutes and that their respective contributions appeared dependent on the variable pore size of the PDMS membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} protein {{composition}} and content {{on the characteristics}} and properties of laminated baked products has been studied for a long time. However, there are no flour quality parameters related to its suitability to produce yeast-leavened laminated salty baked products. The relationships among flour characteristics, laminated dough pieces and baked products were studied {{in order to establish}} flour quality parameters and help predict the quality of the products. Yeast-leavened salty laminated products made with hard wheat flour had better quality properties than the products made with soft wheat flour. Hydrophilic components and a high gluten network quality are responsible for the generation of a rigid structure and viscous dough. Consequently, during baking, the dough rises rather than extends laterally and does not experience any change in the expected shape. Among the analysed flour characteristics, glutenin macropolymer content, lactic acid and sodium carbonate <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> capacities together with dough viscosity and resistance to deformation were the variables which influenced the most the quality of yeast-leavened salty laminated products...|$|E
40|$|Succinic acid (SA) was {{recently}} {{shown to be}} the major pH determining metabolite produced by yeast during straight-dough fermentation (Jayaram et al, 2013), reaching levels as high as 1. 6 mmol/ 100 g of flour. Here, the impact of such levels of SA (0. 8, 1. 6 and 2. 4 mmol/ 100 g flour) on yeastless dough properties was investigated. SA decreased the development time and stability of dough significantly. Uniaxial extension tests showed a consistent decrease in dough extensibility upon increasing SA addition. Upon biaxial extension {{in the presence of}} 2. 4 mmol SA/ 100 g flour, a dough extensibility decrease of 47 to 65 % and a dough strength increase of 25 to 40 % were seen. While the SA <b>solvent</b> <b>retention</b> capacity of flour increased with increasing SA concentration in the solvent, gluten agglomeration decreased with gluten yield reductions of over 50 %. The results suggest that SA leads to swelling and unfolding of gluten proteins, thereby increasing their interaction potential and dough strength, but simultaneously increasing intermolecular electrostatic repulsive forces. These phenomena lead to the reported changes in dough properties. Together, our results establish SA as an important yeast metabolite for dough rheology. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Solvent</b> <b>retention</b> {{capacity}} (SRC) test is {{an effective}} method for quality evaluation of soft wheat. Ningmai 9 is a founder in soft wheat breeding. The SRC and genotype of Ningmai 9 and its 117 derivatives were tested. Association mapping was employed to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with SRCs. Ningmai 9 had the allele frequency of 75. 60 % and 67. 81 % to its first- and second-generation derivatives, respectively, indicating higher contribution than theoretical expectation. Neighbor-joining cluster based on the genotyping data showed that Ningmai 9 {{and most of its}} first-generation derivatives were clustered together, whereas its second-generation derivatives were found in another group. The variation coefficients of SRCs in the derivatives ranged from 5. 35 % to 8. 63 %. A total of 29 markers on 13 chromosomes of the genome were associated with the SRCs. There were 6 markers associated with more than one SRC or detected in two years. The results suggested that QTL controlling SRCs in Ningmai 9 might be different from other varieties. Markers Xgwm 44, Xbarc 126, Xwmc 790, and Xgwm 232 associated with SRCs in Ningmai 9 might be used for quality improvement in soft wheat breeding...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the extent of organic <b>solvent</b> and water <b>retention</b> in comonomer blends with different hydrophilicity (Hoy's solubility parameter for hydrogen bonding, Î´h) after solvent evaporation, {{and the extent of}} tracer penetration in polymerised films prepared from these resins. For each comonomer blend, adhesive/solvent mixtures were prepared by addition of (1) 50 wt% acetone, (2) 50 wt% ethanol, (3) 30 wt% acetone and 20 wt% water and (4) 30 wt% ethanol and 20 wt% water. The mixtures were placed in glass wells and evaporated for 30 - 60 s for acetone-based resins, and 60 - 120 s for ethanol-based resins. The weight of the comonomer mixtures was measured before and after solvent evaporation. Resin films were prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after immersion in ammonical silver nitrate. The percentages of solvent and water retained in the comonomer mixtures, and between the acetone and ethanol groups were measured gravimetrically and were statistically compared. In comonomer-organic solvent mixtures, the percentage of solvent retained in acetone and ethanol-based mixtures increased significantly with hydrophilicity of the comonomer blends (P< 0. 05). In resin-organic solvent-water mixtures, significantly more solvent and water were retained in the ethanol-based mixtures (P< 0. 0001), when compared to acetone-based mixtures after 60 s of air-drying. TEM revealed residual water being trapped as droplets in resin films containing acetone and water. Water-filled channels were seen along the film periphery of all groups and throughout the entire resin films containing ethanol and water. The addition of water to comonomer-ethanol mixtures results in increased retention of both ethanol and water because both solvents can hydrogen bond to the monomers. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In several {{industries}} {{organic solvent}} nanofiltration (OSN) offers a high potential as energy-, product- and waste-saving alternative compared with commonly used unit operations. Thus, organic solvent nanofiltration gained importance in recent decades. This technology separates complex organic mixtures under mild conditions. To use the full potential of OSN, {{a thorough understanding}} of the separation mechanism is essential. This work systematically investigates solvent as well as solute transport through adense PDMS-based polymeric OSN membrane. Experiments with four different solute classes, namely polyethylene glycol (194 - 820 Da), linear carboxylic acid (228 - 340 Da), polystyrene (162 - 2000 Da) and n alkanes with different chain length (142 - 339 Da) were performed. These solutes are dissolved in n-hexane, toluene, isopropanol or in methanol. Furthermore the transport of n alkanes with different chain length (142 - 339 Da) is comprehensively quantified not only in pure solvents but also in binary mixtures of isopropanol/toluene, methanol/toluene and methanol/isopropanol. Negative retentions were observed using isopropanol or methanol as pure solvent and n alkanes or linear carboxylic acids as solutes, whereas positive retentions were measured with polyethylene glycol as solute. In contrast, using toluene or n-hexane as <b>solvent,</b> all observed <b>retentions</b> were positive. A significant minimum in retentions was found for all n alkanes with different chain length in the binary mixture of toluene and methanol. Furthermore salt permeation and retention in water/methanol mixtures were investigated. Membrane performance varied depending on the composition ranging from aqueous to methanol solutions. Ion pair formation or ion dissociation correlates with a different salt retention. So, depending on the solvent or solvent mixtures and the solute, there exist considerable differences in the retention behaviour due to different membrane-solvent-solute interactions. This significantly changes flux and retention. Also negative retentions were observed, opening up new possibilities for further applications of organic solvent nanofiltration...|$|R
40|$|Solid phase {{extraction}} (SPE) is {{an extension}} of conventional liquid chromatographic methods. In the case of SPE the desired separation is digital in nature. Under one <b>solvent</b> condition total <b>retention</b> occurs while under a second solvent condition total elution occurs. The role of SPE as a sample preparation tool is becoming more dominant in the field of analytical chemistry. The need for high throughput, decreased solvent usage, and automation makes SPE the method of choice over other extraction methods. Ionic interactions at modified silica sorbents are studied with respect to the impact on the isolation and purification of analytes. The interactions are characterized by quantitating absolute recoveries for a variety of analytes under different conditions, and qualitative analysis of analytical interferences. Extractions of ionizable compounds were found to be dependent on a myriad of factors. These factors include sample pH, buffer composition, solution concentration, and elution solvent composition. Selectivities for ionizable analytes can be increased by utilizing ionic interactions, particularly in a mixed-mode operation. The extraction of basic compound compounds is generally robust, while methods for the acidic analytes are more highly dependent on the type of counter-ion. Ion selectivities observed were different than those recorded for polymer-based ion-exchange sorbents. The organization of water in the near surface region of the silica-based sorbents is the reason for the disparity between the two types of materials. The utility of a polymeric polystyrene divinylbenzene sorbent for the analysis of analytes from biological matrices is demonstrated. It was shown that these sorbents can withstand harsh chemical environments that would preclude using a silica-based material. Analysis times were shortened and extraction efficiencies were comparable to the silica materials. The extractions were not as selective as those performed on mixed-mode sorbents however...|$|R
