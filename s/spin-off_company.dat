40|$|Public {{research}} organisations nowadays {{are very much}} involved in the commercialisation of their research results, especially by creating <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies.</b> Government generally views research commercialisation as an important driver of innovation and {{as an opportunity to}} supplement increasingly strained budgets of public {{research organisations}}. Others, though, are worried that engaging in commercialisation activities and collaboration with industry will be detrimental to the autonomy and quality of academic research. This study investigates what happens when researchers create <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies</b> and collaborate with them. The case studies presented here show that collaborations between researchers and their <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies</b> vary widely and can have substantial impacts on academic research. In addition, researchers make clever use of their <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies</b> in their quest for prestige and government research funding...|$|R

2500|$|In August 2012, SAIC {{announced}} {{its plans to}} split into two publicly traded companies.

The remaining part became a $7 billion-per-year IT company specializing in technology for the national security, health, and engineering sectors. The smaller company was led by Tony Moraco, who beforehand was leading SAIC’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance group, and the bigger one was led by John P. Jumper. The split has allowed both companies to pursue more business, which it could not pursue as a single company due to conflicts of interest.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Spin-off</b> <b>companies</b> {{are among}} the most crucial factors {{contributing}} to the productivity and development and cycles of innovation in developed and developing communities. Due to this importance, some reference groups in the field deem <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies</b> as the most effective links between science and marketplace, and hence, they have widely researched the field of <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies.</b> In the present paper, the problems acting against <b>spin-off</b> <b>companies</b> in Science and Technology Park of University of Tehran are investigated through a combined approach, specifying these factors {{in the light of the}} results of the research. The first step in the research is interviews with 15 people responsible for the foundation of the companies. According to data provided by the interviews, it was concluded that the answers provided by the interviewees are consistent. These answers were codified and the factors of failure were identified. In the qualitative section of the study, the researcher-made questionnaire, whose validity was confirmed by the qualified reference groups, was used to collect data. Then, factors of failure were distributed in hierarchies. The final section of the study included the interpretation and analysis of the results...|$|R
