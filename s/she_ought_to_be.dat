5|$|It {{has been}} two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{political}} controversies and their age difference—he was fifteen years her senior—Helena {{was happy with}} Christian and was determined to marry him. As a younger son of a non-reigning duke, {{the absence of any}} foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in Britain—the Queen's primary concern—and she declared the marriage would go ahead. Helena and Christian were actually third cousins in descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales. Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained, and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian (who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from King Frederick V of Denmark) as either a cousin or brother-in-law. The Queen never forgave the Princess of Wales for accusations of possessiveness, and wrote of the Waleses shortly afterwards: [...] "Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [...] is by no means what <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> It will be long, if ever, before she regains my confidence." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} that Cornelia hated so much as <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made a fool of, {{and this was the}} {{grievance}} which she was willing fate should retaliate upon him, though she had not meant it at all. <b>She</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> satisfied, and <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> happy, but she was not.|$|R

500|$|Her media {{appearances}} were criticised {{for their}} awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she [...] "fluffed her lines" [...] {{during an interview}} with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating." [...] The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as [...] "Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television".|$|E
2500|$|On February 15, 2006, Schaefer made suggestive {{comments}} to Elizabeth Krum, a 24-year-old assistant to then-Governor Robert Ehrlich. Responding to Schaefer's request for tea, Krum set a thermal mug {{in front of}} him. Schaefer watched her walk away, then beckoned for her to return. When she obliged, he told her, [...] "Walk again", staring after her {{as she left the}} conference room. Schaefer initially refused to apologize, saying, [...] "She's a pretty little girl. <b>She</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> damn happy that I observed her going out the door. The day I don't look at pretty women is the day I die." [...] (Schaefer long called the women with whom he worked [...] "little girls.") However, within days of the leering incident, Schaefer issued a handwritten letter to Krum informing her she had handled the affair as a [...] "trouper." ...|$|E

60|$|JUNO. Why don't you let my wife say something? I don't think <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thrust into}} the {{background}} like this.|$|E

6000|$|... "When? When? What's the use {{of trying}} to pin me down to When and Why and Where and How and When? That's the trouble with women, that's why they don't make high-class executives; they haven't any sense of diplomacy. When the proper {{opportunity}} and occasion arises so it just comes in natural, why then I'll have a friendly little talk with him and--and--Was that Tinka hollering up-stairs? <b>She</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>been</b> asleep, long ago." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} hurriedly, [...] "certainly; but ma {{has been quite}} queer of late, and she may think--you know--that since--since {{there has been so}} much {{property}} <b>to</b> dispose of, <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> consulted." ...|$|R

60|$|Her {{instinct}} was alarmed, and the instinct {{in such matters}} of this excellent woman <b>was</b> keen. <b>She</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> a Forsyte; in young Jolyon's sense of the word, she certainly had that privilege, and merits description as such.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. [In a low fluster to JAMES and WALTER] No, Mr. James. She's not <b>been</b> {{quite what}} <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> ha' <b>been,</b> while this young man's been away. She's lost her chance. We can't consult how to swindle the Law.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanking you kindly, sir,' {{returned}} Miggs, 'I couldn't take my rest in peace, nor fix {{my thoughts}} upon my prayers, otherways than that I knew mistress was comfortable {{in her bed}} this night; by rights <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> there, hours ago.' ...|$|R

60|$|Clara, as she {{got into}} the cab, felt that <b>she</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> more stout in her {{resistance}} to his offer. But it would be better, perhaps, that she should write to him from Aylmer Park, and get Frederic to write also.|$|R
