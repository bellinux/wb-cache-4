30|$|Currently, {{conservative}} treatment (parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, octreotide, <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> and percutaneous drainage of abscesses) {{is successful}} in over 90 % of cases; reoperation {{is reserved for}} septic patients or failure of conservative approach [4, 28].|$|R
30|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{decrease}} the postoperative risks associated with prolonged hospital stay (e.g. venous thromboembolism, hospital-acquired infections), we discharged women that underwent radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy with <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> in situ within 48 to 72  h postoperatively.|$|R
30|$|Currently, no robust {{evidence}} exists for the optimal period {{for maintaining the}} suction drainage in the groin incisions for women who undergo inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar carcinoma. In many cases, this may take more than 2  weeks. Some authorities advocate early drain removal at 72  h after surgery, but this approach is associated with increased risk of lymphocyst formation. We attempted to discharge women with <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> in situ within 48 to 72  h following the surgery. Four patients that underwent vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulval cancer were discharged home within 48 to 72  h postoperatively with <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> in situ. The mean age was 61.5  years. The average number of groin lymph nodes removed was 9.12 per patient. Only one patient had nodes positive for disease (bilaterally). Drains were removed within 7 to 10  days following the discharge. Wound healing was satisfactory in all cases. No cases of wound breakdown were recorded. There was only one case of a small lymphocyst (< 3  cm) that resolved spontaneously within 8  weeks. Early postoperative discharge with <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> in situ appears safe for women that undergo inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar carcinoma.|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess if primary closure of wounds on a <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> can be {{performed}} in open fractures after debridement and to determine the risk of infection and nonunion. A total of 78 type II and type IIIa open fractures were managed with primary closure on a <b>suction</b> <b>drain.</b> They were followed until union. Rates of infection, delayed union and nonunion were determined and compared with rates reported in the literature. Overall, 16 fractures (20.5 %) were complicated with superficial infections and 8 fractures (10.2 %) had deep infections. Delayed union was observed in 11 fractures (14.1 %) and nonunion in 12 fractures (15.3 %). Primary closure of a wound on a <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> seems to cause no significant increase in rates of infection, nonunion or delayed union.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} the complications {{inherent in the}} use or not of continuous <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> in postoperative period of patients undergoing 1 -level lumbar arthrodesis.

30|$|In England, for {{patients}} that undergo inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic disease from penile, vulval, anal and cutaneous malignancies, the mean inpatient stay is 12.8  days [5].

Also, maintaining the <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> in situ does not increase the risk of lymphocyst formation and lymphoedema. In our series, early postoperative discharge within 48 to 72  h following surgery appears to be safe and without any major risks to the patient. No cases of wound breakdown were reported.

We reviewed the clinical charts of 43 consecutive patients who underwent total cystectomy with urinary diversion using the intestine from February 2006 to March 2011 at Nishi-Kobe Medical Center. All patients received intravenous prophylactic antibiotics before and throughout surgery {{as well as for}} three days after surgery. Skin closure was performed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures with 2 - 0 nylon on the first 22 patients (mattress group), and with interrupted subcuticular buried sutures with 4 - 0 absorbable monofilament with subcutaneous closed <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> on the remaining 21 patients (subcuticular buried suture with subcutaneous drain; SBD group). SSI occurred in 7 (31. 8 %) patients in the mattress group, but did not affect any patient in the SBD group.

40|$|AbstractObjective {{to study}} the {{incidence}} of wound haematomas and hyperperfusion following carotid endarterectomy {{and the effect of}} changes in perioperative management. Methods we undertook a prospective audit of the postoperative outcome of 300 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed for a symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery, under the care of a single consultant. Results audit of the first 100 operations between 1990 – 93 resulted in 4 changes to clinical practice. These included the use of Dacron instead of vein because of 3 vein patch blowouts, invasive postoperative monitoring of blood pressure, and the use of intravenous beta-blockers to control hypertension, because of 4 hyperperfusion injuries. The use of 10 F <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> was discontinued, because they did not prevent 8 wound haematomas. The results of the second 100 cases between 1994 – 97 and the third 100 cases between 1998 – 2000 confirmed no further hyperperfusion injuries or patch blowouts (p = 0. 01 and 0. 04 respectively). Larger 14 F <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> were reintroduced for the third series because of thirteen haematomas in the second series (p = 0. 09). Only 4 haematomas occurred in the third series (p = 0. 05). The need for beta-blockers fell in the third series due to the introduction of local anaesthesia (p = 0. 0001).

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} value of <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> tip culture in patients undergoing primary posterior spine surgery. Overview of Literature: To date, the diagnostic value of <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> tip culture for predicting surgical site infection (SSI) {{has not been}} firmly established in orthopedic or spinal surgery. Methods: In total, 133 patients who underwent primary posterior spine surgery from January 2013 to April 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Patients diagnosed with infective disease or condition was excluded. The <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> tip was cut off ap-proximately 5 cm from its far end. The sample {{was sent to the}} microbiological laboratory of the hospital for culture analysis. Any signs of infection, such as wound discharge or dehiscence, fever, chills, or chronic pain, were recorded. The culture outcome, identi-fication of bacteria, and postoperative transition of the serum C-reactive protein level were also recorded in all patients. The wounds were followed up for a minimum of 3 months. Results: A positive drain tip culture was found in 48 patients (36. 1 %), of whom, 6 developed SSI. The sensitivity of drain tip culture for SSI after primary posterior spine surgery was 60. 0 %, and the specificity was 65. 9 %. The association between the incidence of positive suction tip culture and SSI was not statistically significant. Among the 48 positive drain tip cultures, there was no significant association between the occurrence of SSI and virulence of isolated bacteria. There was no significant association between drain tip culture positivity and the duration of drainage, or between the rate of SSI and duration of drainage.

40|$|To the Editor: We {{would like}} to express our opinion about the article by Gonzalez et al. (1). We congratulate them on the well-performed study and {{the large number of}} {{patients}} included. We know that seroma formation is the most common complication of breast cancer surgery (2). We noted a few things in the article. First, the authors do not describe the amount of lymphorrhea aspirated and the number of aspirations during the postoperative medications. There is a big difference between an aspiration of 10 cc of seroma and an aspiration of 100 cc of lymphorrhea, but they describe only the mean number of aspirations. We believe the amount of aspiration and number of aspirations for every postoperative medication will be helpful in understanding the results. Second, we noted the absence of any information about the mean quantity of lymph loss with drains during the first postoperative days. The authors described only the removal of <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> after 5 or 7 days, {{depending on the type of}} surgery performed. We would also like to know if the authors used some compressive medication with <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> or if they placed only <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> without compressive medication? We think that Gonzalez et al. could test compressive medication or other ways of preventing seroma formation. In our experience (3, 4), the use of compressive medication is helpful, but not resolutive, in the treatment of seroma or lymphorrhea, where other authors tested axillary padding with encouraging results (5). We know that external axillary compression is not universally accepted to reduce seroma (6) formation, but we think that this kind of medication combined with <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> will be useful, even if today some authors do not encourage the use of <b>suction</b> <b>drains</b> in breast surgery (7). Finally, we {{would like to}} remind readers that today in breast surgery we can take advantage of octreotide. In fact, octreotide can be used successfully for the treatment of postaxillary dissection lymphorrhea, and potentially in the prevention of postaxillary lymph node dissection lymphosarcoma, since the amount and duration of lymphorrhea in this setting are known to be important risk factors for its development. In fact, in our experience, the mean quantity (± standard deviation) of lymphorrhea was 94. 6 ± 19 cc/day and the average duration was 16. 7 ± 3. 0 days. In comparison, the mean quantity of lymphorrhea in the treatment group was 65. 4 ± 21. 1 cc/day and the average duration was 7. 1 ± 2. 9 days. Potentially octreotide might be used in similar situations where lymphorrhea is detrimental, such as peripheral vascular surgery and regional lymph node dissection for melanoma. So we encourage the authors of this article to use octeotride in the treatment of lymphorrhea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Suction</b> <b>drains</b> are {{routinely}} used after {{modified radical mastectomy}} and are an important factor contributing to increased hospital stay as the patients are often discharged only after their removal. Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain {{has been reported to}} be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative suction and full vacuum suction drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy. The associated postoperative morbidity was also compared between the two groups. Methods 85 FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) proven cases of locally advanced breast cancer were randomized. (Using randomly ordered sealed envelops, which were opened immediately before the closure of the wound) in to 50 patients with full vacuum suction (pressure = 700 g/m 2) and 35 cases in to half vacuum suction drainage (pressure = 350 g/m 2) groups. The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight, and technique of operation and extent of axillary dissection. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electrocautery. External compression dressing was provided over the axilla for first 48 hrs and following that patients were encouraged to do active and passive shoulder exercises. The outcomes measured were postoperative morbidity and the length of hospital stay. Statistical methods used: Descriptive studies were performed with SPSS version 10 and group characteristics were compared using student t-test.

Our aim {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of closed <b>suction</b> <b>drain</b> after total knee arthroplasty. 				 					Materials and methods: One hundred twenty patients (135 knees) with primary Total Knee Arthroplasty were divided into a study group (no drain) and a control group (drain used). Inclusion criteria were grade 3 and grade 4 osteoarthritis of the knee. Revision cases and rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. Parameters assessed were pain, pre and post-op Hb, dressing change, early infection, ecchymosis and duration of stay. Results were calculated using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Oxford Knee scoring systems at two weeks, six months and one year. 				 					Results: Mean age was 72. 03  ±  6. 68 in study group and 71. 38  ±  7. 02 in control group. Pre and post op Hb was 12. 1678  ±  1. 3220 (study group), 12. 1803  ±  1. 2717 (control group) and 9. 8373  ±  1. 5703 (study group), 9. 7918  ±  1. 4163 (control group).
