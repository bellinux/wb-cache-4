5000|$|Before the {{beginning}} of his artistic career, De la Hoz has been interested in the oneiric process and the unconscious world introduced by the psychological theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung. The literary works of Julio Cortázar, José Donoso and some of Gabriel García Márquez’s early stories, so called [...] "magic realism", taught him to give a plastic interpretation to their contents. In his compositions, we can see two or three juxtaposed areas of different geometrical shapes, visually balanced. Daily elements, animals and anonymous people take their place inside them. In this way, De la Hoz <b>suggest</b> <b>us</b> an unexplainable interaction of realities. Nicolás develops his artistic work mainly with the technical resources of the easel painting. Color and organic textures play a fundamental role in integrating the structures of his designs.|$|E

Cables unearthed by WikiLeaks <b>suggest</b> <b>US</b> pressure was {{a major factor in}} the creation of Ley Sinde. In February 2008 the US Embassy in Spain sent a cable back to Washington indicating they planned to tell the Spanish government that they would appear on the Watch List of the Special 301 Report if they did not take significant steps to reduce internet copyright infringements. The cable indicated that they would encourage the Spanish government to adopt a law similar to the two proposals that would eventually become France's HADOPI Law and the UK's Digital Economy Act 2010. The Spanish government did not show sufficient progress to satisfy the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and it was added to the 301 Special Report in 2008 and 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} of Esthappan is always engaged {{in all sorts}} of things (in a moral way) to make people remind of Christ. At the sea shore and on the walls he draws pictures of Christ. It is evident after the homily given by the priest that the film gives importance to act besides belief. This very thing acts as the manifesto of the film Esthappan. The fishermen community of the place works (different sorts of ‘acts’) so hard and so do all other {{men and women of the}} locality. Yet the greatness of their acts is lost once the same community indulges without any moral concerns, in immoral and illegal acts. They lose the greatness of their effort (acts) through excessive drinking, gossiping, being promiscuous and through exploiting each other in many ways. This reprobate state of the people is what drives Esthappan to do what he does. He, who was once a fisherman now does no work other than doing things that will remind the people of Christ. He thinks that to work without a philosophy, is a waste. Therefore his attempt is at the heart of the people who have forgotten Christ. In order to do that he comes to help people from diseases, from false acquisitions, from debt, from dangers etc. like Christ did. But his constant worries and thoughts while doing all these <b>suggest</b> <b>us</b> that he is not satisfied from these external acts alone. He is worried more about getting into the hearts of people where lay the real problem; the question of morality and conscience. Interestingly Esthappan is not against established dogmas of the Church or against the practices of her. His attendance of mass celebrated in the church and his asking for the incenses are examples for this.The audience come to know about Esthappan solely through the narration of different characters. Though for most part Esthappan is doing benevolent deeds he is seen by some as a trickster. Sometimes people talk about him in hostile tones. However those who directly received the goodness of his deeds, like the children and women, talk nicely about him. The reason why others talk ill of Esthappan is that either he does things that they are not capable of (for which they are jealous) or because they basically are immoral to accept someone’s good deeds. He can be seen doing a death-like act which he himself clears as a sleep-act (Like Christ’s death on the cross) that might be to suggest that Christ was made to sleep by the same people for which He came and that He is not dead but still lives even on the cross.The inability of Esthappan in completely representing Christ stems from the vastness of Christ’s infinite nature. This is reflected in the disillusions and restlessness of the finite character Esthappan. The final image of Esthappan accompanied with the death toll seems like to suggest that he finally lost in his attempt to redraw the attention of the people toward Christ.|$|E
