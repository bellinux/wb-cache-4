40|$|Background: The authors tested three {{possible}} pathways linking prenatal maternal depressive <b>symptoms</b> to adolescent depressive <b>symptoms.</b> These pathways went through childhood Irritability <b>Symptoms,</b> Anxiety/Depressive <b>Symptoms</b> or Conduct Problems. - Method: Data {{were collected from}} 3, 963 mother–child pairs participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Measures include maternal depressive <b>symptoms</b> (pre- and postnatal); toddler temperament (2 years); childhood (7 – 13 years) irritability <b>symptoms,</b> anxiety/depressive <b>symptoms,</b> conduct problems, and adolescent depressive <b>symptoms</b> (16 years). - Results: Irritability Symptoms: This pathway linked sequentially – prenatal maternal depressive <b>symptoms,</b> toddler temperament (high perceived intensity and low perceived adaptability), childhood irritability <b>symptoms,</b> and adolescent depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Anxiety/Depressive symptoms: This pathway linked sequentially – prenatal maternal depressive <b>symptoms,</b> toddler temperament (negative perceived mood), childhood anxiety/depressive <b>symptoms,</b> and adolescent depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Childhood conduct problems were not associated with adolescent depressive <b>symptoms,</b> above and beyond irritability <b>symptoms</b> and anxiety/depressive <b>symptoms.</b> - Conclusions: Results suggest evidence for two distinct developmental pathways to adolescent depressive <b>symptoms</b> that involve specific early and midchildhood features...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to reveal the}} {{influences}} of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) <b>symptoms</b> on self-esteem and self-perception during early adolescence and to clarify the spillover effect of self-esteem on depressive <b>symptoms.</b> ADHD <b>symptoms</b> in 564 early adolescents were evaluated via teacher-rating scales. Self-esteem and depressive <b>symptoms</b> were assessed via self-reported scales. We analyzed the relationships among these <b>symptoms</b> using structural equation modeling. Severe inattentive <b>symptoms</b> decreased self-esteem and hyperactive–impulsive <b>symptoms</b> affected self-perception for non-academic domains. Although these ADHD <b>symptoms</b> did not directly affect depressive <b>symptoms,</b> low self-esteem led to severe depression. ODD <b>symptoms</b> had {{a direct impact on}} depression without the mediating effects of self-esteem. These results indicated that inattentive <b>symptoms</b> had a negative impact on self-esteem and an indirect negative effect on depressive <b>symptoms</b> in adolescents, even if ADHD <b>symptoms</b> were subthreshold. Severe ODD <b>symptoms</b> can be directly associated with depressive <b>symptoms</b> during early adolescence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTobacco {{withdrawal}} <b>symptoms</b> may be confounded with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <b>symptoms</b> among smokers with ADHD. Objective(1) To assess {{overlap between}} ADHD <b>symptoms</b> and tobacco/nicotine withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> and craving; (2) {{to assess the}} relationship between craving or withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> {{and the effect of}} osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) on ADHD symptoms; (3) to assess the association of ADHD <b>symptoms,</b> craving, and withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> with abstinence. MethodsSecondary analysis of a randomized, placebo controlled smoking cessation trial assessing the efficacy of OROS-MPH taken in addition to nicotine patch among individuals with ADHD. ADHD <b>symptoms,</b> withdrawal <b>symptoms,</b> and craving were assessed at baseline and 2, 4 and 6 weeks after a target quit day. ResultsWithdrawal <b>symptoms</b> and craving showed limited and modest overlap with ADHD <b>symptoms</b> prior to abstinence but more extensive and stronger correlation after quit day. Compared to placebo, OROS-MPH reduced ADHD symptoms; this effect was attenuated by controlling for withdrawal <b>symptoms,</b> but not by craving. Craving, but not ADHD <b>symptoms</b> and withdrawal <b>symptoms,</b> was associated with abstinence during the trial. ConclusionWhen treating smokers with ADHD (1) craving, rather than tobacco withdrawal <b>symptoms</b> or ADHD <b>symptoms</b> may be the more effective therapeutic smoking cessation targets; (2) careful distinction of craving, withdrawal <b>symptoms,</b> and ADHD <b>symptoms</b> when assessing withdrawal phenomena is needed...|$|R

40|$|Persistent {{negative}} <b>symptoms</b> {{represent an}} alternative ap-proach for assessing negative <b>symptoms</b> {{in the context}} of clinical trials. Persistent negative <b>symptoms</b> are designed to capture those <b>symptoms</b> that lead to functional impair-ment but are currently understudied and for which there are no currently available effective treatments. Persistent negative <b>symptoms</b> differ from the 2 most commonly used approaches: primary, enduring negative <b>symptoms</b> or def-icit <b>symptoms</b> and negative <b>symptoms</b> broadly defined to include negative <b>symptoms,</b> regardless of their etiology or duration. In contrast to deficit <b>symptoms,</b> persistent neg-ative <b>symptoms</b> may include secondary negative <b>symptoms.</b> However, in contrast to negative <b>symptoms</b> broadly de-fined, the secondary negative <b>symptoms</b> included in the assessment of persistent negative <b>symptoms</b> only include those that have failed to respond to usual treatments for secondary negative <b>symptoms.</b> In consequence, the pres-ence of persistent negative <b>symptoms</b> identifies a patient population with clinically relevant symptomatology, which is larger than the one with the deficit syndrome but less heterogeneous than that captured {{through the use of a}} non-restrictive definition of negative <b>symptoms.</b> This may facil-itate the selection of subjects for inclusion into research and efforts to develop new pharmacological treatments and enhance our understanding of a relevant clinical problem. Ultimately, the investigation of the different entities char-acterized by negative <b>symptoms,</b> such as persistent negative <b>symptoms,</b> and the enhanced understanding of their bio-logical and clinical characteristics may help to unravel the psychopathological and biological heterogeneity of schizophrenia.

40|$|Negative <b>symptoms</b> in {{schizophrenia}} may {{be classified}} as primary or secondary. Primary negative <b>symptoms</b> {{are thought to be}} intrinsic to schizophrenia, while secondary negative <b>symptoms</b> are caused by positive <b>symptoms,</b> depression, medication side-effects, social deprivation or substance abuse. Most of the research on secondary negative <b>symptoms</b> has aimed at ruling them out in order to isolate primary negative <b>symptoms.</b> However, secondary negative <b>symptoms</b> are common and can {{have a major impact on}} patient-relevant outcomes. Therefore, the assessment and treatment of secondary negative <b>symptoms</b> are clinically relevant. Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms underlying secondary negative <b>symptoms</b> can contribute to an integrated model of negative <b>symptoms.</b> In this review we provide an overview of concepts, evidence, assessment and treatment for the major causes of secondary negative <b>symptoms.</b> We also summarize neuroimaging research relevant to secondary negative <b>symptoms.</b> We emphasize the relevance of recent developments in psychopathological assessment of negative <b>symptoms,</b> such as the distinction between a motivation and diminished expression, which have only rarely been applied in research on secondary negative <b>symptoms...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study examined whether adolescent depressive <b>symptoms</b> were best predicted by sibling depressive <b>symptoms</b> or by perceived relationship quality (i. e. support, conflict and power) over time. We researched whether perceived sibling relationship quality moderated {{the effect of}} sibling depressive <b>symptoms</b> on adolescent depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Furthermore, we examined whether birth order, adolescent gender and dyadic gender composition moderated these effects. Across six waves, 412 Dutch adolescents (57 % boys; Mage = 13. 02, SDage =. 43) and their siblings reported on their own depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Adolescents also reported on perceived support, conflict and power from sibling. Crosslagged panel analyses showed that only sibling depressive <b>symptoms</b> predicted adolescent depressive <b>symptoms</b> over time. This longitudinal effect of sibling depressive <b>symptoms</b> on adolescent depressive <b>symptoms</b> was not moderated by perceived sibling relationship quality. Moreover, the longitudinal effects of sibling depressive <b>symptoms</b> and perceived relationship quality on adolescent depressive <b>symptoms</b> were not moderated by birth order, adolescent gender or dyadic gender composition. Our results indicate that especially sibling depressive <b>symptoms</b> {{should be taken into}} account as a risk factor for depressive <b>symptoms</b> during adolescence...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{framework}} {{known as}} the 4 D-model of Trauma-related Dissociation (Frewen 2 ̆ 6 Lanius, 2014) differentiates between <b>symptoms</b> of clinically significant distress based on whether the <b>symptoms</b> do or do not intrinsically exemplify trauma-related altered states of consciousness (TRASC). Undergraduate students (n = 342) participated in an online survey and completed several measures assessing childhood experiences and psychological <b>symptoms.</b> Female PTSD patients (n = 25) completed similar measures before entering treatment. Within the student sample, NWC <b>symptoms</b> were endorsed as occurring more frequently than TRASC <b>symptoms.</b> Any two <b>symptoms</b> of NWC were not intercorrelated stronger than any two <b>symptoms</b> of TRASC; however, on average, <b>symptoms</b> of NWC were more strongly intercorrelated than <b>symptoms</b> of TRASC. <b>Symptoms</b> of TRASC were more strongly correlated with Traumatic Dissociation Scale (TDS) total scores; however, this difference was not significant. The four dimensions of TRASC incremented over the four NWC dimensions in predicting total scores of the TDS, and the reverse was not true. NWC and TRASC <b>symptoms</b> were both weakly correlated with Dissociative Experiences Scale-Brief scores. Although <b>symptoms</b> of TRASC were more strongly correlated with CARTS scores, only the Body dimension (i. e., depersonalization) was significant. Support for the 4 D-Model was not as strong within the patient sample. <b>Symptoms</b> of NWC were endorsed as occurring more frequently than TRASC <b>symptoms.</b> However, {{in contrast to the}} student sample, <b>symptoms</b> of NWC were not more highly intercorrelated than TRASC <b>symptoms,</b> TRASC <b>symptoms</b> were not correlated stronger with TDS total scores, and TRASC <b>symptoms</b> were not correlated stronger with CARTS scale scores than were NWC <b>symptoms.</b> In general, the hypotheses and structure of the 4 D-model were supported within the student sample, although some hypotheses had stronger support than did others.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the bidirectional dynamic relationship between sleep <b>symptoms</b> and core depressive <b>symptoms</b> {{and to identify}} subgroups differing {{with respect to their}} course. METHODS: The weekly state of depressive <b>symptoms</b> in depressed primary care patients (N = 267) was assessed retrospectively every 3 months for 3 consecutive years. The bidirectional relationship between sleep and core <b>symptoms</b> was estimated by means of manifest Markov modeling. Data-driven subgroups were estimated with parallel processes-latent class growth analyses to identify differences in courses of sleep and core <b>symptoms.</b> RESULTS: In total, core <b>symptoms</b> were associated with next-week development (odds = 1. 42; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 20 - 1. 67; p <. 001) and remission of sleep <b>symptoms</b> (odds = 0. 86; 95 % CI 0. 75 to 0. 99, p =. 033). Evidence was also found for a reverse pathway such that sleep <b>symptoms</b> were associated with the development (odds = 1. 26; 95 % CI = 1. 05 - 1. 50; p =. 012) and remission of core <b>symptoms</b> (odds = 0. 87; 95 % CI = 0. 76 - 0. 99; p =. 038). Three classes with different 3 -year courses were derived. In class 1, the likelihood that core <b>symptoms</b> remitted was reduced if sleep <b>symptoms</b> were present, and <b>symptoms</b> remained present over 3 years. In class 2, <b>symptoms</b> were bidirectionally related and remitted over 3 years. In class 3, <b>symptoms</b> were not associated, and sleep <b>symptoms</b> declined less steeply than core depressive <b>symptoms.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that sleep <b>symptoms</b> should be treated alongside core depressive <b>symptoms</b> in patients with an asynchronic decrease of sleep and core <b>symptoms</b> and in patients that do not respond to treatment to increase the chance of complete remission...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the study}} was to make a {{comprehensive}} inventory of the physical, psychological, and social <b>symptoms</b> of children with cancer and their parents during the palliative phase and the extent to which health professionals address those <b>symptoms.</b> PROCEDURE: Forty parents of children who died 1 - 3 years prior to data collection (structured questionnaire) were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: The response rate was 32 out of 40 parents (80 %). Most frequently mentioned physical <b>symptoms</b> were pain, poor appetite, and fatigue. The children's most mentioned psychological <b>symptoms</b> were sadness, difficulty in talking to their parents about their feelings regarding illness and death and fear of being alone. The <b>symptoms</b> of fear of death of the child and fear of physical <b>symptoms</b> were most frequently mentioned parents' psychological <b>symptoms.</b> Health professionals addressed 82 % of the children's physical <b>symptoms,</b> 43 % of the children's psychological <b>symptoms,</b> and 56 % of the parents' psychological <b>symptoms.</b> Parents indicated that after professional attention the proportion of children's physical <b>symptoms</b> that were completely or partially resolved was 18 and 26 %, respectively. For children's psychological <b>symptoms</b> the figures were 9 and 25 %, respectively, and for parents' psychological <b>symptoms</b> 2 and 23 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of <b>symptoms</b> of the child with cancer during the palliative phase and their parents is high. Health professionals focus mainly on the physical <b>symptoms</b> of the child. Relief of <b>symptoms</b> could not be achieved for a large proportion of <b>symptoms.</b> Further prospective research is necessary to investigate the kind, frequency and intensity of <b>symptoms</b> in order to tailor optimal palliative care to the needs of both child and parent...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the prevalence of endoscopic findings and their association with dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> in the community. Methods: A total of 1, 533 inhabitants of two villages {{were invited to participate}} in a cross-sectional survey, and 1, 033 were recruited. Participants underwent a validated dyspepsia questionnaire, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and a 13 C-urea breath test. Results: Endoscopic findings were present in 17. 6 of asymptomatic subjects and in 27. 4 of those with dyspeptic <b>symptoms.</b> The prevalence of esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus in subjects with dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> and without prominent reflux <b>symptoms</b> was 8. 1 and 1. 5, respectively, and was similar to that of asymptomatic subjects (8. 5 and 0. 7, respectively). Esophagitis was significantly associated with dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> only in subjects with concomitant prominent reflux <b>symptoms.</b> Peptic ulcer (PU) was present in 8. 8 of subjects with dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> without reflux <b>symptoms</b> and similarly in 9. 4 of those with prominent reflux <b>symptoms.</b> Subjects with dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> and concomitant prominent reflux <b>symptoms</b> had an increased risk of having an underlying PU (odds ratio 2. 74, 95 confidence interval 1. 30 - 5. 78). Conclustions: Almost three-quarters of subjects with dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> do not have endoscopic findings and, in addition, esophagitis may not be the cause of dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> in subjects without prominent reflux <b>symptoms.</b> PU may be the cause of dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> in a subgroup of subjects with prominent reflux <b>symptoms.</b> Â© 2010 by the American College of Gastroenterology...|$|R
