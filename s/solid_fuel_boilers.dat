The steam demand {{is covered by}} a recovery <b>boiler</b> and a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> (consists of two parallel <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> furnaces and a boiler). Adjustments in steam production are foremost made by the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> Previously made energy-reducing measures at the mill has lowered the steam demand which forces the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> to low steam production. The <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> produces over 25 GWH/year and is therefor bound by the Swedish nitrous oxide charge, but is also restricted to a monthly mean value of 70 mg/MJ. This mean value was exceeded in July 2016, which {{is thought to be}} a result of forced limitation in steam production. NOx emissions are reduced secondarily by an urea-based SNCR-system where its efficiency depends on several parameters, foremost sufficiently high flue gas temperatures. This work has identified parameters that effects foremost hydrogen-based combustion emission from the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> This was achieved by evaluating historical data and by conducting tests during operation of the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler,</b> which was planned and evaluated using a software called MODDE. Emission reducing measures and recommended ways to operate the boiler was then presented from the collected data. Practical measures including down-winding supply machinery of secondary air and replacement of urea injection showed no tendencies in reducing NOx emissions. However, complete shut down of one the furnaces produced at least 100 °C higher flue gas temperatures produced from the active furnace. Low NOx emissions was noted when secondary air was supplied from machinery with original speed. therefor, during stretched periods with low steam production, it's recommended that: Only one furnace should be active as steam producer, urea should be injected at its original placement in the flue gas chamber close the furnace and that secondary air should be supplied by machinery with original speed. Comparison test made in this work showed that this way of operating the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> could reduce NOx emissions with 45 % compared to mean NOx emissions at low steam production in July 2016...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop the {{knowledge}} about nonlinear and/or adaptive <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> control at Vattenfall Utveckling AB. The aim is also to make a study of implemented and published control strategies. A <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> is a large-scale heat (and power) generating plant. The Idbäcken boiler studied in this work, is a one hundred MW furnace mainly fired with wood chips. The control system consists of several linear PID controllers working together, and the furnace is a nonlinear system. That, {{and the fact that}} the fuel-flow is not monitored, are the main reasons for the control problems. The system fluctuates periodically and the CO outlets sometimes rise high above the permitted level. There is little work done in the area of advanced boiler control, but some interesting approaches are described in scientific articles. MPC (Model Predictive Control), nonlinear system identification using ANN (Artificial Neural Network), fuzzy logic, Hµ loop shaping and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) PID tuning methods have been tested with good results. Both linear and nonlinear system identification is performed in the thesis. The linear models are able to explain about forty percent of the system behavior and the nonlinear models explain about sixty to eighty percent. The main result is that nonlinear models improve the performance and that there are considerable disturbances complicating the identification.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{public interest in}} developing a sustainable biobased economy that favors support of family farms and rural communities and also promotes the development of biorenewable energy resources. This study focuses {{on a number of}} questions related to the development and exploration of new pathways that can potentially move us toward a more sustainable biobased economy. These include issues related to biomass fuels for drying grain, economies-of-scale, new biomass harvest systems, sugar-to-ethanol crop alternatives for the Upper Midwest U. S., biomass transportation, post-harvest biomass processing and double cropping production scenarios designed to maximize biomass feedstock production. For each question of interest, specific examples were identified and detailed models developed in MS Excel 3 ̆c® 3 ̆e. Techno-economic analysis and Monte Carlo simulation techniques were used to challenge each model and evaluate viability. The first section of this study considers post-harvest drying of shelled corn grain both at farm-scale and at larger community-scaled installations. Currently, drying of shelled corn requires large amounts of fossil fuel energy. To address future energy concerns, this study evaluates the potential use of combined heat and power systems that use the combustion of corn stover to produce steam for drying and to generate electricity for fans, augers, and control components. Techno-economic analysis suggests that there are significant economies of scale with community-based dryers, e. g. grain elevators, which show a much faster return on investment over farm-scaled systems. Because of the large capital requirements for <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boilers</b> and steam turbines/engines, both farm-scale and larger grain elevator-scaled systems benefit by sharing boiler and power infrastructure with other processes. The second and third sections evaluate sweet sorghum as a possible 2 ̆ 2 sugarcane-like 2 ̆ 2 crop that can be grown in the Upper Midwest. Various harvest systems are considered including a prototype mobile juice harvester, a hypothetical one-pass unit that separates grain heads from chopped stalks and traditional forage/silage harvesters. Also evaluated were post-harvest transportation, storage and processing costs and their influence on the possible use of sweet sorghum as a supplemental feedstock for existing dry-grind ethanol plants located in the Upper Midwest. Results show that the concept of a mobile juice harvester is not economically viable due to low sugar recovery. However, traditional forage/silage harvest systems provide an economically viable harvest solution as long as chopped forage can be quickly processed in a nearby, centralized facility. The transportation of low bulk density, fresh harvested or ensiled sweet sorghum was found to significantly contribute to overall costs. However, at the scales evaluated in this study, those costs did not adversely affect the viability of sweet sorghum as a supplemental feed for existing dry-grind ethanol plant. The addition of front-end stalk processing/pressing equipment into existing ethanol facilities was also found to be economically viable when combined with the plants 2 ̆ 7 use of residuals as a natural gas fuel replacement. Because of high loss of fermentable carbohydrates during ensilage, storage of sweet sorghum in bunkers was not found to be economically viable. The forth section looks at double cropping winter triticale with late-planted summer corn and compares these scenarios to traditional single cropped corn. Double cropping systems show particular promise for co-production of grain and biomass feedstocks and potentially can allow for greater utilization of grain crop residues. However, additional costs and risks associated with producing two crops instead of one could make biomass-double crops less attractive for producers despite productivity advantages. Detailed evaluation and comparisons show double cropped triticale-corn to be at a significant economic disadvantage relative to single crop corn. The cost benefits associated with using less equipment combined with availability of risk mitigating crop insurance and government subsidies will likely limit farmer interest and clearly indicate that traditional single-crop corn will provide greater financial returns to management. To evaluate the various sweet sorghum, single crop corn and double cropped triticale-corn production scenarios, a detailed but generic model was developed. The primary goal of this generic approach was to develop a modeling foundation that can be rapidly adapted, by an experienced user, to describe new and existing biomass and crop production scenarios that may be of interest to researchers. To facilitate ease-of-use, the techno-economic model was developed in MS Excel 3 ̆c® 3 ̆e. It also incorporates the Excel add-on, Crystal Ball 3 ̆c® 3 ̆e, which provides Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis capabilities. The foundation model allows input of management practices, crop production characteristics and utilizes standardized machinery performance and cost information, including farm-owned machinery and implements, and machinery and farm production operations provided by custom operators. Several of the studies reported in this dissertation take advantage of the flexibility of the foundation model. Many specific models of unique production scenarios (in excess of 100) were developed and tested. Twenty of these models are actually presented in this work. More important to the success and value of this modeling approach is the now readily available Monte Carlo simulation tools, which allows researchers to describe uncertainty around key model variable in a more realistic manner. It is opinion of the author that all future crop related techno-economic studies should incorporate Monte Carlo simulations as standard practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to create}} a dynamic model for the {{processes}} in a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> of the moving grate type. Another aim with the model was to keep it as simple as possible but still able to catch the dynamics of the processes in the bedplate of the boiler. The creation of the model had its origin from drying and combustion equations used in earlier modeling work of boilers. The represented model has been used to simulate different kinds of disturbances in a boiler and different ways to control the boiler. These tests show that controlling a number of parameters in the bed of the boiler is an effective way to keep the grate stable during disturbances. This is important since an unstable bed causes high emissions. The model has not been formally validated but its behavior is accordingly to what is expected of a real boiler...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a change in}} the Scottish forestry policy from the exogenous to the endogenous development approach, and feasibility of heat entrepreneurship based on locally produced woodfuels in the Highlands of Scotland. The cost structure and heat pricing {{in the case of an}} 800  kW <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> is presented, and the profitability of local heat entrepreneurship is analysed with scenarios of different investment costs and fuel prices. The results indicate that a district heating (DH) system, using locally produced woodchips, could produce heat at a lower price than single-house heating systems using light fuel oil. The profitability of replacing existing heating units by investing in a new district heating (DH) scheme is very dependent on the available investment support, price level of woodchips and substituted light fuel oil, and the amount of sold energy. In the case of an 800  kW DH scheme, and woodchip prices of 14 and 22  €/MWh, investments should remain under break-even points of 280 and 420  €/kW of heating power (230, 000 - 335, 000 €). ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{considerations}} that might cause lower efficiency in the dust collection system on boilers. One {{of the reasons is}} the deterioration of a dust collection system. Even properly designed systems from reputable suppliers may show a decrease in performance characteristics due to wear and poor maintenance. In principle, the dust collector is like any other equipment, requiring regular maintenance, servicing, evaluation and testing to ensure its operation is efficient and optimal. Poor awareness among the millers who only focus on maximizing mill productivity and who try to minimize the cost of production, instead of investing in high-efficiency pollution control system and good maintenance practice to protect the environment, is a major concern. The reason might be that there is no return or profit from the investment; it is merely a requirement of the Clean Air Regulation of 1978. Because of this, many mills simply use low-cost dust collectors just to fulfil the basic requirement of having a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> Furthermore, improper design of dust collection systems, including poor quality control of material, can shorten the lifespan or increase the deterioration rate of a dust collection system, or it might even escalate the problem. For example, putting a wet scrubber instead of dry mechanical cyclone after a biomass boiler might create further problem since wastewater needs an extra wastewater treatment system to prevent water pollution problems.|$|R

40|$|This {{model is}} {{applicable}} in designing and investigating the power controllers (water temperature in <b>boiler)</b> of <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> gas generation <b>boilers.</b> The electro-analogy of thermal processes is applied {{in order to}} construct boiler models. Electro-analogical model of boiler consist of current source, which models the remaining boiler heat, when the air is not compulsory supplied (fan is off); current source, which models the change of boiler capacity proportionally to air debit blown by fan; current source, which models the workload of boiler; electric volume (condenser), which model the total heat volume of boiler; delay line, which models the delay of the change of water temperature in boiler subject to the change of blown air. In order to establish the model rates, experimental researches on 25 kW and 31. 5 kW nominal capacity boilers “Astra G” were carried out. During these experiments, working characteristics of two-position-controllable boilers (fan is off and on) under different capacity work loads were registered.

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} on the system performance of different biomass pretreatment methods before gasification and subsequent production of Fischer-Tropsch crude is considered. Entrained flow gasification at high pressure is a well proven technology for coal as feedstock {{with the benefit of}} producing a practically tar free raw gas with a close to complete carbon conversion. The short residence time in this type of gasifier requires a fuel, which is relatively dry and has a small particle size, to be pressurized from ambient conditions up to 20 - 50 bar. The small particle size can be acquired by grinding but this is highly energy intensive and feeding is challenging. Torrefaction is a thermal pretreatment method carried out at around 300 °C which makes the biomass easier to grind, thus requiring less electricity, and makes the material less fibrous, while on the other hand requiring heat for the process. Pyrolysis is a process carried out at around 500 °C which lets the biomass decompose into a gaseous, a liquid and a solid part. The solid part can be grinded and fed into the gasifier together with the liquid and gaseous phases. This will further facilitate the feeding but with a further increased heat demand compared to torrefaction. The different pretreatment methods and their impact on the overall biorefinery energy system have been studied and evaluated using process integration methodology. The results show that the excess heat from an FT process with a biomass input of 300 MW(HHV) can replace the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> in a large chemical pulp and paper mill. With the preconditions given for this study, thermal pretreatment of the biomass can be beneficial in terms of system thermal efficiency...|$|R
