The channel estimation process is divided into two main phases. The relay-destination channel is estimated in the ﬁrst phase and can be obtained using well known point-to-point MIMO OFDM estimation methods. In the second phase, the source-relay channel is estimated at the destination {{with the use of a}} known training sequence that is transmitted from the source and forwarded to the destination by a non-regenerative relay. To obtain an estimate of the source-relay channel, the source training <b>sequence,</b> <b>relay</b> precoder, and destination processor, require to be optimised. To solve this problem we derive an iterative algorithm that involves sequentially solving a number of convex optimisation problems to update the source, relay, and destination design variables. Since the iterative algorithm may be too computationally expensive for practical implementation we then derive simpliﬁed solutions that have reduced computational complexity.

40|$|This thesis studies {{two issues}} for the two-way (TW) the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems (TWMRS), namely channel {{estimation}} techniques and the training sequence design. The training based two-step channel estimation scheme has been proposed for two-way MIMO relay systems over uncorrelated Rayleigh channels. For a TWMRS with multiple relay antennas, {{the structure of the}} channel matrices is analyzed and can be estimated by one by one deriving the channel estimators related to each relay antenna in the equivalent one-way MIMO relay systems (OWMRS). For the proposed channel estimation scheme, we estimate the forward channel during the first phase by using linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) method. During the second phase for the composite channel estimation, singular value decomposition (SVD) based maximum likelihood (ML) method is applied in two-way relay systems, which is extended from OWMRS. Therefore, the backward channel estimator is derived with the given forward channel and composite channel estimators. For the training <b>sequence</b> and <b>relay</b> gain design, due to the nonlinearity of the estimators and the closed form of mean square error (MSE) is unavailable, we propose a novel criterion based on Bayesian Cramér-rao Lower Bound (BCRLB) since BCRLB has been shown to tightly lower bound on the estimation MSE. The proposed novel criterion scheme aims to minimizes the trace of the asymptote BCRLB with respect to the individual channels. The BCRLB based training <b>sequences</b> and <b>relay</b> gain are though suboptimal, they are more tractable and amenable to handle, where the optimization process is efficiently performed under scalar variables. The numerical results have shown that the proposed channel estimation scheme with the BCRLB relay gain and training sequences has improved the MSE performance. Moreover, though the BCRLB based training <b>sequences</b> and <b>relay</b> gain are proposed for individual channels, the MSE performance for the composite channel estimator has also been improved. For correlated TWMRS, we consider two cases under white noise and colored disturbance respectively. For the first case, the channel estimators are derived by using a joint method, which is based on LMMSE and maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods. The training sequences for the second stage are proposed based on a novel approximated BCRLB criterion. For the second case, a novel two stage channel estimation scheme has been proposed. At the first stage, the backward channels are estimated with employment of LMMSE method. Subsequently, the optimal training sequence is straightforwardly derived with MSE criterion. For forward channel estimation, which is performed at the second stage, the estimators are obtained with the known estimated backward channels and the estimation error viewed as random variable. For training signal design at the second stage, a novel criterion has been proposed which is based on the asymptotic MSE conditioned on the estimated backward channels. Subsequently, the novel structure of the training sequences has been proposed. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed training sequences can improve the MSE performance under both high and low spatial correlation channels. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Many {{emerging}} applications {{based on}} wireless networks involve distributed control. This implies high requirements on reliability, {{but also on}} predictable maximum delay. Further, for applications, {{it is vital to}} use off-the-shelf components, both due to cost constraints and requirements on interoperability with existing networks. This, in turn, implies that concurrent transmissions and multiuser detection are seldom possible. Instead, half-duplex time-division multiple access (TDMA) is typically used. Aiming to reduce the packet error rate given a deadline (a set of TDMA time-slots), this thesis proposes a relaying scheme, which can be implemented on top of off-the-shelf components. The relaying scheme selects the best sequence of relayers, given the number of time-slots allowed by the deadline, such that the resulting error probability is minimized at the targeted receiver(s). The scheme differs from existing work in that it considers both unicast as well as broadcast and assumes that all nodes can overhear each other, as opposed to separating source nodes, relay nodes and destination nodes into three disjoint sets. A full analysis of the resulting error probability is provided and complementary numerical results show that the proposed <b>relay</b> <b>sequencing</b> strategy significantly improves reliability given a certain maximum delay, or alternatively, reduces the delay, given a certain target reliability requirement. To illustrate the performance improvements of <b>relay</b> <b>sequencing,</b> it is incorporated in a platooning application. If the decision regarding which relayer to assign in each time-slot can be taken online, just before the transmission, much can be gained. To this end, a low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is shown to be highly likely to find the optimal combination of relaying nodes that minimizes the resulting error probability at the targeted receiver(s). Data packets in wireless automation networks is typically small. To enable timely and reliable all-to-all broadcast in such systems, <b>relay</b> <b>sequencing</b> using packet aggregation is proposed. The strategy assigns relayers to time slots, as well as determines which packets to aggregate in each slot, using the proposed low-complexity algorithm. To further increase the reliability, a clustering scheme is proposed. When a relayer in the sequence fails to overhear a correct copy, a backup relayer in the cluster takes over. This work thereby enables ultra-reliable communications with maintained end-toend delay using low-complexity techniques and off-the-shelf components...|$|R

This sequence gives correlation signals split by small (LR) J(CC), which seriously suffers from residual center signal. The unwanted signal is due to long-range C-H couplings ((LR) J(CH)).

40|$|Abstract—Channel {{estimation}} in {{the presence}} of frequency off-sets is developed for cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. A two-time-slot cooperative chan-nel estimation protocol is proposed. The source broadcasts the training <b>sequence</b> to the <b>relays</b> and the destination (first time slot), and the relays retransmit the training sequence (second time slot). Pilot designs for amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relays are derived. These designs eliminate interre-lay interference (IRI), which occurs due to the simultaneous relay retransmissions, and minimize the mean square error (MSE). Consequently, the number of AF and DF relays is constrained to be less than N/(2 L − 1) and N/L, respectively, where N is the total number of subcarriers, L is the channel order, and a is the maximum integer part of a. The pairwise error probability (PEP) of orthogonal space–time coding in cooperative OFDM due to both frequency offset and channel-estimation errors is also evaluated. The optimal power allocation ratio between the source and the relays to minimize the PEP is derived for AF and DF relays. When L < 16, DF relays outperform AF relays in terms of PEP. With L = 4 and 16 active relays, the gap is 9 dB for a frequency offset error variance of 10 − 3, and this gap increases to about 11. 3 dB when the variance increases to 10 − 2.

30|$|Multiple input {{multiple}} output (MIMO) {{systems are}} being applied into many wireless systems {{to increase the}} channel capacity. In {{order to maintain the}} high channel capacity while saving transmit powers and sharing spectrum, multiple hop MIMO relay systems (MHMRSs) are taken into account. MHMRSs have been analyzed in both decode and forward (DF) [8, 9] and amplify and forward (AF) [10, 11] schemes. We have optimized that distances between each transceiver transmit powers of every transmitter to improve the performance of MHMRSs whether there is a control on MAC layer [12, 13] or not [14]. A problem of MHMRSs is the co-channel interference from adjacent relays that let the performance of MHMRSs deteriorate. In order to avoid the co-channel interference, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA) and so on have been proposed. According to TDMA, FDMA, or CDMA, the co-channel interference is avoided; however, the channel capacity of multiple hop systems is deteriorated due to considerably small allocation time, small bandwidth, or long length of <b>sequence</b> for every <b>relay</b> [12, 13, 15, 16]. There are several researches that use properties of MIMO to cancel the co-channel interference of adjacent relays, such as a dirty paper coding (DPC), zero forcing (ZF) [17], network coding (NC) [18] and so on. Additionally, a smart antenna technology has been proposed, by controlling antennas combining weight to be orthogonal to the interference signal and to be matched to the desired signal, the co-channel interference is reduced, and a diversity gain is achieved. As a result, the channel capacity of systems is improved [19, 20]. The matched/orthogonal weight algorithm can avoid the co-channel interference and supply link multiplexing simultaneously in a single channel. Every relay can transmit data to bi-direction in the same channel, and the channel capacity is improved by means of network- oriented MIMO interference cancellation that cannot be achieved by TDMA-based smart antenna MIMO networks. However, a relay should design its weights to be orthogonal to two interference signals and to be marched to two desired signals from adjacent relays. Therefore, the relay should have at least three antenna elements, and it is unavailable to small devices, such as mobile phones, vital sensors and so on. Furthermore, the interference from two adjacent relays is cancelled; however, the co-channel interference from other relays still affects the performance of MHMRSs.|$|R

The Isle of Wight Monocline {{is the result of}} the interplay between two inverted east–west trending, southerly dipping and overlapping down-to-the-south major syndepositional normal faults that were active during Triassic and Jurassic times: the Needles and Sandown faults. The area between the two faults tips forms an easterly-dipping relay ramp, down which sequences of all ages thicken. Both of these major normal faults were inverted during Cenozoic (Miocene: Alpine) compressional events, folding the overlying post-rift sequences of early Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (Palaeogene) age. Interpretation of the seismic reflection data suggest that previously unknown high angle, down-to-the-north reverse faults cut the northern limbs of both anticlines forming the composite monocline and are likely to come to crop in the steeply-dipping Chalk and/or the drift-covered Cenozoic sequences. Their identification marked a period of discussions and testing of the model by detailed field mapping. The existence and location of such faulting was proved through an iterative process with the result that a reverse fault zone is now mapped along the northern limb of the northern Sandown Anticline section of the Monocline. The main reverse faults on the Brighstone and Sandown anticlines result in up to circa 550 m of displacement at top Chalk level. It is thought that a series of smaller footwall short-cut faults affect the Cenozoic strata to the north of the main reverse fault, producing up-faulted sections of flatter-lying Cenozoic strata. Reverse displacements and the severity of folding on the inverted faults decreases on each fault segment in a complementary fashion in the area of the relay ramp as one fault takes up the movement at the expense of the other. The swing in strike of the Chalk in the area of shallowly dipping strata between Calbourne and Garstons is a result of deformation of the post-rift <b>sequences</b> across the <b>relay</b> ramp established between the overlapping fault tips of the Needles and Sandown faults and the interaction of the folds developed at the tips of the reverse faults. ...|$|R
