5000|$|Federer next {{played in}} the Swiss Indoors. He {{defeated}} Adrian Mannarino {{in the first round}} in straight sets, and then came back from a one-set deficit against Denis Istomin in under two hours. In the quarterfinal, Roger Federer faced Grigor Dimitrov, nicknamed [...] "Baby Federer", for the first time. Dimitrov was defeated in straight sets, but Federer had to recover from a <b>service</b> <b>break</b> down and force a tie-break decision in the second set. In the semifinal round, Federer defeated Vasek Pospisil in a very tight three-setter. After winning the first set comfortably by breaking Pospisil's serve twice, Federer served for the match in the second set but squandered the opportunity. Then, Federer's serve was broken early in the deciding set, but he managed to return the <b>service</b> <b>break</b> and was able to serve for the match successfully at his second chance. Federer faced Juan Martín del Potro for the title, in a repeat of the previous year's final that saw del Potro emerge again victorious. He fell short again in another three-set battle against the Argentine. Despite the loss, the match saw Federer display significant improvement in form after a sluggish run to the final.|$|E

50|$|Playing singles only, Erakovic {{returned}} to the tour at the 2015 Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati where, in a scrappy first-round qualifying match that saw more service breaks than holds, she lost to Kurumi Nara, 6-4, 6-3. She also played singles only at the final tournament before the U.S. Open, the 2015 Connecticut Open. She beat Lucie Hradecká {{in the first round}} of qualifying, Erakovic winning the first set 6-4, and losing the second 6-3. They had a <b>service</b> <b>break</b> each early in the third set, then held serve until the tenth game of the set, when Erakovic broke to win the match 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.She had identical scorelines for the first two sets against Olga Savchuk in the second round of qualifying, then broke Savchuk's first service game of the third set to lead 3-0. However, she dropped her own service when leading 4-2, and games then went with service until Erakovic was broken to love to make the score 6-5 in favour of Savchuk. The latter then served out to love to win the match 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.|$|E
50|$|Erakovic {{scored the}} very first point of the tournament as play began at Wimbledon but, as she did with Belinda Bencic at Charleston, again found a {{stumbling}} block in a top junior. This time it was Croatian Ana Konjuh who prevailed in three sets, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0. Ranked 17th in the doubles, and therefore one place outside the seedings, Erakovic and Parra Santonja were drawn {{in the first round}} against the 12th seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova, who had defeated them so easily at Charleston. Although this match was much closer, the result was the same, with Medina Garrigues and Shvedova winning 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. A disappointing week at Wimbledon came to a close when she lost {{in the first round of}} the mixed doubles. Partnered with South African Raven Klaase, there was only one <b>service</b> <b>break</b> in the entire match against the British pair of Dominic Inglot and Johanna Konta. That was enough to produce a final scoreline of 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. For the trivia buffs, it was the first time on the senior tour that Erakovic had played against someone with the same birthday, Inglot also being born on 6 March.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} Quarterfinal match of the women's side saw Justine Henin and Nadia Petrova. In {{the first set}} Henin broke to lead 3-2 but Petrova broke back at the eighth game to put it 4-4. Henin then served for the set at 5-4 but was broken back then it went to a tie-break, which Henin won 7-3. In the second set Petrova led 3-0 with two <b>service</b> <b>break</b> but let Henin back in as Henin broke back to lead 4-3. They then stayed on serve until the 12th game where Henin broke the Petrova serve to win the set 7-5 and the match. The match was {{followed}} by an encounter between Maria Kirilenko and Zheng Jie. The first set went lopsided as Zheng won five straight games after 1-1 to take the set 6-1. Kirilenko then received treatment for her leg after the first set. In the second set Zheng broke immediately {{in the first game}} to lead 1-0 and then stayed on serve to 5-3. At the 10th game Kirilenko double faulted at match point to give Zheng the match 6-1 6-3.|$|E

50|$|Kunitsyn {{is arguably}} {{best known for}} two matches against compatriot Marat Safin. The first of which was at the 2007 Tennis Channel Open's round robin stage. Kunitsyn had won the first set, and had an early break in the 2nd before Safin fought back and then got a 5-3 lead. While serving for the match, Kunitsyn broke Safin and then held {{to get it to}} 5-5. The set went to a tiebreaker which Safin won. Kunitsyn was still dangerous, as he won the first 3 games of the 3rd set, before losing the next 4. Kunitsyn {{performed}} the same as before, and broke Safin again to get the set on equal terms. At 5-5, Kunitsyn suffered a <b>service</b> <b>break</b> and Safin ultimately won the 3rd set 7-5. The pair met again in the final of the Kremlin Cup, an ATP tournament played in Moscow, which is to date Kunitsyn's only tour final and was Safin's last appearance in an ATP final before his retirement in 2010. In what was a considerable upset, Kunitsyn defeated the former two-time Grand Slam winner and world no. 1, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 for his first and, to date, only professional title.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Federer {{defeated}} Rafael Nadal in a five-set match, 6−4, 3−6, 6−1, 3−6, 6−3 {{extending his}} {{record for the}} most Grand Slams won in men's singles to 18 and becoming the first man ever to win at least 5 times in 3 different Grand Slam tournaments each. Nadal was leading the fifth set after breaking Federer's service in the first game, but Federer mounted a comeback, breaking back and then going up another <b>service</b> <b>break.</b> The Swiss held {{on to win the}} set and match for his first Major victory over Nadal since the 2007 Wimbledon Championships. Federer, brought to tears when Nadal's challenge to a forehand winner on championship point was ruled unsuccessful, admitted after the match that he would have been [...] "happy to lose" [...] and said, [...] "Tennis is a tough sport, there are no draws but if {{there was going to be}} one I would have been very happy to accept a draw tonight and share it with Rafa." [...] The 2017 Australian Open men singles final between Federer and Nadal was the most highly anticipated tennis match in not only the tournament's history but also all of Grand Slam and tennis history.|$|E
50|$|The last tournament {{before the}} U.S. Open was the Premier level 2014 Connecticut Open, where Erakovic faced Caroline Garcia {{in the first}} round of {{qualifying}} singles. Garcia, the third seed in the qualifying tournament, was the winner for the first time in their four meetings, taking the match in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, with only one <b>service</b> <b>break</b> in each set. The doubles was a different story, with Erakovic and Parra Santonja having nail-biting wins in all three matches on the way to the final. They did not manage even one point against the serve of Garbiñe Muguruza and Carla Suárez Navarro in the first set of their first-round match, but eventually did enough to win 10-6 in the super tie-break. The second match (quarter-final) was against their old foes Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova. Down 0-5, 0-40 in the first set, they were able to win that game (although losing the next) before going on to win another super tie-break 10-7. It became three super tie-breaks from three when beating Caroline Garcia and Monica Niculescu in the semi-final, clawing their way back from 3-8 in the final set to level at 9-all, then going on to win 11-9.|$|E
5|$|The Bryan {{brothers}} faced Fisher and Huss in {{the first}} semifinal and lost, ending their streak of winning 13 consecutive matches. Mirnyi and Ram encountered much harder competition against Knowle and Melzer and saved five match points before winning. In the final, there were no <b>service</b> <b>breaks</b> {{in the first}} set, with Fisher and Huss winning it in the tiebreak. Mirnyi and Ram came back strong to win the second set. The match-tiebreak decided {{the outcome of the}} final, with Mirnyi and Ram winning the tiebreak and the match. It was Mirnyi's 36th and Ram's 16th men's doubles title of the career and their second title as a team.|$|R

50|$|In the singles, Erakovic {{started with}} an epic three-hour {{marathon}} against María Teresa Torró Flor. Breaking the Spaniard's serve twice, and holding three set points {{on her own}} serve at 5-2, 40-0, Erakovic served three consecutive double faults as she dropped that game, and her next, before Torró Flor won a 14-point game to go ahead 6-5. Erakovic held serve to force the tie-break where, despite dropping four of her own serves in a row, she finally prevailed 10-8. It was a similar story in the second set as both players dropped serve twice {{on the way to}} another tie-break. Between them, the pair won only three of their service points as Torró Flor, having held three set points, eventually won 7-5. The third set was rather more straightforward as Erakovic broke Torró Flor's serve twice {{on the way to a}} final score of 7-6 (8), 6-7 (5), 6-2. Her second round match against Petra Martic was half an hour shorter, again featuring a first set tie-break. Five double faults at inopportune times through the set saw Martic eventually take the tie-break 7-2, but it was a different story in the second set. Erakovic served much better, and was able to take the only <b>service</b> <b>break</b> in the set. Martic was much the stronger in the deciding set, however, breaking Erakovic twice to run out the winner 7-6 (2), 5-7, 6-2.|$|E
50|$|In the doubles, Erakovic {{teamed up}} with Spaniard Sílvia Soler Espinosa {{for the first time}} in close to ten years. In the first round they were drawn against local wild cards Sacha Jones and Rosie Cheng. After losing the first two games they won the next six, and the set. The second set was closer, {{eventually}} going to a tie-break, but the far more experienced pair prevailed comfortably in the finish, the final score being 6-2, 7-6 (1). Their second round (quarter-final) was against the second seeds Julia Görges and Katarina Srebotnik. The first three service games were all lost, and it was Soler-Espinosa holding serve that saw them eventually take the first set. She dropped both her second and third service games in the second set, however, as the seeds bounced back to level the match. Erakovic and Soler-Espinosa raced away to a 6-1 lead in the match tie-break, losing only two points on their own service as they eventually won 6-4, 4-6, 10-7. The semi-final was against Danka Kovinic and Barbora Strýcová, and an inability to convert break points cost Erakovic and Soler-Espinosa dearly. They missed three in the very first game, eventually gaining only two of the ten offered. Kovinic and Strýcová fared slightly better, claiming three of eight break points to take the set 6-4. With only one <b>service</b> <b>break</b> apiece, the second set was much tighter. With Erakovic serving to stay in the match at 4-5, she was 15-30 down when rain forced a halt, the match resuming the following day. Kovinic and Strýcová took only a couple of minutes to get the two points they needed to win the match, 6-4, 6-4.|$|E

The objective of this project was to explore the concepts of volunteerism, community service, service learning, and alternative break trips, and {{to determine whether a}} reorientation process is important for making a student’s experience more meaningful and what specific parts of a reorientation are important. 12 <b>service</b> <b>break</b> leaders participated in a survey about the reorientation process at their school. The surveys were conducted in an interview fashion and the data was analyzed to extract major themes about reorientation and its importance.
