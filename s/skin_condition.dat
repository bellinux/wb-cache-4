An uncommon but severe breed-specific <b>skin</b> <b>condition,</b> hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E

40|$|Lauren L Levy, Jason J EmerDepartment of Dermatology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USABackground: Recent studies {{highlighting}} the psychological benefits of medical treatment for dermatological <b>skin</b> <b>conditions</b> have demonstrated a clear role for medical therapy in psychological health. <b>Skin</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{particularly those that}} are overtly visible, such as those located on the face, neck, and hands, often {{have a profound effect}} on the daily functioning of those affected. The literature documents significant emotional benefits using medical therapy in conditions such as acne, psoriasis, vitiligo, and rosacea, but there is little evidence documenting similar results with the use of cosmetic camouflage. Here we present a review {{highlighting the}} practical use of cosmetic camouflage makeup in patients with facial <b>skin</b> <b>conditions</b> and review its implications for psychological health. Methods: A search of the Medline and Scopus databases was performed to identify articles documenting the emotional benefit of cosmetic camouflage. Results: Cosmetic camouflage provides a significant emotional benefit for patients with facial <b>skin</b> <b>conditions,</b> and this is substantiated by a literature review and personal experience. More clinical studies are needed to assess and validate the findings reported here. Conclusion: Patients with visible <b>skin</b> <b>conditions</b> have increased rates of depression, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. It is prudent for us to consider therapies that can offer rapid and dramatic results, such as cosmetic camouflage.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of the thesis is a meta-analytic review {{investigating}} the effectiveness of psychological interventions for <b>skin</b> <b>conditions.</b> Twenty-one controlled trials are included and results indicate a medium average effect size of psychological interventions on outcomes relating to itch/scratch and outcomes relating to psychosocial functioning and a small average effect size on outcomes relating to skin severity. The overall average effect of psychological interventions on <b>skin</b> <b>conditions</b> {{was found to be}} medium. Ten moderating variables relating to the type of <b>skin</b> <b>conditions,</b> the nature of the interventions and methodological characteristics of the studies were also investigated. The review concluded that psychological interventions have a beneficial effect on <b>skin</b> <b>conditions.</b> Recommendations for future research and clinical practice are explored. There is extensive literature linking the distress experienced by people with <b>skin</b> <b>conditions</b> to social anxiety. As attentional biases are implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of social anxiety, {{the second part of the}} thesis investigates their presence in people with <b>skin</b> <b>conditions</b> and matched controls, using the Visual Dot Probe task. To explore what factors predict attentional biases, measures of social anxiety, appearance concerns, shame and self-esteem were administered. An attentional bias was found away from positive words, however no attentional biases were found towards social and appearance threat words. Low levels of shame and self-esteem predicted the attentional bias away from positive words. No other factors predicted variance in response latencies to the word groups.
