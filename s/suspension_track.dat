50|$|The <b>suspension</b> <b>track</b> is {{slightly}} wider on the V8S achieved with revised wishbones {{at the front}} and revised trailing arms at the rear. Disc brakes are fitted all round.|$|E
50|$|They {{developed}} {{different versions}} of the vehicle that could run over or under a single rail, allowing bi-directional travel on a single guideway. This reduces the trackage, otherwise considered an eyesore. The new design first ran on 6 March 1971, and a test track was set up at Rohr's Chula Vista, California plants, consisting of a loop of bottom-running <b>suspension</b> <b>track</b> and a separate grade-level top-running track and one offline station.|$|E

30|$|The vehicle speed, vehicle <b>suspension</b> {{parameters}}, and <b>track</b> support parameters strongly {{affect the}} vibration of the vehicle–track coupled system. This section analyzes {{the effects of}} the vehicle speed, vehicle <b>suspension</b> parameters, and <b>track</b> support parameters on the vehicle–track coupled system.|$|R
50|$|The final entry {{was from}} Leyland and Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon (BRC&W). Their design {{was similar to}} the Nuffield, but with {{different}} <b>suspension</b> and <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the Surf/4Runner {{underwent}} a major front suspension design change {{as it was}} changed from a solid front axle to the Hi-Trac independent front <b>suspension.</b> <b>Track</b> width was also increased by three inches. These changes made the trucks more comfortable on-road, and improved stability and handling. The new suspension also increased the space in the engine compartment (necessary to fit larger engines, such as the V6 introduced in 1987) but arguably decreased the truck's off-road capabilities. The North American specification Toyota Pickup also adopted this new suspension, but the regular Hilux for other markets at this point retained the more rugged and capable, if less refined, solid axle configuration. With the 1986 update, the Surf/4Runner grille changed from the three segment type to the two segment grille. Tops were color-matched on blue, red and some gold models, while other body colors were still sold with black or white tops.|$|E
30|$|This paper, {{based on}} the {{existing}} research results, introduced of a feedback mechanism with the active control of the suspension controller and used finite element method to build the bridge structure model. The maglev vehicle is simplified as a vertical model with 12 degrees of freedom and secondary <b>suspension.</b> <b>Track</b> irregularity is also considered. The vertical coupling vibration analysis model of the maglev car bridge is established.|$|E
40|$|Several {{projects}} that {{have demonstrated the}} advantages of using thick composite armor technology for structural applications in armored combat vehicles are discussed. The first involved composite cargo doors for the Marine Corps LVTP- 7 amphibious landing vehicle. Another was a demonstration composite turret that offered a weight reduction of 15. 5 percent. The advantages of this composite armor compared to metallic armors used for combat vehicle hull and turret applications are reduced weight at equal ballistic protection; reduced back armor spall; excellent corrosion resistance; reduced production costs by parts consolidation; and inherent thermal and acoustic insulative properties. Based on the encouraging results of these past programs, the Demonstration Composite Hull Program was started in September 1986. To demonstrate this composite armor technology, the Army's newest infantry fighting vehicle, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV), was selected as a model. A composite infantry fighting vehicle, designated the CIFV for this program, has been designed and fabricated and is currently undergoing a 6000 mile field endurance test. The CIFV demonstration vehicle uses the BFV engine, transmission, <b>suspension,</b> <b>track</b> and other equipment...|$|E
50|$|The Type 75 130 mm Multiple Rocket Launcher (nana-go-shiki-130mm-jisou-ta-rensou-Rocket-dan-hassya-ki) was {{developed}} to carry the 130 mm rocket system developed by the Aerospace Division of the Nissan Motor Company. It used the <b>suspension,</b> <b>tracks</b> and diesel engine of the Type 73 Armored Personnel Carrier. Komatsu {{was responsible for the}} chassis and IHI Aerospace, as Nissan's Aerospace Division has since been renamed, for the launcher and its rockets. 15 Type 75 wind measurement vehicles were built on the same chassis to provide weather information for the rockets.|$|R
50|$|Following the Great War, many {{experiments}} involving {{armoured vehicles}} {{were conducted in}} the United Kingdom. Particularly many advances {{were made in the}} areas of <b>suspensions,</b> <b>tracks,</b> communications, and the organization of these vehicles on the battlefield. Britain continued its technical dominance of tank design from 1915 through to at least the early 1930s. British designs, particularly those from Vickers-Armstrong, formed the basis for many of the most common tanks of the 1930s and early WWII. The six-tonner, which was arguably the most influential design of the late 1920s, was not adopted by the British Army.|$|R
50|$|To be able {{to drive}} off the pavement, {{off-road}} vehicles need several characteristics: They need to have a low ground pressure, so as not to sink into soft ground, they need ground clearance to not get hung up on obstacles, and they need to keep their wheels or tracks on the ground so as not to lose traction. Wheeled vehicles accomplish this by having a suitable balance of large or additional tires combined with tall and flexible <b>suspension.</b> <b>Tracked</b> vehicles accomplish this by having wide tracks and a flexible suspension on the road wheels.|$|R

50|$|Throughout the interwar {{period the}} US {{produced}} {{only a few}} hundred tanks. From the end of World War I to 1935, only 15 tanks were produced. Most were derivatives or foreign designs or very poor quality private designs. The Christie designs were among the few better examples, but the US Army acquired only three Christies and did not pursue the idea any further. Budget limitations and the low priority given to the army meant that there were few resources for building tanks. The US Army instead developed and tested tank components such as <b>suspensions,</b> <b>tracks,</b> and transmissions. This paid off when production had to be initiated on the outbreak of war.|$|R
25|$|Alvis {{also offered}} a {{comprehensive}} upgrade for the export {{version of the}} CVR(T), which included a diesel engine, upgraded <b>suspension,</b> new <b>track</b> and vision enhancements. Brunei {{is the only country}} known to have returned vehicles for an overhaul.|$|R

The most significant advances {{were made in the}} areas of <b>suspensions,</b> <b>tracks,</b> communications, and the organization of these vehicles on the battlefield. Britain continued its technical dominance of tank design from 1915 through at least the early 1930s. British designs, particularly those from Vickers-Armstrong, formed the basis for many of the most common tanks of the 1930s and early World War II. For example, the Vickers Six Ton Tank was the basis for the Polish 7TP, the Soviet T-26, and was a major influence on the Italian M-11 and M-13 series and the Czech LT-35. The six-ton Vickers tank was not adopted by the British Army.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, 222 Turkish Army M44s were {{extensively}} upgraded with 36 caliber 155mm howitzers by Rheinmetall with {{an increased}} range of 24.7 km. An MTU MB 833 Aa-501 V-6 water-cooled diesel developing 450 hp at 2,300 rpm coupled to the original Allison CD-500-3 transmission via a ZF gearbox was fitted. There were numerous other improvements such as upgraded <b>suspension,</b> <b>tracks</b> and fire control and increased fuel capacity. The driver's position was moved into the hull. The last was delivered in 1992. Some sources claim they have now been withdrawn, but two were seen in a video by the Russian news agency RT, allegedly firing into Northern Syria from a border post inside Turkey in 2015.|$|R

5000|$|T87: {{proposed}} {{improvement of}} the T42 including features such as a cast steel elliptical hull and a flat <b>track</b> <b>suspension</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The Sherman's {{reliability}} {{resulted from}} many features developed for U.S. light tanks during the 1930s, including vertical volute spring <b>suspension,</b> rubber-bushed <b>tracks,</b> and a rear-mounted radial engine with drive sprockets in front. The goals were {{to produce a}} fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank then in use by the Axis nations.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{commissioning}} {{it became}} apparent that the Z-class had ride problems due to stiff <b>suspension,</b> and <b>track</b> differences between Gothenburg and Melbourne. The issues were rectified by the time the 80th tram was constructed, and the fix, rubber secondary suspension, was retrofitted to all trams. The braking systems also had issues, and were seen as insufficient by the MMTB.|$|R
50|$|All Pumas are front-engined, front-wheel-drive, three-door coupés {{with four}} seats. They came with 15 in alloy wheels as standard, (although the Ford Racing Puma was {{equipped}} with 17 in alloy wheels), with front disc and rear drum brakes.The car {{was based on the}} Mark 4 Ford Fiesta, with new engines (codeveloped with Yamaha), a new body, stiffer <b>suspension,</b> wider <b>track</b> and close-ratio gearbox, among other changes.|$|R
5000|$|Radically Enhanced Mobility - Ability to {{traverse}} diverse off-road terrain, including slopes, various elevations, {{and a range}} of surfaces and gradients; advanced <b>suspensions</b> and redefined <b>track</b> or wheel configurations; extreme speed; rapid omnidirectional movement changes in three dimensions ...|$|R
25|$|Ob'yekt 911 - {{experimental}} IFV, {{developed by}} the Gavalov design bureau. The Ob.911 had a <b>tracked</b> <b>suspension</b> but additionally 4 retractable wheels under the hull. The performance advantages of this wheel-cum-track design didn't prove themselves and was deemed too complex.|$|R
40|$|Tracked {{locomotion}} offers superior mobility characteristics over wheeled or legged {{vehicles for}} locomotion in unstructured environment. Design of <b>track</b> <b>suspension</b> robot with arm {{deals with a}} <b>tracked</b> robot with <b>suspension</b> capable of moving on any terrain specially designed for military purpose and rescue operations in remote areas...|$|R
5|$|CTL-3TBD – An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} CTL-3, although the only differences were improved <b>tracks,</b> <b>suspension</b> {{and the addition of}} an M2 machine gun. The two M2 machine guns were mounted in a turret. Only five were produced and all of them were scrapped in Samoa in 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Donkervoort D8 GT - {{introduced}} in 2007 - {{is the first}} closed Donkervoort. Compared to the open version of the D8, the D8 GT has entirely new front and rear <b>suspension,</b> increased <b>track</b> width by 8 centimeters, larger brakes for increased stopping power and 17-inch aluminum wheels. With a total weight of 650 kg, the D8GT is the lightest GT in the world. This {{is largely due to}} the extensive use of carbon fiber: the entire roof, the entire rear and the doors and fenders of the car are made of this material.|$|R
50|$|Horstmann {{suspension}} {{is a type}} of <b>tracked</b> <b>suspension</b> {{devised by}} the British engineer Sidney Horstmann in 1922. It was widely used on World War II-era tank designs but in the post-war era was increasingly limited to British designs. The last tank to use the design was the Chieftain, from the 1960s.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} work, {{in order to}} reduce wear of the wheel profile and extend the service life of wheels, a dynamic model for a {{high-speed}} vehicle was set up, in which the wheelset was regarded as flexible body, and the actual measured track irregularities and line conditions were considered. The wear depth of the wheel profile was calculated by the well-known Archard wear law [19]. Through this model, the influence of the wheel profile, primary <b>suspension</b> stiffness, <b>track</b> gage, and rail cant on the wear of the wheel profile were studied through multiple iterative calculations.|$|R
50|$|The big {{impediment}} {{revealed by}} the first two engines was {{the state of the}} permanent way and the lack of any cushioning <b>suspension.</b> The <b>track</b> was often carelessly laid and with rails of only 3ft in length there were frequent derailments. He devised a new chair and used half-lap joints between the rails instead of butt-joints. Wrought iron replaced cast iron wheels and he used the steam pressure of the boiler to provide 'steam spring' suspension for the engine. These improvements were detailed in a patent filed with the iron-founder Mr. Losh of Newcastle on 30 September 1816.|$|R
50|$|Four-cross/Dual Slalom (4X) is a {{discipline}} in which riders compete either on separate tracks, as in Dual Slalom, or {{on a short}} slalom track, as in 4X. Most bikes used are light hard-tails, although the last World Cup was actually won on a full <b>suspension</b> bike. The <b>tracks</b> have dirt jumps, berms, and gaps.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{excavator}} follows requirements of machines for demolition work. The excavator is equipped with an innovative type of under carriage, which not only increases mobility over the demolition sites but also the visibility from the driver’s cabin. The components of the excavator, that improve the demolition work, are special types of <b>tracks,</b> <b>suspensions</b> and articulated steering. Tracks can change their shape to increase the stability and also {{to adapt to the}} diff erent types of ground. The <b>suspensions</b> with <b>tracks</b> are able to adapt to the terrain thereby they lighten the asperity. Suspension can also tilt or even raise the excavator and thereby increase the angle of visibility from the cabin. This function is necessary mainly when taking down higher constructions. Articulated steering is a new function that has never been used for excavators. This steering was chosen due to fl exible movement over demolition sites. The main aim of the project is to create a new {{design of the}} excavator, but more importantly to distinguish the excavator from the excavators already on the market, with regards to its esthetics and under carriage innovation...|$|R
500|$|The {{specifications}} of the M16 {{were similar}} to those of the M3 Half-track. It was 21ft 4in (6.5m) long (with a wheelbase of [...] ), 7ft 1in (2.16m) wide, and 7ft 8in (2.34m) high and weighed 9.9short tons (9t). It had suspension consisting of vertical volute spring <b>suspension</b> for the <b>tracks</b> and leaf springs for the wheels.|$|R
30|$|The present work {{establishes}} {{a model for}} the vehicle–track vertical coupled system based on the theory of vehicle–track coupled dynamics. With this model, the frequency response of the vehicle–track vertical coupled system is calculated, and the effects of the vehicle speed, vehicle <b>suspension</b> parameters, and <b>track</b> support parameters on the frequency response of the coupled system are analyzed.|$|R
50|$|The Holden HR {{range was}} {{released}} in April 1966, replacing the Holden HD series which had been in production since 1965. In addition to a revised grille, the HR featured a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels.Other changes included revised ball joint front <b>suspension,</b> widened <b>track,</b> improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after {{the launch of the}} HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front safety belts, windscreen washers, reversing lights, sunvisors and a shatterproof interior rearview mirror.|$|R
5000|$|The Vickers-derived {{running gear}} had two bogie trucks with eight pairs of small wheels on each side, using leaf-spring <b>suspension.</b> The <b>tracks</b> were {{conventional}} skeleton steel plate links, and were relatively narrow. Together, this system {{was thought to}} allow good mobility in the mountainous areas in which future combat was expected. In the desert where most M13s were actually employed, mobility was less satisfactory. The tank was powered by a [...] diesel engine. This was an innovation that many countries had yet to introduce, as diesel engines were the future for tanks, with lower cost, greater range and reduced danger of fire compared to petrol engines.|$|R
