500|$|... "Eagleton" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised Posey's performance, {{and said}} the garbage fight scene {{was one of the}} funniest of the season. He also complimented the show for giving Poehler's and Posey's characters a strong back story that helped further develop the history of Pawnee and the characters. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said [...] "Eagleton" [...] strongly developed Leslie, particularly in the way she ends the feud with Lindsay by building something new rather than resorting simply to revenge. He also praised Nick Offerman's comedic performance, {{and said the}} episode continues the strong development between Leslie and Ron's characters. Steve Kandell of New York magazine enjoyed the comedic chemistry between Poehler and Posey [...] and especially enjoyed the garbage fight scene [...] but said the sudden resolution to their feud felt forced. Kandell <b>said</b> <b>Nick</b> Offerman stole the episode, and that the final scene between Leslie and Ron about his birthday party could be the best scene of the series. Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said Posey was perfectly cast in her guest role, and said of the episode: [...] "Sometimes TV gets it right, and last night, Parks and Recreation got it uber-right." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN found Posey's character [...] "somewhat one-note", but felt the episode was an improvement over the previous week's [...] "Jerry's Painting", and with great comedy coming from the portrayal of Eagleton and Ron's paranoia about his surprise birthday party.|$|E
