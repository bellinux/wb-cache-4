This article seeks to inform the International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB’s) on-going consideration of mineral resource reporting. Listed companies are considered to evidence forms of reserve disclosure with a logistical regression approach applied to measure determinants of reporting. The risk associated with mineral reporting reserves is hypothesized as the key disclosure driver whilst controlling other relevant variables. The majority of firms disclosed reserve quantities in some form but only a minority disclosed in line with recommended practice, disclosure quality being more variable between companies. The findings indicate that a voluntary disclosure approach is ineffective, partially explained by agency related behaviour. Risk, proxied by the stage of production, drives reserve disclosure showing that producer firms are more likely to disclose reserve quantum balances and of a significantly higher quality...|$|R

Only fully fledged financial accounting and reporting systems guarantee the consolidated information needed by executive and legislative bodies to fulfil their duties in financial management and the supervision of network entities. Consolidated financial statements may serve to increase accountability and transparency towards internal and external stakeholders. The article aims at giving an overview of consolidation approaches in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It will focus on the methods applied and the guiding principles followed to define the perimeter of consolidation. The analysis is carried out through a comparison of legal requirements and standards for consolidation, and the published consolidated financial statements, taking the International Public Sector Accounting Standards as a benchmark. Points for practitioners: The analysis of consolidation practice in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries reveals that while the use <b>of</b> consolidated <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> is increasing, there are still significant deviations from the perspective of international accounting standards. The results show that the equity method plays a crucial role as it is used in a transition period to full consolidation and/or for organisations having major influence on the <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>position.</b> These findings are of interest in the ongoing debate of international standard-setting in the field of consolidation, {{as well as for the}} discussion of European Public Sector Accounting Standards...|$|R

40|$|The word ‘asset’ was {{originally}} {{taken into the}} English language, from the Latin ‘ad satis’ and French ‘asez’, as a term used at law meaning sufficient estate or effects to discharge debts. It later came {{to be used in}} the sense of property available for the payment of debts. Assets were understood to be property (objects owned and rights of ownership) that could be exchanged for cash. The importance of factual knowledge of the money equivalents of property and debts, in managing mercantile affairs, was emphasised in accounting manuals during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The rights of investors and creditors to factual up-to-date information about the <b>financial</b> state <b>of</b> affairs of companies, given the advent of limited liability, underscored the early company legislation that required the preparation and auditing <b>of</b> <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> property and debts. During the latter part of the nineteenth century the emphasis in accounting moved away from assets as exchangeable property to assets as deferred costs. Expectations took the place of observables. The abstract (expectational) notion of assets as ‘future economic benefits’ was embraced by accountants in the absence of rigorous definitions of the elements and functions <b>of</b> dated <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>position</b> and performance. Assets are quantified financially by a heterogeneous mass of potentially inconsistent rules that, by and large, have no regard for the empirical nature of measurement. Consequently, accountants have failed to provide the community with up-to-date factual information about the <b>financial</b> state <b>of</b> affairs and performance of business entities - and, hence, with an informative basis for financial action...|$|R
40|$|Not refereed. Abstract only. Historical enquiry {{reveals how}} ideas mutate. This {{account of the}} ideas {{underpinning}} how fair value accounting (FVA) drifted into corporate financial reporting shows that a primary lesson of business history is that we ignore history at our peril, that frequently we encourage the recall of history for possibly the wrong reason – to supposedly ‘learn lessons’ regarding what we {{might or might not}} repeat. It might be more fruitful to use history to gain insight into the development of the ideas (good and bad) that delivered us to where we are. The case of fair value is shown to have drifted from the basis for a specific purpose calculation into a general application in accounting <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>position</b> and <b>financial</b> performance. The Mark-to-Market (MtM) dispute during the current global financial crisis has nurtured further mutation of its FVA predecessor. What originally arose as an attempt to disclose a present financial state or condition is being denied by many {{in the name of the}} alleged virtue of hiding it. Doing so contradicts what history tells us has been the focus from when fair value accidentally ‘drifted’ into the accounting for adaptive companies. Our analysis also highlights historical enquiry aptly showing how accounting is conducive to politicization – an easy victim of interested parties’ special pleading, corrupting its technology function primarily because it is inconvenient to have accounting data tell it how it is.
