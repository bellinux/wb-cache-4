5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk.</b> As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E
25|$|She was a {{precocious}} child, — {{so much so}} that, {{on being}} asked, she once confessed she had no more recollection of learning to read either French or English than of learning to talk. As soon as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> her mother said, she was following her about, book in hand, begging to be taught to read stories for herself. She read them soon to so much purpose that before she was five years old, she had finished the Bible, being rewarded by a polyglot Testament for the feat, and had also read Plutarch, which at every subsequent reading gave her an equal pleasure, and at seven, had mastered Racine in the original, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father.|$|E
500|$|Previously, Julian {{had been}} allowed to visit his father twice a year by himself, but Lennon complained that during his time with Pang his ex-wife also wanted to be present, saying: [...] "She [...] thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> back in 'cos I wasn't with Yoko!" [...] After his {{reconciliation}} with Ono, he complained again that his son was not being allowed to visit him.|$|E
60|$|An old woman, {{the last}} of the party, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> fast, turned round and pointed at the buffoon with her staff.|$|R
60|$|Dinner-time came, and the {{whirling}} ceased; whereupon Tess {{left her}} post, her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking {{of the machine}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>walk.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Holiday {{admitted}} that Rollo had rather {{the best of}} the argument; but she was still quite unwilling to believe that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> really <b>walk</b> six miles.|$|R
2500|$|Birgit Nilsson {{was born}} Märta Birgit Svensson {{on a farm}} at Västra Karup in Skåne (100km/60 miles north of Malmö) to Nils Svensson and Justina Svensson née Paulsson. When she {{was three years old}} she began picking out melodies on a toy piano her mother bought for her. She once told an {{interviewer}} that she could sing before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> adding, [...] "I even sang in my dreams". Her vocal talent was first noticed when she began to sing in her church choir. A choirmaster near her home heard her sing and advised her to take voice lessons.|$|E
2500|$|Elisabeth {{seized on}} the excuse and left her husband and children, to spend the winter in seclusion. Six months later, a mere four days after her return to Vienna, she again {{experienced}} coughing fits and fever. She ate hardly anything and slept badly, and Dr. Skoda observed a recurrence of her lung disease. A fresh rest cure was advised, this time on Corfu, where she improved almost immediately. If her illnesses were psychosomatic, abating when she was removed from {{her husband and her}} duties, her eating habits were causing physical problems as well. In 1862 she had not seen Vienna for a year when her family physician, Dr. Fischer of Munich, examined her and observed serious anemia and signs of [...] "dropsy" [...] (edema). Her feet were sometimes so swollen that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> only laboriously, and with the support of others. On medical advice, she went to Bad Kissingen for a cure. Elisabeth recovered quickly at the spa, but instead of returning home to assuage the gossip about her absence she spent more time with her own family in Bavaria. In August 1862, after a two-year absence, she returned shortly before her husband's birthday, but immediately suffered from a violent [...] "migraine" [...] and vomited four times en route, which supports the theory that her primary complaints were stress-related and psychosomatic.|$|E
60|$|She {{replied that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> and run {{as well as}} any child, and that she had her pram just to sit and rest in when tired of walking.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not run. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>walk.</b> Dark forms loomed up. Her strength failed, {{and as she}} reeled, sinking down, rude hands grasped her. Above her bent {{the gleaming}} face and glittering eyes of Durade.|$|R
60|$|To-night {{she went}} up the {{well-known}} stairs very slowly: she ached so in every limb that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>walk.</b> <b>She</b> seemed to have aged twenty years in two days.|$|R
25|$|After the lobotomy, {{it quickly}} became {{apparent}} that the procedure was not successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> or speak intelligibly and was incontinent.|$|R
60|$|Though the girl's colour {{was coming}} back, {{and she said}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> quite well, both had such aching knees and such shaken limbs that they were glad to hold by {{each other as they}} mounted the sloping road, and half-way up Gillian came to a sudden stop.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{you need}} a few minutes' rest," [...] he said to Madame Duchesne, who was so much shaken that it was evident <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> but little farther. [...] "I {{will go back to}} the edge of the wood and see if there are any signs of their {{following}} us." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she decided}} to go and look at the picture. The trip would help to relieve her {{loneliness}} and she was eager to see what Jason Jones had really accomplished. The Institute was not far from her hotel; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> the distance in a few minutes; so she put on her hat and set out for the exhibition.|$|E
60|$|Columbine felt {{a sinking}} within her. Where was her strength? <b>She,</b> who <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> and ride so many miles, to become sick with an inward quaking! It was childish. She {{struggled}} {{to hide her}} weakness from him.|$|R
5000|$|Rendell brutally abused Morris' children, once beating Annie so savagely that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk.</b> Arresting officer Inspector Harry Mann said [...] "she {{delighted in}} seeing her victims writhe in agony, and from it derived sexual satisfaction".|$|R
50|$|He is {{also known}} for {{carrying}} out the lobotomy of Rose Marie Kennedy {{under the supervision of}} Freeman. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> or speak intelligibly and was considered incontinent.|$|R
6000|$|... "How funny!" [...] said Mela. [...] "Well, now, I'm {{just the}} other way. I always take the last thing, after I've picked over all the rest. My luck {{always seems to be}} {{at the bottom of the}} heap. Now, Christine, she's more like you. I believe <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> right up blindfolded and put her hand on the thing she wants every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The 'ouse {{was pretty}} full {{when we got}} in, but she didn't take no notice of that. Her idea was that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> about {{all over the place}} looking for Cap'n Tarbell, and it took three men in buttons and a {{policeman}} to persuade 'er different. We were pushed into a couple o' seats at last, and then she started finding fault with me.|$|E
60|$|Although Old Peg was by {{no means}} feeble--indeed, judged by her capacities, she might have been {{pronounced}} middle-aged, for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> about the house all day, actively engaged in miscellaneous self-imposed duties, and could also eat like a man and sleep like a dormouse--she was, nevertheless, withered, and wrinkled, and grey, and small. Her exact age nobody knew--and, for the matter of that, nobody seemed to care.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} a family round you; and if, as you say"--but the ground that she {{approached}} was so hot that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> on it. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not get further in that direction, and therefore merely added: [...] "I am sure I hope you will always be happy." ...|$|R
60|$|Eve went, unwillingly enough, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>walk,</b> {{flashing a}} good-night to her lover with her fine eyes. Presently Grey Dick {{also went to}} sleep, like a dog with one eye open, in the little ante-chamber, near to the great door.|$|R
5000|$|After her [...] "rebirth", Jolt {{could change}} from flesh-and-blood into living electricity. In her energy form, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> fly and fire blasts of {{electrical}} force. At first, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only function in her electric form, her human form was so injured that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> barely <b>walk</b> and talk. She has now fully recovered, and her level of power has increased.|$|R
60|$|She {{heard no}} more of her visitor; and shortly after, {{in an attempt to}} recover some mental {{serenity}} by violent physical exercise, she put on her hat and cloak and went out-of-doors, taking a path which led her up the slopes to the nearest spur of the wood. She disliked the woods, but they had the advantage of being a place in which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> comparatively unobserved.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{else she}} did, she {{must go back}} and pack. She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready. For she felt that once she had left, she could never come back to Woodhouse again. If England had cliffs all round--why, when there was {{nowhere else to go}} and no getting beyond, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> over one of the cliffs. Meanwhile, she had her short run before her. She banked hard on her independence.|$|E
60|$|He tried another {{plan with}} more success. Lost dogs, {{it may be}} remembered, {{had a habit of}} {{following}} Shovel's father, and he not only took the wanderers in, but taught them how to beg and shake hands and walk on two legs. Tommy had sometimes been present at these agreeable exercises, and being an inventive boy he--But as Elspeth was a nice girl, let it suffice to pause here and add shyly, that in time <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kiki is a 15-year-old female. Kiki {{was kept}} as a pet {{in a cage}} under a house, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> or climb when she was rescued - she rolled everywhere. She was {{released}} to Palas Island and now has become a regular on Orangutan Island.|$|R
25|$|Margaret Wong, Onyango's {{immigration}} lawyer since 2008, said at {{the time}} the story broke that Onyango could be barred from reentering the US for up to ten years if she left the country. Wong said that Onyango needed to stay for medical care because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk.</b>|$|R
50|$|Described as small, {{with white}} skin and black hair, she {{retired from the}} stage in 1684, because of obesity such that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>walk.</b>|$|R
60|$|But the {{youngest}} child, {{who had never}} been outside the prison walls, was a thoughtful little creature, and wondered what the outside world could be like. Her great friend, the turnkey, who was also her godfather, became very fond of her, and as soon as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> and talk, he bought a little arm-chair and stood it by his fire at the lodge, and coaxed her with cheap toys to come and sit with him.|$|E
60|$|It must be remarked {{here that}} {{although}} we have called Pussi a baby, she was not exactly an infant. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> and understand, and even talk. She did not, however, (desirable child!) use her tongue freely. In fact, Eskimo children seldom {{do so in the}} company of their elders. They are prone to listen, and gaze, and swallow, (mentally), and to reply only when questioned. But they seem to consider themselves free to laugh at will--hence Pussi's explosion.|$|E
60|$|All {{this while}} he did not leave Allie Lee alone, or at least out of hearing. When he went to tend his traps or to hunt, to chop wood or to watch the trail, Allie always {{accompanied}} him. She grew strong and supple; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> far and carry a rifle or a pack; she was keen of eye and ear, and she loved the wilds; she not only was of help to him, but she made the time pass swiftly.|$|E
60|$|So {{she stopped}} on alone for her dark hour in Perugia. She stopped on, untended by any save unknown Italians whose tongue she hardly spoke, and uncheered by a {{friendly}} {{voice at the}} deepest moment of trouble in a woman's history. Often for hours together she sat alone in the cathedral, gazing up at a certain mild-featured Madonna, enshrined above an altar. The unwedded widow seemed to gain some comfort from the pitying face of the maiden mother. Every day, while still <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> out along the shadeless suburban road to Alan's grave in the parched and crowded cemetery. Women trudging along with crammed creels on their backs turned round to stare at her. When <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>walk,</b> <b>she</b> sat at her window towards San Luca and gazed at it. There lay the only friend she possessed in Perugia, perhaps in the universe.|$|R
60|$|Soon the {{persistent}} girl heard a trampling overhead, then a hand beckoned to her, and, following directions, {{she went out}} and crossed the inner paved court beyond the gatehouse, her knees trembling so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>walk.</b> One of her arms was out of its sleeve, and only covered by her shawl.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Anníe was {{not able}} to defend her title due to a back injury (a herniated disc) {{sustained}} while too casually lifting heavy weight. She withdrew during the third week of the five-week Open. At the time, <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do basic movements like squatting without weight. She questioned whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>walk</b> again and {{spent the rest of the}} year recovering.|$|R
