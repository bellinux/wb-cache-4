40|$|We have {{developed}} an efficient large-stencil finite-difference scheme of time-dependent Maxwell's curl equations based on the wavelet-Galerkin formulation in time-domain. The proposed scheme enables, {{for the first time}} within a limited computational resource, full-vector analysis of three-dimensional rib waveguides that are typically used in integrated planar optical devices. The formulation takes advantage of compactly-supported interpolating bases to expand and represent the electric and magnetic fields. Moreover, unlike the well-known beam propagation methods, the numerical scheme is based on the firstprinciple algorithm with no explicit approximation, and thus rigorous and versatile for various types of boundary conditions We demonstrate the efficiency of the method by first analyzing a <b>straight</b> <b>rib</b> waveguide and examining the convergence of the results.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a successful design, realization,and characterization of single-mode rib optical waveguides on SOG/SU- 8 polymers {{in order to}} highlight {{a new approach to}} designing heat sensors. The basic principle of this new thermal-sensing method relies on the differential thermal behavior regarding both acting arms of a micro Mach-Zehnder Interferometer(MZI). First, two families of single-mode <b>straight</b> <b>rib</b> waveguides composed of SOG/SU- 8 polymers are analyzed. Hence, optical losses for TE 00 and TM 00 optical modes for structures on Si/SiO 2 /SU- 8 have been estimated respectively as 1, 36 plusmn 0, 02 and 2, 01 plusmn 0, 02 dBmiddotcm- 1, while the second one composed of Si/SiO 2 /SOG/SU- 8 presented losses of 2, 33 plusmn 0, 02 and 2, 95 plusmn 0, 02 dBmiddotcm- 1. Then, owing to modeling results, an experimental sensor is realized as an integrated device made up of SU- 8 polymer mounted on a standard silicon wafer. When subjected to a radiant source, as a laser light (980 nm) is injected across the cleaved input face of the MZI, the significant change of output signal allows us to consider a new approach to measuring radiant heat flowrate. Experimental results are given regarding the obtained phase shift against the subjected thermal power. According to the modeling results, one can expect new highly sensitive devices to be developed in the next coming years, with advantageous prospective industrial application...|$|E
