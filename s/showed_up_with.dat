5|$|Lee {{received}} Magruder's {{calls for}} reinforcement and instructed Huger to let Ransom go support the men trapped {{on the field}} of battle. He also sent orders to the brigades of Brig. Gens. Joseph B. Kershaw and Paul Jones Semmes, in Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division within Magruder's command. Robert Ransom's unit, after they finally <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Huger's permission, first attempted to charge straight up the hill, following the path of other Confederate brigades attempting to aid Magruder. When this proved useless, Ransom ordered them to regroup in the woods to the Confederate right, march double-time a half a mile in a hook to the right around all the other Confederate units and attack the far Union western flank. While Ransom was angling west, Jackson responded to a request for reinforcement from D. H. Hill by sending forward brigades from his own command to move from the east into the area where D. H. Hill had attacked. From his own division Jackson sent Brig. Gens. Alexander Lawton and Charles S. Winder, and from Ewell's division, Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble and Cols. Leroy A. Stafford and Jubal Early.|$|E

25|$|On 23 April, O'Donnell's lead {{division}} under Major General Miguel Ibarrola Gonzáles {{bumped into}} General of Brigade Jean Isidore Harispe's small French force east of Lérida. Harispe managed {{to contain the}} numerically superior Spanish column until Musnier's division appeared on the scene. Ibarrola immediately beat a hasty retreat with Musnier in headlong pursuit. At the hamlet of Margalef, the Spanish were attempting {{to fend off the}} French when the 13th Cuirassiers charged into their flank. Ibarrola's division disintegrated as the heavy cavalrymen slashed and hacked at the fleeing foot soldiers. Just as the butchery ended, O'Donnell <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his second division. The Spanish general quickly backtracked but the French cavalry were soon at his soldiers' heels. Again, the cuirassiers caught up with the Spaniards and rode down their rear guard, inflicting more casualties.|$|E

25|$|In May 2011, Chinese patrol boats {{attacked}} 2 Vietnamese {{oil exploration}} ships near the Spratly Islands.

The 3 Chinese military vessels were numbered 989, 27 and 28, and they <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{a small group of}} Chinese fishing vessels. Another Vietnamese fishing vessel was fired on near Fiery Cross Reef (Chu Thap). The Chief Commander of Border Guards in Phú Yên Province, Vietnam reported that a total of 4 Vietnamese vessels were fired upon by Chinese naval vessels. These incidents involving Chinese forces sparked mass protests in Vietnam, especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and in various Vietnamese communities in the West (namely in the US state of California and in Paris) over attacks on Vietnamese citizens and the intrusion into what Vietnam claimed was part of its territory.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Miguel Ibarrola Gonzáles {{encountered}} Jean Isidore Harispe's small {{covering force}} east of Lérida. Harispe called {{for help and}} when Musnier <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his division, Ibarrola quickly fell back to the hamlet of Margalef with Musnier in aggressive pursuit. In the Battle of Margalef, as the Spanish troops faced Musnier's infantry, the 13th Cuirassier Regiment charged into their flank. Ibarrola's formations were cut to pieces. When O'Donnell appeared with a second division, the French heavy cavalrymen overran his rear guard. Out of 5,500 foot soldiers and 500 horsemen, the French reported only 100 casualties, all from the cuirassiers. O'Donnell lost 500 men killed and wounded plus 2,000 soldiers and three guns captured {{out of a total}} of 7,000 infantry, 300 cavalry, and six guns. In addition to the heavy cavalry, Musnier's force included three battalions each of the 114th and 115th Line, two battalions of the 1st Vistula Legion, the 4th Hussars, and two foot artillery batteries. The Siege of Lérida ended with the French capture of the city in mid-May.|$|E
25|$|Frehley {{spent the}} early 1970s {{in a series}} of local bands {{including}} one called Molimo who recorded half an album for RCA Records in 1971. In late 1972, his friend, Chris Cassone, spotted an advertisement for a lead guitarist in The Village Voice and showed the ad to Frehley. Frehley went to 10 East 23rd Street above the Live Bait Bar. Frehley auditioned for a band later named Kiss members Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (bass guitar) and Peter Criss (drums). Frehley, who <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> best friend Chris Cassone, wearing one red and one orange sneaker, was less than impressive visually, but the band liked what they heard from his playing. About three weeks later, the band named Frehley as their lead guitarist. By January 1973, and they didn't have a name but later came up with the name Kiss. Frehley designed the band's double-lightning-bolt logo, which was polished up by Paul Stanley. The band quickly decided to paint their faces for live performances, and Frehley decided to start painting silver stars on his eyes. When the group eventually decided to adopt stage personas to match their makeup and costumes, Frehley became Space Ace. Later his stage persona was also known as The Spaceman.|$|E

Maybe he wasn’t in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn’t quite happen but it could have worked." ...|$|E
500|$|A Day to Remember {{formed when}} guitarist Tom Denney asked Jeremy McKinnon {{if he would}} like to join the band as a vocalist. The pair hung out with drummer Bobby Scruggs, who later joined the band. During this period, both Denney and Scruggs were already in a band; Denney was in 2 Days 2 Late, while McKinnon played in All for Nothing. The trio wrote a song which McKinnon said [...] "was better than {{everything}} our other bands had come up with". Shortly afterwards the trio decided to form a band which was called End of An Era in its first week of existence. The name was inspired by a movie listing in a TV guide found in Denney's home.

The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'.

500|$|Merrion did {{not want}} to pay a {{severance}} tax to both New Mexico and the tribe, and filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, along with such major companies as Atlantic Richfield (now part of BP), Getty Oil, Gulf Oil, and Phillips Petroleum (now ConocoPhillips), among others. [...] The case was not filed until 15 days before the severance tax was due. [...] In the hearing on the temporary injunction on June 17, 1977, Merrion argued that the tribe's severance tax was unconstitutional, violating both the Commerce clause and Equal protection clause, and that it was both taxation without representation and double taxation. In addition, the plaintiffs argued against the entire concept of tribal sovereignty, stating that it had been a [...] "legal fiction for decades." [...] U.S. District Judge H. Vearle Payne granted the temporary injunction and set the hearing on the permanent injunction for August 29, 1977. The oil companies <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> approximately 40-50 attorneys, compared to 2 or 3 lawyers for the tribe. [...] Both sides made essentially the same arguments as for the temporary injunction. [...] Following the hearing, District court ruled that the tribe's tax violated the Commerce clause of the Constitution and that only state and local authorities had the ability to tax mineral rights on Indian reservations. [...] The court then issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the collection of the tax by the tribe.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Brian K. Roberts and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Prior to writing the episode, Roberts had been an audio and visual editor on the show. Musician Ringo Starr made a guest appearance in the episode as himself. He was the first Beatle {{to appear on the}} show; both George Harrison and Paul McCartney would later guest star on the show in the season five episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] and the season seven episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] respectively. When the story of Marge having a crush on Starr was pitched out, Roberts took the opportunity to write Starr into the script because he had always wanted to meet a Beatle. He then sent the script to Starr, who was then in Southern France. Starr agreed to do the guest appearance after only reading two lines, and he told Roberts that {{he would be able to}} do it when he visited Los Angeles a few weeks later. The staff of the show was thrilled when Roberts revealed that Starr had agreed to do it, and they immediately decided to expand Starr's role in the script. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said of the guest appearance: [...] "We were so excited that we got Ringo Starr coming in to do the show and we recorded him over at the Complex in West Los Angeles. We were given a list of rules about what we couldn't do to Ringo, such as 'Don't touch him', 'Don't approach him', and 'Don't ask for his autograph'. But of course when he shows up in this big limo, Brian brings out a big poster and asks him to sign it!" [...] Roberts explained that he had not received the memo with the rules so he <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a copy of the script cover and asked Starr to sign it. Groening asked Starr if he wanted to be animated the way he was in Yellow Submarine or the way he was in the cartoon series The Beatles. Starr chose Yellow Submarine because he did not like his appearance in the cartoon. In addition to Starr, the episode features a guest appearance by Jon Lovitz as Lombardo and the doughnut delivery man that delivers doughnuts to the nuclear power plant. Lombardo's physical appearance was based on an art teacher Reardon had in art school.|$|E

2500|$|In The Other Hollywood, Boreman {{said she}} felt [...] "used" [...] by the anti-pornography movement.
