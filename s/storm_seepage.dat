It deals with a field and laboratory evaluation of several physical and hydraulic properties of the weathered parent material and suggests how these properties may relate to flood runoff problems. A simple correlation analysis shows that only one variable, non-capillary porosity had a significant relationship with saturated hydraulic conductivity. A factor analysis indicated that information from 19 descriptive variables could be attributed to 5 common factors. The 5 common factors show the types of variables that would be most useful in describing parent material. Darcy's equation was used to compute saturated hydraulic conductivity. The resulting computations, utilizing Reynolds number criterion, yielded values which were well within the laminar flow range. However, differing Reynolds numbers were obtained by using average grain size as compared to average pore diameters. A comparison between field hydraulic conductivity and laboratory hydraulic conductivity showed no significant correlation between the two measurements. Moisture-retention curves of the surface and parent material show little difference between the two materials. Retention and detention storage values for the soil and parent material were calculated and used to assess the occurrence of overland flow. The importance of the parent material, as it influences overland flow, was evaluated utilizing existing rainfall records, streamflow hydrographs, moisture storage values and the permeability results of this study. Total storm and 24 -hour rainfall data were not very useful for evaluating {{the presence or absence of}} overland flow. Rainfall was budgeted into the soil and parent material according to the respective permeabilities and storage capacities of those two strata. Overland flow was computed by subtracting the amount of water in-filtered from the amount of rain falling during a six minute time period. Rainfall hyetographs and streamflow hydrographs indicated that overland flow is of limited occurrence even during flood runoff periods. Flood peaks were thought to be the result of <b>storm</b> <b>seepage</b> flow from the side slopes rather than from direct channel interception or overland flow. Any overland flow coming from recently burned watersheds probably results from a change in the soils permeability characteristics. The soil resists wetting because of a water repellency created by wildfire temperatures...|$|E
40|$|In {{the effort}} to clean up America's waters, there is a little-known complicating factor: because they leak, sewer systems in many American cities are causing rather than {{preventing}} pollution of rivers and lakes. Fixing the leaks is difficult because their locations are unknown. Maintenance crews can't tear up a whole city looking for cracks in the pipes; they must first determine which areas are most likely suspects. An aerospace spinoff is providing help in that regard. The problem starts with heavy rains. Rainwater naturally flows into the sewers from streets, but sewage systems are designed to accommodate it. However, they are not designed to handle the additional flow of "groundwater", rain absorbed by the earth which seeps into the sewers through leaks in pipes and sewer walls. After a <b>storm,</b> groundwater <b>seepage</b> can increase the waterflow to deluge proportions, {{with the result that}} sewage treatment plants are incapable of processing the swollen flow. When that happens the sluices must be opened, dumping raw sewage into rivers and lakes...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} 3 D lithological model framework {{was developed}} using GOCAD software to understand interactions between alluvial, volcanic and GAB aquifers and the {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of groundwater recharge to the alluvium of the Lockyer Valley. Groundwater chemistry, isotope data (H 20 -δ 2 H and δ 18 O, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 3 H and 14 C) and groundwater level time-series data from approximately 550 observation wells were integrated into the catchment-wide 3 D model to assess the recharge processes involved. This approach enabled the identification of zones where recharge to the alluvium primarily occurs from stream water during episodic flood events. Importantly, the study also demonstrates that in some sections of the alluvium recharge is also from <b>storm</b> rainfall and <b>seepage</b> discharge from the underlying GAB aquifers. These other sources of recharge are indicated by (a) {{the absence of a}} response of groundwater levels to flooding in some areas, (b) old radiocarbon ages, and (c) distinct bedrock water chemistry and δ 2 H and δ 18 O signatures in alluvial groundwater at these locations. Integration of isotopes, water chemistry and time-series displays of groundwater levels before and after the 2010 / 2011 flood into the 3 D model suggest that the spatial variations in the alluvial groundwater response are mostly controlled by valley morphology and lithological (i. e. permeability) variations within the alluvium. Examination of the groundwater level variations in the 3 D model also enabled quantification of the volumetric change of groundwater stored in the unconfined alluvial aquifer prior to and post-flood events...|$|R
40|$|The Thrissur kole wet land is {{a unique}} natural wet land system lying in Thrissur district. It is used for paddy {{cultivation}} and it covers more than 10, 000 Ha. In fact kole in Malayalam means bumper yield, bumper prize, Jackpot etc. As the wet land {{all over the world}} are depleted and affected by development, the importance of natural wet land in water shed system becomes increasingly apparent effort to restore and maintain wet land have been crucial to water quality in many areas. This kole land provides natural fresh water resources for groundwater recharge, provide a sink for the large surface runoff from eastern height land in every monsoon and keep Thrissur city free from flood. The act as natural draining system through a network of canals and ponds and finally to the Arabian sea through back waters. But for the past decades the kole land which lies adjacent to Thrissur city re facing severe pressure due to urbanisation. The entire storm water drainage network of Thrissur city carries the urban waste with its flow and passes through the Kole lands. The municipal waste water it’s made up of domestic waste water, Industrial waste water, <b>Storm</b> water, Groundwater <b>seepage.</b> Due to this Kole land adjacent to Thrissur city becomes highly polluted and is severe in a stream named Kokkala stream leading to Kole lands from the thrissur railway station. So in this project it has been studied the pollution level of the Kokkala stream and its effect on Kole lands. The collected water sample had been tested for different physical, chemical and biological parameters during the pre monsoon and post monsoon. From this result It is found that all the parameters tested in rainy season are well within the irrigation standard. But from the result of summer samples it is found that the parameters like Turbidity, BOD, suspended matters, oil and grease and COD are high and above the irrigation standard...|$|R
