5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> where necessary.|$|E
2500|$|William Witney, one of Republic's film directors, said: [...] "There will {{probably}} never be another stuntman who can compare to Yakima Canutt. He had been a world champion cowboy several times and where horses were concerned {{he could do it}} all. He invented all the gadgets that made stunt work easier. One of his clever devices was a step that attached to the saddle so that he had leverage to transfer to another moving object, like a wagon or a train. Another was the “shotgun,” a spring-loaded device used to separate the tongue of a running wagon from the horses, thus cutting the horses loose. It also included a <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> attached to the wagon bed, which caused wheels to cramp and turn the wagon over on the precise spot that was most advantageous for the camera." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>cord</b> - This is a {{bungee cord}} with a loop {{at one end}} that permits the mounting, with a {{removable}} link, of a standard bicycle chain. The {{opposite end of the}} <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> is normally knotted to prevent it from slipping into the power lever. The <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> is located inside the power lever and is normally not visible unless the power lever is pulled all the way back. The <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> loses its elasticity over time and needs to be replaced when this happens.|$|E

50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was very simple, with wheels {{close to the}} sides on a split axle mounted within the fuselage. Rubber <b>cord</b> <b>shock</b> {{absorbers}} were used and the tailskid was also mounted elastically.|$|R
50|$|The Libellule's {{landing gear}} was fixed and {{conventional}} with a track of 1.20 m.

Drag loads were countered with fore-and-aft wire bracing.|$|R
5000|$|The Avis was {{designed}} by Wright and William Oke Manning for Alan Boyle's newly formed Scottish Aeroplane Syndicate and was constructed at Wright's Battersea works during 1909. It was a single-seat tractor monoplane with an uncovered wire-braced wooden fuselage using wing-warping for lateral control, resembling the aircraft that Louis Bleriot had {{used to make the}} first flight across the English Channel. The wings were braced by wires attached to two pairs of cabane struts, which extended down and outwards to form two A-frames carrying a pair of skids to each of which a pair of wheels was attached using <b>shock</b> <b>cords.</b> It had an all-moving cruciform tail, built as a single assembly articulated on a universal joint. A small sprung tailwheel was fitted. At that time there was no standardised system for control layout and the Avis used foot pedals for lateral control, and a stick with a wheel at the top to control rudder and elevator. The prototype, known as the Golden Plover fitted with a 30 hp (22 kW) Anzani engine. It was finished in December 1909, but trials at Brooklands were unsatisfactory and the engine was replaced by a [...] Anzani driving a wooden propeller manufactured by Wright. The prototype was first successfully flown by Boyle in March 1910. It was sold to Mr Maconie, who used it at Brooklands in August 1910.|$|R
50|$|Some designs {{replace the}} kill {{line with a}} fixed length of <b>shock</b> <b>cord,</b> which {{stretches}} when the pilot chute is moving quickly, allowing it to inflate. When the pilot slows down (after opening a canopy, for example) the <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> retracts, killing the pilot chute. While this avoids the possibility of pilot-in-tow malfunction due to an un-cocked pilot, it has the disadvantage of requiring significant airspeed to operate. This could cause a delayed deployment if used for a BASE or balloon jump, or any other jump with a low speed deployment. This type may also begin to re-inflate behind a highly loaded, fast moving canopy, negating the usefulness of a collapsible pilot chute.|$|E
50|$|The O'pen Bic uses a {{composite}} epoxy daggerboard, with a <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> strap {{to hold it}} in place. The removable rudder is adjustable, with separate lines to raise and lower it, The rudder blade is composite epoxy, while the tiller and tiller extension are aluminum.|$|E
50|$|The glider {{was built}} {{with a wooden}} {{structure}} and steel fittings. The wings and tail surfaces were covered in fabric. Typical of the primary gliders of its day, the fuselage was open and featured an open seat with stick and rudder three-axis controls. The aircraft {{was designed to be}} bungee launched with an elastic <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> and had a single skid for landing gear.|$|E
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on split, cranked axles {{mounted on a}} central {{inverted}} strut-pyramid from the lower fuselage longerons. There were rearward drag struts to the longerons as well as rubber <b>cord</b> <b>shock</b> absorbing struts. The undercarriage track was 1.30 m. The PM X had a short, castering tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The Couzinet 10 had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, with mainwheels {{below the}} outer engines on V-struts from the wing spars and with rubber <b>cord</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers. Enclosed within fairings that reached {{back to the}} trailing edges, its track was 5.4 m. A small tailskid was fitted on the fuselage below the tailplane's leading edge.|$|R
50|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional, {{with a low}} {{aspect ratio}} tailplane and generous elevators mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. The fin was triangular, with a rounded rudder. The 6W-3 had conventional, fixed, tailskid landing gear with wheels on a single axle held by twin V-struts to the lower fuselage longerons. Rubber <b>cord</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers were fitted.|$|R
50|$|Another {{very simple}} {{recovery}} technique, used in very early {{models in the}} 1950s and occasionally in modern examples, is nose-blow recovery. This is where the ejection charge of the motor ejects the nose cone of the rocket (usually attached by a <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> made of rubber, Kevlar string or another type of cord) from the body tube, destroying the rocket's aerodynamic profile, causing highly increased drag, and reducing the rocket's airspeed to a safe rate for landing. Nose-blow recovery is generally only suitable for very light rockets.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 Robert Chicken {{patented}} a {{sheet to}} tiller {{system in the}} UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two swinging platforms fitted on to the cockpit coamings {{either side of the}} boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re-bolted down on to the top of these platforms.With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, swings the platform forward. To balance this movement, a <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the platform to swing forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course.The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‘block-and-tackle’ form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the fixed end is clipped, and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of <b>shock</b> <b>cord.</b> For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> is used instead.The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it [...] "is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind" [...] is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper steering correction at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, stern ladders etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{newsreel}} from 1937 {{clearly shows}} a rowed bicycle {{that is very}} similar to today's RowBike. It does not use a bungee cord to maintain tension, instead it has a circular chain case mounted where the derailer normally hangs. The case seems to have a spring mechanism that pulls excess chain links into the case, much the same way the <b>shock</b> <b>cord</b> pulls excess chain into the power lever. Like the first version of the RowBike the chain is connected {{to the end of the}} power lever, and there is no [...] "Dave cam" ...|$|E
25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated <b>shock</b> <b>cords.</b> was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid. Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the MG-1 was steel {{framed and}} fabric {{covered with the}} exception of a glass fibre engine cowling. This housed a conventionally nose mounted, 74.5 kW (100 hp) flat four Continental O-200 piston engine driving a non-retractable propeller. Its cockpit seated two side by side under a rearward sliding canopy. The conventional undercarriage had main wheels with rubber <b>cord</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers and brakes, assisted by a steerable tailwheel.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 - 30 years, using the {{specific}} properties of rubber (high elasticity, resistance to environmental influences, good dynamic performance, low compressibility, almost linear relationship between {{stress and strain}} at strains up to 15 % ÷ 20 %) developed shock absorbers, possible to realize nonlinear characteristics "force - settlement".

50|$|The elastic rope {{first used}} in bungee jumping, and still {{used by many}} {{commercial}} operators, is factory-produced braided <b>shock</b> <b>cord.</b> This special bungee cord consists of many latex strands enclosed in a tough outer cover. The outer cover may be applied when the latex is pre-stressed, so that the cord's resistance to extension is already significant at the cord's natural length. This gives a harder, sharper bounce. The braided cover also provides significant durability benefits. Other operators, including A. J. Hackett and most southern-hemisphere operators, use unbraided cords with exposed latex strands. These give a softer, longer bounce and can be home-produced.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bungee cord}} (sometimes spelled bungie), {{also known as}} a <b>shock</b> <b>cord,</b> (occy strap or octopus strap in Australian common usage) is an elastic cord {{composed}} of one or more elastic strands forming a core, usually covered in a woven cotton or polypropylene sheath. The sheath does not materially extend elastically, but it is braided with its strands spiralling around the core so that a longitudinal pull causes it to squeeze the core, transmitting the core's elastic compression to the longitudinal extension of the sheath and cord. Specialized bungees, such as some used in bungee jumping, may be made entirely of elastic strands.|$|E

50|$|The Robin, a workmanlike cabin monoplane, had {{a wooden}} wing and steel tubing fuselage. The cabin {{accommodated}} three persons; two passengers were seated side-by-side behind the pilot. Early Robins were distinguished by large flat fairings over the parallel diagonal wing bracing struts; the fairings were abandoned on later versions, having {{been found to}} be ineffective in creating lift.
