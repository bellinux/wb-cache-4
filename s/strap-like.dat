5|$|The snout of Ankylosaurus was arched and {{truncated}} at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical, {{and they}} were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front, because the sinuses were expanded {{to the sides of}} the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae, <b>strap-like,</b> side osteoderms of the snout, completely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils. The nostrils also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities or chambers of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the snout into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the choanae (internal nostrils).|$|E
25|$|The final {{carnivore}} with a pitfall-like trap is the bromeliad Brocchinia reducta. Like most {{relatives of}} the pineapple, the tightly packed, waxy leaf bases of the <b>strap-like</b> leaves of this species form an urn. In most bromeliads, water collects readily in this urn and may provide habitats for frogs, insects and, more useful for the plant, diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) bacteria. In Brocchinia, the urn is a specialised insect trap, with a loose, waxy lining and a population of digestive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In spring, {{the plant}} {{produces}} large, yellow flowers with 5-fold symmetry. The yellow petals {{are long and}} <b>strap-like,</b> and dangle over the umbrella-like style of the flower, which is held upside {{down at the end}} of a 50cm long scape. The stigma of the flower are found at the tips of the 'spokes' of this umbrella. Pollinating insects generally enter the flower from above, forcing their way into the cavity between the petals and umbrella, and depositing any pollen they are carrying on the stigmata as they enter. The pollinators generally exit the flower, having been dusted with the plant's own pollen, by lifting a petal. This one-way system helps to ensure cross pollination.|$|E
25|$|Bog {{pondweed}} occurs both as {{terrestrial plants}} in seeps and wet moss, and as aquatic forms, {{and is very}} variable. Terrestrial forms in particular can {{be very difficult to}} identify. It is most likely to be confused with P. natans which it resembles in general habit, but can usually be distinguished by the presence of submerged leaves (these are reduced to <b>strap-like</b> phyllodes in P.natans) and the absence of a discoloured mark {{at the base of the}} floating leaves. The submerged leaves of P. alpinus can be similar, but these are sessile. Although a common plant, bog pondweed does not seem to hybridise readily with other pondweeds, though hybrids with P. natans (P. × gessnacensis G.Fisch.), P. gramineus, P. alpinus (P. × spathulatus Schrad. ex W.D.J.Koch & Ziz), P. berchtoldii (P. × rivularis Gillot)and P. pusillus have been recorded.|$|E
25|$|The flowerheads {{are seated}} {{at the end of}} the stem or in the limbs of the higher leaves, are {{arranged}} in a spike or a globose cluster and are subtended by two to more than five leaflike bracts. Each flowerhead is circled by an involucre that consists of many spine-tipped bracts in several rows, the outer papery and shorter than the inner ones, which are leaflike in consistency. These surround the common floral base (or receptacle), which is conical in shape and is set with ovate papery bracts called chaff or paleae. Inplanted are dorsally compressed cypselas, each enclosed by a palea, the outer rows higher than the inner ones. On top of the cypselas there may be two to five stiff scabrous bristles, which are equivalent to sepals (and are called pappus). Also, on top of the cypsela and within the pappus is a yellow, orange or white <b>strap-like</b> corolla which ends in five teeth, together comprising a ligulate floret.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} members of the {{composite}} family, the actual flowers appear in two different froms: as ray florets, which have <b>strap-like</b> appendages that look like petals and project around the outside of the capitulum, and as disc florets, which appear {{at the center of the}} flower head and are very small. The ray florets number between 5 and 10, though as many as 12 may be present. Their straps are white and measure 6 to 12mm long by 1.5 to 2.2mm wide. The disc florets number from 12 to 19 and up to 25 and have yellow corollas (i.e. petals, though they are fused into a tube) that are 4.1 to 4.8 and exceptionally 5.5mm long. Their corollas are abruptly ampliate, or enlarged, with tubes that are longer than their campanulate throats. The tubes measure 2.3 to 2.6mm while the throats are typically only 0.9 to 1.2mm long. The lobes, i.e. the friges of the throat, are reflexed and lanceolate in shape, measuring 0.7 to 1.4mm.|$|E
500|$|Thrips {{are small}} hemimetabolic insects with a {{distinctive}} cigar-shaped bauplan. They are elongated with transversely constricted bodies. They {{range in size}} from [...] in length for the larger predatory thrips, but most thrips are about 1mm in length. Flight-capable thrips have two similar, <b>strap-like</b> pairs of wings with a fringe of bristles. The wings are folded back over the body at rest. Their legs usually end in two tarsal segments with a bladder-like structure known as an [...] "arolium" [...] at the pretarsus. This structure can be everted by means of hemolymph pressure, enabling the insect to walk on vertical surfaces. They have compound eyes consisting of a small number of ommatidia and three ocelli or simple eyes on the head.|$|E
2500|$|Cordaites, a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with <b>strap-like</b> leaves, {{was related}} to the cycads and conifers; the catkin-like inflorescence, which bore yew-like berries, is called Cardiocarpus. These plants were thought to live in swamps and mangroves. [...] True {{coniferous}} trees (Walchia, of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.|$|E
