50|$|Rigging: for {{a variety}} of construction, forestry, crane, shipping, marine and {{industrial}} wire rope applications. These products include rigging hardware, components, swagers, <b>swage</b> <b>fitting,</b> dies and spelter sockets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Swage</b> (compression) <b>fittings</b> or {{cable clips}} {{are used to}} {{terminate}} counterweight system lift lines, after the cable has been looped around a thimble. Cable clips terminations maintain less load capacity than <b>swage</b> <b>fittings,</b> typically require three clips, and are greatly reduced in load capacity if the installer happened to [...] "saddle a dead horse". Both swage and cable clip terminations permanently crimp (deform) the wire rope.|$|R
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a <b>swage</b> <b>fitting,</b> and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when <b>swaging</b> <b>fittings</b> onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|R
5000|$|Swaging is {{a method}} of wire rope {{termination}} that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of <b>swaging</b> wire rope <b>fittings</b> is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic swager is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of <b>swaged</b> <b>fittings.</b> Threaded Studs, Ferrules, Sockets, and Sleeves are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|R
40|$|Tubular inserts {{reinforce}} joints, reducing {{incidence of}} leaks. In new swaging technique, tubular inserts placed inside ends of both tubes to be joined. Made from thicker-wall tubing with outside diameter that matches inside diameter of thin tubing swaged, inserts support tube ends at joint. They ensure more uniform contact between <b>swage</b> <b>fitting</b> and tubing. New swaging technique developed for Al/Ti/V-alloy hydraulic supply lines...|$|R
40|$|Test {{based on}} {{eddy-current}} probe technique identifies cracks in swaged metals. Hinged collar with spring-loaded latch holds probe {{in place on}} part tested. For repeated measurements on same or similar parts, collar loosened and moved to various measuring positions. Method suitable for many kinds of metal parts, including <b>swaged</b> <b>fittings,</b> tubing, and pipes. Used for rapid crack/no-crack determinations in suspect parts already installed...|$|R
5000|$|Tension grids for {{theatrical}} catwalks {{are typically}} constructed of 1/8" [...] diameter black galvanized aircraft cable woven into a taut grid with 2" [...] spacing, which corresponds {{to an open}} area (transparency) of approximately 94%. <b>Swaged</b> <b>fittings</b> terminate {{the ends of the}} cables, which are secured at a perimeter frame. Tension grid frames are typically made of steel channel or rectangular tubing. Tension grid assemblies are often made up of tension grid modules arranged in a grid and resting on support structure suspended from ceiling structure above.|$|R
50|$|Many {{other methods}} {{can be used}} to attach hoses or tubing, such as {{compression}} fittings (where a nylon or soft metal ferrule is compressed onto the hose by the tightening of the fitting), push-fit fittings (where the hose is inserted inside of a compression sleeve, designed such that force against the hose causes the sleeve to tighten), <b>swage</b> <b>fittings</b> (where a stiff collar is compressed onto the hose), clamp fittings (where two blocks are tightened onto the sides of the hose, often found on garden hoses), crimp banding (similar to worm gear banding but a crimp is used instead of a screw/thread), and a multitude of others. However, these devices are not typically referred to as hose clamps.|$|R
40|$|A cracked pipe {{assembly}} of hydraulic system-II of an aircraft was forwarded to this laboratory for establishing {{the cause of}} failure. Investigation revealed that the tube of the {{pipe assembly}} had developed a circumferential crack beneath one of the <b>swaged</b> end <b>fittings</b> by fretting fatigue mechanism. Analysis suggests {{that the reason for}} setting in fretting damage at the joint was due to inadequate closeness of the fit that was formed by swaging. Study also showed that after initiation, the propagation of the fatigue crack was relatively fast indicating possibility of substantial assembly stresses in the tube. The material of construction of the tube was found to conform to AMS 4944 D Ti-alloy specification, and no metallurgical abnormalities in the material were found responsible for the failure. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report and a few recommendations suggested for prevention of recurrence of similar failures in future...|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} impervious {{mechanical seal}} is formed between the outer {{surface of a}} tube and the inside surface of a mechanical fitting of a high pressure fluid or hydraulic system by applying a very thin soft metal layer onto the outer surface of the hard metal tube and/or inner surface of the hard metal <b>fitting,</b> prior to <b>swaging</b> the <b>fitting</b> onto the tube. The thickness of such thin metal layer is independent {{of the size of}} the tube and/or fittings. Many metals and alloys of those metals exhibit the requisite softness, including silver, gold, nickel, tin, platinum, indium, rhodium and cadmium. Suitably, the coating is about 0. 0025 millimeters (0. 10 mils) in thickness. After swaging, the tube and fitting combination exhibits very low leak rates on the order or 10. sup. - 8 cubic centimeters per second or less as meaured using the Helium leak test...|$|R
5000|$|Swagelok {{was founded}} by Fred Lennon and Cullen Crawford in 1947. The name Swagelok was created by Lennon and Crawford, for Crawford's {{invention}} of a leak-tight <b>fitting</b> <b>swage</b> which formed tubing that held the fitting in place. Crawford Fitting Co., manufactured and sold the fittings. In 1948, Lennon bought Crawford's share in the company. In 1955, Cajon Company was created, adding pipe fittings to the product line. Swagelok also began manufacturing in Canada. In 1957, Nuclear Products Company (Nupro Company) was acquired. In 1965, Swagelok moved its headquarters from Cleveland, Ohio to Solon, Ohio. In 1972, the company expanded into Japan. In 1986, Cajon Company, Whitey Company, and Sno-Trik Company, were all unified under the name the Swagelok Companies. Swagelok has more than 3000 employees.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel <b>fittings</b> <b>swaged</b> on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen is {{of great}} {{interest}} since the availability of traditional fossil fuels is in decline. Strictly speaking, hydrogen is not a primary source of energy but is an energy carrier, since energy typically must be used from another source (electricity, natural gas, coal, etc.) to produce it. Of hydrogen production techniques, the Sulfur-Iodine thermochemical water splitting process (S-I cycle), which was proposed by General Atomics (GA), is promising with its simplicity and high efficiency. Most of the chemicals are recycled except water. However, the S-I cycle operates in a harsh, corrosive environment {{in the presence of}} a mixture of iodine (I 2), hydroiodic acid (HI), and water (called HIx in the literature), phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) and sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) at different sections of the cycle. Hence, the corrosion performance of structural materials plays an important role in the success of the process. In a search for structural materials for the S-I cycle, a systematic material suitability study was conducted at GA and Ceramatec Inc. As a result of the preliminary study, corrosion-resistant materials such as tantalum alloys, niobium alloys, and ceramics were exposed to corrosive environments for extended periods. These environments were similar to the hydrogen iodide decomposition and sulfuric acid decomposition sections of the Sulfur-Iodine thermochemical hydrogen production cycle. Post mortem studies were conducted of parts from the recent Sulfur-Iodine Integrated Laboratory Scale (SI-ILS) test at GA. A HI distillation column boiler made of bulk tantalum alloy tube failed during refurbishment under shutdown conditions, and a few tantalum-coated steel parts (<b>swage</b> <b>fittings)</b> were found to have unexpected corrosion residues. This thesis reports the result of the microscopic and spectroscopic study of these exposed materials as well as the results of the post mortem investigations described above. The refractory tantalum and niobium alloys developed their metal oxide layers in the harsh corrosive environment of HI x /H 3 PO 4 at 120 °C. The study results indicate that there is a relation between the stability of these oxides and the corrosion of the alloys. The corrosion rate of the tantalum alloy decreases with exposure time due to the formation of a stable protective tantalum pentoxide film. On the other hand, the corrosion of niobium alloys is complicated by the formation of several oxides. The tantalum boiler section showed severe material degradation, and the observation of multiple contaminants at the fresh fracture surface leads to the suggestion that cracking of the tantalum led to the degradation. The cracking may be due to hydrogen embrittlement or another process. The curious form of the lateral cracking (delamination) may indicate investigations of the crystal form and fabrication technique of the tubing could be in order. In the silicon-based ceramic samples tested, silicon oxides were formed as a protective layer on the samples 2 ̆ 7 surface (except alumina). The type and structure of the silicon oxide depend on the fabrication process of the ceramic. Alumina showed a different corrosion mechanism than the silicon based ceramics. The study of corrosion of the refractory alloys in HI x /H 3 PO 4 and of ceramic materials in H 2 SO 4 reiterates the important role of oxidized layers, which formed on the surface of these materials as corrosion products, on their corrosion behavior. The XPS and SEM analytical techniques have proved their strength in the study of corrosion as well as in the failure analysis. The results from this study and from other studies (visual examinations, weight change measurements, and mechanical property tests) contributed to the material selection for the S-I cycle test as well as to the success of the test...|$|R
