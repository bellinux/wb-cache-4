This paper investigates the significance of short circuit levels of the grid on the fault ride through capability of the wind farm equipped with Fixed Speed Induction Generators. The minimum <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>level</b> of the grid required for uninterrupted operation of FSIG based wind farm during three phase fault is determined. Inadequate VAR support or reactive power support could result in low voltage levels and ultimately instability of the wind power systems. A balanced three phase fault is simulated at WT 3 in MATLAB/Simulink with Mechanically switched shunt capacitors and without Mechanically switched shunt capacitors at the 33 kV bus for different short circuit levels of the grid. The results shows that with Mechanically Switched Capacitors, fault ride through capability of the FSIG based wind farm increases and also improves the transient voltage stability therefore helps the wind farm to remain in service during faults.
