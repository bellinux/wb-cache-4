In 2008, three Linfield fans were charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick's Athletic, but were released. In November of the same year, Linfield player Conor Hagan was struck by a rocket that was fired from Cliftonville <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> the crowd following Linfield's 2–1 defeat, and the following month riot police were called into Glentoran <b>supporters</b> <b>in</b> the Boxing Day match after Linfield had taken a 2–0 lead.|$|E
