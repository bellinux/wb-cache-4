5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, naval weapons {{had a short}} range, so {{camouflage}} was unimportant for ships, and for the men {{on board}} them. Paint schemes were {{selected on the basis}} of ease of maintenance or aesthetics, typically buff upperworks (with polished brass fittings) and white or black hulls. Around the start of the 20th century, the increasing range of naval engagements, as demonstrated by the Battle of Tsushima, prompted the introduction of the first camouflage, in the form of some solid <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> overall, in the hope that ships would fade into the mist.|$|E

5|$|The uniform {{used by the}} Confederate States Marine Corps resembled that {{prescribed}} for the Confederate Army. However, there is controversy {{about some of the}} exact details of the uniform, since the CSMC was not as large, and many of its records were destroyed. In 1865, right after the war's end, Lloyd J. Beall, commander of the CSMC, had a fire at his home which destroyed most of the CSMC's records. It is clear, however, that the Marines were often equipped out of the stores of whichever garrison was nearest their location. One description has the Marines dressed in frock coats of a particular (and undetermined) <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> and dark blue or black trousers. It appears that Confederate Marines wore forage caps although it is unclear if there was any ornamentation on the cover. Much of the gear worn by the CSMC was imported from Russia, and from Great Britain and its empire, mainly Canada. This created a fairly unusual look.|$|E

25|$|Raiden's Fatality in the {{original}} game, in which he obliterated his opponent's head with a lightning strike, was drastically altered in the Super NES version due to Nintendo's strict no-blood policy at the time. The decapitation was changed to the opponent's simply turning into a gray pile of dust and a skull. In the same game, by using Raiden's finishing move on the final opponent in the third Endurance match, Goro appeared with a glitchy body {{that was the same}} <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> as the ashes of Raiden's defeated opponent.|$|E

25|$|Zero {{intensity}} {{for each}} component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the black), and full intensity of each gives a white; {{the quality of}} this white depends {{on the nature of}} the primary light sources, but if they are properly balanced, the result is a neutral white matching the system's white point. When the intensities for all the components are the same, the result is a <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> darker or lighter depending on the intensity. When the intensities are different, the result is a colorized hue, more or less saturated depending on the difference of the strongest and weakest of the intensities of the primary colors employed.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos invited Moore to {{work with}} him on a new musical project. Moore had worked with Matheos before, {{appearing}} as guest keyboardist on Fates Warning's 1989 album Perfect Symmetry, 1997 album A Pleasant <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gray</b> and 2000 album Disconnected. The new project involved Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and Cynic bassist/Chapman Stick player Sean Malone. This would be the first time Moore had worked with Portnoy since leaving Dream Theater nearly 10 years earlier. The band that was formed was named OSI, and they released the album Office of Strategic Influence. Musically, it can be described as a mixture of Chroma Key's dark, melodic focus with the guitars and heaviness of Fates Warning and Dream Theater. Moore assumed vocal duties.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} set {{to follow the}} stories of 8–10 playable characters, beginning with an American-Iranian State Department translator trying to free American hostages. This was later reduced to a single character: an aspiring Iranian photojournalist. Khonsari's goal was to allow players to [...] "see {{the world is a}} lot more gray than black and white", achieving this by having a protagonist who experienced the Revolution. The game's characters are based on the interviews conducted with Iranians who experienced the Revolution. Executive producer Vassiliki Khonsari said the characters [...] "do not fall into the typical good guy/bad guy, but everyone is a <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> ... to show the complexity of history". The team featured a variety of characters from different families, beliefs and social classes.|$|E

500|$|Ghost Rider was {{designed}} by Marvel Television creative director Joshua Shaw, based on Felipe Smith's design from the comics. His jacket was then custom made by costume designer Ann Foley and her team. The character's skull design includes exhaust-type jets of flames coming from the temples to mimic the effects on his car. Foley worked with the visual effects department {{to ensure that the}} costume would not interfere with their work. Aida's costume was also custom made, and inspired by the works of Alexander McQueen. The costume evolves through the season, becoming a darker <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> when the more ruthless [...] "Aida 2.0" [...] is introduced. Foley left the show after the thirteenth episode of the season, to work on a television adaptation of Altered Carbon, and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to [...] "blend in" [...] with Foley's established look, and also noted that the majority of her work was designing for the Framework reality which allowed her to not exactly match with previous designs. Riley took Foley's costumes for Aida as the base shape of the Madame Hydra costume, but looked to make it feel [...] "stronger" [...] and more military-esque than those costumes by having the shoulders of the costume evoke epaulettes. The costume uses the color green, which is closely tied with the character in the comics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{back of the}} {{cartridge}} bears a label with handling instructions. Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the back label to correspond with the software version and producer. All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray</b> plastic, {{with the exception of}} The Legend of Zelda and , which were manufactured in gold-plastic carts. Unlicensed carts were produced in black, robin egg blue, and gold, and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these [...] "test carts" [...] were never made available for purchase. All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo, Konami and Acclaim. For promotion of , Capcom sent 150 limited-edition gold NES cartridges with the original game, featuring the Remastered art as the sticker, to different gaming news agencies. The instruction label on the back included the opening lyric from the show's theme song, [...] "Life is like a hurricane".|$|E
2500|$|Frisch was {{the first}} to {{demonstrate}} (in 1914) that honey bees had color vision, which he accomplished by using classical conditioning. [...] He trained bees to feed on a dish of sugar water set on a colored card. He then set the colored card {{in the middle of a}} set of gray-toned cards. If the bees see the colored card as a <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> then they will confuse the blue card with at least one of the gray-toned cards; bees arriving to feed will visit more than one card in the array. On the other hand, if they have color vision, then the bees visit only the blue card, as it is visually distinct from the other cards. A bee’s color perception is comparable to that of humans, but with a shift away from the red toward the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For that reason bees cannot distinguish red from black (colorless), but they can distinguish the colors white, yellow, blue and violet. Color pigments which reflect UV radiation expand the spectrum of colors which can be differentiated. For example, several blossoms which may appear to humans to be of the same yellow color will appear to bees as having different colors (multicolored patterns) because of their different proportions of ultraviolet.|$|E

Each year she had to impress Mrs. Tubbs of West Skipsit with new metropolitan finery, and this year Father had no peace nor comfort in the ménage till she had selected a smart new hat, incredibly small and close and sinking coyly down over her ear. He was only a man folk, {{he was in the}} way, incapable of understanding this problem of fashion, and Mother almost slapped him one evening for suggesting that it [...] "wouldn't make such a gosh-awful lot of difference if she didn't find some new fad to impress Sister Tubbs." ...|$|E
60|$|They had decidedly prettier patios {{and more}} of them, and they had many public {{carriages}} against none whatever in that ancient capital. Rubber tires I did not expect in Cordova and certainly did not get {{in a city where}} a single course over the pavements of 850 would have worn them to tatters: but there seems a good deal of public spirit if one may judge {{from the fact that it}} is the municipality which keeps Abderrahman's mosque in repair. There are public gardens, far pleasanter than those of Valladolid, which we visited in an interval of the afternoon, and there is a very personable bull-ring to which we drove in the vain hope of seeing the people come out in a typical multitude. But there had been no feast of bulls; and we had to make what we could out of the walking and driving in the Paseo del Gran Capitan toward evening. In its long, discouraging course there were some good houses, but not many, and the promenaders of any social quality were almost as few. Some ladies in private carriages were driving out, and a great many more in public ones as well dressed as the others, but with no pretense of state in the horses or drivers. The women of the people all wore flowers in their hair, a dahlia or a marigold, whether their hair was black or gray. No ladies were walking in the Paseo, except one pretty mother, with her nice-looking children about her, who totaled the sum of her class; but men of every class rather swarmed. High or low, they all wore the kind of hat which abounds everywhere in Andalusia and is called a Cordovese: flat, stiff, squat in crown and wide in brim, and of every <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>gray,</b> brown, and black.|$|E
