40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a {{multimedia}} signalling protocol that {{has evolved into}} a widely adopted communication standard. The integration of SIP into existing IP networks has fostered IP networks becoming a convergence platform for both real-time and non-real-time multimedia communications. This converged platform integrates data, voice, video, presence, messaging, and conference services into a single network that offers new communication experiences for users. The open source community has contributed to SIP adoption through the development of open source software for both SIP clients and servers. In this paper, we provide a survey on open SIP systems that can be built using publically available software. We identify SIP features for service development and programming, services and applications of a SIP-converged platform, and the most important technologies supporting SIP functionalities. We propose an advanced converged IP communication platform that uses SIP for service delivery. The platform supports audio and video calls, along with media services such as audio conferences, voicemail, presence, and instant messaging. Using SIP Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the platform allows the deployment of advanced integrated services. The platform is implemented with open source software. Architecture components run on standardized hardware with no need for <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> {{private equity}} fund (SPPEF) also called a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> private equity <b>investment</b> fund, is a legal entity, {{frequently}} a Limited Liability Company incorporated in the US state of Delaware, {{but it can be}} any type of corporation or partnership entity and of any domicile, including sovereign states. It is formed so as to enable a group of investors, usually individuals, to invest collectively in another entity. It is mostly used to enable private investors in early- stage technology companies pool their resources and invest on the same terms as a traditional venture capital fund would. Such investors are typically referred to as angel investors.|$|R

5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS {{was interested in the}} idea, but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entity Chewco <b>Investments</b> limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.|$|R

5000|$|Shadow {{institutions}} {{typically do}} not have banking licenses; they do not take deposits as a depository bank would and therefore {{are not subject to}} the same regulations. [...] Complex legal entities comprising the system include hedge funds, structured <b>investment</b> <b>vehicles</b> (SIV), <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entity conduits (SPE), money market funds, repurchase agreement (repo) markets and other non-bank financial institutions. Many shadow banking entities are sponsored by banks or are affiliated with banks through their subsidiaries or parent bank holding companies. The inclusion of money market funds in the definition of shadow banking has been questioned in view of their relatively simple structure and the highly regulated and unleveraged nature of these entities, which are considered safer, more liquid, and more transparent than banks.|$|R
