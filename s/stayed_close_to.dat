US25 <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the shoreline and passed Lakeport State Park {{in the town of}} the same name.

5|$|The 31st Division {{remained}} at Morotai until 12 April 1945 when it departed {{to participate in}} the liberation of Mindanao, and was replaced by the 93rd Infantry Division. The 93rd Division was a segregated African American unit, and was mainly used for security and labor tasks during the war. Once established on Morotai the division conducted intensive patrols with the aim of destroying the remaining Japanese force on the island. At this time most of the Japanese on Morotai were located along the island's west coast, and generally <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> native gardens. The 93rd Division landed patrols along Morotai's west and north coasts from April onwards, and these fought scattered skirmishes with small Japanese forces. One of the division's main goals was to capture Colonel Ouchi, and this was achieved by a patrol from the 25th Infantry Regiment on 2 August. Ouchi was one of the highest-ranked Japanese officers to be captured {{before the end of the}} war. The American force also used propaganda broadcasts and leaflets to encourage Japanese soldiers on Morotai to surrender, with some success.|$|E

A rather flimsy-looking cloth belt is tied high under the ribs as a badge of rank rather than a practical item.|$|E

25|$|Penn was not disinherited and he {{came into}} a large fortune, but found himself in jail again for six months as he {{continued}} to agitate. After gaining his freedom, he finally married Gulielma Springett in April 1672, after a four-year engagement filled with frequent separations. Penn <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> home but continued writing his tracts, espousing religious tolerance and railing against discriminatory laws. A minor split developed in the Quaker community between those who favoured Penn's analytical formulations and those who preferred Fox's simple precepts. But the persecution of Quakers had accelerated and the differences were overridden; Penn again resumed missionary work in Holland and Germany.|$|E
25|$|The men's race {{started at}} a middling-pace and 20 runners (mostly Kenyans, Ethiopians and Eritreans) {{had formed a}} leading pack by the third lap. Defending {{champion}} Gebregziabher Gebremariam was not among them and it soon became obvious he would not reach the podium for a second year running. Samuel Tsegay and Teklemariam Medhin of Eritrea began to increase the pace {{at the beginning of}} the fourth lap. This disrupted the pack and by the end of the lap Medhin was leading, shortly followed by Joseph Ebuya and Moses Kipsiro, who was a little further behind. Ebuya took the lead and he continued the quicker pace for the fifth and final lap. Medhin <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Ebuya, however, while Leonard Komon and Kipsiro were battling for the bronze medal position.|$|E
25|$|The {{theater was}} bounded by the Appalachian Mountains {{to the west}} and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. By far, the {{majority}} of battles occurred in the 100 miles between the cities of Washington and Richmond. This terrain favored the Confederate defenders because a series of rivers ran primarily west to east, making them obstacles rather than avenues of approach and lines of communication for the Union invaders. This was quite different than {{the early years of the}} Western theater, and since the Union Army had to rely solely on the primitive road system of the era for its primary transportation, it limited winter campaigning for both sides. The Union advantage was control of the sea and major rivers, which would allow an army that <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ocean to be reinforced and supplied.|$|E

25|$|Maud {{had married}} Sir Thomas Parr, {{the eldest son}} of Sir William Parr and Elizabeth FitzHugh, in 1508 {{when she was about}} 16 years old. He was the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, master of the wards and {{comptroller}} to the King. Maud and Thomas had three surviving children. Although Thomas Parr inherited properties in the north including Kendal Castle in Westmorland, the Parr's resided at Parr House which was located on The Strand in London. By the time Sir Thomas had inherited the castle, it was in need of repair and eventually became derelict. Parr and his wife were courtiers and <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> court. Thomas Parr died of the sweating sickness on 11 November 1517, leaving Maud a widow at the age of 25. She chose not to remarry for fear of jeopardizing the huge inheritance she held in trust for her children. She carefully supervised the education of her children and studiously arranged their marriages.|$|E
25|$|Locally, {{mopping up}} {{operations}} around Cape Gloucester continued throughout early 1944, although by February 1944 US planners began preparing {{to expand their}} lodgement further east. In early March 1944, the Americans launched an operation to capture Talasea, on the northern coast of New Britain, as part of actions to follow up Japanese troops who were beginning a general withdrawal towards Cape Hoskins and Rabaul. The 1st Marine Division was relieved around Cape Gloucester on 23 April 1944, and were replaced by the 40th Infantry Division. After this, a period of relative quiet followed on New Britain as the US confined their operations largely to {{the western end of}} the island, having decided at a strategic level to bypass Rabaul, while the Japanese <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> their base around Rabaul {{at the opposite end of}} the island. Later, responsibility for operations on New Britain transferred from US forces to the Australians. In November 1944, they landed at Jacquinot Bay before beginning a limited offensive aimed at securing Wide Bay and Open Bay and confining the larger Japanese force to the Gazelle Peninsula, where they remained until the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|Following {{even more}} {{training}} in northeastern Dijon, on August 24, the 90th Infantry Division entered a {{sector of the}} front {{on the eastern side}} of the St. Mihiel salient. At the time Pershing, now a full general and Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the AEF on the Western Front, was getting ready for his first major offensive–closing off the salient. Allen's unit was to form the right pivot in the offensive. It started early on September 12 when the offensive began. After a rolling barrage, the division kept moving ahead. Over the next nine hours, Allen's men captured their objectives and by September 16, the Americans had reduced the salient. After the salient was eliminated, Pershing planned for the American forces to attack west at Meuse-Argonne. In the beginning, Allen's unit <b>stayed</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> St. Mihiel, covered sectors already left vacate by the troops who went west, and grouped together their positions. Once the battle had become more intense, Allen and his men entered the lines close to Bantheville. The 90th advanced slowly and Allen relieved officers who he found to be incompetent or weak. The division was able to get through the Meuse River near Stenay only several days before the signing of the Armistice of November 11, 1918.|$|E
