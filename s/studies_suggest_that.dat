5|$|Physcia caesia {{was first}} {{described}} by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1784 as Lichen caesius. Other lichenologists assigned it to various other genera {{both before and}} after it was moved into its current genus by Georg Ernst Ludwig Hampe in 1839. It has 2 subspecies, P. c. caesia and P. c. ventosa, {{as well as a number}} of distinct forms and varieties, some of which were thought to be distinct species in the past. Although this species and Physcia aipolia have been considered a species pair, some molecular <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> they should instead be considered conspecific. Other molecular <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> both Physcia caesia and Physcia aipolia are polyphyletic taxa, with various forms more closely related to other species than to each other.|$|E

5|$|Basic {{research}} on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects.

5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups.

Experimental <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E

5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E

Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference.

5|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos {{has met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other <b>studies</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E
