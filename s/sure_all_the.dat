5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to {{go to great lengths to}} make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen {{days after}} the festival, to make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hungry ghosts find {{their way back to}} hell, people float water {{lanterns}} and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a paper boat. The lanterns are used to direct the ghosts back to the underworld, and when they go out, it symbolizes that they have found their way back.|$|E
25|$|After juice filtration, {{additional}} {{ingredients are}} added to the mixture to achieve the desired taste and consistency. Some of the main ingredients used to create ketchup include sweeteners, vinegar, salt and spices, and flavouring. These additions are usually integrated later on in the process with the exception of some spices added in at the beginning. Throughout the entire process, temperature must be consistently monitored to make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ingredients are being added and absorbed properly. Air is then removed in order to prevent oxidation, maintain proper colouring and inhibit the growth of any unwanted bacteria. Before being packaged, the ketchup is heated to approx.190°F (88°C) to prevent contamination.|$|E

However, Aung Min, a President’s Office Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president {{the responsibility of the}} students' safety until they arrived in Popa in Mandalay Region. The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{missions}} {{were designed}} to suit the story, rather than the story to fit the missions. Taking inspiration from GoldenEye 007, the team added a difficulty system that changes mission objectives; Leonard said [...] "it allowed the designers to create a very different experience at each level of difficulty, without changing the overall geometry and structure of a mission. This gave the game {{a high degree of}} replayability at a minimum development cost". The team extended the concept by decreasing the player's ability to kill human characters on higher difficulty settings. Writer and voice actress Terri Brosius said: [...] "We took pains to make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> missions could be won without killing any humans".|$|E
500|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a [...] "Fan's Revenge" [...] Lumberjack match by LAX against James Storm and Robert Roodenow {{known as}} Beer Money Incorporatedin the fourth match of the show. LAX were {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by Salinas and Héctor Guerrero, while Storm and Roode were accompanied by Jackie Moore. In a [...] "Fan's Revenge" [...] Lumberjack match, people are chosen from the audience {{to take part in}} the encounter by standing around the ring with straps, in which their primary purpose is to make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> participants remain in the ring. If the participants do not remain in the ring, then the fans that are chosen are supposed to hit them with the straps until they re-enter. Roode was whipped twice during the encounter; the first when he was thrown to the ringside area, while the second was when he fell to the outside. LAX won the match at 10 minutes and 6 seconds when Hernandez pinned Roode following LAX's signature 5150 tag team maneuver.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Lester Bangs gave a lukewarm assessment and called Wavelength [...] "a very nice record. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people at Warner Bros. are pleased with it. Ditto the DJs... Still, though, it do confound {{how such a}} monumental talent can mire himself in such twaddle, fine as some of it may be." [...] Melody Maker reviewed the album as evidence of Morrison's [...] "drift into the American Dream." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau {{referred to it as}} a good but not great album and called attention to side two, which he felt was [...] "an evocative reinterpretation of Van's America fixation, but side one is nothing more (and nothing less) than class programming." [...] Time magazine was more enthusiastic: [...] "Morrison has made two, maybe three albums that rank high among the finest of all rock 'n' roll. Wavelength is good enough to stand close by Morrison's best work, a record of sinuous, sensuous magic. The man just can't be beat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital. Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We tried morphing to a live action Hoff – {{but it did not}} hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version,..and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double,- we didn't {{want to go to the}} same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> effects stuck correctly to the body… so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt." [...] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment. Gunn added that there are [...] "over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Zoo TV Tour, U2 aired {{controversial}} satellite link-ups to Sarajevo. The link-ups {{were arranged}} by aid worker Bill Carter, who interviewed ordinary people {{about their experiences}} of the ongoing War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As {{a result of the}} satellite broadcasts, U2 promised to play in Sarajevo. The Sarajevo show had to wait until the PopMart Tour, when U2 became the first major band to perform in the city after the war had ended. [...] The highly emotional concert was among the highlights of the PopMart Tour. 45,000 people attended and effort was made to make <b>sure</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ethnic groups were present. Also in attendance were several hundred members of the international [...] "Stabilisation Force" [...] (SFOR) who were tasked at that time with upholding the Dayton Agreement. [...] During the encore, Brian Eno got on stage for the band's first ever live performance of [...] "Miss Sarajevo." [...] Luciano Pavarotti, who was guest vocalist on the original recording was not in Sarajevo. However, his vocal was retained. An old style phonograph, complete with amplifying horn, was brought on stage for the song and its stylus was moved into position by Brian Eno to coincide with the tenor's vocal contribution. Unfortunately, the performance of this song did not go as well as planned as the band's timing was off and Bono was having difficulty with his voice. It was in this context that Bono chose to apologize to the audience for the band not being able to [...] "fucking play it." [...] After the Sarajevo show in 1997, [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was not played again until the second leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2005.|$|E
