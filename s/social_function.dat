40|$|Studies {{have linked}} {{cognitive}} <b>functioning</b> to everyday <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in psychotic disorders, but {{the nature of}} the relationships between cognition, social cognition, symptoms, and <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> remains unestablished. Modelling the contributions of non-social and social cognitive ability in the prediction of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> may help in more clearly defining therapeutic targets to improve functioning. In a sample of 745 patients with a non-affective psychotic disorder, the associations between cognition and social cognition at baseline on the one hand, and self-reported <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> three years later on the other, were analysed. First, case-control comparisons were conducted; associations were subsequently further explored in patients, investigating the potential mediating role of symptoms. Analyses were repeated in a subsample of 233 patients with recent-onset psychosis. Information processing speed and immediate verbal memory were stronger associated with <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in patients than in healthy controls. Most cognition variables significantly predicted <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> at follow-up, whereas social cognition was not associated with <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Symptoms were robustly associated with follow-up <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> with negative symptoms fully mediating most associations between cognition and follow-up <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Illness duration did not moderate the strength of the association between cognitive <b>functioning</b> and follow-up <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> No associations were found between (social) cognition and follow-up <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in patients with recent-onset psychosis. Although cognitive functioning is associated with later <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in psychotic disorder, its role in explaining <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> outcome above negative symptoms appears only modest.

Method: Subjects were 140 offspring of bipolar parents and 1122 adolescents and 1175 young adults from the general population. Parent, teacher and self-report ratings were used to assess <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Results: Analyses revealed no differences in scores on <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> for offspring aged I I to 18 years, and few differences for ages 18 to 26 years compared to same aged individuals from the general population. Offspring with a DSM-IV disorder showed a lower level of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> compared to Dutch subjects from the general population in the same age range. Limitations: The limitations of this study are lack of information on the representativeness of the sample and use of one measure for <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Conclusions: Bipolar offspring in the adolescent age range have good overall level of <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>functioning</b> in offspring aged 18 years or older with a bipolar or other mood disorder is impaired.

The present study investigated gender differences in child, parent, and teacher perceptions of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> among ADHD and control children. Participants included 119 children (ages 6 - 11) and their parents. Sixty-one children were previously diagnosed with ADHD. Parents, teachers, and children completed measures assessing the child's <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} relationship between ADHD status and <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> differs as a function of rater. Teachers and parents reported that ADHD children had lower <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> than controls, while ADHD and control children reported similar levels of <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Gender differences were found on the child self-report, with girls reporting lower <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> than boys. In ADHD children the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and comorbid depression differed as a function of rater.

40|$|Aims: The study aims {{to compare}} <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> {{in young people}} {{considered}} {{to be at risk}} of psychosis with those meeting criteria for first episode psychosis (FEP) and controls, and to determine the association between <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and positive and negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, and social anxiety. Methods: This study examined <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in 20 individuals at risk of psychosis, 20 FEP patients and 20 healthy controls. <b>Social</b> <b>functioning</b> was measured using the <b>Social</b> <b>Functioning</b> Scale and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale. Psychiatric variables were also measured using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Brief Social Phobia Scale, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale. Results: At-risk individuals had comparable social deficits to the FEP group, and both patient groups had significantly poorer <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> than controls. Importantly, <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> was most strongly associated with depressive and social anxiety symptoms {{and to a lesser extent}} with positive symptoms. However, negative symptoms did not appear to relate to <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Conclusion: <b>Social</b> <b>functioning</b> impairments precede the onset of full-threshold psychosis and may therefore be a significant marker for the illness.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to examine <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) within the first 2 years after a cancer diagnosis and compare their scores with population norms and identify trajectories of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> over time and its correlates. METHODS: A multicenter, longitudinal study was conducted among 215 AYA patients with cancer aged 14 to 39 years. A total of 141 patients completed a self-report measure of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> within the first 4 months of diagnosis and again at 12 months and 24 months later. RESULTS: AYA patients with cancer were found to have significantly worse <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> scores around the time of diagnosis (52. 0 vs 85. 1; P<. 001), at the 12 -month follow-up (73. 1 vs 85. 1; P<. 001), and at the 24 -month follow-up (69. 2 vs 85. 1; P<. 001) when compared with population norms. Significant improvements in <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> from baseline to the 12 -month follow-up were observed; however, <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> levels remained stable thereafter. Among participants, 9 % demonstrated consistently high/normal <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> 47 % demonstrated improved <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> 13 % were found to have worsening <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> and 32 % demonstrated consistently low <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> AYA patients with cancer who had consistently low <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> were more often off treatment at the time of follow-up, reported more physical symptoms and higher levels of distress at baseline and follow-up, and perceived less social support at baseline compared with the other 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although improved over time, <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> still was found to be compromised 24 months after the primary diagnosis. Nearly one-third of these patients remain at risk of poor <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Reducing physical symptoms and psychological distress and enhancing social support by interventions during the period after treatment may potentially help these young survivors to better reintegrate into society.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early-onset bipolar {{disorder}} (BD), typically defined as illness onset occurring prior to late adolescence, {{is associated with}} a broad range of significant psychosocial impairments. The current study sought to characterize <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> among patients who had previously participated in a randomized controlled trial of family focused treatment. METHODS: Thirty BD subjects (mean age = 19. 07; female = 62 %) and 30 healthy adolescent controls (mean age = 17. 50; female = 60 %) completed interviews and a battery of questionnaires assessing <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and psychiatric symptoms. BD participants’ current data were compared to <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> affective symptom, and family functioning data collected during intake assessments for the treatment study. RESULTS: BD participants reported poorer <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> than controls across all study measures. Levels of depression predicted use of <b>social</b> skills; <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> was otherwise independent of concurrent affective symptoms. Intake measures of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> did not predict current social impairment; teen- and parent-reported family cohesion at study intake significantly predicted current social skill use. Finally, depression at study intake, and not prior measures of <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> predicted current depression. CONCLUSIONS: Those with early-onset BD lag behind their healthy peers in <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> suggesting the importance of interpersonal impairment as a treatment target with this population.

40|$|Impaired <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> {{is one of}} the {{diagnostic}} features of schizophrenia. Cognitive functioning is also often impaired in several domains. Meta-analysis has shown a predictive value of cognition for a variety of domains related to <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> (Green, Kern, Braff, & Mintz, 2000). The significance of these findings for clinical practice has remained largely uninvestigated, however, and is therefore taken up here. We investigated verbal memory, attention and executive functioning in 52 schizophrenia patients. <b>Social</b> <b>functioning</b> was assessed for different types of social roles.

Although both psychologic and pharmacologic treatments generally improve many depressive symptoms, {{they do not}} always result in significant improvement in <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> The importance of recovery of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in depressed patients is now widely appreciated, and studies are beginning to include it in evaluations of therapeutic efficacy. Among the various social adjustment evaluation rating scales, the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale, a social motivation and behavior scale, {{has been found to}} be simple to use and sensitive to change. Using this scale, the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, reboxetine, has been shown to be significantly more effective in improving <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. These findings are consistent with the notion that improvement in <b>social</b> adaptation involves <b>functions</b> depending primarily on noradrenergic neurotransmission. This hypothesis suggests that the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and milnacipran, could be particularly helpful in improving <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Preliminary studies with the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors suggest that they significantly improve <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Comparative studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the effects on <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> should be encouraged.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{reviews the}} {{available}} data on <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in depression and provides clinical guidelines and opinion on this important and expanding field. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify all English-language articles (1988 - 1999) using the search terms depression and <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> depression and <b>social</b> adjustment, depression and psychosocial <b>functioning,</b> and <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and antidepressant.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Depressive disorders are frequently associated with significant and pervasive impairments in <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> often substantially worse than those experienced by patients with other chronic medical conditions. The enormous personal, social, and economic impact of depression, due in no small part to the associated impairments in <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> is often underappreciated. Both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches can improve social impairments, although {{there is a lack of}} extended, randomized controlled trials in this area using consistent assessment criteria. CONCLUSION: Despite this lack, it is becoming clear that not all treatments are equally effective in relieving the impaired <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> associated with depressive disorders.

When evaluating <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> both objective and subjective appraisals should be taken into account, because they may highlight different aspects of <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> <b>Social</b> support, impact of gender, and specific characteristics of older-old patients figure among areas that should be given priority in future research of <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in late life schizophrenia.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} of associations between <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and theory of mind performance and between <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and negative symptoms in chronic psychosis. This study investigates these associations in those with first episode psychosis who are unaffected by factors related to long-term mental illness. Our first hypothesis states {{that there is an}} association between theory of mind and <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> The second hypothesis states that there is no association between symptoms of psychosis and <b>social</b> <b>functioning.</b> Methods. Fifty-two individuals with first episode psychosis were assessed for <b>social</b> <b>functioning,</b> theory of mind ability (using the Hinting test with verbal stimuli and the Visual Cartoon test with pictorial stimuli), and symptoms of psychosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations. Results. <b>Social</b> <b>functioning</b> and theory of mind were associated when measured by the Hinting test (OR 1. 70, 95 % CI 1. 08, 2. 66), but not with the Visual Cartoon test (ToM jokes OR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 15, 2. 53). There was no association between <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> and symptoms (psychotic symptoms; OR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 81, 1. 12; selected negative symptoms; OR 1. 33, 95 % CI 0. 78, 2. 25). Conclusions. Theory of mind assessed by verbal stimuli is associated with <b>social</b> <b>functioning</b> in a population with first episode psychosis. These findings may be related to language disorders in psychosis...|$|R
