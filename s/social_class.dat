5|$|In Syria, ethnic {{minorities}} were often underprivileged, and a specific ethnicity often {{belonged to a}} specific <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> The Alawites, the Druzes and the Isma'ilis for instance, were ethnic groups with low <b>social</b> <b>class</b> who began to embrace a radical form of Arab nationalism, e.g. Ba'athism. Without the peasantry there {{could not have been}} a Ba'athist revolution in Syria. The new middle class alone could only produce instability, but together with the peasantry, the revolution became possible. The inequality between urban and rural dwellers, together with capitalist penetration of the agrarian sector and the traditional elites' monopolisation of most large revenue sources, led to the establishment of peasant movements who fought for change, or opposed the system. The Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was able to recruit young peasants from radical peasant movements, and because of it, was able to mobilise large sectors of the population.|$|E
50|$|The {{continued}} existence of poverty in the 1960s was also characterised by differences in health between different <b>social</b> <b>classes.</b> In 1964-65 the incidence of infant deaths was more than half as much higher in the two lowest <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> than in the two highest <b>social</b> <b>classes.</b> In 1961-62 28% of all men recorded at least one spell of sickness of four days or more. For the lowest <b>social</b> <b>classes,</b> however, 35% of men had experienced this, compared with 18% {{of men in the}} highest <b>social</b> <b>classes.</b> There is evidence that in large families the height of children was less than that for the average, while families with three or more children {{were more likely to be}} inadequately nourished.|$|R
40|$|Departing from sociological interpretations {{inspired}} by May of 1968, this article attempts {{to revive the}} centrality of the theory of <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> for the understanding of the different social movements and collective organizations. To that end, it departs from the contributions of Nicos Poulantzas’s Political Power and <b>Social</b> <b>Classes,</b> attempting to determine its peculiarities, advances and limits en relation to the process of renovation of Marxism, in general, and the Althusserian current, in particular. The general thesis is that this work has a theory of <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> in a practical state, whose principle characteristic is the primacy of social practices in the delimitation of <b>social</b> <b>classes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity.

40|$|AIM—To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of socioeconomic status on growth pattern in height from age 7 to 23 years.  METHODS—Prospective cohort study. A total of 10 200 white singleton born children from the 1958 British birth cohort (National Child Development Study) were analysed.  RESULTS—Differences in height by birth weight persisted throughout the follow up period. However, the mean differences in height between low birth weight infants (< 2500 g) and adequate birth weight infants (⩾ 2500 g) were less notable in <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> I and II than in the lower <b>social</b> <b>classes.</b> The catching up of growth in height of low birth weight infants was also more pronounced in <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> I and II than in other <b>social</b> <b>classes.</b> That is, the mean height deficits of low birth weight infants were decreased from 2. 9 cm at age 7, to 1. 6 cm at age 16, and 2. 5 cm at age 23; the significant difference disappeared after age 16 in <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> I and II. Although such improving tendency was more pronounced among the preterm born infants, a similar growth pattern was observed among the term infants. Such improvement was not observed in the other <b>social</b> <b>classes.</b>  CONCLUSION—The growth retardation in height by birth weight can be overcome by improved social conditions and proper health care from childhood to adulthood. ...|$|R

5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning <b>social</b> <b>class</b> influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
