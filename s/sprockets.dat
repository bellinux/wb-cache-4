The distance from the bottom bracket to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The <b>sprockets</b> were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.|$|E

50|$|One {{problem with}} roller chains is the {{variation}} in speed, or surging, caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the chain as it goes around the <b>sprocket</b> link by link. It starts {{as soon as the}} pitch line of the chain contacts the first tooth of the <b>sprocket.</b> This contact occurs at a point below the pitch circle of the <b>sprocket.</b> As the <b>sprocket</b> rotates, the chain is raised up to the pitch circle and is then dropped down again as <b>sprocket</b> rotation continues. Because of the fixed pitch length, the pitch line of the link cuts across the chord between two pitch points on the <b>sprocket,</b> remaining in this position relative to the <b>sprocket</b> until the link exits the <b>sprocket.</b> This rising and falling of the pitch line is what causes chordal effect or speed variation.|$|R

25|$|With a {{chain drive}} transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to a}} crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear <b>sprocket(s)</b> (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 <b>sprockets,</b> hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple <b>sprockets</b> (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E
25|$|Compact gearing is not {{necessarily}} lower than standard gearing if cassettes with smaller <b>sprockets</b> (such as 11–23) are used. A high gear of 50×11 on a compact drivechain is actually slightly higher than the 53×12 of a standard set.|$|E
25|$|Derailleur type {{mechanisms}} {{of a typical}} mid-range product (of the sort used by serious amateurs) achieve between 88% and 99% mechanical efficiency at 100W.

25|$|Compact gearing {{usually has}} a large {{percentage}} jump between the two chainrings. In balance, it may also allow small jumps in the rear by allowing a closer ratio cassette to be used, except for the 9% jump {{at the high end}} between the 11 and 12 tooth <b>sprockets.</b>|$|E
25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double or triple {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally geared hub, extending the gear range without having to fit multiple <b>sprockets</b> to the hub. However, this does require a chain tensioner of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} to chaindrive {{is to use}} a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain - popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance.

25|$|Bicycle {{manufacturing}} {{proved to}} be a training ground for other industries and {{led to the development of}} advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as ball bearings, washers, and <b>sprockets.</b> These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and <b>sprockets</b> in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes {{have two or three}} chainrings, and from 5 to 11 <b>sprockets</b> on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E
50|$|The three-speed bicycle is {{a bicycle}} that uses {{internal}} hub gears {{at the rear}} wheel hub to provide three gear ratios.

40|$|HP <b>Sprocket</b> is a pocket-size photo printer, {{released}} in the market in September 2016. About {{the size of a}} smartphone, this Bluetooth printer goes anywhere. The <b>Sprocket</b> gives customers the ability to use their smartphone to take photos, with the added benefit of having a physical picture to keep forever. The <b>Sprocket</b> works with an App on a smartphone or a tablet. It instantly prints photos that are 2 X 3 inches and waterproof. With a peel able back, photos can turn into fun stickers. The <b>Sprocket</b> works with social media feeds, so you can incorporate text, emojis, filters and frames before you print. The <b>Sprocket</b> retails for $ 129. 99 and replacement paper is $ 10 for 20 photo papers. The <b>Sprocket</b> is unique in that it does not require replacement ink. Instead, it uses Zink technology, and only requires the HP replacement photo paper. HP is counting on the <b>Sprocket</b> to boost their lagging printer sales. Currently, the printer market is stagnant. The introduction of the <b>Sprocket</b> boosted sales over the 2016 holidays season. So unexpectedly, that the <b>Sprocket</b> sold out. Although the competition is fierce, the <b>Sprocket</b> has edged out competitors to hold a slight market share lead. Based on App downloads, current market share is 38 %. After implementation of the marketing plan, the <b>Sprocket</b> is projected to increase market share to 51 % by the end of 2018. The <b>Sprocket</b> was originally marketed to the teenage girl demographic. There is a real opportunity for growth by pivoting to additional segments. The <b>Sprocket</b> will be promoted heavily in the category of women with children. This demographic holds the most opportunity, as they are making the majority of buying decisions as well as making gift purchases. The gifting opportunity will be promoted heavily during graduation season and Mother’s Day. To a lesser extent, the <b>Sprocket</b> will continue to be promoted to teenage girls, and additionally to the active senior population. Those seniors who are retired, use a smartphone, but would like to retain physical pictures. The <b>Sprocket</b> will be promoted through social media, with a separate campaign for each segment, as well as through tech fairs, SEO, and traditional advertising channels. The team will monitor these campaigns through a newly created marketing dashboard. In addition to an increase in sales, the marketing department will monitor customer satisfaction and customer engagement through on line reviews and online community engagement. The key success factors will be growth in sales, market share growth, and holiday sales growth...|$|R

25|$|Prior to 1937 {{this was}} the only {{permitted}} form of gear changing on the Tour de France. Competitors could have 2 <b>sprockets</b> {{on each side of the}} rear wheel, but still had to stop to manually move the chain from one sprocket to the other and adjust the position of the rear wheel so as to maintain the correct chain tension.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{which have}} been shown to affect the {{drive-train}} efficiency include the type of transmission system (chain, shaft, belt), the type of gearing system (fixed, derailleur, hub, infinitely variable), the size of the <b>sprockets</b> used, the magnitude of the input power, the pedalling speed, and how rusty the chain is. For a particular gearing system, different gear ratios generally have different efficiencies.|$|E
25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and <b>sprockets.</b> It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|E

50|$|Chain-drive {{systems such}} as the {{derailleur}} systems work best if the chain is aligned with the <b>sprocket</b> plane, especially avoiding the biggest drive <b>sprocket</b> running with the biggest driven <b>sprocket</b> (or the smallest with the smallest).

25|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%). This {{was used in the}} mid-20th century when front derailleurs could only handle a small step between chainrings and when rear cogsets only had a small number of <b>sprockets,</b> e.g. chainrings 44-48 and cogset 14-17-20-24-28. The effect is to provide two interlaced gear ranges without any duplication. However to step sequentially through the gear ratios requires a simultaneous front and rear shift on every other gear change. This style is not available off the shelf.|$|E
