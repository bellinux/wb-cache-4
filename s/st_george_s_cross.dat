Mahler# Minimal {{important difference}} of the transition dyspnoea index in a multinational clinical trial. T. J. Witek Jr, D. A. Mahler. #ERS Journals Ltd 2003. ABSTRACT: Dyspnoea is a primary symptom of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The baseline (BDI) and transition (TDI) dyspnoea indices are commonly used instruments to assess breathlessness and the impact of intervention. Its validity and pattern of response in multinational clinical trials has not been established. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 997 COPD patients who received tiotropium, salmeterol or placebo, in addition to usual care, the validity and pattern of response of the BDI and TDI were examined. The BDI was significantly correlated with the dyspnoea diary (DD) score and the symptom and activity components of the <b>St.</b> <b>George</b> 9 <b>s</b> respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), establishing concurrent validity. Furthermore, the TDI was also correlate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{prevalence}} and clinical consequences of {{gastro-oesophageal reflux disease}} (GERD) in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are not well characterised. The present study prospectively studied 42 males with COPD (forced expiratory volume in one second % predicted: 35 %, range 20 – 49) and 16 healthy volunteers of similar age without respiratory or gastro-oesophageal symptoms. The diagnosis of GERD was confirmed using oesophageal 24 h pH monitoring. In the current study group, reflux symptoms were measured using the Vigneri score, cough and dyspnoea with the modified Medical Research Council questionnaire, and pulmonary function with bronchodilator response and health status using <b>St</b> <b>George</b> 9 <b>s</b> Respiratory Questionnaire. Pathological reflux was documented in 26 out of 42 patients (62 %) and in three volunteers (19 %). In patients with GERD, 15 patients (58 %) did not report any reflux symptoms. There were no differences in symptoms, health status, bronchodilator treatment and pulmonary function test between patients with and without GERD...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the study}} was to obtain the general {{population}} norms for the <b>St.</b> <b>George</b> 9 <b>s</b> Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), a specific questionnaire for respiratory diseases. The IBERPOC project was a cross-sectional study of representative samples of the general population aged between 40 – 69 yrs. The study sample was composed of 862 individuals. All participants considered as "probable cases " of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n= 460) were eligible to complete the SGRQ and among the rest of the nonprobable COPD participants (n= 3, 571), 10 individuals from each defined age and sex group were eligible (n= 402). Weights were applied to restore general population representativity of the sample. Mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) predicted was 89. 4 % (SD= 16. 5 %; range: 16 – 131 %). Chronbach 9 s alpha coefficients were w 0. 7 in the symptoms, activity and impact scales, andw 0. 9 in the overall scale. Symptom scale score was significantly higher among males (11. 6 versus 7. 8; pv 0. 01) and activity scale score was significantly higher among females (12. 2 versus 14. 6; p= 0. 04).

2500|$|The {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, in 1861, led to the organization of military forces in Colorado Territory. In March 1862, the Colorado volunteers defeated a Confederate Army from Texas in the Battle of Glorieta Pass, New Mexico by destroying their supply wagons, forcing them to retreat. The Confederates returned to Texas, and the First Regiment of Colorado Volunteers returned to Colorado Territory. They were then mounted as a home guard {{under the command of}} Colonel John Chivington. Chivington and Colorado territorial governor John Evans adopted a hard line against Indians, whom white settlers accused of stealing livestock. Without any declaration of war, in April 1864, Colorado soldiers began attacking and destroying a number of Cheyenne camps, the largest of which included about 70 lodges, about 10% of the housing capacity of the entire Cheyenne nation. On May 16, 1864, a detachment under Lieutenant <b>George</b> <b>S.</b> Eayre <b>crossed</b> into Kansas and encountered Cheyenne in their summer buffalo-hunting camp at Big Bushes, near the Smoky Hill River. Cheyenne chiefs Lean Bear and Star approached the soldiers to signal their peaceful intent, but they were shot down by Eayre's troops. This incident touched off a war of retaliation by the Cheyenne in Kansas.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Only {{long-term}} home {{oxygen therapy}} {{has been shown}} in randomised controlled trials to increase survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There have been no trials assessing the effect of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, alone or in combination, on mortality in patients with COPD, despite their known benefit in reducing symptoms and exacerbations. The "TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health " (TORCH) survival study is aiming to determine the impact of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (SFC) combination and the individual components on the survival of COPD patients. TORCH is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Approximately 6, 200 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to b. i. d. treatment with either SFC (50 / 500 mg), fluticasone propionate (500 mg), salmeterol (50 mg) or placebo for 3 yrs. The primary end-point is all-cause mortality; secondary end-points are COPD morbidity relating to rate of exacerbations and health status, using the <b>St</b> <b>George</b> 9 <b>s</b> Respiratory Questionnaire. Other end-points include other mortality and exacerbation end-points, requirement for long-term oxygen therapy, and clinic lung function. Safety end-points include adverse events, with additional information on bone fractures. The first patient was recruited in September 2000 and results should be available in 2006.

Jones Interpreting thresholds for a clinically {{significant change in}} health status in asthma and COPD. P. W. Jones. #ERS Journals Ltd 2002. ABSTRACT: Health status (or Health-Related Quality of Life) measurement is an established method for assessing the overall efficacy of treatments for asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Such measurements can indicate the potential clinical significance of a treatment 9 s effect. This paper is concerned with methods of estimating the threshold of clinical significance for three widely used health status questionnaires for asthma and COPD: the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire and <b>St</b> <b>George</b> 9 <b>s</b> Respiratory Questionnaire. It discusses the methodology used to obtain such estimates and shows that the estimates appear to be fairly reliable; i. e. for a given questionnaire, similar estimates may be obtained in different studies. These empirically derived thresholds are all mean estimates with confidence intervals around them. The presence of these confidence intervals affects {{the way in which the}} thresholds may be used to draw inferences concerning the clinical relevance of clinical trial results. A new system of judging the magnitude of clinically significant results is proposed. Finally, an attempt is made to translate these thresholds into scenarios that illustrate what a clinically significant change with treatment may mean to an individual patient...|$|R
