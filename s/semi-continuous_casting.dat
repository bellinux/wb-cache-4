Almost all the eutectic compounds were dissolved into the matrix {{and there was}} no evident grain growth after optimum solution treatment at 500 °C for 4 h. Further ageing at low temperatures led to significant precipitation hardening, which strengthened the alloy. Peak-aged at 200 °C, the alloy had the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and lowest elongation at 395 MPa and 2. 8 %, respectively. When aged at 225 °C for 15 h, the alloy exhibited prominent mechanical performance with UTS and elongation of 363 MPa and 5. 8 %, respectively. With regard to microstructure and tensile properties, the processes of 500 °C, 4 h + 225 °C, 15 h are selected as the optimal heat treatment conditions. The alloy under different conditions shows different fracture behaviors: in the as-cast alloy, a quasi-cleavage pattern is observed; after solution treatment, the alloy exhibits a trans-granular quasi-cleavage fracture; after being peak-aged at 200 °C and 225 °C, the fracture mode is a mixed mode of trans-granular and inter-granular fracture, in which the inter-granular mode is dominant in the alloy peak-aged at 200 °C...|$|R

Results show that the as-cast microstructure of this alloy is fine and has less intergranular eutectic phases, with the melting temperature of 473. 4 ℃.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{addition}} of small percentages of Ti to A 356 Al-Si alloys results {{in the formation of}} AITiSi intermetallics with two distinct morphologies; flake and blocky. Higher cooling rates and lower Ti contents favor flake formation while the reverse is true for blocky particles. On further reheating, the flakes undergo morphological changes due to spheroidization and coarsening and convert into large blocks which may result in confusion as to which morphology is more detrimental toward the blockage of casting nozzles. This paper is a further elaboration of the previous reports to not only emphasize the effect of Ti content and cooling rate on the formation of either ATT iSi intermetallic morphologies, but also to identify the morphology that becomes problematic for <b>semi-continuous</b> or continuous <b>casting</b> operations.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper dealt with the effect of ultrasonic vibration on the solidification of 7050 aluminum alloy.

The mechanism of particle resonance caused by ultrasonic vibration was illustrated on the basis of theoretical analysis of the kinetics and energy conversion during the solidification.

40|$|<b>Semi-continuous</b> direct-chill (DC) <b>casting</b> of {{aluminium}} ingots {{suffers from a}} very frequent defect {{which can lead to}} a strong decrease in productivity: hot tearing. This phenomenon takes place in the mushy state (i. e., at solid fractions, gs, lower than unity). In order to solve this problem, research moved towards the development of models for the prediction of the hot cracking sensitivity of any kind of alloy under given casting conditions. The defect being of complex nature and revealing some random aspects, the models must describe in the most precise way the interconnected mechanisms intervening in the formation and propagation of the crack. However, an approach supporting the separate study of each mechanism in order to integrate them, thereafter, in a single model, emerged as the way to follow from now on. The objective of this research task is to study the mechanisms leading to hot cracking {{of aluminium}} alloys during continuous casting processes, in order to deduce from them the fundamental parameters and mechanisms that will be integrated in the models to predict hot cracking sensitivity. For this purpose, two relevant aspects were targeted: the mechanical behaviour of the material in the semi-solid state {{as a function of the}} microstructure, and also the coalescence phenomenon. In order to study these phenomena, specific apparatus were developed in the laboratory. The first one, previously used by Farup et al. [Far 01] for in-situ observation of organic alloys (succinonitrile- 0. 5 wt pct acetone), was improved in order to allow more precise observations under better controlled conditions of the hot cracking phenomenon in columnar grains. Then, in order to study the mechanical behaviour of an Al- 4. 5 wt pct Cu alloy as a function of three various types of microstructures (equiaxed, E, columnar radial parallel to the shear plane, C//, and columnar longitudinal perpendicular to this plane, Cperp), a torsion test performed on hollow cylindrical specimens in the semi-solid state was built, based on the original idea of Mahjoub et al. [Mah 00]. Finally, an apparatus intended to tear a grain-refined Al- 1 wt pct Cu alloy in the semi-solid state, avoiding any contact with air during the test, was designed. In order to optimize the tests on the Al-Cu alloys, numerical simulations of the thermal field in the specimens were made. Moreover, as a complement to the experimental results, numerical simulations of the mechanics for the torsion test were carried out so as to study the arrangement influence of the wet grain boundaries within a medium made up of hexagonal grains. From the tests on the organics, two distinct cases depending on the value of gs at which the grain boundary is stressed could be observed: either ''healing'' of the crack due to liquid feeding in the zone under constraints, or the formation of a hot crack. Finally, temperature ranges within which intra- and intergranular coalescence start to take place were established and used in a simple model (Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud [Rap 99]) for the prediction of hot cracking. Temperatures for coherency loss of an Al- 4. 5 wt pct Cu alloy, as a function of the microstructure, were obtained using the torsion test. Moreover, creep tests made it possible to describe the deformation mode depending on the type of microstructure tested. An evolution of the E and C// samples behaviour towards that of a fully solid material could be highlighted by fitting the curves with a Norton's power law, in the case of an increase of gs from 90 to 92 %. The Cperp samples always showed a higher resistance to deformation compared to that of the other microstructures. The tearing test results highlighted a strong increase in the maximal force needed to break a grain-refined Al- 1 wt pct Cu specimen as gs reached approximately 95 %. The latter is attributed to a start of coalescence between the grains. Observations under the microscope of the broken surfaces confirmed this assumption by revealing a transition from a smooth surface with a dendritic aspect to a surface containing important sharp-edged areas. An evolution in the shape of the spikes left by the broken bridges could also be highlighted. The temperature versus solid fraction curves were determined using the thermal analysis method developed at the laboratory by Campanella et al. [Cam 01]: the single pan thermal analysis (SPTA). Indeed, this method allows a closer description of the actual solidification path for systems out of equilibrium. Finally, the study by successive transverse sectioning of a DC cast billet containing a hot crack was undertaken. The results point out the crack evolution in the case of a constant increase of the casting speed. The crack starts as a concentration of microporosity in the centre of the billet that quickly changes to an annular shape made of microcracks. Then, it moves off centre taking the shape of a linear crack. Eventually, the crack moves again to the billet centre with a typical "star" crack shape...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{materials}} engineering requires {{the use of}} materials characterised by high mechanical properties, as these precisely properties determine the choice of material for parts of machinery and equipment. Owing to these properties it is possible to reduce the weight and, consequently, the consumption of both material and energy. Trying to meet these expectations, the designers are increasingly looking for solutions in the application of magnesium alloys as materials offering a very beneficial strength-to-weight ratio. However, besides alloying elements, the properties are to a great extent shaped by the solidification conditions and related structure.

40|$|Approximately 68 % of the {{aluminum}} {{produced in the}} United States is first cast into ingots prior to further processing into sheet, plate, extrusions, or foil. The direct chill (DC) <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>casting</b> process has been the mainstay of {{the aluminum}} industry {{for the production of}} ingots due largely to its robust nature and relative simplicity. Though the basic process of DC casting is in principle straightforward, the interaction of process parameters with heat extraction, microstructural evolution, and development of solidification stresses is too complex to analyze by intuition or practical experience. One issue in DC casting is the formation of stress cracks [1 - 15]. In particular, the move toward larger ingot cross-sections, the use of higher casting speeds, and an ever-increasing array of mold technologies have increased industry efficiencies but have made it more difficult to predict the occurrence of stress crack defects. The Aluminum Industry Technology Roadmap [16] has recognized the challenges inherent in the DC casting process and the control of stress cracks and selected the development of 'fundamental information on solidification of alloys to predict microstructure, surface properties, and stresses and strains' as a high-priority research need, and the 'lack of understanding of mechanisms of cracking as a function of alloy' and 'insufficient understanding of the aluminum solidification process', which is 'difficult to model', as technology barriers in aluminum casting processes. The goal of this Aluminum Industry of the Future (IOF) project was to assist the aluminum industry in reducing the incidence of stress cracks from the current level of 5 % to 2 %. Decreasing stress crack incidence is important for improving product quality and consistency as well as for saving resources and energy, since considerable amounts of cast metal could be saved by eliminating ingot cracking, by reducing the scalping thickness of the ingot before rolling, and by eliminating butt sawing. Full-scale industrial implementation {{of the results of the}} proposed research would lead to energy savings in excess of 6 trillion Btu by the year 2020. The research undertaken in this project aimed to achieve this objective by a collaboration of industry, university, and national laboratory personnel through Secat, Inc., a consortium of aluminum companies. During the four-year project, the industrial partners and the research team met in 16 quarterly meetings to discuss research results and research direction. The industrial partners provided guidance, facilities, and experience to the research team. The research team went to two industrial plants to measure temperature distributions in commercial 60, 000 -lb DC casting ingot production. The project focused on the development of a fundamental understanding of ingot cracking and detailed models of thermal conditions, solidification, microstructural evolution, and stress development during the initial transient in DC castings of the aluminum alloys 3004 and 5182. The microstructure of the DC casting ingots was systematically characterized. Carefully designed experiments were carried out at the national laboratory and university facilities as well as at the industrial locations using the industrial production facilities. The advanced computational capabilities of the national laboratories were used for thermodynamic and kinetic simulations of phase transformation, heat transfer and fluid flow, solidification, and stress-strain evolution during DC casting. The achievements of the project are the following: (1) Identified the nature of crack formation during DC casting; (2) Developed a novel method for determining the mechanical properties of an alloy at the nonequilibrium mushy zone of the alloy; (3) Measured heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) between the solidifying ingot and the cooling water jet; (4) Determined the material constitutive model at high temperatures; and (5) Developed computational capabilities for the simulation of cracking formation in DC casting ingot. The models and the database developed in this project have been used to predict crack formation and to determine the optimal conditions for DC casting. The results demonstrated that cracking formation is strongly affected by casting conditions and the composition of the alloy. Scrap rate due to crack formation can be significantly reduced by controlling the cast speed and the concentrations of the alloy...|$|E
40|$|Modelling of Flow Phenomena during DC Casting Jan Zuidema The {{production}} of aluminium ingots, by <b>semi-continuous</b> <b>casting,</b> {{is a complex}} process. DC Casting stands for direct chill casting. During this process liquid aluminium transforms to solid aluminium while cooling down. This is not an instantaneous transformation, but occurs in temperature interval. In the casting process the latent heat is moved away by convection and conduction. A number of problems may occur during solidification, because the solidification rate is rather high. The difference in density between liquid and solid aluminium is 7 % {{and because of that}} solidification porosities may form during solidification when transport of liquid metal is insufficient. If besides this also high enough thermal stresses are present, cracks may be induced from these pores. The cracks, that originate during the solidification of the metal are called hot cracks. This in contradiction with cold cracks. These are formed due to high stress levels in the already solidified aluminium. What happens from the moment that the casting process is started? This is {{one of the questions that}} is treated in this thesis. To be able to describe the DC Casting process, it is necessary to have a good model that describes the phenomena at hand adequately and that also enables to do predictions on process changes. The model, that is used, is based on the differential equations that describe the heat- and fluid dynamics transport. In chapter 2 a description of the model is given. Numerical methods for solving these equations are also given there. Without validation, a model is of little use. Model validation can be performed using various methods during DC Casting experiments. Temperature recordings enable to follow the evolution of the temperature during the casting- and solidification process in some important positions. Because part of the heat transport in the DC Casting process is convection driven, it is also important to find information on the flow pattern and velocities in the liquid aluminium. Various methods to evaluate velocities in liquid metals are described in chapter 2. Based on their use for measuring the molten aluminium velocity during DC Casting, a ranking of the methods is made. Good boundary conditions are essential for reliable predictions of the behaviour of aluminium during the mould filling and subsequent solidification. In chapter 3 the determination of the most important boundary conditions is described. Those boundary conditions determine the amount of heat transport in that area of the system, where the heat transfer to the surroundings is the largest. Through sophisticated experiments the heat transfer from a plate of aluminium to (boiling) water could be predicted. This heat transfer model enables the prediction of temperatures close to the surface of the solidifying aluminium. By instrumentation of the experimental casting facility with thermocouples, the temperature close to the surface of the ingot could be measured as function of time. Calculations using the casting- and solidification model with the constant heat transfer coefficients, and calculations with the new model for water cooling were performed. This showed, that in the first centimetres from the surface of the ingot the new model gives a better description of the experiment. Further away from the surface towards the centre of the billet, the constant heat transfer coefficient model is just as good as the new model. The best method to measure liquid metal velocities during DC Casting is a method that is based on magnetic induction. The sensor to measure velocities is based on a ferro magnet, surrounded by a conduction tube with spot-welded thermocouples. Between two opposing thermocouples an inductive voltage is measured, which is proportional with the velocity of the surrounding medium. To test this method, a prototype of this sensor was constructed. In chapter 4 this sensor is described. The sensor was firstly tested in a water setup. Because the electrical conductivity of the water was several orders of magnitude less than that of liquid metals, this gave an unsatisfactory result. It was decided to perform fluid flow experiments in liquid tin. From these experiments results were obtained which gave a velocity dependent signal for the probe output. Unfortunately, electro-magnetical shielding from the surroundings was not good enough. This prevented to quantitatively test the sensor. In chapter 5 the start-up phase of the casting is covered. In the first part of this chapter, a calculation described in the literature was repeated, using the casting- and solidification model. This showed that, due to lack of published data, more validation was necessary to fully validate the model. With the aid of the experimental casting facility, a number of casting experiments were conducted. The experiments were recorded with a video camera and the temperature during casting was recorded by thermocouples at a number of locations in the ingot. The experiments served as the basis for a number of calculations with the casting- and solidification model. A conclusion, that could be drawn from the combination of the results of the casting experiments and the calculations, was that the description of the inlet of the mould in the model as an jet of aluminium was a good description of reality during the first tenths of seconds of the process. From the moment that the aluminium melt level is overflowing the inlet level, the jet description is not accurate anymore and should be replaced with a filling over the complete width of the mould. During casting, unwanted inclusions are filtered from the liquid aluminium by degassers and filters, before the casting table is reached. In order to comply with the increasing demands for the quality of cast products, an additional method to filter out particles from the launder system was evaluated. This is the subject of chapter 6. Manipulation of the flow pattern enables to create wakes, where particles can settle. Two dimensional calculations of the flow pattern in the mould with special flow modifiers, show that this settling is possible in theory. However, it is more likely, that transient velocity fluctuations prevent the settling of particles. To create a better method for settling of unwanted inclusions, a cyclone was designed, which enables the separation of particles 20 micrometers in diameter from a stream of liquid aluminium. The cyclone was used in a series of calculations with the fluid-flow and solidification model. The outcome of these calculations has resulted in a patent for this type of cyclone. Validation measurements using a water model of the cyclone have confirmed the working of the cyclone in separation of denser particles out of a slow flowing medium. The velocity of the particles was therefore tracked using a laser and camera set-up. The laser exposed a two-dimensional area of the water model. By auto-correlation of two subsequent images, it was possible to extract the particulate rate in this area. Velocity patterns indicated, that particles had a tendency of settling down in the lower part of the cyclone. Because there was no possibility to count all particles going in and out of the system, no quantitative comparison with the model was possible. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|E
