5|$|After the Met and the District had {{withdrawn}} from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the South Eastern Railway, the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (LB) and the Great Eastern Railway. Both the Met and the District {{wanted to see the}} line electrified, but could not justify the whole cost themselves. Discussions continued, and in 1911 it was agreed that the ELR would be electrified with the UERL providing power and the Met the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, the Met running two trains an hour from both the SER's and the LB's New Cross <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> Shoreditch.|$|E

5|$|There was {{significant}} rivalry for frequencies among Pirate stations, fuelled {{by the financial}} rewards that came from promoting raves, and as a consequence, {{it was not uncommon}} for some <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> attack or destroy the transmitters and/or studios of their rivals for airtime.|$|E
5|$|Travel {{time from}} Nydalen and Storo <b>{{stations}}</b> <b>to</b> the city centre stations {{is about the}} same, independent of which direction on the Ring Line travellers choose. Passengers heading for the city centre can therefore take the first train that comes, independent of which direction it is heading, thus giving Nydalen and Storo a five-minute headway service to the city centre. The trains are operated by Sporveien T-banen, a subsidiary of Sporveien, on contract with the public transport authority Ruter.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, it appears to be considered that trains from these <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded. The proposed 2-mile tunnelled extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|After {{experimentation}} on the Brighton experimental ensemble, Ofcom advertised {{for small}} scale DAB multiplexes to broadcast across the United Kingdom on ten localised multiplexes for a nine-month trial period, then extended {{for an extra}} two years. The trials will test the viability of using free and open source software (FOSS) with low cost equipment to broadcast from a single transmitter, a single frequency network or channel repeaters to allow smaller radio <b>stations</b> <b>to</b> broadcast more cost effectively than is currently possible on local multiplexes.|$|E
