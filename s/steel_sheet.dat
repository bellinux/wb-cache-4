40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on characterization of CO 2 {{laser beam welding}} (LBW) of dual phase (DP) and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> based on experimental, numerical simulation and statistical modeling approaches. The experimental work aimed to investigate the welding induced-microstructures, hardness, tensile properties and formability limit of laser welding butt joints of DP/DP, TRIP/TRIP and DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> under different welding speeds. The effects of shielding gas types and flow rates on the weldability of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were also studied. The simulation of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> through welding induced-temperature field, thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortions using Sysweld 2010 software v 12. 0 was the second goal of this research. Also stretch formability (Erichsen test) was simulated in this step using Abaqus/CAE software v 6. 9 - 1. The aim of statistical modeling was to predict and optimize laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in industry through applying a three-factor-three-level Box-Behnken statistical design with full replication as a design of experiment (DoE) approach to design the experiments, develop mathematical models and optimize the welding operation. This was achieved by controlling selected welding parameters: laser power, welding speed and focus position. The experimental {{results showed that the}} CO 2 LBW is a successfully welding process for butt joining of DP and TRIP <b>steels</b> <b>sheets.</b> The LBW of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> is successfully numerically simulated using the finite element (FE) code SYSWELD when using a 3 D Gaussian distribution heat source model with a conical shape. There are good agreements between the experimental- and FE- results during simulation of stretch formability of DP/TRIP steel weldments when using von Mises yielding model as yielding criterion. Statistically, mathematical models were developed to predict the required responses (mechanical properties, weld bead geometry and unit welding operation cost) of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> It was found that the welding speed is the most significant parameter during laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Large {{sections}} of roadway may consist entirely of [...] viaduct, sections with {{no connection to}} the earth other than through vertical columns. When concrete columns are used, the detailing is critical. Typical failure {{may be in the}} toppling of a row of columns due either to soil connection failure or to insufficient cylindrical wrapping with rebar. Both failures were seen in the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe, Japan, where an entire viaduct, centrally supported by a single row of large columns, was laid down to one side. Such columns are reinforced by excavating to the foundation pad, driving additional pilings, and adding a new, larger pad, well connected with rebar alongside or into the column. A column with insufficient wrapping bar, which is prone to burst and then hinge at the bursting point, may be completely encased in a circular or elliptical jacket of welded <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> and grouted as described above.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 November 2005, {{an article}} in the Times-Picayune {{revealed}} that sonar soundings discovered that the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> pilings of the levee floodwall were 2.1m (7ft) less deep than engineering specifications. Sample pilings pulled up were found to be of the length specified in the design (17 feet), but it was then revealed that this length was less than the actual depth of the canal, in retrospect an obvious engineering mistake. Current analysis concludes that the catastrophic breach was due to faulty design, rather than storm surge higher than what the canal was designed to withstand. According to an article published in the August 2015 issue of the official journal of the World Water Council, the Army Corps of Engineers misinterpreted the results of a Sheet Pile Load test (E-99 Study) conducted in the mid 1980s and concluded they needed to drive sheet pilings to depths of not more than 17 feet, rather than the necessary 31 to 46 feet. This move saved millions but greatly reduced overall engineering reliability.|$|E

2500|$|Flooding due to {{rain and}} storms {{has long been}} an issue since the New Orleans' early {{settlement}} due to the city's location on a delta marsh, much of which sits below sea level. The city is surrounded by the Mississippi River to the south, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and Lake Borgne to the east. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. The levees were originally designed to prevent damage caused by seasonal flooding. Today, the floodwalls atop the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals are used for drainage, to pump water from the city streets out to Lake Pontchartrain. These floodwalls are one foot (300mm) wide at the top and widened to two feet (600mm) at the base. The visible portion is a concrete cap on <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> pile that anchors to the wall. [...] Sheet piles are interlocked steel columns, in this case at least 30 feet (10 m) long, with 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) visible above ground; examinations afterward showed that some pilings were not as deep as specified. The wide, navigable Industrial Canal is used for shipping.|$|E
2500|$|Rock-fill dams are {{embankments}} of compacted free-draining granular {{earth with}} an impervious zone. The earth utilized often contains {{a high percentage}} of large particles, hence the term [...] "rock-fill". The impervious zone may be on the upstream face and made of masonry, concrete, plastic membrane, <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> piles, timber or other material. The impervious zone may also be within the embankment in which case it is referred to as a core. In the instances where clay is utilized as the impervious material the dam is referred to as a composite dam. To prevent internal erosion of clay into the rock fill due to seepage forces, the core is separated using a filter. Filters are specifically graded soil designed to prevent the migration of fine grain soil particles. When suitable material is at hand, transportation is minimized leading to cost savings during construction. Rock-fill dams are resistant to damage from earthquakes. However, inadequate quality control during construction can lead to poor compaction and sand in the embankment which can lead to liquefaction of the rock-fill during an earthquake. Liquefaction potential can be reduced by keeping susceptible material from being saturated, and by providing adequate compaction during construction. An example of a rock-fill dam is New Melones Dam in California or the Fierza Dam in Albania.|$|E
