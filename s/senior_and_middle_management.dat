The Central Bank monitors the progress made by the commercial banks with Omanization and in July 1995 issued a circular stipulating that by the year 2000, at least 75% of <b>senior</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> positions should be held by Omanis. In the clerical grades 95% of staff should be Omanized and 100% in all other grades. At the end of 1999, no less than 78.8% of all positions were held by Omanis which is a considerable achievement for the banking sector in general. Women made up 30% of the total. During 1999 the percentage of Omanis employed at <b>senior</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> levels went up from 76.7% to 78.8%.

This {{article is a}} based on {{a study of the}} implementation of innovation policies in Swedish municipalities, and gives a first-hand, empirical view of some of the complexities of innovation in the public sector. The study took place in four municipalities in central Sweden. The municipalities varied in size and organisational forms. Interviews and policy documents were used for data collection. The results showed that the innovation policies were not followed by action, which may be described as not mobilizing dynamic capabilities to create innovativeness. Thus, dynamic capabilities, such as learning and HRM, Human Resource Management, were not used in conjunction with innovation. Particularly amongst senior management there was a negative attitude towards the innovative capacity of their organization. <b>Middle</b> <b>management</b> saw possibilities. However, barriers such as extensive control systems removed the focus from innovation. There was a lack of communication between <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> regarding innovation. The conclusion was that innovation, as both concept and practice, was not fully embraced by the municipalities. It is suggested that generative leadership, opening up communication within the organisations, especially between employees, could be beneficial, and that a common understanding and definition of the innovation concept is needed.

The research design was based on the established procedures and quality controls associated with qualitative case study method within a critical realism paradigm. Analysis was based primarily on in-case and intra-case analyzes and pattern matching for the purpose of analytic generalization about the research questions. The study concluded that to overcome the implementation barriers people need a platform where they can share knowledge and be rewarded for knowledge transfer, additionally key performance indicators (KPI’s) linked to knowledge transfer and sharing must also be created and utilized. Ultimately, this study has contributed to EWRM implementation strategies for MTN and the creation of associated KPI metrics; both the researcher and MTN consider the research and its outcomes to have been advantageous. More generally the research has also contributed to the wider risk management debate, shedding light on barriers to implementation and suggesting holistic strategies that should embed EWRM more effectively and efficiently...|$|R

The overall aim of the research was to determine whether creativity in organisations can be linked to transformational leadership behaviours. A literature review was done to conceptualise transformational leadership and organisational creativity and to identify the theoretical relationship between these concepts. During the investigation it was found that a relationship does exist between transformational leadership and organisational creativity. A one-way ANOVA analysis and post hoc analysis were performed to address the empirical research questions. The descriptive statistics were analysed in terms of <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management,</b> <b>and</b> their raters. The data analysis revealed that the research results were largely supportive of the theoretical research findings on the relationship between transformational leadership and organisational creativity. With regard to senior management, it was found that most raters rated their teams as creative, despite the fact that a relationship between transformational leadership and organisational creativity could not be determined due to the small sample size. With regard to <b>middle</b> <b>management,</b> it was found that a correlation existed between inspirational motivation, idealised influence (attributes and behaviour) and organisational creativity.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey collected responses from <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> of large Australian companies. Findings: The findings support several positive significant associations. Direct associations are found between value-creating processes within the Internal Process perspective. These results support {{the feasibility of}} integrating environmental, social, and innovation-orientated valuecreating process into the Internal Process of the four SBSC perspective model. The results also provide evidence about the extent direct or indirect associations exist between the four SBSC perspectives: first, human capital (Learning and Growth perspective) direct association with value-creating processes (Internal Processes perspective); second, the value-creating (Internal Processes perspective) direct association with customer value (Customer Perspective); and third, value-creating (Internal Processes perspective) direct and indirect associations with financial performance (Financial perspective).

40|$|Worldwide {{events like}} the BP oil {{incident}} (2010) and subprime crisis (2007) have created surprises whereby organisations have had to quickly respond. These crises are occurring in an increasingly competitive and turbulent business arena which has made effective preparation and timely responses even more critical. Much of crisis management literature directly focuses on man-made disasters (Piotrowski, 2006 : 12), however this research among other limited studies provides exclusive insight into how an organisation responds to an event which is uncontrollable to prevent or contain. This study uncovers how Experian; a global organisation, prepared, responded and learned from the Chile earthquakes (2010). Incorporating a well-rounded appreciation of the crisis and organisational management behaviour enabled this research to capture a holistic account {{of the effectiveness of}} their theoretical and practical crisis management capabilities. The implementation of a number of key conceptual frameworks was used to formulate the research model to reflect contemporary organisational crisis management issues. The model consists of multiple phases of the crisis event (pre, event and post), factors (identification, preparation, prevention, containment, recovery and learning) and themes (leadership, communication and stakeholder involvement). This researcher acknowledges the interconnected nature of Experian’s risk management and business continuity activities and uses this as a foundation to form an understanding of what enables or disables them to manage the crisis. This research undertook an epistemological interpretist philosophical perspective through a case study analysis consisting of eight in-depth, semi-structured interviews with <b>senior</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> level <b>management</b> in the UK, U. S. and Chile. The reason for this focus was to ensure the researcher gained insight into key organisational issues such as management behaviours, processes, systems and motives. Overall, Experian displayed strong evidence of crisis-preparedness over crisis-proneness due to their fully integrated enterprise-wide risk management approach. Experian were able to respond quickly to the event through global support, leadership and proactive preparation. This however was not the case for post-crisis activities which was surprisingly weak and unformulated in contrast to the other phases. This was represented by fundamental communication and leadership issues which blemished aspects of the response and their future resilience. Not all organisations can respond perfectly to a crisis but this research sheds light on success and failure, strengths and weaknesses faced by a modern crises...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} an explosion of research into the area of quality initiatives (QI) such as ISO, total quality management, lean, Kaizen and its application within {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). However, very few empirical studies have reported the application of Six Sigma in SMEs; the reasons may be attributed to several myths associated with Six Sigma. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the current status of QI in the UK manufacturing SMEs and report the differences in the quality management practices of Six Sigma SMEs against the ISO certified firms. Design/methodology/approach – A survey-based approach was adopted to understand the established quality management practices in the UK SMEs. A short survey instrument was designed by reviewing the literature on quality improvement initiatives in SMEs. A sample of 500 manufacturing SMEs across UK was selected through stratified random sampling technique. Findings – A response rate of 12. 7 per cent was achieved and included respondents at <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> level across the manufacturing industry in the UK. Data analysis on the history of quality initiatives (QI) in SMEs indicated towards the trend that ISO may be the foundation or building block before embarking on lean or Six Sigma. Differences in quality management practices such as customer focused measures and method of knowledge transfer to employees, were observed in Six Sigma and ISO certified SMEs. The main reasons cited for not implementing Six Sigma in SMEs were lack of knowledge or understanding of the system and limited resources. A significant difference in the performance of Six Sigma/lean firms against ISO certified companies were observed with respect to the strategic and operational measures of organizational performance. Research limitations/implications – The limited response rate from the survey in the UK manufacturing SMEs will affect the generalizability of study to entire SME population. To negate the limitations of this study, a multiple multi-level case studies will be conducted in SMEs in the next phase of doctoral research. Future study should focus on performing a global survey on quality management practices in SMEs. Originality/value – The novelty of the paper lies in conducting a comparative study on the quality management practices in Six Sigma and non-Six Sigma UK SMEs and measuring its impact on the performance of the firm. This study will facilitate in demystifying the myth that Six Sigma is only applicable in large organizations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DTech(Public Management)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2002 South Africa {{prides itself}} on its "rainbow nation" status. The term "rainbow nation" has {{frequently}} been used to reflect {{the diversity of the}} South African community. In the preamble to our present constitution, it is stated that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, and that diversity epitomises the unity of its people. However, if one takes a glance around many local government offices, particular at our <b>senior</b> <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> level <b>management</b> levels, our rainbow appears less colourful than we would like to think. Whatever its meaning, diversity has become a term used freely by both the previous and present government, neither being able to define its true meaning. In fact, they have used the term diversity in so many ways and in so many contexts that it seems to mean many things. With the diversification of local authorities, a new challenge has arisen for the local government manager when resolving, or at least ameliorating, some of the difficulties arising from the widespread diversity found in the workplace. The transformation of local authorities and the implementation of affirmative action programmes were the way government thought diversity should be effected, but this alone will not ensure the employment equity local government managers are seeking. The awareness of selected local government managers (internal managing of diversity) regarding diversity will provide an insight into their acceptance of diverse groups as being a vital resource for an organisation. In return, this will also reflect the commitment of selected local government managers (external managing of diversity) in serving their diverse local communities In this dissertation, the terms "selected local government manager(s) " will be used interchangeably with the term" public manager (s) ". The core problem, which this study addresses, revolves around tile different belief windows and the effect these have on the local government manager's self-concept of diversity in the workplace. A belief window refers to an invisible window through which one views diversity This dissertation will attempt to provide the insights and awareness levels of local government managers in respect of diversity management as expounded in the paragraphs that follow. The theories of diversity management in the workplace are explored The focus is on the definition of terms within the study; what managing diversity is not; why diversity management; the different dimensions of diversity; the differences between managing diversity, valuing of differences and affirmative action; models for managing diversity in the workplace; and the consequences of ignoring diversity in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to explore}} the attitudes of {{managers}} and employees to high performance work practices (HPWS) in a medium sized rural Australian hospital. Design/methodology/approach: The study consists of two stages. Stage one involved a qualitative investigation consisting of interviews and focus group sessions with <b>senior,</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> line <b>management</b> at the hospital. Bowen and Ostroff&# 039;s framework {{was used to examine}} how strategic HRM was understood, interpreted and operationalised across the management hierarchy. Stage one investigates the views of managers concerning the implementation of strategic HRM/ HPWS. Stage two consisted of a questionnaire administered to all hospital employees. The mediation effects of social identification on the relationship between high performance work systems and affective commitment and job satisfaction are examined. The purpose of stage two was to investigate the views and effects of SHRM/HPWS on employees. It should be noted that HPWS and strategic HRM are used inter-changeably in this paper. Findings: At the management level the importance of distinctiveness, consistency and consensus in the interpretation of strategic HRM/HPWS practices across the organization was discovered. Findings indicate that social identification mediates the relationship between HPWS and affective commitment and also mediates the relationship between HPWS and job satisfaction. Practical implications: High performance work systems may play a crucial role facilitating social identification at the unit level. Such practices and management support is likely to provide benefits in terms of high performing committed employees. Originality/value: The paper argues that team leaders and managers {{play a key role in}} building social identification within the team and that organizations need to understand this role and provide recognition, reward, education and support to their <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> lower managers...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Office Management and Technology) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2004. Video {{conferencing}} networks are complex. Implementation and cross-departmental functioning requires a managerial strategy {{to ensure a}} systematic and logical implementation process. The implementation of video conferencing equipment is based on existing managerial strategies e. g. Process, System, Operation and Project Management in a Total Quality Management (TQM) framework. Managerial functions (planning, organising, activation/motivation and control) are applied in the concluding of an effective managerial strategy for video conferencing implementation. The proposed managerial strategy for video conferencing implementation was tested with video conferencing equipment suppliers (in-depth structured interviews) and video conferencing network managers (questionnaires) in Gauteng. The proposed strategy (chapter 5) as constituted from comprehensive literature studies (chapters 3 and 4) needed to be adapted. The final video conferencing implementation strategy (chapter 8) indicated that the inclusion of processes and procedures {{is not sufficient to}} ensure successful implementation. The final strategy for video conferencing implementation is a flexible strategy that is aligned with existing managerial (operational and implementation) strategies to ensure successful implementation. This is based on the involvement of <b>senior,</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> lower <b>management</b> that also includes the appointment of project teams to ensure successful cross-departmental implementation. The formulation of quality structures and evaluation criteria ensures that strategic objectives set in the strategic plan, vision and mission statement, are achieved. The conclusion of the implemented project is by testing the project through pilot projects and finalising project documentation by means of an acceptance letter to the management team. Dissemination of data (whether the project was successful or not) has to be made to the senior management team. Video conferencing implementation is not just an action that takes place on an ad hoc basis. It requires a logical and systematic plan, supported by a scientific managerial strategy to ensure that the set objectives and quality standards are achieved...|$|R

The training began with top <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management.</b> The idea that top <b>and</b> <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> needed training had found resistance in the United States. For Japan, it would take some 20 years for the training to pay off. In the 1970s, Japanese products began to be seen as the leaders in quality. This sparked a crisis in the United States due to quality issues in the 1980s.|$|R
