40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the design, {{optimization}} and testing of a <b>self-regulating</b> <b>valve</b> for single-phase liquid cooling of microelectronics. Its purpose is to maintain the integrated circuit (IC) at constant temperature and to reduce power consumption by diminishing flow generated by the pump {{as a function of}} the cooling requirements. It uses a thermopneumatic actuation principle that combines the advantages of zero power consumption and small size in combination with a high flow rate and low manufacturing costs. The valve actuation is provided by the thermal expansion of a liquid (actuation fluid) which, at the same time, actuates the valve and provides feed-back sensing. A maximum flow rate of 38 kg h− 1 passes through the valve for a heat load up to 500 W. The valve is able to reduce the pumping power by up to 60 % and it has the capability to maintain the IC at a more uniform temperature. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} aircraft energy systems, <b>self-regulating</b> pneumatic <b>valves</b> (SRPVs) {{are used}} to control the pressure and mass flow of the bleed air. The dynamic behavior of these valves is complex and dependent on several physical phenomena. In some cases, limit cycles can occur, deteriorating performance. This paper presents a complex multiphysical model of SRPVs implemented in Modelica. First, the working-principle is explained, and common challenges in control-system design-problems related to these valves are illustrated. Then, a Modelica-model is presented in detail, taking into account several physical domains. It is shown, how limit cycle oscillations occurring in aircraft energy systems can be represented with this model. Finally, some multi-domain interactive effects are described...|$|R

40|$|A novel <b>self-regulating</b> parylene micro <b>valve</b> is {{presented}} in this paper with potential applications for biomedical flow controls. Featuring a free-floating bendable valve disk and two-level valve seat, this surface-micromachined polymeric valve accomplishes miniature pressure/flow rate regulation in a band-pass profile stand-alone without the need of power sources or active actuation. Experimental data of underwater testing results have successfully demonstrated that the microfabricated in-channel valve can regulate water flow at 0 - 80 mmHg and 0 - 10 µL/min pressure/flow rate level, which is perfectly suitable for biomedical and lab-on-a-chip applications. For example, such biocompatible microvalve can be incorporated in ocular implants for control of eye fluid drainage to fulfill intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation in glaucoma patients...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>self-regulating</b> {{shielding}} gas <b>valves</b> {{have been developed}} to synchronise the shielding gas flow rate to the welding current being used in the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW). These valves make claims to reduce the shielding gas consumption by up to 60 %. One such system, the Regula® EWR Pro, has undergone detailed evaluation in an effort to fully understand the benefits that could be obtained. This electromagnetically controlled system necessitates around an extremely fast response valve, which opens and closes continually throughout the welding process. This creates a pulsing of the shielding gas, further reducing consumption whilst maintaining optimal shielding gas flow. The unit has been identified to reduce the initial gas surge at weld initiation and results in a virtually instant decay of gas flow at weld termination. These particular characteristics {{have been found to be}} ideally suited to saving shielding gas when carrying out intermittent or stitch welding. It was established that the use of this valve generated deeper penetration in fillet welds, which in turn has highlighted the potential to increase the welding speed, therefore further reducing gas consumption. In addition, a computational model has been developed to simulate the effects of cross drafts. The combination of reducing the gas surge and slow decay with faster welding has been shown to meet the drive for cost savings and improving the carbon footprint...|$|R
40|$|The human larynx is a {{miscellaneous}} organ, which main {{functions are}} phonation, protection, and {{regulation of the}} air ways. The VF and the FVF make up the laryngeal double valve that {{is required for the}} ability of building up the abdominal prelum. With the loss of the larynx, the person concerned suffers from many handicaps, amongst others, the disability to build up abdominal pressure. The development of a <b>self-regulating</b> double clack <b>valve</b> for a functional laryngeal prosthesis {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The valve was designed to imitate the laryngeal double valve function. A model with a narrow and a wide inlet was built to abstract the larynx and its vocal folds and false vocal folds as clacks. When using the narrow inlet model, it was shown, that the FVC were closed during expiration, whereas the VC were closed during inspiration. Whereas using the wide inlet demonstrated that the VC were closed during expiration and the FVC were closed during inspiration. To sim ulate fluid flow the angle of the VC and of the FVC, the distance between both clacks and the flow rate were altered against each other. During certain simulations vortices were built between the clacks, which build up pressure upon the particular clack and initiated the closure. Vortices occurred significantly more often during simulations with a narrow inlet than a wide one. The developed "two way clack valve" was shown to be working well while using the narrow inlet. Furthermore the narrow inlet model describes the natural conditions in the human larynx more appropriate than the wide one. The designed valve represents a fundament for future work on the functional laryngeal prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{clear trend}} in the vehicle {{industry}} to implement more safetyrelated functions, where {{the focus is on}} active safety systems and today the steering system is also involved. Steering-related active safety functions can only be realised with a steering system that allows electroniccontrol of either the road wheel angle or the torque required to steer the vehicle, called active steering. The high power requirement of heavy vehicles means they must rely on hydraulic power to assist the driver. Thesystem is a pure hydro-mechanical system with an open-centre circuit activated by the driver’s steering action and suffers from poor energy efficiency. The main task of the hydraulic system is to control the pressure in the assistance cylinder {{in such a way that}} it eases the load on the driver. This work suggests a way to design and evaluate a <b>self-regulating</b> pressure control <b>valve</b> for use as actuator in the steering system. This valve can be made small and fast and is electronically controlled to enable active steering. It is based on a closed-centre circuit and has therefore the potential to improve energy efficiency. The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibility for the valve to perform as the  original open-centre valve. The suggested approach is a model-based design and evaluation process where an optimisation routine is used to design the valve. Together with a validated model of the steering system, the new concept is compared with the original system. A hardware-inthe-loop simulation test rig has also been designed and built with the possibility to test a closed-centre steering system. It has partly been used to support the modelling process and partly to verify that a closedcentre steering system is a feasible solution. The simulation results  have shown that the designed valve can perform sufficiently well compared to the original system...|$|R
