40|$|Introduction: Oral Candidiasis is an opportunist fungal infection, {{with high}} {{incidence}} in HIV and immunosuppressed patients and Candida albicans {{is the most}} common causing agent. In some cases, it can evolve to resistant injuries to antifungal conventional therapy. According to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopeia (BHP) [1], biotherapic medicines are prepared from chemically undefined biological products. Biotherapics created by Brazilian doctor Roberto Costa (RC) have a different homeopathic compounding technique, as its dynamization starts from the ethiologic agent of the illness in its alive form, which present higher capability to stimulate the host immunological system [2, 3]. &# 13; &# 13; Aim: The goal of this study was evaluate the physical-chemical and microbiological stability of Candida albicans RC potencies under different conditions of storage. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: To prepare the biotherapics, one part of Candida albicans yeast suspension (109 cell/ml) was diluted in 9 parts of sterile distillated water. After preparing this 1 : 10 dilution, the sample was undergone 100 <b>succussions,</b> resulting in the first decimal dilution (1 x). Then, one part of this solution was diluted in 9 parts of sterile distillated water and submitted to 100 <b>succussions,</b> generating the 2 x. This process was successively repeated following BHP, until 30 x. Water 30 x was prepared by the same technique, as control. All the solutions were prepared in aseptic and sterile conditions. Biotherapics 6 x, 12 x, 18 x, 24 x, 30 x and water 30 x were storage under refrigeration (2 to 8 Ã‚Â°C) and at room temperate (25 Ã‚Â°C) during 8 weeks. Every 15 days, the following parameters were analyzed: pH, electrical conductivity, UV absorbance (260 and 280 nm). Microbiological analyses were performed after 3 weeks by colony forming unit (CFU) method [4]. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The preliminary analyses performed at times zero, 15, 30 and 45 days suggest that electrical conductivity of these solutions tend to increase proportionally to storage time without significant differences due to temperature storage conditions. There was no statistically significant difference detected in pH values. Measures of absorbance of different biotherapic potencies under both conditions of storage are in course. Microbiological analyses showed no colony growth, but in the 1 x sample analyzed at time zero, indicating the viability of the fungus. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: Further experiments are being carried out in order to confirm the preliminary data obtained...|$|R
40|$|Background: Oral {{candidiasis}} is an opportunist {{fungal infection}} in humans, {{mainly caused by}} Candida albicans. It occurs when the host presents an imbalance in {{the immune system and}} Candida spp., normally found in human flora, become able to develop the infection [1]. This disease is very common in HIV patients, and in all individuals that present immunossupression, such as patients treated with chemotherapy. Considering this scenario, the development of new medicines to treat oral candidiasis is mandatory. &# 13; &# 13; Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate citotoxicity, morphology and quantify the adhesion rates of C. albicans to biotherapic-treated Ma 104 cells. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: The biotherapic was prepared following the Roberto Costa technique and Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopeia protocol [2]. Briefly, biotherapic 1 X was prepared with 1 mL of aqueous solution containing 108 yeasts of living Candida albicans plus 9 ml of sterile distilled water. This solution was submmited to 100 mechanical <b>succussions.</b> Biotherapic 2 X was obtained after addition of 1 ml of 1 X solution in 9 ml of sterile distilled water and it was also submitted to 100 mechanical <b>succussions.</b> This procedure was repeated until biotherapic 30 X was obtained. As a control, sterile dynamized water (30 X) was used. The inhibition of fungal growth induced by biotherapic was evaluated by MTT method after 24 hours of treatment. The morphological aspects of Ma 104 -biotherapic-treated cells were analyzed by Giemsa staining after 5, 10 and 60 days, and compared with control groups (water 30 X and untreated cells). Additionally, Ma 104 cells were treated during 5 and 30 days with biotherapic in parallel with respective controls, and the index adhesion of yeast cells was quantified. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The biotherapic was not able to reduce the viability of treated C. albicans when compared with controls. On the other hand, Ma 104 treated cells presented important morphological alterations after 60 days, such as: cytoplasmic vacuoles, halos around the nucleolus and elongation of the plasmatic membrane. These changes were not observed in,untreated cells nor in ones treated with water 30 X. The adhesion index to Ma 104 cells was reduced around 27 % after 5 and 30 days of treatment when compared to controls. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: These results showed that the biotherapic did not present any citotoxicity, but was able to modify the morphological aspects of Ma- 104 cells. Additionally, the interaction between host cells and ethilogic agent is directly influenced by biotherapic treatment, suggesting a promising antifungal potential of this medicine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Candida spp is {{naturally}} found in humansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ flora of skin, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and, in general, up to 75 % {{of the population}} {{does not have any}} symptom [1]. However, oral candidiasis is very common among HIV patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. The treatment of oral candidiasis is necessary once the disease causes discomfort and dysphagia, resulting in poor nutrition, slow recovery, and prolonged hospital stay [2, 3]. Preliminary results obtained by our group with a new biotherapic prepared from Candida albicans (Candida 30 x) showed a great potential to reduce the candida yeast adhesion rate when the epithelial cells were pre-treated. This study is currently being developed with the evaluation of mutagenic and genotoxic potentials of several homeopathic solutions. &# 13; &# 13; Aims: The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of different homeopathic potencies of C. albicans. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: One part of C. albicans yeast obtained from Brazilian patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood [4] was diluted in 9 parts of sterile water. This sample was submitted to 100 mechanical <b>succussions</b> (approximately 3 Hz), using AuticÃ‚Â® Brazilian machine, originating the first dilution (1 x). Then, 1 ml of this solution was diluted in 9 ml of solvent, submitted to 100 <b>succussions,</b> obtaining 2 x potency. This procedure was successively repeated to obtain 30 x potency, according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [5]. By the same technique, water vehicle was prepared until 30 x to be used as control. All samples were prepared in sterile and aseptic conditions, using laminar flow cabinet, class II and were stored in the refrigerator (8 Ã‚ÂºC). The samples 1 x, 6 x, 12 x, 18 x, 24 x and 30 x of C. albicans and water 30 x (vehicle control) were analysed by: the Inductest, which assesses the ability of physical or chemical agents to promote lysogenic induction as a reflection of damage in DNA molecules in lysogenic bacteria, and the Ames test, which uses indicator strains of Salmonella typhimurium, sensitive to substances that can induce different types of mutation. &# 13; &# 13; Results: In the Inductest no decrease in survival fraction of bacteria and no increase in the formation of lysogenic induction were detected independently of the homeopathic potency employed. The same profile was obtained after the Ames test, with similar results to negative control. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: Afterwards, we can conclude that these samples are not able to induce DNA damage in the cells tested.

40|$|Introduction: Strains of macrophages, such as murine J 774. G 8 macrophages, are {{susceptible}} to influenza A infection [1]. One of the responses to viral infection involves the production of various types of immunostimulatory cytokines by infected cells [2]. &# 13; &# 13; Methods: In the present study, the macrophage strain J 774. G 8, maintained in RPMI medium, was submitted to treatment with 10 % V/V of two different biotherapics prepared from influenza H 3 N 2, both at 30 x. Additionally, two control groups were analyzed: macrophages stimulated with water 30 x and macrophages without any treatment. Biotherapics were prepared from intact H 3 N 2 influenza virus and H 3 N 2 inactivated by alcohol 70 %. The compounding of both biotherapics followed this procedure: one part of viral particles was diluted in 9 parts of sterile distilled water. The 1 : 10 sample was submitted to 100 mechanical <b>succussions</b> using AuticÃ‚Â® Brazilian machine, originating the first dilution, named decimal (1 x). 1 ml of this solution was diluted in 9 ml of solvent and was submitted to 100 <b>succussions,</b> generating biotherapic 2 x.

By the same technique, water vehicle was prepared in the potency of 30 x {{to be used as}} control. All samples were prepared under sterile and aseptic conditions, using laminar flow cabinet, class II, and were stored in the refrigerator (8 Ã‚ÂºC), to avoid microbiological contamination. J 774. G 8 macrophages were stimulated for 2 days, in a total of six stimuli. Immediately before infection with 25 Ã‚Âµl of H 3 N 2 influenza virus, the supernatants were collected and frozen at - 20 Ã‚ÂºC for later analysis. Next, 24 hours after the virus infection, the supernatants were aliquoted and frozen under the same conditions. Three independent experiments were done in triplicate. Analysis of supernatants was performed by flow cytometry using the Mouse Inflammation Kit. The cytokines detected in this experiment were IL- 10, IL 12, TNF-ÃŽÂ± and MCP 1. &# 13; &# 13; Results: In all cases, {{there were no significant differences}} compared to control groups. However, the production of TNF-ÃŽÂ± detected in macrophages treated by intact and inactivated biotherapics presented a tendency to increase after infection.

40|$|Introduction: Lack of {{accuracy}} and uniformity of impact {{have been the}} limitations of the ancient and current methods of potentization. Non-standardized electromechanical potentizers are in use across industry. It is very important that within each manufacturing process, the number of <b>succussions</b> should remain constant as well as the impact given (force exerted) is quantified. The author proposes to give importance to the force parameters in potentization and quantify the impact of potentization. Materials and Methods: The author develops electromechanical potentizer with certain specifications such as arm length, weight, and angle at which the arm drops at the base. The machine was operated with specific instructions given in the machine operation manual. The force parameters were calculated and standardized. Results: Torque is measured to quantify the impact of the force applied in potentization. The magnitude of torque is to be calculated by the force applied, length of the lever arm connecting the axis to the point of force application, and angle between the force vector and the lever arm. In this case, torque was calculated to be = 40. 43 Nm. Since ten strokes are given, torque applied at every potency is calculated as 40. 43. Conclusion: Necessity for the documentation of force parameters used in the process of potentization has been identified, and a tool is developed to demonstrate it...|$|R

Discussion The proposed active components of homeopathic remedies are nanoparticles of source substance in water-based colloidal solution, not bulk-form drugs. Nanoparticles have unique biological and physico-chemical properties, including increased catalytic reactivity, protein and DNA adsorption, bioavailability, dose-sparing, electromagnetic, and quantum effects different from bulk-form materials.

Nanoparticles stimulate hormesis, a beneficial low-dose adaptive response. Homeopathic remedies prescribed in low doses spaced intermittently over time act as biological signals that stimulate the organism’s allostatic biological stress response network, evoking nonlinear modulatory, self-organizing change. Potential mechanisms include time-dependent sensitization (TDS), a type of adaptive plasticity/metaplasticity involving progressive amplification of host responses, which reverse direction and oscillate at physiological limits. To mobilize hormesis and TDS, the remedy must be appraised as a salient, but low level, novel threat, stressor, or homeostatic disruption for the whole organism. Silica nanoparticles adsorb remedy source and amplify effects. Properly-timed remedy dosing elicits disease-primed compensatory reversal in direction of maladaptive dynamics of the allostatic network, thus promoting resilience and recovery from disease.

5000|$|In homeopathy, homeopathic {{dilution}} (known by practitioners as [...] "dynamisation" [...] or [...] "potentisation") {{is a process}} in which a substance is diluted with alcohol or distilled water and then vigorously shaken in a process called [...] "succussion".

40|$|Introduction: Candidiasis is an opportunist infection, {{caused by}} yeast {{of the genus}} Candida, which emerges {{as one of the}} main causes of {{systemic}} infections in hospitalized patients. Candida albicans is the most common causing agent of these infections. According to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopeia[1], nosodes are medicines compounded from chemically undefined biological products. Living nosodes are prepared using the etiologic agent of an illness in its infective form, were first developed by Brazilian physician Roberto Costa (RC). Roberto CostaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research indicated that living nosodes present a higher capability to stimulate the hostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immunological system [2]. &# 13; Aim: This study aims to evaluate cellular alterations induced in C. albicans yeasts and RAW 264 - 7 macrophages by Candida albicans RC. &# 13; Methodology: To prepare Candida albicans RC, one part of C. albicans infective yeast suspension (108 cell/ml) was diluted in 9 parts of sterile distilled water and submitted to 100 mechanical <b>succussions.</b> This process was successively repeated to the potencies of 12 x and 30 x 1. Water 30 x was prepared by the same technique, as control. The cell viability of C. albicans previously treated with nosodes in both potencies and respective controls was evaluated using the samples at the concentration of 10 % (V/V), in a volume of 1 ml, distributed in 1 - 3 days. The viability of the yeast cells was analyzed by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimetiltiazol- 2 -il) - 2, 5 -difeniltetrazolic) (5 mg/ml) assay [3] and by Propidium Iodide (PI) incorporation methods. Additionally, using macrophages RAW 264 - 7 as a cell model, Nitric Oxide (NO) production and cell viability were also evaluated. For this, the following protocol of cell treatment was employed: on each experimental day, RAW 264 - 7 cells were treated 4 times (4 stimuli) with RC nosode 30 x at the concentration of 10 % (V/V). &# 13; Results: The nosodes (12 x and 30 x) did not present cytotoxic effects on macrophage cells (n= 1), or on C. albicans yeasts (n= 2), as detected by MTT and PI methods. Moreover, no statistically significant differences on NO production were detected among the experimental groups (n= 6). &# 13; Conclusion: Preliminary results of in vitro assays indicate that nosodes (12 x and 30 x) do not alter mitochondrial activity or cell viability of C. albicans. Similarly, treatment by RC nosodes does not seem to alter NO release and mitochondrial activity of RAW macrophages. New experiments are being performed to confirm these preliminary data...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{influenza}} virus {{has been responsible}} for contagious respiratory diseases with high mortality rates [1]. Some drugs have been used to treat human influenza. However, these drugs cause many common side effects and induce the appearance of resistant viral strains [2]. The impact caused by the {{influenza virus}} has motivated the development of new approaches for the prevention and control of influenza [3]. Therefore, a new homeopathic medicine was developed using, as a starting point, the infectious influenza virus [4]. This belongs to a group called living nosodes [5]. However, its mutagenic and genotoxic potentials, especially when used in low dilutions, has not yet been evaluated and it is important because this biotherapic is prepared from living microorganisms. Different methods can be used to detect mutagenic and genotoxicic effects. &# 13; &# 13; Aims: This study aims to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of influenza A living nosode at different homeopathic potencies. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: 1 ml of purified viral suspension was diluted in 9 ml of sterile distilled water.

A common explanation for his settling on this process {{is said to be}} that he found preparations subjected to agitation in transit, such as in saddle bags or in a carriage, were more [...] "potent". Hahnemann had a saddle-maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair. Insoluble solids, such as granite, diamond, and platinum, are diluted by grinding them with lactose ("trituration").|$|E
5000|$|Following up the {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} Viennese physician Anton von Störck, Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von Störck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von Störck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states, and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal [...] "law of similars". He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of [...] "potentization" [...] using dilution and <b>succussion</b> (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800-01 when, {{on the basis of}} his [...] "law of similars," [...] he had begun using Ipecacuanha for the treatment of coughs and Belladonna for scarlet fever.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{more than}} 50 years of research, Hahnemann {{introduced}} improvements for the manufacture of homoeopathic medicines to raise quality standards. In {{the case of the}} fifty-milesimals potencies (Q or LM potencies), this is related to freshness of raw materials; the principle of triturating all substances as far as the 3 c; maintaining a regular batch size; the number of <b>succussion</b> strokes and method of impregnation. Manufacturers later ignored these practices or discontinued them without giving valid reasons. Consistent, high-level quality can only be achieved by following the precise methods laid down, for example, for “Pe”-quality Q potencies. </p...|$|E

40|$|The “extremely diluted solutions”, {{anomalous}} solutions prepared {{through the}} iteration {{of a process}} of dilution and <b>succussion,</b> have been studied {{with the aim of}} obtaining information about the influence of the preparation method on the water structure of the solutions. We measured the heats of mixing of basic solutions with such “extremely diluted solutions”, and their electrical conductivity, comparing with the analogous heats of mixing, electrical conductivity of the solvent. We found some relevant exothermic excess heats of mixing, and higher conductivity than those of the untreated solvent. The heats of mixing and electrical conductivity show a good correlation, underlining a single cause for the behaviour of the extremely diluted solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{conductivity}} {{of extremely}} dilute solutions (EDS) was measured and studied {{in relation to}} the age of the solutions. The aim was to obtain information about the influence of succussive dilutions and succussions on the conductivity and structure of water. EDS are obtained by iteration of two processes: dilution 1 : 100 (mass basis) and <b>succussion.</b> The iteration is carried out until extreme dilutions are reached. We found significant increases in electrical conductivity with respect to the untreated demineralised water used as solvent, confirming the intriguing new behavior disclosed some time ago, namely the evolution of certain physico-chemical parameters with the age of the samples. We studied variations in electrical conductivity of samples up to two years old. Conductivities showed large variations reaching a pronounced maximum and, for several samples, then returning to their initial values. The latter fact suggests that the temporal evolution of this physico-chemical parameter does not stem from the slow attainment of an equilibrium condition, characterized by a minimum of energy, since that state, when reached, should be steady. These systems could be far from thermodynamic equilibrium, producing dissipative structures. In order to stay far from equilibrium, they need to dissipate energy. For reasons that are not yet clear, when modified environmental conditions prevent the necessary dissipation of energy, these systems return to their initial conditions. In the light of this interpretation, the <b>succussion</b> procedure may be the trigger for the formation of dissipative structures, the number and/or size of which increase with age, up to a certain point...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{information}} about the influence of successive dilutions and succussions (violent shaking) on the structure ofwater. “Extremely diluted solutions” (EDS) are solutions obtained through the iteration of two processes: 1 : 100 dilution and <b>succussion.</b> Those two processes are repeated until extreme dilutions are reached, so that the chemical composition of the end solution is identical to that of the solvent. We measured the heats of mixing and the electrical conductivity of basic solutions of such EDS, and compared these results with the analogous heats of mixing and electrical conductivity of the untreated solvent. The measurements were carried out as a function of the age of the samples. We found some relevant exothermic excess heat of mixing, and higher electrical conductivity than those of the untreated solvent, also in function of time. The measurements show a good linear correlation between the two independent physico-chemical quantities, implying a single cause for this behavior of the extremely diluted solutions. The slopes of the linear correlation depend on the age of the EDS. Such a phenomenon could result from a variation of the shape of molecular aggregates that characterize the two different supramolecular structures of the water of different ages. This behavior could provide important support for understanding the nature of the phenomena described herein. A really intriguing phenomenon is the evolution of some physico-chemical properties with time. This hints at a “trigger” effect on the formation of molecular aggregates that result from the <b>succussion</b> procedure. We show that successive dilutions and succussions can permanently alter the physicochemical properties of the aqueous solvent, the extent of which depends on the age of the samples...|$|E

40|$|High Dilution is a {{solution}} beyond the Avogadro limits that, in the dependence of the applied <b>succussion</b> elicits a suppressive or a stimulant effect on a living cell, with a consequent generation of an oscillatory dose-effect curve.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} homoeopathic Arsenicum album potencies were investigated in-vitro, using a {{continuous cell line}} (MT 4), pre-intoxicated with arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3), and then treated with succussed and unsuccussed homoeopathic potencies, 6 CH, 30 CH and 200 CH. This study aimed to verify the homoeopathic law of similars and to determine whether potencies diluted beyond Avogadro’s constant had physiological effects on cells; whether various potencies would cause different effects {{as suggested by the}} concept of hormesis; whether succussed and unsuccussed homoeopathic potencies had different effects on the cells; and to establish whether a biotechnological method could be used to evaluate the above. As 2 O 3 was used to pre-intoxicate and the MTT assay was used to measure the percentage cytotoxicity and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of the cells. The homoeopathic potencies of Arsenicum album (6 CH, 30 CH and 200 CH) were prepared by either succussing or allowing to diffuse for 30 s. After pre-intoxication of the MT 4 cells with the IC 50 As 2 O 3 and treatment with succussed and unsuccussed Arsenicum album (6 CH- 200 CH), the cell viability increased with increasing potency from 81 % to 194 % (over 72 h). The treatments and the times of exposure were found to be statistically significant determinants of cell viability, whereas <b>succussion</b> did not cause any significant variation in the results. The study provided evidence that a biotechnological method (namely cell viability) may be used to scientifically evaluate the physiological effects of homoeopathic potencies on human cells; it confirmed that the homoeopathic potencies did have therapeutic effects; and that <b>succussion</b> was not required in the potentization method in order to produce a curative remedy...|$|E
