30|$|As far as {{pavement}} {{response is}} concerned, some pioneers have dedicated their research {{to the subject}} of effects of moving loads on pavement structure. To perform the dynamic analysis of pavement structures, one of the indispensable considerations is the dynamic traffic loading, which is the excitation source of pavement structures. Since pavement loads are caused by vehicle vibration, it is necessary to include the vehicle in the investigations of pavement loads. Employing MIT heavy truck simulation program Hedric and his associates, Abbo and Markow [9, 10, 11], examined the influence of joint <b>spacing,</b> <b>step</b> faulting, vehicle suspension characteristics, and vehicle velocity on pavement damage as defined by fatigue cracking in concrete slab. The response of pavement under their consideration is achieved using PMARP, a static finite element program for pavement analysis developed by the Purdue. The conclusions obtain provide a valuable approximation of pavement response.While PMARP is a static finite element program, the properties of inertia and damping of the pavement structure were not included in consideration.|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{investigation}} of synthesis conditions for the direct growth of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) used for surface functionalization. The characterization of the surface-grown crystals is a central part of this thesis, in order {{to learn more about the}} mechanism of MOF crystallization and the interesting properties of this class of materials leading to future applications. The tuneable oriented growth of thin films of the porous MOF HKUST- 1 (Cu 3 (C 9 H 3 O 6) 2 (H 2 O) 3 •xH 2 O) on different functionalized SAMs is demonstrated. Films grown on carboxylate-terminated SAMs are highly oriented along the [100] direction, while alcohol-terminated surfaces induce a completely different orientation along the [111] direction. Homogeneous but less oriented thin films are also obtained on methyl-terminated SAMs. A combination of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy was used to study the film growth, including the morphological evolution of the crystals on the SAMs. In situ atomic force microscopy was used to directly investigate the growth processes of the oriented MOF HKUST- 1 grown on SAMs on gold substrates. This approach provides direct evidence for a layer-by-layer mechanism of the constituent 1. 5 nm d 111 crystal <b>spacing</b> <b>step,</b> its form during growth, and the influence of the step vertex on the rate of growth. The orientation and structure of porous MOFs based on iron terephthalate can be controlled by heterogeneous nucleation on self-assembled monolayers of mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA). The framework MIL- 53 is the product of homogeneous nucleation, whereas in the same crystallisation solution, oriented MIL- 88 B grows on the functionalized gold surface. A new sample cell was developed to allow for the investigation of the structural changes of flexible, porous materials during adsorption and desorption of guest molecules. Crystals of the flexible MOF Fe-MIL- 88 B were investigated as bulk material as well as surface-grown, oriented crystals. We were able to follow the structural changes of the Fe-MIL- 88 B crystals upon ad- and desorption of water. Due to the orientation of the crystals on the gold substrates, structural changes in [001] direction could be observed. For the randomly oriented bulk crystals the structural changes in all crystallographic directions are observable and the changes of the lattice constants a and c and the cell volume could be determined quantitatively by indexing of the complete diffraction patterns. The sorption isotherms recorded with the help of the sorption@XRD method show two distinct steps of structural changes. During adsorption of water the lattice parameter c is slightly but still detectably decreased, whereas the lattice parameter a shows a prominent two step-increase resulting in an increase of the cell volume about 40 %. The conventional volumetric water sorption measurement also shows two distinct steps of the amount of adsorbed volume that can be correlated to the structural changes observed in X-ray diffraction. We have demonstrated that advantages of functionalization can also be realized in oriented film synthesis of MOFs: We have shown for the first time that functionalized MOFs can be grown on self-assembled monolayers and that a preferred orientation of the crystals is achieved. This was demonstrated for NH 2 -MIL- 101 and to a lesser extent for NH-MIL- 88 B. Importantly for potential storage applications, it was also shown that the adsorption capacity of NH 2 -MIL- 101 was not significantly reduced by the amino functionalization...|$|E

When turbulent flow develops fully, the terms of first order, compared with terms of second order, can be ignored. So, it is why classic N-S equations aren’t closed when they are used to analyze turbulent flow.

40|$|We first analyse {{the effect}} of a square root {{transformation}} to the time variable on the convergence of the Crank-Nicolson scheme when applied to the solution of the heat equation with Dirac delta function initial conditions. In the original variables, the scheme is known to diverge as the time step is reduced with the ratio of the time <b>step</b> to <b>space</b> <b>step</b> held constant and the value of this ratio controls how fast the divergence occurs. After introducing the square root of time variable we prove that the numerical scheme for the transformed partial differential equation now always converges and that the ratio of the time <b>step</b> to <b>space</b> <b>step</b> controls the order of convergence, quadratic convergence being achieved for this ratio below a critical value. Numerical results indicate that the time change used with an appropriate value of this ratio also results in quadratic convergence for the calculation of the price, delta and gamma for standard European and American options without the need for Rannacher start-up steps...|$|R
40|$|The {{solution}} of the full wave equation implies very high computational burdens to get high accurate results. Indeed, to improve {{the accuracy of the}} numerical solution, one must considerably reduce the <b>space</b> <b>step,</b> which is the distance between two points of the mesh representing the computational domain. Obviously this results in increasing the number of unknowns of the discrete problem. Besides, the time step, whose value fixes the number of required iterations for solving the evolution problem, is linked to the <b>space</b> <b>step</b> through the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Levy) condition. The CFL number defines an upper bound for the time step {{in such a way that}} the smaller the <b>space</b> <b>step</b> is, the higher the numbers of iterations and of discrete unknowns will be. In the three-dimensional case, the problem can have more than ten millions of unknowns which must be evaluated at each time-iteration. However, high-order numerical methods can be used for computing accurate solutions with larger <b>space</b> and time <b>steps.</b> Recently, Joly and Gilbert [2], have optimized the modified equation technique, which was proposed by Shubin and Bell [1] for solving the wave equation and it seems to be very promising providing some improvements. In this work, we apply this technique in an original way. Indeed, most of the works devoted to the {{solution of}} the wave equation consider first the space discretization of the system before addressing the question of the time discretization. We intends here to invert the discretization process by applying first the time discretization thanks to the modified equation technique and after to consider the space discretization. After the time discretization an additional bilaplacian operator appears and we therefore we have to consider C 1 finite elements (such as the Hermite ones) or Discontinuous Galerkin finite elements whose C 1 continuity is enforced through an appropriate penalty term.
