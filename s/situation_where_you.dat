Elements of the story are raised in various scenes of [...] "Time Capsule", including when Tom tries to ask Lucy why she broke up with him: [...] "Is it because I'm not cool enough, like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob type <b>situation,</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> like me but there's someone else you like more?" [...] Leslie claims to favor Harry Potter, the popular fantasy series by author J.K. Rowling, over Twilight. Parks department employee Donna professes an unhealthy infatuation with Robert Pattinson, the actor who played Edward Cullen in the Twilight films.|$|E

During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can't help it.

[...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be?

500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds.

The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5.

[...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking?

I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone.

50|$|There {{are many}} <b>situations</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want {{multiple}} fields from each row. Column databases {{are usually not}} good for these types of queries. The more fields you like to read per record, the less benefits you get from storing in a column-oriented fashion. Actually, if your queries are for looking up user-specific values only, row-oriented databases usually perform those queries quicker. Secondly, writing new data could take more time in columnar storage. For instance, if you're inserting a new record into a row-oriented database, you can easily write that in one process. However, if you're inserting a new record to a column database, you need to write to each column one by one. This results as it will take longer time when loading new data or updating many values in a columnar database.|$|R
