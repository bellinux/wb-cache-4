40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether passively collected routine health facility {{data can be}} used for mapping spatial heterogeneities in malaria transmission at the level of local government housing cluster administrative units in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. From June 2012 to Jan 2013, residential locations of patients tested for malaria at a public health facility were traced based on their local leaders’ names and geo-referencing the point locations of these leaders’ houses. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to visualise the spatial distribution of malaria infection rates. Spatial scan statistics were deployed to detect spatial clustering of high infection rates. Among 2, 407 patients tested for malaria, 46. 6 % (1, 121) could be traced to their 411 different residential housing clusters. One small spatially aggregated cluster of neighbourhoods with high prevalence was identified. While the home residence housing cluster leader was unambiguously identified for 73. 8 % (240 / 325) of malaria-positive patients, only 42. 3 % (881 / 2, 082) of those with negative test results were successfully traced. It was concluded that recording <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> of <b>reference</b> during routine health facility visits {{can be used for}} mapping malaria infection burden on very fine geographic scales, potentially offering a feasible approach to rational geographic targeting of malaria control interventions. However, in order to tap the full potential of this approach, it would be necessary to optimise patient tracing success and eliminate biases by blinding personnel to test results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Simple point {{detection}} is {{an important}} task for several problems in discrete geometry, such as topology preserving thinning in image processing to compute discrete skeletons. In this paper, the approach to <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> detection is based on techniques from cubical homology, a framework ideally suited for problems in image processing. A (-dimensional) unitary cube (for a-dimensional digital image) is associated with every discrete picture element, instead of a point in (the-dimensional Euclidean space) as has been done previously. A <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> in this setting then refers to the removal of a unitary cube without changing the topology of the cubical complex induced by the digital image. The main result is a characterization of a <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> (i. e., <b>simple</b> unitary cube) {{in terms of the}} homology groups of the @Q IA neighborhood of for arbitrary, finite dimensions Index Terms—Cubical homology, digital geometry, <b>simple</b> <b>point,</b> skeleton...|$|R

However, the {{simultaneous}} deletion of <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> may change the topology. Through the notion of P-simple point, we give examples of algorithms, described by a two-steps procedure, which removes <b>simple</b> <b>points</b> in parallel and which are automatically ensured to preserve the topology. More particularly, a new symmetrical thinning algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, through the notion of P^x-simple point, we give a methodology which permits to produce an algorithm A' (described by a one-step procedure) from an existent one A, which is "faster" than A, {{in the sense that it}} usually 'deletes more points than A''...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} purely {{discrete}} deformable partition model for segmenting 3 D images.

An ML <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> can be relabeled without modifying the overall topology of the partition. The definition is based on intervoxel properties, and uses the notion of collapse on cubical complexes. This work {{is an extension of}} a former restricted definition [DupasAl 09] that prohibits the move of intersections of boundary surfaces. A deformation process is carried out with a greedy energy minimization algorithm. A discrete area estimator is used to approach at best standard regularizers classically used in continuous energy minimizing methods.
