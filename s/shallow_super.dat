5000|$|The National hive, as {{it usually}} known, {{is based on}} the same {{principles}} as other Langstroth designs: a vertical stack of modular components. The original specification and the associated Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food leaflet detail a floor (now often superseded by an open-mesh floor which allows monitoring of Varroa infestation), stand, 'deep' boxes (actually not 'deep', but standard brood boxes), shallow honey supers, a section rack (for production of sections of comb honey), a crownboard, and a roof. The main boxes are 18⅛" [...] (460mm) squares in footprint: the standard brood boxes being 8⅞" [...] (225mm) tall, and the <b>shallow</b> <b>super</b> 5⅞" [...] (150mm) tall. The main walls are ¾" [...] (19mm) thick.Because the boxes are square, it is possible to stack them in two orientations above the floor (that is, with respect to the entrance). The orientation of the moveable frames within the boxes, then, can be either aligned with the entrance block ('warm way'), or perpendicular to it ('cold way'). The frames are supported on runners on two sides of the box, in a deep rebate formed by the two-piece construction of the sides.|$|E
50|$|The deep hive body is {{normally}} {{used only for}} brood, as it becomes too heavy to handle manually if it becomes filled with honey. Commercial operations usually use one- or two-deep hive bodies for brood, and additional shallow hive components for honey supers. Some hobbyists prefer to standardize on all mediums. <b>Shallow</b> <b>supers</b> are not ideal for the brood chamber of the hive because the bees need to form a single compact sphere during the cold winter months — a sphere that can expand and contract without being divided by a horizontal plane in the middle caused by the gaps between combs in multiple hive bodies.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was always}} seeking {{a better way}} to keep bees. Just as he had begun with the old European [...] "eke" [...] he quickly {{abandoned}} that kind of beekeeping for the modern Langstroth hive concept. Bee hives have often been designed and built without regard for the needs and habits of the honey bee colony. Probably the best design for a colony was the large hive developed by Charles Dadant. It provided a large, deep brood chamber with plenty of room in which the queen could lay, and <b>shallower</b> <b>supers</b> for honey storage. However, the price and promotion of smaller hives offered for sale during the period from about 1885 to 1900 made them more popular.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the British National, National, or Modified National, this hive is based on square boxes (460mm side), with a 225mm standard/brood box, and <b>shallow</b> 150mm <b>supers</b> {{typically}} used for honey. The construction of the boxes is relatively complicated (eight pieces), but strong, and with easy-to-hold handles. The boxes take frames of 432mm length, with a relatively long lug (38mm) and a comb width of 355mm.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} U-Pb-He triple dating {{age determination}} for several porphyry Cu±Mo±Au deposits in Chile, Indonesia and Iran {{in an effort}} to determine their thermal histories and to explore the effects of cooling/exhumation rates on ore formation and preservation processes. Inverse thermal modelling of measured time-temperature history data from these deposits was conducted to quantitatively constrain the depth of emplacement, duration of ore deposition, exposure ages and cooling/exhumation rates. The duration of hypogene ore formation for the deposits studied generally occurs within timeframes of 10 ⁵ years, although modelling results for the Grasberg, Batu Hijau and El Teniente super porphyry deposits suggest formation periods of the order of 10 ⁴ years. Emplacement depths on intrusions associated with porphyry mineralisation range from 800 m to 5500 m from the palaeosurface, with the Grasberg and Rio Blanco being respectively the <b>shallowest</b> and deepest <b>super</b> porphyry deposits studied. The thermochronology data indicates a positive correlation between metal grade and cooling rate during hypogene ore formation, but further investigation is warranted. Exhumation rates varying from 0. 3 to 1. 1 km/m. y. have implications for the preservation potential of hypogene ore deposits, with super porphyry deposits like Sar Cheshmeh potentially losing 3. 5 Mt of copper to erosion over the last 5 million years. The potential for supergene ore formation under such conditions is high, as is the potential for the formation of proximal Exotica-type deposits. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|At {{an average}} age of 42 years, 10 % of the nation’s over 607, 000 bridges are posted for load restrictions, with an {{additional}} 15 % considered structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. While there are major concerns with decks in 75 % of structurally deficient bridges, often weight and geometry of the deck further limit the load rating and functionality of the bridge. Traditional deck systems and construction methods usually lead to prolonged periods of traffic delays, limiting options for transportation agencies to replace or widen a bridge, especially in urban areas. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a new generation of ultra-lightweight <b>super</b> <b>shallow</b> solid deck systems to replace open grid steel decks on movable bridges and as well serve as a viable alternative in bridge deck replacements across the country. The study has led to a lightweight low-profile asymmetric waffle deck made with advanced materials. The asymmetry comes from the arrangement of primary and secondary ribs, respectively perpendicular and parallel to the direction of traffic. The waffle deck is made with ultrahigh performance concrete (UHPC) reinforced with either high-strength steel (HSS) or carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement. With this combination, the deck weight was limited to below 21 psf and its overall depth to only 4 inch, while still meeting the strength and ductility demands for 4 ft. typical stringer spacing. It was further envisioned that the ultra-high strength of UHPC is best matched with the high strength of HSS or CFRP reinforcement for an efficient system and the ductile behavior of UHPC can help mask the linear elastic response of CFRP reinforcement and result in an overall ductile system. The issues of consideration from the design and constructability perspectives have included strength and stiffness, bond and development length for the reinforcement, punching shear and panel action. A series of experiments were conducted to help address these issues. Additionally full-size panels were made for testing under heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) at the accelerated pavement testing (APT) facility in Gainesville. Detailed finite element analyses were also carried out to help guide the design of this new generation of bridge decks. The research has confirmed the superior performance of the new deck system and its feasibility. ...|$|R
