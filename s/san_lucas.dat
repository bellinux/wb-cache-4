5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on August 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of Cabo <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b> On August 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, despite a lack of convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of Cabo <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b> In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{development}} {{took place}} as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation while located west of Sonora. During the afternoon of September20, an {{area of low pressure}} developed within the system, prompting the NHC to classify it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 240mi (390km) south-southeast of Cabo <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b> Situated along the western edge of a subtropical ridge, the system was steered towards the north-northwest throughout its existence.|$|E
5|$|Henriette {{continued}} to improve in structure {{and with the}} formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85mph (135 km/h) that morning while centered about 75miles (120km)south-southeast of Cabo <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b>|$|E

5|$|Initially, some {{forecasts}} {{predicted the}} storm would strike the Baja California Peninsula as {{a tropical storm}}; a tropical storm watch was briefly issued from Sante Fe to Cabo <b>San</b> <b>Lucas</b> accordingly. Over 100 shelters were opened in the municipalities of Los Cabos, La Paz and Comondú, respectively.

The third tropical cyclone of the season, Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270miles (470km) southeast {{off the coast of}} Mexico. With favorable conditions for development, it strengthened steadily at first, followed by a period of rapid deepening to peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) on June 22. Cooler waters caused Carlotta to gradually weaken, and on June 25 it degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure while located about 260miles (420km) west-southwest of Cabo <b>San</b> <b>Lucas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fefa {{was a major}} Pacific {{hurricane}} of the 1991 Pacific {{hurricane season}} that despite causing minimal effects its name {{was removed from the}} list of tropical cyclone names.
