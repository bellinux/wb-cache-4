5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a riskier slip knot. Julia fails to <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E

50|$|<b>Slipping</b> <b>the</b> clutch (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering the clutch) is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car. It's called <b>slipping</b> because <b>the</b> clutch plate will <b>slip</b> against <b>the</b> flywheel surface when such an action is performed. <b>Slipping</b> <b>the</b> clutch {{is known to be}} hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|R

5|$|Pressed by the French and Bavarians to {{the west}} and Hungarian rebels to the east, Austria faced the real {{possibility}} of being forced out of the war. Concerns over Vienna and the situation in southern Germany convinced Marlborough of the necessity of sending aid to the Danube; but the scheme of seizing the initiative from the enemy was extremely bold. From the start the Duke resolved to mislead the Dutch, who would never willingly permit any major weakening of Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands. To this end, Marlborough moved his English troops to the Moselle (a plan approved of by The Hague), but once there he planned to <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> Dutch leash and march south to link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.|$|E
5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E

50|$|Selvages in {{knitting}} {{can either}} bear a special pattern worked {{into the first}} and last stitches or simply be the edge of the fabric. The two most common selvage stitches are the chain-edge selvage and the slipped-garter edge, both of which produce a nice edge. The chain-edge selvage is made by alternating rows of <b>slipping</b> <b>the</b> first stitch knitwise and knitting the last stitch, with rows of <b>slipping</b> <b>the</b> first stitch purlwise and purling the last stitch. <b>The</b> <b>slipped</b> garter edge is made by <b>slipping</b> <b>the</b> first stitch knitwise and knitting the last in every row. Other selvages include a garter stitch border one stitch wide, or a combination of the above techniques.|$|R

25|$|Unless {{the tunnel}} penetrates a fault likely to <b>slip,</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} danger to tunnels is a landslide blocking an entrance. Additional protection around the entrance may {{be applied to}} divert any falling material (similar as is done to divert snow avalanches) or the slope above the tunnel may be stabilized in some way. Where only small- to medium-sized rocks and boulders are expected to fall, the entire slope may be covered with wire mesh, pinned down to the slope with metal rods. This is also a common modification to highway cuts where appropriate conditions exist.|$|E
25|$|The Australian first innings {{got off to}} a solid start, with Justin Langer {{forging a}} 100 {{partnership}} with fellow opener Matthew Hayden – the first opening-partnership century of the series by the Australian cricket team. Langer played some blistering strokes off Giles' bowling in particular, but survived a sharp chance to Marcus Trescothick at first <b>slip.</b> <b>The</b> Australians were offered the light immediately after tea, despite the English protesting and wanting to bowl Giles. The Australians accepted it, and the light never improved, with light rain coming down later. Thus, the day concluded with Australia 112/0, 261 runs behind England.|$|E

25|$|Barry twice sent Goodridge to {{the canvas}} with low kicks in the early going, the first ruled a <b>slip,</b> <b>the</b> second a {{legitimate}} down. He then landed a left high kick on the Trinidadian brawler and, although it did not knock him down, it opened a large cut which caused the ringside physician to call {{a halt to the}} bout and send Barry through to the semis where he had his rubber match with Aleksandr Pitchkounov. He was floored with a mawashi geri in round two and received a count from the referee in three after being injured when the Russian checked one of his low kicks, losing by unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|Hand-modeled clay female figurines {{are also}} highly {{characteristic}} of Las Charcas culture. Those found at Kaminaljuyu are generally of reddish brown clay {{and some have}} a white <b>slip.</b> <b>The</b> female figurines often depict pregnancy and {{are thought to have}} been offerings to promote fertility in the fields. Usually the arms and legs of the figures are mere stumps but some attempt at a realistic body shape has been made. The head has received the most attention to detail. The nose was pinched into the relief and nostrils were made by punctuating the clay. The eyes and the mouth were formed by strategically applied lumps. The figurines often have earplug flares.|$|E
25|$|When Lucy {{returns and}} sees the Time Lord, the Doctor reveals {{to her that the}} alien brains {{colonise}} planets by taking control of their prominent leaders, with Earth being their next target. Leaving Lucy to prepare for an interview with Grant's alter ego, the Doctor and Nardole track down the alien's ship in a low orbit and board it via the TARDIS. There, they discover that the ship's reactor is in a critical state and realise from Dr Sim that he intends to drop it on New York. Remembering an observation made by Nardole, the Doctor realises the city would be vaporised except for the Harmony Shoals building. World leaders would then take shelter in the company's other buildings within each capital city, believing Earth was under attack, effectively allowing the brains to take them over. After Dr Sim lets <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> ship is to be dropped at a designated time, the Doctor forces its descent ahead of schedule.|$|E

25|$|The 2006 Trojans {{came out}} strong, easily {{defending}} their top 10 status throughout the year. As the season progressed, USC began to display marked inconsistencies, as their margins of victory began to <b>slip.</b> <b>The</b> first setback {{proved to be}} a 31–33 loss to unranked Oregon State, in which the Beavers were able to repeatedly capitalize on several Trojan turnovers. Even though USC dropped initially in the polls, they worked their way back up. After defeating both Cal and Notre Dame, they held the number 2 spot heading into the final week of the season. The Trojans were considered to be a virtual lock for the National Championship Game against Ohio State and just needed to beat UCLA. USC was shocked in the final game of the season, losing to crosstown rival UCLA 13–9. This eliminated the Trojans from championship contention and opened the door for Florida to become Ohio State's opponent. The Trojans did earn a Rose Bowl bid and defeated Michigan 32-18. It was the Trojans fifth straight BCS Bowl appearance.|$|E
25|$|Band cups have {{a softer}} {{transition}} between {{the body and}} the rim. The decoration {{is in the form of}} a band circling the cup exterior and can frequently be a very elaborate frieze. In the case of this form the rim is coated with a glossy black <b>slip.</b> <b>The</b> interior retains the color of the clay, except for a black dot painted in the center. Variations include Droop cups and Kassel cups. Droop cups have black, concave lips and a high foot. As with classic band cups the rim is left black, but the area below it is decorated with ornaments like leaves, buds, palmettes, dots, nimbuses or animals on the cup exterior. Kassel cups are a small form, squatter than other Little Masters cups, and the entire exterior is decorated. As in the case of Droop cups, primarily ornaments are painted. Famous Little Masters are the potters Phrynos, Sokles, Tleson and Ergoteles, the latter two being sons of the potter Nearchos. Hermogenes invented a Little Master variety of skyphos now known as a Hermogenes skyphos. The Phrynos Painter, Taleides Painter, Xenokles Painter and the Group of Rhodes 12264 should also be mentioned here.|$|E
25|$|A new villainous Star Sapphire {{debuted in}} Green Lantern Vol 5 #21 (August 2013). Prixiam Nol-Anj {{was a former}} {{prisoner}} of the Oan sciencells, imprisoned for a slew of different crimes: racketeering, smuggling, extortion, murder for hire, abduction, trafficking in organisms, larceny, grand theft starship, and assault with an energy weapon. Over time, she uses her wiles to beguile her guard, a Green Lantern named Cossite, and he {{falls in love with}} her. When Larfleeze attacks Oa {{in the aftermath of the}} First Lantern's defeat and the death of the Guardians, his constructs kill a Star Sapphire who arrived to aid in the defense of the planet. The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence is proof that her love for him is true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> ring onto her fingers and acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when no one else would.|$|E

25|$|This match {{proved to}} be the turning point for the Indians who now began to win consistently. The match was played in warm {{sunshine}} before a crowd that included many Indians. Barry Dudleston and David Steele began with a stand of 50 runs in an hour before Chandra caught and bowled Steele. Baig ran Dudleston out for 51 and Solkar took a spectacular catch at short squareleg to dismiss Brian Davison. Leicestershire were dismissed before tea for 198. Gavaskar and Wadekar added 231 for the second wicket. Wadekar once swung Jack Birkenshaw over fineleg, shattering the window panes. India was 120 for 1 at close on the first day, and added another 125 without loss before lunch on the second. Wadekar was well caught by Birkenshaw at short midwicket having made 126 with 18 fours and the six. Gavaskar made 165 in five and a half fours with 21 fours. India declared after tea with a lead of 218. Leicestershire lost quick wickets on the last day before Chris Balderstone and Roger Tolchard added 72 for the fifth wicket. Tolchard was dropped by Solkar but Gavaskar had him caught at <b>slip.</b> <b>The</b> match ended ten minutes after lunch. Chandra returned figures of 5 for 63 and 6 for 64 (11 for 127).|$|E
25|$|The clubs {{second season}} saw Brendon Santalab and Australian {{international}} Matthew Špiranović join the team. Wanderers held second position behind Brisbane Roar throughout {{the majority of}} the season despite criticism over the team's squad rotation policy which Popovic implemented with consideration to the AFC Champions League and the short turnaround between matches. On 26 February 2014, the club made their Champions League debut against Ulsan Hyundai. A goal within the first minute of the match by Santalab was cancelled out as the South Korean side scored three unanswered goals to win the match. Nevertheless, the team eventually finished top in their group to progress to the Round of 16. After finishing runners-up in the 2013–14 A-League season, Wanderers secured direct qualification into the 2015 AFC Champions League, as well as a place in the A-League finals series. A 2–0 win against Central Coast Mariners in the semi-finals of the finals series on 26 April 2014, saw the team progress to their second A-League Grand Final in as many seasons. On 4 May 2014, Western Sydney Wanderers competed against Brisbane Roar in the 2014 A-League Grand Final at a sold out Lang Park. 10,000 Wanderers supporters travelled north for the occasion, but after taking the lead through a header from Špiranović the team failed to hold the lead late in the game, later letting <b>slip</b> <b>the</b> A-League Championship during extra time. Following the loss, the team was forced a quick turnaround for their home and final leg of the Champions League Round of 16– a home and away series against Japanese side Sanfrecce Hiroshima. Despite being down 3–1 on aggregate, the team managed to overturn the result and win 2–0 to progress to the quarter-finals in what was Ono's, Hersi's, Polenz's and inaugural captain Michael Beauchamp's final match for the club.|$|E
25|$|Bill Lawry (52) and Bobby Simpson (38) {{weathered}} the early storm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, edging a few through the slips and Trueman bowling out-swingers which moved {{just past the}} edge of the bat. Len Coldwell (2/58) came on the bowl his in-swingers, off which the openers managed to steal a few singles, until he managed to move the ball the other way and caught the edge of Simpson's bat for a catch behind at 62/1. Norm O'Neill came in until lunch when Australia went in on 93/1 off 22 overs in two hours, a total somewhat less than 15 overs an hour promised by Ted Dexter {{at the start of the}} tour. After lunch Lawry edged a ball from Statham between the wicket-keeper Alan Smith and Tom Graveney at first <b>slip,</b> <b>the</b> ball cutting back after it hit the turf. O'Neill was caught by Graveney off Statham (1/83), distracted by the loud racing commentary on a radio in the stands, Neil Harvey was bowled by Coldwell for a duck and Lawry by Trueman (3/83) and Australia lost three wickets for 1 run to be left 112/4. The rest of the innings was a grinding match as Dexter rested his fast bowlers and set defensive field until they returned and while all of the remaining Australian batsmen reached double figures none reached 50. Fred Titmus took his new best Test figures of 4/43 as he wheeled his way through the afternoon, trapping Peter Burge lbw for 23 when he swept once too often and having Brian Booth caught by Ken Barrington for 27 trying to repeat a fine glance to leg. Alan Davidson (40) and Ken Mackay (49) added 73 for the eighth-wicket and Mackay and Richie Benaud (36) 52 runs into the next day as they tried to wear down the bowlers. Titmus dismissed them both in the end, Benaud sweeping the ball the Barrington and Mackay lbw after some deliberation by Umpire Smyth. Trueman removed Garth McKenzie (16) after a last-wicket stand of 22 and Australia were all out for 316 with Barry Jarman on 10 not out.|$|E
