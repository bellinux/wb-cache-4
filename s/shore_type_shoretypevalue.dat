40|$|The climate {{envelope}} {{approach to}} predicting climate-induced species range shift is limited. There are many possible reasons for this, but one novel {{explanation is that}} species adapt to changes in temperature {{at the expense of}} adaptation to other stressors. Here we test this hypothesis using the limpet, Patella depressa (Mollusca, Patellidae), over a large geographical area covering most of the Atlantic coast of Iberian Peninsula, known to consist of a genetically inter-connected population. We examine limpet shell morphology on four shores in each of three regions, from northern Spain to southern Portugal. Within each region, shell morphology (measured as maximum shell profile to length ratio) varied between <b>shore</b> <b>types</b> differing in their insolation, wave action, microhabitat availability and biological factors. However, this ratio, which is known to be an adaptive response to heat stress, was found to be consistently higher in more southern latitudes, despite differences between <b>shore</b> <b>types</b> being found in all regions. This implies that localised adaptation to <b>shore</b> <b>type</b> (most likely through phenotypic plasticity) is compromised by factors which change over latitudinal or regional scales, or which could occur in response to climate change. Even though such climate-induced changes may initially be localized, compromised adaptation (through plasticity or genetic) may result in altered community interactions and potentially large shifts in community structure...|$|R

40|$|Recruitment and {{population}} structure of Perna perna in low shore mussel beds were investigated over 15 months at six sites {{along the south}} coast of South Africa. Initial, subjective classification of sites as wave exposed or wave sheltered (three of each) was confirmed using the dissolution of cement blocks to measure average water flux and dynamometers for maximum wave force. Recruitment occurred throughout the year, but recruit (1 – 5 mm) densities were significantly higher from January to April 1996 on both <b>shore</b> <b>types.</b> Recruit densities were positively correlated with adult (> 15 mm) densities for both <b>shore</b> <b>types</b> (P 0. 05). Thus wave exposure dramatically affects density, recruitment and mussel size, but not recruitment timing or biomass where there is 100 % cover, and mediates a three-way interaction among food supply, larval supply and intraspecific competition for space. In contrast to shores with saturation recruitment, mussel biomass here appears to be limited by recruit supply and constraints of food, especially on sheltered shores, while density is regulated through intraspecific competition for space primarily on exposed shores and at small spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore the effect of increased operational tempo on the retention behavior of Navy Hospital Corpsmen in pay grades E 1 -E 6. Two data files {{were obtained from the}} Defense Manpower Data Center, one for first term personnel on active duty on September 1, 1998 who were eligible to reenlist/separate prior to September 11, 2001 and another for those on active duty on September 11, 2001 who were eligible to reenlist/separate prior to March 2004. The two groups differed significantly in demographics and military background characteristics. A logistic regression model incorporating individual and organizational factors affecting retention was estimated for each group. Model results indicate that personnel who have been deployed regardless of whether they were assigned to sea or <b>shore</b> <b>type</b> duty and regardless of the frequency of deployments are more likely to remain on active duty than those assigned to <b>shore</b> <b>type</b> duty and who have not deployed.

Annual macrofaunal and meiofaunal {{standing}} {{stocks were}} estimated on an exposed rocky shore {{along the west}} coast of False Bay, South Africa, using comparable area based sampling techniques. While meiofaunal densities exceeded those of macrofauna in all zones, by an overall ratio of approximately 400 : 1, macrofaunal biomass exceeded that of meiofauna by an overall ratio of 10 : 1. The numbers of meiofauna were not evenly distributed across the shore but varied with the algal standing stocks in each zone and their sediment load. By incorporating turnover ratios from the literature, mean annual productivity ratios were calculated which suggested that meiofauna were responsible for 25 of total (excluding bacterial) secondary production. To follow this up, the impact of wave exposure on the meiofauna of one species of alga (viz. Gelidium pristoides) was examined on five shores around False Bay. Meiofaunal densities (dominated by animals between 63 um- 280 um) were significantly greater on sheltered than exposed shores. As the minimum width of Gelidium fronds exceeds that of these permanent meiofauna, and tufts offer little resistance to wave action, only those individuals living in the dense, holdfast region of plants could escape the impact of waves on exposed shores. Total meiofaunal biomass per plant remained constant irrespective of <b>shore</b> <b>type,</b> due to the greater numbers of juvenile bivalves and amphipods on exposed shores. Algal and herbivore biomass were not significantly different between <b>shore</b> <b>types</b> around False Bay and therefore, the proportional contribution by meiofauna to total secondary production on sheltered shores was predicted to be greater than on exposed shores, where the biomass of macrofaunal filter feeders was very high. It has previously been argued that differences in meiofaunal communities between plant species are a result of differential surface area, number of habitats and refugia from predation. The possible fate of meiofaunal productivity as food for higher trophic levels (fish) and the mediating role played by algal complexity was investigated in a series of carefully designed laboratory and field experiments...|$|R

The specific aims {{of this study}} were to: (1) Sample quantitatively and describe macrofaunal communities on mixed shores in False Bay; (2) make direct comparisons among both the four types of habitats and three types of shores; and (3) test the hypothesis that sand inundation increases diversity at both habitat (a-diversity) and shore (diversity) level. The biological communities of mixed shores are described in terms of species composition, trophic organisation and zonation.

The automation of the classification process allows for a faster evaluation of the presence of amphibian species in the water bodies. Three machine-learning methods (artificial neural networks, decision trees and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm) have been used to classify water bodies in Chorzów – one of 19 cities in the Upper Silesia Agglomeration.

Study sites were chosen to cover most of the typical <b>shore</b> <b>types</b> encountered on this coast (a rocky shore, an exposed sandy beach and a small estuary). Both the presence of active Phaeocystis cells and their degradation product (foam) did {{have a significant impact on}} the studied shores. The primary production and growth rates of the kelp Saccharina latissima decreased during the bloom because of a shortage of light and nutrient for the macroalgae. On sandy sediments, the benthic metabolism (community respiration and community primary production), as well as the nitrification rate, were enhanced during foam deposits, in relation with the presence of bacteria and active pelagic cells within the decaying colonies. In estuarine sediments, the most impressive impact was the formation of a crust at the sediment surface due to drying foam. This led to anoxic conditions in the surface sediment and resulted in a high mortality among the benthic community. Some organisms also tended to migrate upward and were then directly accessible to the higher trophic level represented by birds. Phaeocystis then created a shortcut in the estuarine trophic network. Most of these modifications lasted shortly and all the systems considered came back to their regular properties and activities a few weeks after the end of the bloom, except for the most impacted estuarine area...|$|R

40|$|Summary 1. Seed {{dispersal}} and germination are {{two primary}} processes influencing plant community assembly. On freshwater shores, water levels regulate both processes. However, {{it is still}} unclear how water levels, shore morphology and species traits interactively affect seed dispersal and germination, and how these interactions determine plant community assembly. We hypothesize that a drawdown water regime enhances seed establishment compared to a year-round stable water level, that this increases species richness and diversity, {{and that this is}} modulated by species traits and shore morphology. 2. Germination of 20 wetland plant species with different dispersal capacities (floating capacity expressed as seed floatation half-time) and soil moisture preferences for germination (Ellenberg F) was tested on artificial shores in 24 outdoor ponds in two complementary experiments over 8 weeks. The ‘dispersal experiment’ tested the effect of water regime on recruitment of hydrochorously dispersing seeds. The ‘seed bank experiment’ tested the effect of water regime on germination from a sown seed bank, on steep and gradual shores. 3. In the dispersal experiment, the drawdown regime increased recruitment and species richness. Longer floating species colonized a larger shoreline section. Soil moisture preference for germination did not determine colonization patterns. 4. In the seed bank experiment, the drawdown regime increased the number of seedlings on gradual sloping shores, but not on steep shores. The number of germinating seedlings corresponded to the area subjected to the drawdown regime in both <b>shore</b> <b>types.</b> Species richness was not affected by water regime or shore morphology, and species traits did not determine shoreline colonization. Most seeds germinated in moist soil conditions for all species. 5. Synthesis. A spring drawdown instead of stable water regime stimulates establishment of hydrochorously dispersing seeds in temperate wetlands, leading to higher species richness and diversity. Germination from the seed bank is more affected by water regime and shore surface than by the tested species traits. Species traits, water levels and shore morphology together determine wetland plant community assembly, with dispersal as the main driver of seedling community diversity. Water-level regulations and shore morphology can be used to influence plant communities in wetland restoration. ...|$|R
