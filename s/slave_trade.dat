5|$|Abolitionists, notably William Wilberforce, {{continued}} {{their effort to}} end the <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b> Britain passed the <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa.

5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} horrors of the <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s.

5|$|The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of the <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> {{was founded}} in 1787. The next year Parliament passed the first law {{regulating}} the <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> {{to limit the number}} of slaves per ship. Then in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners in cases in which slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> Act 1807, which abolished the African <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b> A monument to the killed slaves on Zong was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.|$|E
40|$|Polygyny {{rates are}} higher in Western Africa than in Eastern Africa. The African <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> explain this difference. More male slaves were {{exported}} in the trans-Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> from Western Africa, while more female slaves were exported in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> from Eastern Africa. The <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> led to prolonged periods of abnormal sex ratios, which impacted {{the rates of}} polygyny across Africa. In order to assess these claims, we construct a unique ethnicity-level data set linking current rates of polygyny with historical trade flow data from the African <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Our OLS estimates show {{a positive correlation between}} the trans-Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> and polygyny. An IV approach shows the relationship is causal and statistically signicant. We also provide cross-country evidence corroborating our findings. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{show that}} geography, through {{its impact on}} history, can have {{important}} effects on current economic development. The analysis focuses on the historic interaction between ruggedness and Africa’s <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Although rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, negatively affecting income globally, within Africa rugged terrain afforded protection to those being raided during the <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Since the <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> retarded subsequent economic development, within Africa ruggedness has also had a historic indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we estimate the differential effect of ruggedness on income for Africa. We show that the differential effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be explained by other factors like Africa’s unique geographic environment, and it is fully {{accounted for by the}} history of the <b>slave</b> <b>trades...</b>|$|R

5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for <b>slave</b> <b>trading</b> could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince <b>slave</b> <b>trading</b> was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States.

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There is {{controversy}} about whether geography matters {{mainly because of}} its contemporaneous impact on economic outcomes or because of its interaction with historical events. Looking at terrain ruggedness, {{we are able to}} estimate the importance of these two channels. Because rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, it has a negative direct effect on income. However, in Africa rugged terrain afforded protection to those being raided during the <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Since the <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> retarded subsequent economic development, in Africa ruggedness also has had a historical indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we find that both effects are significant statistically and that for Africa the indirect positive effect dominates the direct negative effect. Looking within Africa, we provide evidence that the indirect effect operates through the <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> We also show that the <b>slave</b> <b>trades,</b> by encouraging population concentrations in rugged areas, have also amplified the negative direct impact o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Thirty-eight years ago, Hubert Gerbeau {{discussed}} {{the problems that}} contributed to the “history of silence” surrounding <b>slave</b> <b>trading</b> in the Indian Ocean. While the publication of an expanding body of scholarship since the late 1980 s demonstrates that this silence is not as deafening as it once was, our knowledge and understanding of this traffic in chattel labor remains far from complete. This article discusses the problems surrounding attempts to reconstruct European <b>slave</b> <b>trading</b> in the Indian Ocean between 1500 and 1850. Recently created inventories of British East India Company slaving voyages during {{the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries}} and of French, Portuguese, and other voyages involving the Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and Réunion between 1670 and the 1830 s not only shed light on the nature and dynamics of British and French <b>slave</b> <b>trading</b> in the Indian Ocean, but also highlight topics and issues that future research on European <b>slave</b> <b>trading</b> within and beyond this oceanic world will need to address...|$|R
40|$|Can part of Africa’s current {{underdevelopment}} {{be explained}} by its <b>slave</b> <b>trades?</b> To explore this question empirically, I combined data from ship records with data from various historical documents reporting slave ethnicities, and construct {{estimates of the number}} of slaves exported from each country during Africa’s <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> between 1400 and 1900.

The results suggest that the relationship between slave exports and current economic performance is causal. I then test for potential channels of causality.

5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
