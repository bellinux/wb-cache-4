500|$|Octavarium begins [...] "The Root of All Evil" [...] {{with the}} final note of the band's {{previous}} album, Train of Thought with [...] "In the Name of God". Train of Thought started [...] "As I Am" [...] with the last note from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence with the title track, which in turn started with the noise that ended [...] {{at the end of}} [...] "Finally Free". Portnoy was inspired to do this thanks to the Van Halen album Women and Children First; the outro of the album's final song ended with a new riff being played which faded out. Portnoy recalled that he expected Van Halen's next album to <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> ending riff, but was disappointed when it did not. He later realized he had [...] "dug a hole where we're expected to do it every time". He solved this problem on Octavarium, where the final track ends with the beginning of the first one. This made the album a cycle in itself, allowing the band to have a clean start with their next album. At 04:52â€“05:17, there is a lyrical and musical reference to the chorus of [...] "This Dying Soul" [...] from Train of Thought.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Afghanistan, Dutton wrote an article for The Guardian newspaper, in which he opined that the NATO-led forces in the country were making a {{difference}} and the situation was improving, but that the Afghan government still required assistance. He argued that more troops did not necessarily mean more violence, saying that [...] "experience shows that after an initial spike as the insurgents are cleared out, violence reduces to much lower levels" [...] and that [...] "providing {{a sense of security}} depends on much more than physical troop presence, but it has to <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> We need sufficient troops to protect the people and convince them that Afghan government control (supported by [...] for the moment) is sufficient to prevent the return of the insurgents. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "the backbone of the NATO alliance gives the coalition a steadfastness which [...] "coalitions of the willing" [...] cannot match. It also gives unparalleled authority and legitimacy based on the consensus of its members". Dutton concluded that [...] "given the strength of this unparalleled military coalition, and the political and financial commitment to building the long-term stability of Afghanistan and the region, failure should not be contemplated". He was awarded the American Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer), and given permission to wear the decoration, [...] "in recognition of meritorious, gallant and distinguished services during coalition operations in Afghanistan".|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, {{the first}} request was sent from South Africa for {{auxiliary}} troops, {{and a commitment}} was made to send a [...] "considerable force of militia and picked yeomanry and volunteers". In early January, the reinforcements to be sent out included one service company of volunteers for each regular battalion, one complete volunteer battalion, and seven militia battalions. A large number of battalions of the Militia, which had volunteered for overseas service, were eventually sent {{out of the country}} during the war; sixty, with around 46,000 men, went to South Africa, whilst eight more served in colonial garrisons. They were employed mainly on lines of communication, and regarded as second-line troops of low quality; this was unsurprising, as they were strongly deficient in officers and heavily composed of men of 18 and 19, who would have been regarded as too young by the regular Army. The deficiencies of the militia were increased by {{the fact that many of}} its best and most experienced men had volunteered for the Militia Reserve: Of the 30,000-strong militia reserve, 13,000 were stripped from their battalions and sent overseas as drafts for regular units, while some of the 10,000 who had already travelled to South Africa with the militia were subsequently transferred to regular units while overseas. Sir Ian Hamilton commented that [...] "the men from the Militia Reserve who were in regular battalions were quite excellent... Every commanding officer I asked about them said they were first class men. The Militia battalions that had come out, had lost many of their officers, who had gone to regular battalions to replace losses in the earlier part of the war. They had also been somewhat short of officers to <b>start</b> <b>with...</b> <b>that</b> [...] was what they were best suited for under the circumstances." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{has been}} my {{conviction}} for many years that the Russian and the Englishman are as it were the complementary halves of a man. What the Russian lacks the Englishman has; what the Englishman lacks, that has the Russian. The works of Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoievsky, Tolstoi, Tchekov--the amazing direct and truthful revelations of these masters--has let me, I think, into some secrets of the Russian soul, so that the Russians I have met seem rather clearer to me than {{men and women of}} other foreign countries. For their construing I have been given what schoolboys call a crib. Only a fool pretends to knowledge--the heart of another is surely a dark forest; but the heart of a Russian seems to me a forest less dark than many, partly because the qualities and defects of a Russian impact so sharply on the perceptions of an Englishman, but partly because those great Russian novelists in whom I have delighted, possess, before all other gifts, so deep a talent for the revelation of truth. In following out this apposition of the Russian and the Englishman, one may well <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> little matter of [...] "truth." [...] The Englishman has what I would call a passion for the forms of truth; his word is his bond--nearly always; he will not tell a lie--not often; honesty, in his idiom, is the best policy. But he has little or no regard for the spirit of truth. Quite unconsciously he revels in self-deception and flies from knowledge of anything which will injure his intention to [...] "make good," [...] as Americans say. He is, before all things, a competitive soul who seeks to win rather than to understand or to [...] "live." [...] And to win, or, shall we say, to maintain to oneself the illusion of winning, one must carefully avoid seeing too much. The Russian is light hearted about the forms of truth, but revels in self-knowledge and frank self-declaration, enjoys unbottoming the abysses of his thoughts and feelings, however gloomy. In Russia time and space have no exact importance, living counts for more than dominating life, emotion is not castrated, feelings are openly indulged in; in Russia there are the extremes of cynicism, and of faith; of intellectual subtlety, and simplicity; truth has quite another significance; manners are different; what we know as [...] "good form" [...] is a meaningless shibboleth. The Russian rushes at life, drinks the cup to the dregs, then frankly admits that it has dregs, and puts up with the disillusionment. The Englishman holds the cup gingerly and sips, determined to make it last his time, not to disturb the dregs, and to die without having reached the bottom.|$|E
