40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Results {{from the}} few field {{studies that have}} tried to relate <b>seston</b> taxonomic and fatty acid (FA) composition suggest that phytoplankton composition only partially explains <b>seston</b> FA composition. However, in these studies, the heterotrophic components of <b>seston</b> (i. e. bacteria and heterotrophic protists) have not been accounted for. 2. The general premise {{of this article was}} that including the contribution of heterotrophs to <b>seston</b> biomass can improve understanding of the variability in <b>seston</b> FA composition. This was tested for an oligotrophic clearwater lake, in which the taxonomic and FA compositions of <b>seston,</b> fractionated into three size classes, were monitored every 2 weeks over a growth season. The relationship between <b>seston</b> taxonomic and FA composition was studied using canonical correlation analyses. 3. Because of their relative richness in branched FA and lack of highly unsaturated FAs (HUFA) compared to autotrophs and other protists, the contribution of bacteria to <b>seston</b> biomass was shown to explain {{an important part of the}} differences in FA composition between the different <b>seston</b> size classes. Phytoplankton seasonal succession also affected the FA composition of <b>seston</b> but only for size classes that were dominated by autotrophs. 4.

40|$|Abstract. Lakes were {{surveyed}} {{to assess the}} potential patterns of latitudinal variation in carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry of lower food web components. Thirty-four lakes {{were surveyed}} at an arctic latitude (68 ° 38 N, 149 ° 38 W) and 10 lakes at a temperate latitude (46 ° 13 N, 89 ° 32 W) during 1997. The temperate data set was augmented with earlier survey results employing similar methods. It was hypothesized that differences in environmental variables across latitude would cause differences in community C:N:P ratios, leading to differences in trophic interactions. Physical measurements (light, temperature), <b>seston</b> and zooplankton were collected from each lake. <b>Seston</b> and zooplankton were analyzed for C, N and P content, and zooplankton were counted and measured for biomass estimates. The degree of trophic interaction between <b>seston</b> and zooplankton was assessed by (i) measuring elemental imbalances between <b>seston</b> and zooplankton and (ii) calculating the potential recycling ratio by the zooplankton community available for <b>seston.</b> <b>Seston</b> C:nutrient, but not N:P, ratios were higher in temperate than arctic lakes. Conversely, arctic zooplankton had higher C:nutrient, but not N:P, ratios than zooplankton in temperate lakes. Elemental imbalances were greater in temperate than in arctic lakes, but N:P stoichiometry of potential zooplankton recycling was nearly identical between the two latitudes. Zooplankton community C:N:P ratios were not related to either latitude or <b>seston</b> C:N:P. In accordance with stoichiometric theory, relative abun-dances of calanoid copepods were positively correlated with <b>seston</b> C:N in temperate lakes. Addition-ally, relative abundances of Daphnia were negatively correlated with <b>seston</b> C:N ratios in temperate and arctic lakes, and positively correlated with N:P ratios in the arctic.

Growth bioassays tested the influence of natural <b>seston</b> fractions, separated by net filtration, on cladocerans. The treatments were: (1) total <b>seston</b> plus Scenedesmus spinosus (1 mg C.

The intrinsic rates of natural increase were higher for Moina micrura and Daphnia ambigua at 27 degrees C compared to 17 degrees C. The age at first reproduction of both species was delayed at 17 degrees C. Growth rates and fecundity of M. micrura {{were higher in the}} <b>seston</b> fraction 36 mu m.

However, no changes in phytoplankton abundance or species composition were noted, although <b>seston</b> carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratios increased. Filamentous cyanobacteria and detritus continued to dominate the <b>seston.</b> Moreover, planktivorous fish were very abundant. Relationships between zooplankton abundance and <b>seston</b> abundance and stoichiometry (C:P and carbon:nitrogen ratios) were analyzed using data collected during 9 yr of intensive study of the three lakes. Analysis based on annual means shows surprisingly strong and consistent inverse relationships between Daphnia abundance and the <b>seston</b> C:P ratio {{for two of the}} three lakes. In these two lakes (Loosdrecht and Vuntus Lakes), the annual mean abundance of Daphnia cucullata ranged from 104 to 0. 7 individuals L- 1 over a range in mean <b>seston</b> C:P ratios from about 250 to 500 (molar). In the third lake, Breukeleveen, Daphnia abundance was higher for a given <b>seston</b> C:P ratio, especially during the 2 yr following a biomanipulation project in this lake. Analysis of <b>seston</b> C:P ratios and Daphnia abundance in individual samples provides further evidence that high <b>seston</b> C:P ratios constrained Daphnia abundance in all three lakes. In contrast to Daphnia, the abundances of zooplankters with low P requirements, including Bosmina spp. and cyclopoid copepods, show little relationship to <b>seston</b> C:P ratios.

40|$|AbstractDuring two {{sampling}} seasons {{we analyzed}} on weekly basis fatty acid (FA) composition of <b>seston</b> fraction 130 μm, and compared them using a multivariate canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Besides, we evaluated a possible impact of water temperature and inorganic nutrients on FA {{composition of the}} <b>seston</b> and the zooplankton. In spite of significant differences in percentages of several individual FAs, we found very strong canonical correlation (cross-correlation, 1 -week lag) between FA composition of the <b>seston</b> and the zooplankton. The most important factor, providing the overall canonical cross-correlation between FA profiles of the <b>seston</b> and the zooplankton fractions was eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 ω 3, EPA). FA composition of the zooplankton fraction had comparatively poor correlations with taxonomic composition of the zooplankton. Thus, seasonal variations of FA composition of the zooplankton were determined primarily by seasonal changes in FA composition of the <b>seston,</b> rather than by taxonomic differences of FA profiles between rotifers, cyclopoids and cladocerans. FA composition of the <b>seston</b> was strongly affected by its taxonomic composition, namely by that of phytoplankton. According to CCA, the highest factor loadings pertained to diatoms interacting with their marker acids, including EPA, and cyanobacteria and greens, interacting with their marker acids. Ciliates and small rotifers composed considerable and sometimes {{major part of the}} <b>seston</b> biomass, but according to CCA their contributions to seasonal variations of the total FA profile of the <b>seston</b> were insignificant. This finding indirectly support the conclusion of the other authors, that the main source of FAs presented in ciliates and rotifers must be sought in algae and that they do not modify FA composition of food consumed, apart from repackaging it. Water temperature was the principal environmental parameter which drove the overall variations of FA composition. Factor loadings for the inorganic nutrients were comparatively negligible.

With the use of. 2, 000 observations of the chemistry of particulate matter from small and large lakes, as well as nearand off-shore marine environments, {{we found that the}} best model to describe <b>seston</b> stoichiometry depended on the scale of analysis. We also found that there were better estimates for <b>seston</b> chemistry than the classical ratio for all habitats, whether freshwater or marine. Across the entire data set, a constant proportionality of C 166 :N 20 :P 1 (6 error) described the data, which implies higher C sequestration per unit of N and P in surface waters than given in the classical ratio. At a regional scale, however, C: P and C: N often declined with increasing <b>seston</b> abundance, rejecting a constant ratio model. Within both freshwater and marine habitats, higher <b>seston</b> abundance is often associated with lower C: P and C: N ratios (higher nutrient content). The difference in appropriateness of the constant ratio model with respect to the entire data compared with subsets of the data indicates a scale dependence in stoichiometric relationships in <b>seston</b> C: N: P ratios. Given these consistent shifts in <b>seston</b> chemistry with particle abundance, the narrower variation in <b>seston</b> chemistry associated with marine <b>seston</b> chemistry could occur because of a reduced range of particulate nutrient concentration.
