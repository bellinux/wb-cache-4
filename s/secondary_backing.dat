5000|$|Older surfaces, such as double jute-backed {{carpets and}} loose rugs with natural {{foundation}} yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. [...] However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally tear seams or uproot strips. [...] Newer carpets, such as with synthetic backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as delamination where the <b>secondary</b> <b>backing</b> becomes unstuck {{from the primary}} backing, that may need a certified carpet inspector to determine.|$|E

50|$|Back pain in a horse may {{be caused}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. Saddle fit, poor riding technique, lack of conditioning, overwork, accidents, or {{lameness}} can all contribute to back pain. A saddle that is not fitted properly on the horse may lead to immediate, acute pain, or chronic, long-term damage. A saddle of ill fit will repeatedly bruise, pinch, or rub the underlying soft tissue or spinal processes. A horse that is not athletically fit may also experience back pain. Abrupt changes in work, footing, or terrain can make even a fit horse suffer soreness. Accidents, missteps, or awkward jumps all lend themselves to strain. Compensating for any type of limb, joint, or hoof injury can make a horse put extra stress on its back, which can lead to back problems in addition to lameness if not treated promptly. A rider with a poor seat can put abnormal pressure directly on a horse's back, or may indirectly cause back pain in other ways: An ill-fitting bit and bridle or bad hands, resulting in mouth pain, can cause <b>secondary</b> <b>back</b> pain as the horse lifts its neck and stresses its back to avoid the pressure to the mouth.|$|R
