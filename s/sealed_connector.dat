40|$|Background: The {{practice}} of endotracheal suctioning of ventilator treated patients {{is necessary to}} remove secretions to prevent obstruction of the endotracheal-tracheal tube and lower airways. This very common procedure creates a large variety of heart-lung interferences. The closed system enables ventilation during suctioning, avoiding disconnection from the ventilator. Thus, the lesser side-effects of the closed suction system have been thoroughly evaluated rather than its effectiveness of secretion removal. Qualitative and semi-quantitative {{studies have indicated that}} the effectiveness of the closed system is inferior to the open one. Optimising the side-effects and effectiveness of the suction procedure is essential to preserve oxygenation in critically ill patients. This also requires adequate monitoring techniques. Suctioning through a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) via a tight <b>seal</b> <b>connector</b> is another form of closed suctioning. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effectiveness and side-effects of open and closed suctioning manoeuvres, using novel lung-monitoring techniques. Methods: Studies were performed in mechanical lung models, an experimental model of acute lung injury (ALI) in pigs and in ALI patients. Effectiveness of secretion removal was evaluated by weighing the suction system before and after suctioning of gel in a transparent trachea. In ALI model and patients, airway pressure and lung mechanics were measured via a tracheal catheter. A modified N 2 wash-out/wash-in method was used for functional residual capacity (FRC) measurements. Electric impedance tomography (EIT) was used to monitor global and regional lung volume changes during different suction manoeuvres. Results: In a mechanical lung, closed suction during volume control ventilation caused high intrinsic PEEP levels at insertion of the catheter. Pressure control ventilation (PCV) produced less intrinsic PEEP. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode offered the least intrinsic PEEP during insertion of the catheter and least sub-atmospheric pressure during suctioning. Open suctioning and closed suctioning during CPAP of 0 cmH 2 O was about five times more effective in regaining gel from an artificial trachea than closed suctioning during PCV or CPAP of 10 cmH 2 O. In lavaged lungs side-effects were considerable less during closed suction with positive pressure ventilation than during open suction. Closed system suctioning during CPAP of 0 cmH 2 O caused side-effects similar to open suctioning. At disconnection FRC decreased with about 50 % of baseline value and further 20 % during open suctioning. Regional compliance deteriorated most in the dorsal parts of the lavaged lung. Post-suction restitution of lung volume and compliance was somewhat slower during pressure controlled - than during volume controlled ventilation, both in experimental lung injury and in some ALI patients. Bronchoscopic suction through a tight <b>seal</b> <b>connector</b> in a mechanical lung and in ventilator treated ALI patients caused marked lung volume reduction, especially if the endotracheal tube was too small in relation to the thickness of the bronchoscope. Conclusions: New monitoring strategies such as continuous, bedside FRC measurements with EIT technique and the nitrogen washout/washin method could contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the suctioning induced lung collapse and give us knowledge on how to minimize its negative effects, hence develop better clinical routines for handling them. The largest loss of lung volume takes place already at disconnection of the ventilator prior to suctioning. The dorsal regions of lavaged lungs are most affected by disconnection and suctioning. Closed system suctioning prevents lung collapse but is less efficient in removing secretions. Volume control ventilation in the post-suctioning period is a way of recruiting collapsed lung tissue. Bronchoscopic suctioning can cause severe lung collapse, although considered a closed system...|$|R

40|$|Safety measure {{design and}} {{accident}} predictive and prevention strategies are {{critical in the}} offshore process. The key area of concern in an offshore facility is a major event such as a fire, an explosion {{and the release of}} hazardous materials. The recent BP Transocean Deepwater Horizon accident is an example of safety protocols either being inadequate or response being inefficient and ineffective. Understanding the consequences of major release events is a key step in safety measure design and consequence assessment of major events. The assessment includes the definition of different release scenarios, release modeling, event modeling, and damage/loss quantification. The consequence assessment is an important step of risk estimation and is subsequently used to design safety measures. [...] To address release scenario modeling, a new methodology is developed in the current study to revise the emission factor estimation methods earlier developed by USEPA. Applying a non-linear regression approach, a new set of equations is introduced to estimate emission rates. Having ΔAIC values of more than 10, in the categories of pump <b>seals,</b> <b>connectors,</b> flanges and others, the equations replace USEPA's proposed correlation equations for oil and gas facilities.

In 2010, the cable strain relief of the HM II device was improved (132 patients with old and 79 with new) and sealed grafts were introduced (68 patients with <b>sealed</b> inflow <b>connector</b> and outflow graft and 125 without). In 2011, titanium sintering of the inflow cannula of HW pumps was introduced (137 patients with a non-sintered and 210 with a sintered inflow cannula).

In cable connector assemblies, the use of manufacturing processes and materials that are resistant to cathodic {{delamination failure}}s is highly desirable. Also, {{there is a need for}} an accelerated testing regime for assessing the resistance of polymer-to-metal composites to cathodic delamination failures. Cable connector assemblies are employed in marine environments for structural terminations and circuit interconnection of electrical power and signal cabling systems. They are found on offshore sea beds, ROV’s, vessels and submarines and are prone to cathodic delamination related failures particularly when the cable assemblies are coupled to dissimilar metal appurtenances in seawater, e. g., zinc anodes.

40|$|Regolith {{is present}} on most {{planetary}} surfaces such as Earth's moon, Mars, and Asteroids. If human crews and robotic machinery are {{to operate on}} these regolith covered surfaces, they must face the consequences of interacting with regolith fines which consist of particles below 100 microns in diameter down to as small as submicron scale particles. Such fine dust will intrude into mechanisms and interfaces causing a variety of problems such as contamination of clean fluid lines, jamming of mechanisms and damaging <b>connector</b> <b>seals</b> and couplings. Since multiple elements must be assembled in space for system level functionality, it will be inevitable that interfaces will be necessary for structural connections, and to pass commodities such as cryogenic liquid propellants, purge and buffer gases, water, breathing air, pressurizing gases, heat exchange fluids, power and data. When fine regolith dust {{is present in the}} environment it can be lofted into interfaces where it can compromise the utility of the interface by preventing the connections from being successfully mated, or by inducing fluid leaks or degradation of power and data transmission.

40|$|Abstract Background Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{of patients with}} implanted cardiac pacemakers is generally contraindicated but some clinicians condone scanning certain patients. We assessed the risk of inducing unintended cardiac stimulation by measuring electric fields (E) induced near lead tips by a simulated MRI gradient system. The objectives {{of this study are}} to map magnetically induced E near distal tips of leads in a saline tank to determine the spatial distribution and magnitude of E and compare them with E induced by a pacemaker pulse generator (PG). Methods We mapped magnetically induced E with 0. 1 mm resolution as close as 1 mm from lead tips. We used probes with two straight electrodes (e. g. wire diameter of 0. 2 mm separated by 0. 9 mm). We generated magnetic flux density (B) with a Helmholtz coil throughout 0. 6 % saline in a 24 cm diameter tank with (dB/dt) of 1 T/sec (1 kHz sinusoidal waveform). Separately, we measured E near the tip of leads when connected to a PG set to a unipolar mode. Measurements were non-invasive (not altering the leads or PG under study). Results When scaled to 30 T/s (a clinically relevant value), magnetically-induced E exceeded the E produced by a PG. The magnetically-induced E only occurred when B was coincident with or within 15 msec of implantable pacemaker's pulse. Conclusions Potentially hazardous situations are possible during an MR scan due to gradient fields. Unintended stimulation can be induced via abandoned leads and leads connected to a pulse generator with loss of hermetic <b>seal</b> at the <b>connector.</b> Also, pacemaker-dependent patients can receive drastically altered pacing pulses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Laser-induced damage {{mechanisms}} {{that can occur}} during high-intensity fiber transmission have been under study {{for a number of}} years. Our particular interest in laser initiation of explosives has led us to examine damage processes associated with the transmission of Q-switched, Nd:YAG pulses at 1. 06 {micro}m through step-index, multimode, fused silica fiber. Laser breakdown at the fiber entrance face is often the first process to limit fiber transmission but catastrophic damage can also occur at either fiber end face, within the initial entry segment of the fiber, and at other internal sites along the fiber path. Past studies have examined how these various damage mechanisms depend upon fiber end-face preparation, fiber fixturing and routing, laser characteristics, and laser-to-fiber injection optics. In some applications of interest, however, a fiber transmission system may spend years in storage before it is used. Consequently, an important additional issue for these applications is whether or not there are aging processes that can result in lower damage thresholds over time. Fiber end-face contamination would certainly lower breakdown and damage thresholds at these surfaces, but careful design of hermetic <b>seals</b> in <b>connectors</b> and other end-face fixtures can minimize this possibility. A more subtle possibility would be a process for the slow growth of internal defects that could lead to lower thresholds for internal damage. In the current study, two approaches to stimulating the growth of internal defects were used in an attempt to produce observable changes in internal damage thresholds. In the first approach test fibers were subjected to a very high tensile stress for a time sufficient for some fraction to fail from static fatigue. In the second approach, test fibers were subjected to a combination of high tensile stress and large, cyclic temperature variations. Both of these approaches were rather arbitrary {{due to the lack of}} an established growth mechanism for internal defects. Damage characteristics obtained from fibers subjected to each of these aging environments were compared to results from fresh fibers tested under identical conditions. A surprising result was that internal damage was not observed in any of the tested fibers. Only breakdown at the fiber entrance face and catastrophic damage at both end faces were observed. Fiber end faces were not sealed during the accelerated aging environments, and thresholds at these faces were significantly lower in the aged fibers. However, most fibers transmitted relatively high pulse energies before damaging, and a large fraction never damaged before we reached the limits of our test laser. The absence of any observable affect on internal damage thresholds is encouraging, but the current results do not rule out the possibility that some other approach to accelerated aging could reveal a growth mechanism for internal defects...|$|R
