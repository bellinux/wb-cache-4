40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of the Solar Array Flight Experiment (SAFE) structure during deployment and retraction are investigated. The SAFE structure consists of a deployable mast with an attached <b>solar</b> <b>blanket</b> designed with accordion type folds to permit packaging in a small volume. The planar form of the blanket geometry during deployment is maintained by a blanket tension/guidewire system. Structurally, the mast is modeled as an Euler beam column with inplane and out of plane bending and finite torsional stiffness. For out of plane motion, the blanket is modeled as a distributed mass uniformly supported by the three guidewires. For inplane motion the blanket displacements are assumed to vary linearly from the mast base to the mast tip. The mathematical model uses a virtual work formulation, required because the axial loading on the mast is nonconservative, combined with assumed beam modes to derive the differential equations of motion. Consideration of the time dependent boundary conditions results in an infinite set of ODE with time dependent coefficients. Finally, correlation of mast tip accelerations to mast base bending moments for specified modal motions are indicated...|$|E

40|$|The Space Station Freedom Power System {{will make}} {{extensive}} use of photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The phase 1 power system consists of two PV power modules each capable of delivering 37. 5 KW of conditioned power to the user. Each PV module consists of two solar arrays. Each solar array {{is made up of}} two solar blankets. Each <b>solar</b> <b>blanket</b> contains 82 PV panels. The PV power modules provide a 160 V nominal operating voltage.

40|$|The Flexible Array Concentrator Technology (FACT) is a lightweight, {{high-performance}} reflective concentrator blanket assembly {{that can}} be used on flexible <b>solar</b> array <b>blankets.</b> The FACT concentrator replaces every other row of solar cells on a <b>solar</b> array <b>blanket,</b> significantly reducing the cost of the array. The modular design is highly scalable for the array system designer, and exhibits compact stowage, good off-pointing acceptance, and mass/cost savings. The assembly s relatively low concentration ratio, accompanied by a large radiative area, provides for a low cell operating temperature, and eliminates many of the thermal problems inherent in high-concentration-ratio designs. Unlike other reflector technologies, the FACT concentrator modules function on both z-fold and rolled flexible <b>solar</b> array <b>blankets,</b> as well as rigid array systems. Mega-ROSA (Mega Roll-Out Solar Array) is a new, highly modularized and extremely scalable version of ROSA that provides immense power level range capability from 100 kW to several MW in size. Mega-ROSA will enable extremely high-power spacecraft and SEP-powered missions, including space-tug and largescale planetary science and lunar/asteroid exploration missions. Mega-ROSA's inherent broad power scalability is achieved while retaining ROSA s solar array performance metrics and missionenabling features for lightweight, compact stowage volume and affordability. This innovation will enable future ultra-high-power missions through lowcost (25 to 50 % cost savings, depending on PV and blanket technology), lightweight, high specific power (greater than 200 to 400 Watts per kilogram BOL (beginning-of-life) at the wing level depending on PV and blanket technology), compact stowage volume (greater than 50 kilowatts per cubic meter for very large arrays), high reliability, platform simplicity (low failure modes), high deployed strength/stiffness when scaled to huge sizes, and high-voltage operation capability. Mega-ROSA is adaptable to all photovoltaic and concentrator flexible blanket technologies, and can readily accommodate standard multijunction and emerging ultra-lightweight IMM (inverted metamorphic) photovoltaic flexible blanket assemblies, as well as ENTECHs Stretched Lens Array (SLA) and DSSs (Deployable Space Systems) FACT, which allows for cost reduction at the array level...|$|R
