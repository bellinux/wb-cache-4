2500|$|Spoken {{consent of}} the woman is only {{required}} if {{she is not a}} virgin and her wali is neither her father nor her paternal grandfather. But a virgin may not be married off without her permission. If she is too shy to express her opinion her silence will be considered as implicit agreement [...] The wali, who can force a bride against her outspoken will into marriage, is called wali mujbir, according to [...] "The Encyclopaedia of Islam". If the woman was forced into a marriage, without the above-mentioned conditions, according to the Hanafi school of Islamic law the decision can be revoked, when the bride comes of age. Binti Khudham says that when she became a widow her father solemnized her marriage. She did not like the decision <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to Muhammad, who gave her permission to revoke her marriage. Hence, forced marriages are against Islamic teachings if the woman is a virgin, and those forced into marriages before they have come of age have the right to contest them once they do.|$|E
