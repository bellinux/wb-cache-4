40|$|The Iberian Pyrite Belt is an Upper Paleozoic {{succession}} {{which has}} been divided into the Phyllite-Quartzite Group, the Volcanic-Sliceous Complex and the Culm Group in ascending order from base to the top. The contacts among them are conformable. These Groups are tightly folded and metamorphosed un-der low-grade conditions during Hercynian times. The first stage folds of the Volcanic-Siliceous Complex and the Culm Group are associate with slaty cleavages (S 1), while the Phyllite-Quartzite Group is asso-ciate with <b>schistosities</b> (S 1). Fold analysis using cleavages and minoe folds has been utilized {{in the analysis of}} the stratigraphy. This led to systematic horizontal collection of specimens (pelitic rocks). S 1 texture is defined by paralled alignment of secondary platy minerals which tend to grow larger and together, forming zonal domains toward the Phyllite-Quartzite Group. The clay matrices change to recrystallized quartz toward the Phyllite Quartzite Group. Textural modifications are evidenced by gradational changes from slaty cleavages to <b>schistosities.</b> This shows that recrystallization is the important deformation mecha-nism responsible for S 1 development. It also reflects that the deformation was contemporaneous with metamorphism...|$|R
50|$|Two major deformational phases {{with the}} {{development}} of <b>schistosities</b> (Upper Albian till Lower Cenomanian and Santonian till Maastrichtian) affected the pyrenean domain during the Upper Cretaceous expressing themselves as unconformities in the sedimentary record. The flysch basin was shortened and at the northern edge of Iberia, an orogenic wedge formed that moved slowly into the northern foreland. As a consequence, the flysch basin receiving the erosional products from the wedge was forced to migrate to the north too (changeover during the Santonian of the centre of subsidence from the North Pyrenean Basin to the Subpyrenean Basin). The Subpyrenean Basin was consequently filled in by 1000 to 4000 m of flysch à fucoides.|$|R
50|$|The {{far-reaching}} {{effects of}} the Variscan orogeny influenced the pyrenean domain in many ways. Of prime importance were the compressional stresses that folded the Paleozoic sediments. Several fold generations developed, sometimes superimposing each other. Associated with the folds are <b>schistosities.</b> The Paleozoic sediments and its Precambrian basement were also metamorphosed under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions (HP/LT). In places anatexis was reached, an example being the melting of some Precambrian gneisses of the Prevariscan basement together with their enveloping mica schists. Another important consequence of the orogeny was late-orogenic magmatism emplacing granitoids (granodiorites and biotite granites) of mainly acid but occasionally also of basic composition. Amongst these granitoids are deep-seated, rather diffuse, intrusive bodies associated with migmatites, yet also typical, well-defined plutons often rising into the cores of anticlines within the Variscan fold-belt. The main magmatism perdured from 310-270 million years (late Pennsylvanian and early Permian cooling ages). A good example for the main magmatism is the 280 million years old Maladeta granodiorite.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a general}} field petrologic term for {{metamorphic}} or altered mafic volcanic rock. A greenstone is sometimes a greenschist but can also be rock types without any <b>schistosity,</b> especially metabasalt (spilite or picrite). The green is due to abundant green chlorite, actinolite and epidote minerals that dominate the rock. However, basalts may remain quite black if primary pyroxene does not revert to chlorite or actinolite. To qualify for the name a rock must also exhibit <b>schistosity</b> or some foliation or layering.

40|$|The Crystalline Nappe of the High Himalayan Crystalline {{has been}} {{examined}} along the Kulu Valley and its vicinity (Mandi-Khoksar transect). This nappe {{was believed to}} have undergone deformation related only to its transport towards the SW essentially during the `'Main Central Thrust event''. New data {{has led to the}} conclusion that during the Himalayan orogeny, two distinctive phases, related to two opposite transport directions, characterize the evolution of this part of the chain, before the creation of the late NE-vergent backfolding. The first phase corresponds to an early NE-vergent folding and thrusting, creating the Tandi Syncline and the NE-oriented Shikar Beh Nappe stack, with a displacement amplitude of about 50 km. Two <b>schistosities,</b> together with a strong stretching lineation are developed at a deep tectonic level under amphibolite facies conditions (kyanite-staurolite-garnet-two mica schists). At a higher tectonic level and {{in the southern part of}} the section (Tandy Syncline and southern Kulu Valley between Kulu and Mandi) one or two <b>schistosities</b> are developed in the greenschist facies grade rocks (garnet-biotite and biotite schists). These structures and the associated Barrovian type metamorphism are all related to the NE-verging Shikar Beh Nappe. The creation of the NE-verging Shikar Beh Nappe may be explained by the reactivation of a SW dipping listric normal fault of the N Indian flexural passive margin, during the early stages of the Himalayan orogeny. In the second phase, the still hot metamorphic rocks of the Shikar Beh Nappe were folded and thrust towards the SW (mainly along the MBT and the MCT with a displacement in excess of 100 km) onto the cold, low-grade metamorphic rocks of the Larji-Kulu-Rampur Window or, near Mandi, on the non-metamorphic sandstones of the Ganges Molasse (Siwaliks). Sense of shear criteria and a strong NE-SW stretching-lineation indicate that the Crystalline Nappe has been overthrusted towards the SW. Thermometry on synkinematically crystallised garnet-biotite and garnet-hornblende pairs reveals the lower amphibolite facies temperature conditions related to the Crystalline Nappe formation. From the muscovite and biotite Rb-Sr cooling ages, the Shikar Beh Nappe emplacement occurred before 32 Ma and the southwestward thrusting of the Crystalline Nappe began before 21 Ma. Our model involving two opposite directions of thrusting goes against the conventional idea of only one main SW-oriented transport direction in the High Himalayan Crystalline Nappes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Chouichiat peraluminous structure, {{located in}} the {{northern}} domain of the Bou Azzer – El Graara (Central Anti-Atlas, Morocco), outcrops as a discontinuous whitish ridge 10 to 60 m wide extending E–W for more than 2 km. This structure coincides with a large reverse-sense steeply dipping shear corridor, marked by penetrative <b>schistosities</b> and folds. The Chouichiat structure displays a strong zoning due to the combined effects of metamorphism, hydrothermal alteration, and deformation of a rhyodacite protolith. It has 1) a central quartz–pyrophyllite zone, surrounded on both sides by 2) a pyrophyllite–quartz -rich proximal zone with small amounts of diaspore, kaolinite and zunyite, and spots of hematite, and 3) a distal pyrophyllite zone with quartz–pyrophyllite in smaller amounts, common hematite and diaspore. The zoning expresses the gradual transformation of rhyodacite to pyrophyllitic rocks, enhanced {{by the development of}} the shear zone, which has strongly increased the permeability owing to fluid–rock reaction. Such an interaction is represented by a set of reactions, the most important of which is the hydrolysis of white mica in the rhyodacite to produce pyrophyllite: 2 KAl 2 AlSi 3 O 10 (OH) 2 + 6 SiO 2 + 2 H+ ! 3 Al 2 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 + 2 K+. A decrease in temperature and an increase in silica activity led to replacement of early diaspore by pyrophyllite. Zunyite crystallized later, mostly at the interface between proximal and distal zones, together with spectacular rosettes of fibroradial hematite. The main kaolinite – pyrophyllite – quartz assemblage likely was generated around 273 ° ± 10 °C and 1 kbar. Mass-balance calculations indicate a significant leaching of mobile elements, promoting the residual concentration of Al, and a substantial addition of silica, both due to hydrolysis of aluminum silicates. The pyrophyllite – diaspore – zunyite assemblage is characteristic of hydrothermally altered aluminous felsic volcanic rocks and very similar to rocks altered by acidic fluid associated with gold-bearing epithermal ore deposits...|$|R
40|$|Excellent {{inclusion}} {{trails in}} a sample containing both staurolite and andalusite porphyroblasts are used to demonstrate techniques that allow the intimate relationships between deformation and porphyroblast growth to be recognized, described in detail and understood. This approach reveals three main phases of growth of both mineral phases, some of which was demonstrably synchronous, during three tectonic events. Each main period of growth occurred {{during the early stages}} of three deformations that were successively near orthogonal. However, extra periods are distinguishable in andalusite in some of these events because this phase occurs as clusters of large crystals that vary in orientation by 2 ° to > 10 °. All foliations defined by all inclusion trails within every porphyroblast inflect/intersect about an axis trending at 025 ° (called a FIA). This indicates that the direction of the horizontal component of bulk shortening was identical for the first and third of the three deformations recorded by porphyroblast growth. Portions of sigmoidal to slightly spiral-shaped inclusion trails in most porphyroblast clusters locally diverge in opposite directions due to overprinting orthogonal bulk shortening typical of that which forms millipede geometries. These microstructures confirm the role of coaxial bulk shortening in initiating porphyroblast growth in an environment that locally becomes strongly non-coaxial as the deformation intensifies in the same event. In this sample, increasing non-coaxiality as the deformation intensified resulted in the same asymmetry {{for each of the three}} events and thus an overall spiral-like shape. Differing stages in the development of these bulk-shortening geometries preserved in adjacent or touching phases negate any role for porphyroblast rotation during ductile deformation. Andalusite and staurolite grew without any inter-reaction in locations where they lie in contact. This multiply repeated growth behaviour initiated within zones of spatially partitioned crenulation deformation of pre-existing foliations. This varied slightly in timing and in the subsequent development of successive surrounding foliations from location to location over distances around 5 mm. Growth ceased adjacent to any zone where metamorphic differentiation associated with the development of new foliations initiated. This also varied in timing locally as a result of migrating and/or shifting partitioning of the deformation at similar to smaller scales. A pseudosection for the bulk composition of this sample shows that andalusite and staurolite grow simultaneously only over a very tightly constrained range of P–T conditions. Yet these occurred for at least three tectonic events, two of which produced strong <b>schistosities.</b> This required bulk coaxial orogen-scale deformation with slight crustal thickening during two periods of bulk horizontal shortening balanced by gravitational collapse in the intervening event...|$|R

40|$|The Keskarrah Bay area, Point Lake, N. W. T. is {{underlain}} by Archean {{rocks of}} the Slave Province that form two distinct lithotectonic elements: a sialic basement terrane, consisting of high-grade gneisses and granodiorite, and a supracrustal terrane, {{known as the}} Itchen Lake region supracrustal belt, comprising metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Yellowknife Supergroup. [...] Conditions of regional metamorphism are documented mainly from metamorphic mineral assemblages in turbidites, which comprise greywacke-mudstone and subordinate iron formation and Fe-rich sediments. The sequential development of the key metamorphic index minerals chlorite, biotite, cordierite, andalusite and sillimanite in pelitic lithologies and garnet, staurolite or Ca and Fe-rich clino-amphibole in Fe-rich sediments occurred dominantly through continuous rather than discontinuous metamorphic reactions. The measured trends of increasing Mg:Fe ratios of the index minerals (cordierite > muscovite > chlorite > biotite > amphibole > staurolite > garnet) are used to demonstrate changes in AFM topology, from which the continuous reactions are interpreted. [...] The pattern of metamorphic isograds is attributed to a single, progressive low pressure regional metamorphic event. Metamorphic grade increases both eastwards towards the Yamba batholith, and westwards towards the basement gneisses and the Pointless batholith. Prograde metamorphism in the supracrustal rocks was synchronous with retrograde metamorphism in the basement terrane. Peak metamorphic conditions, which reached a maximum of about 600 °C +/- 50 °C and 4. 0 +/- 1. 6 kbar, were attained {{toward the end of}} deformation. The P-T distribution throughout the area is consistent with the presence of a distant thermal dome that formed in the area of eventual batholith emplacement. [...] Three or possibly four phases of deformation have been recognized in the supracrustal terrane. Proximity to basement is considered to have had an influence on the orientation and intensity of structures developed during the first two phases of deformation. East-west trending isoclinal folds (F₁) and a penetrative S₁ fabric produced during D₁ are recognized mainly along {{the western edge of the}} supracrustal belt. D₂ resulted in the formation of north-south trending main phase F₂ folds that refold F₁ and are overturned to the west, and an S₂ foliation, both of which predominate throughout much of the map area. Post-D₂ deformations produced crenulations of the S₂ foliation, an L-S fabric defined by elongate biotite porphyroblasts and southeast- and northeast-trending biotite <b>schistosities</b> (tentatively designated S₃ and S₄). These fabrics, which are well developed in central and eastern exposures of the metaturbidites, are unrelated to large scale folding. [...] The polyphase deformation (Dx) in the basement terrane that led to the formation of the basement gneisses predated deposition of the Yellowknife Supergroup. After deposition of the Yellowknife Supergroup, the basement gneisses adjacent to the supracrustal rocks were deformed by north-trending mylonitic foliations and large scale folds, which are correlated with S₂ and F₂ respectively in the supracrustals. West-verging recumbent folds (pre-D₂?) in the gneisses may indicate the formation of nappes, which may have also affected the supracrustal rocks. [...] The westward overturning of main phase F₂ folds in the supracrustal terrane is towards basement. A similar relationship is observed in parts of the southern Slave Province, thus the formation of those folds represents a major tectonic event in the slave Province. The suggested deformational history of the Itchen Lake region supracrustal rocks is that of a west-verqing fold-and-thrust belt...|$|R

[...] The Cape Ray Fault cuts through an area of tectonic complexity in southwestern Newfoundland. The fault occurs within the Windsor Point Group, a northeasterly-striking, intermixed sequence of felsic and mafic pyroclastic/volcaniclastic and associated sedimentary rocks, which is centrally located between a tonalitic terrane to the northwest (the Cape Ray Granite) and an amphibolite facies gneiss unit, with synkinematic granite, to the southeast (the Port aux Basques Complex). The tonalite contains isolated metagabbroic remnants of an ophiolite sequence (the Long Range Mafic/Ultramafic Complex). The Windsor Point Group contains tonalitic fragments in the ignimbritic rhyolite at its base, and is in tectonic contact with the gneiss unit, wherein the gneiss is extensively retrogressed. The Windowglass Hill Granite intrude the Windsor Point Group in the northeastern part of the zone. Both sides of the fault zone were intruded by post-tectonic granites (the Strawberry Granite on the northwestern side and Isle aux Morts Brook Granite on the southeast). [...] Geochronological determinations indicate that the tonalitic terrane is Ordovician in age, the Windsor Point Group and Windowglass Hill Granite are late Devonian, and the Strawberry/Isle aux Morts Brook Granites are early Carboniferous. [...] Isograds defined in the Windsor Point Group indicate that metamorphic grade increases from lower to upper greenschist facies towards the SE, and that pressures are rather low.

D 2 effected crenulation cleavages and assymmetrical, open to tight, F 2 folds. D 3 resulted in conjugate kink folding. D 1 also produced mylonites within the Windsor Point Group.

Newly formed metamorphic minerals are preferably arranged along this direction, although their lineations stray between N 110 and N 135. Furthermore the lineations are accompanied by microfolds, whose axes yet again follow the N 110-direction.|$|E
50|$|The entire Thiviers-Payzac Unit is intensively folded. Similar {{as in the}} Génis Unit {{the folding}} is tight and upright and the {{wavelength}} even somewhat shorter (100 to 125 metres, but can increase {{in the south to}} about 200 metres). The more or less horizontal fold axes strike WNW-ESE (N 110, west of the Loyre river). The stratification (S0) is steeply inclined (around 80 °) and north or south dipping. Parallel to the folds axial plane a recognisable <b>schistosity</b> (S1) has developed underlined by newly formed minerals. The tight folding is overprinted by a second fold generation of open folds that have generated a very long wavelength (about 2 kilometers) series of synclines and anticlines. The axis of the first syncline is situated right next to the South Limousin Fault, followed by the first anticline underneath Saint-Mesmin. The second, central syncline is outlined by the trace of the Puy-des-Âges quartzite and the second anticline runs through Saint-Cyr-les-Champagnes.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} is traversed {{by major}} east-west-striking, late Variscan fracture zones that were reactivated during the alpine orogeny cycle. In {{the eastern part}} of the Axial Zone, the fractures are generally upright, a good example being the mylonitic Merens Fault at Pic del Port Vell near Mérens-les-Vals. In the western part, the fractures are more gently dipping to the north and behave as en echelon thrusts arranged in a northwest-southeasterly fashion; along these fractures, the basement of the Axial Zone overthrusts Mesozoic sedimentary units to the south. Good examples are the en echelon thrusts at Eaux Chaudes, Gavarnie and Bénasque—Las Nogueras (referring to the upper reaches of the rivers Noguera Ribagorzana and Noguera Pallaresa). Concomitant with the thrusts, a <b>schistosity</b> developed that affected the basement as well as the sedimentary cover implying an alpine origin. All these fractures account for an overall compression of the Axial Zone by 20% which translates as roughly 10 to 20 km of crustal shortening. As a result, the Axial Zone was squeezed into a south-directed antiformal stack.|$|E
50|$|The granulites {{are very}} closely allied to the gneisses, as they consist of {{nearly the same}} minerals, but they are finer-grained, have usually less perfect foliation, are more {{frequently}} garnetiferous, and have some special features of microscopic structure. In the rocks of this group the minerals, as seen in a microscopic slide, occur as small rounded grains forming a closely fitted mosaic. The individual crystals never have perfect form, and indeed traces of it are rare. In some granulites they interlock, with irregular borders; in others they have been drawn out and flattened into tapering lenticles by crushing. In most cases they are somewhat rounded with smaller grains between the larger. This {{is especially true of}} the quartz and feldspar which are the predominant minerals; mica always appears as flat scales (irregular or rounded but not hexagonal). Both muscovite and biotite may be present and vary considerably in abundance; very commonly they have their flat sides parallel and give the rock arudimentary <b>schistosity,</b> and they may be aggregated into bands in which case the granulites are indistinguishable from certain varieties of gneiss. The garnets are very generally larger than the above-mentioned ingredients, and easily visible with the eye as pink spots on the broken surfaces of the rock. They usually are filled with enclosed grains of the other minerals.|$|E
50|$|Regional {{metamorphism}} {{tends to}} make the rock more indurated {{and at the same}} time to give it a foliated, shistose or gneissic texture, consisting of a planar arrangement of the minerals, so that platy or prismatic minerals like mica and hornblende have their longest axes arranged parallel to one another. For that reason many of these rocks split readily in one direction along mica-bearing zones (schists). In gneisses, minerals also tend to be segregated into bands; thus there are seams of quartz and of mica in a mica schist, very thin, but consisting essentially of one mineral. Along the mineral layers composed of soft or fissile minerals the rocks will split most readily, and the freshly split specimens will appear to be faced or coated with this mineral; for example, a piece of mica schist looked at facewise might be supposed to consist entirely of shining scales of mica. On the edge of the specimens, however, the white folia of granular quartz will be visible. In gneisses these alternating folia are sometimes thicker and less regular than in schists, but most importantly less micaceous; they may be lenticular, dying out rapidly. Gneisses also, as a rule, contain more feldspar than schists do, and are tougher and less fissile. Contortion or crumbling of the foliation is by no means uncommon; splitting faces are undulose or puckered. <b>Schistosity</b> and gneissic banding (the two main types of foliation) are formed by directed pressure at elevated temperature, and to interstitial movement, or internal flow arranging the mineral particles while they are crystallizing in that directed pressure field.|$|E
50|$|The Steel Mine {{is located}} {{just west of}} Ophir along the Uwharrie River. It was a lode gold mine. The rock in the {{vicinity}} is the argillaceous slate, but according to some it is silicified schist. At the Steel Mine ore consists of thin seams of free gold, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite. These seams are conformable with the slaty cleavage or <b>schistosity.</b> Gold {{is said to have}} been discovered here about 1832, and the mine appears to have been worked extensively before 1853. Someone said that at this mine, gold digging amounted to mania for farmers were locating gold in almost every hill. However, the early history of the mine is obscure. Production data are fragmentary and are based on estimates. The only year for which production data are available is 1887, when $150,000 (about 75,000 ounces) in gold was produced. In 1876 the property was purchased by an English company, and until 1884 the ore was treated in Chilean mills. Mining journals for 1886 and 1887 note the repairing of old shafts and buildings of a new mill containing at first 20 stamps and later 40 stamps. One shaft was 135 ft. deep. Assay of ore taken from rich seams ranged from 20 to several hundred ounces of gold to the ton, and the ore from a few assayed more than 100 ounces of silver per ton. As late as 1934, a mill containing 10 stamps, a boiler, an engine, a roaster and other accessories remained on site going to ruin. Today, the Steel Mine is nearly inaccessible and the 1832 structures are in total ruins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Quartz-monzodioritic dykes have intruded the Hercynian {{continental}} lower {{crust of}} Calabria at 323 ± 5 Ma. Pseudosection and average PT calculations {{have been performed}} using THERMOCALC. The obtained P (average PT) and T (pseudosection and average PT) values indicate that the quartzmonzodioritic dykes have intruded the 750 °C hot metapelitic-migmatitic country-rocks {{at a depth of}} about 32 km, with a temperature of ca. 850 °C. Microstructural analysis suggests that deformation of the dykes started at hypersolidus conditions during emplacement and continued after cooling at subsolidus granulite facies conditions together with the country rocks. During this deformation event, which started not later than 323 ± 5 Ma ago, the main Sn+ 1 <b>schistosity</b> evolved. Vorticity analysis of the quartz-metadioritic dykes and of the metapelitic country rocks shows that the Sn+ 1 <b>schistosity</b> evolved during a general shear deformation characterized by 60 to 70 percent of pure shear. This high percentage of pure shear suggests that the main Sn+ 1 <b>schistosity</b> evolved in the hot lower crust undergoing extension during vertical shortening. A horizontal attitude of this extensional <b>schistosity</b> is confirmed by retro-deformation of the today obliquely SE-ward dipping Sn+ 1 <b>schistosity.</b> Extension continued with time and propagated upwards within the crust, affecting the middle crust in a time interval of 306 ± 1 to ca. 300 Ma when huge masses of granitoid rocks intruded it. The deepest batches of these granitoid bodies show a gneissic <b>schistosity</b> which developed under ductile conditions, while granitoids at higher levels became deformed in a brittle fashion. Our whole data set is consistent with a late Hercynian evolution in Calabria characterized by a progressively crust overlying a mantle that gradually rose during lithospheric extension. This extension was asynchronous, starting at 323 ± 5 Ma in the lower crust and affecting higher crustal levels at progressively later times...|$|E

A close relationship exists between differential slope evolution, structural setting, and slope attitude. Lateral spread develops {{in an area where}} the dominant <b>schistosity</b> is subvertical and parallel to the slope, and is facilitated by dissolution of evaporite-bearing bodies. Sackung develops in an area with low-angle <b>schistosity</b> and NNE-SSW high angle faults, parallel to the ridge segment. A huge rock-fall was set off the intersection of the steep N-Dipping <b>schistosity</b> with E-W and N-S to NNE-SSW fault and joints. As a whole, the deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) is an outstanding example of how the mechanics of large mass movements and their potential evolution are controlled by the structural framework, which is the ultimate result of a complex tectonic history...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{understand}} the behaviour and deformation mechanisms of serpentinites in the seismogenic zone we study the deformation macro- and microstructures of serpentinites along the Santa Ynez Fault in the San Andreas System. At the outcrop scale, deformation is localized in a gouge zone that shows three different structures: (1) micrometric undeformed fragments (clasts) {{of the previously}} serpentinized peridotite, (2) localized shear planes (Y and R) and (3) a penetrative <b>schistosity</b> (S). Observations under SEM and TEM reveal that the <b>schistosity</b> corresponds to serpentine fibres, parallel to each other, and whose orientation varies as they wrap around clasts. TEM micro-textures indicate that these long fibres result from continuous syntectonic growth rather than from reorientation of pre-existing fibres implying a slow transfer process that occurs at short distances. We propose a dissolution–diffusion–crystallization process {{for the formation of}} the <b>schistosity</b> that corresponds to a low strain-rate creeping process of deformation that can be effective in aseismic fault segments...|$|E
40|$|The Soursat {{metamorphic}} complex (SMC) {{in northwestern}} Iran {{is part of}} the Sanandaj–Sirjan metamorphic belt. The complex is composed of different metamorphic and plutonic rocks, but is dominated by metapelites composed of garnet, staurolite, kyanite, fibrolite, cordierite, and andalusite. Porphyroblasts in schists have the same fabric, and three stages of <b>schistosity</b> are present. The internal <b>schistosity</b> (Sn) inclusion trails are also offset by conjugate sets of extensional <b>schistosity</b> (Sn+ 1) and a second (Sn+ 2) that crenulates (Sn+ 1). Polyphase metamorphisms are present in the complex. Garnet, staurolite, kyanite, and fibrolite assemblage preserves conditions during the M 1 metamorphic event. This assemblage yields a P–t estimate of 645 ± 11 °C and 6. 5 ± 0. 5 kbar. Other samples of the central part of SMC contain cordierite and andalusite (M 2) overgrowth that yields a P–t estimate of 532 ± 33 °C and 2. 1 ± 1. 1 kbar.
