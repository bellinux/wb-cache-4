This dissection has resulted in a variety of landforms, such as valleys, crags and domes. Small graveled creeks flow from alpine mountains out onto the regional prairies where there are pale blue rock-bottomed lakes, including the so-named Itcha Lake. Three streams drain the Itcha Range, namely Corkscrew Creek, Downton Creek and Shag Creek. Although the Itcha Range has been dissected by <b>stream</b> <b>erosion</b> and subsequently glaciated, its original shape has been largely preserved. Rocks in the Itcha Range are a variety of colours, including red, white and yellow.|$|E
5|$|Shield volcanoes undergo {{at least}} two stages of {{volcanic}} activity. The initial shield stage is the most productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of large volumes of predominately fluid peralkaline felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small summit caldera may form, {{as is the case}} for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by <b>stream</b> <b>erosion</b> is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys.|$|E

The objectives {{of this study were}} to: 1) compare the effect of livestock stocking rate on sediment and phosphorus loss from <b>stream</b> bank <b>erosion</b> in the Rathbun Watershed in southern Iowa; 2) assess the relationship between stream stage and <b>stream</b> bank soil <b>erosion</b> rates, and 3) evaluate the impacts of current riparian land-uses and stream morphologic characteristics at the field and catchment scale on <b>stream</b> bank <b>erosion.</b> <b>Stream</b> bank <b>erosion</b> rates over three years were estimated using the erosion pin method, with erosion rates correlated to pasture stocking rates and the number of high stream stage events, which were monitored using pressure transducers. The effects of stream morphology and land-use on <b>stream</b> bank <b>erosion</b> were assessed using parameters such as percent of land-use, bank soil texture, stream bed slope, and sinuosity at both the field and catchment scale. While there was no significant correlation between <b>stream</b> bank <b>erosion</b> rates and stocking rates, erosion rates within sites under Conservation Reserve Program management were significantly lower than those within grazed pastures, particularly during the winter/spring season. The length of severely eroded stream banks and compaction of the riparian area were positively related to livestock stocking rates within pasture stream reaches. Approximately 75 % of the variability in <b>stream</b> bank <b>erosion</b> was found to be correlated to the frequency of high stream stage events. Overall, these data and previous studies allow the speculation that, in the long term and at the catchment scale, a high percentage of agricultural land-use in riparian areas can be either directly and/or indirectly related to alteration of stream hydrologic regimes. In order to reach equilibrium state condition, where energy input to the stream channel is balanced with the minimal channel boundary resistance, such land-use changes will result in changes in <b>stream</b> bank <b>erosion</b> and channel morphology...|$|R

25|$|In both Zion National Park and Yosemite National Park, the {{increase}} in human visitation {{during the first half}} of the 20th century was found to correspond to the decline of native cougar (Puma concolor) populations in at least part of their range. Soon after, native populations of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) erupted, subjecting resident communities of cottonwoods (Populus fremontii) in Zion and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) in Yosemite to intensified browsing. This halted successful recruitment of these species except in refugia inaccessible to the deer. In Zion the suppression of cottonwoods increased <b>stream</b> <b>erosion</b> and decreased the diversity and abundance of amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and wildflowers. In parts of the park where cougars were still common these negative impacts were not expressed and riparian communities were significantly healthier.|$|E

2500|$|The Mount Meager massif is {{the most}} voluminous {{composite}} volcano in the Garibaldi chain and British Columbia, {{as well as the}} most recent to erupt. It has a volume of [...] and consists of an eroded stratovolcano, ranging in composition from andesite to rhyodacite. Several dissected lava domes and volcanic plugs are present on its glaciated summit, as well as a clearly defined volcanic crater with a lava dome placed within it. At least eight volcanic vents compose the complex and have been the sources for volcanic activity throughout Meager's 2.2million year history. [...] A well-documented history of volcanism is present at Meager, with its most recent eruption about 2,350years ago that was similar in character to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and the continuous eruption of SoufriÃ¨re Hills on the island of Montserrat. This is the largest recorded Holocene explosive eruption in Canada, originating from a volcanic vent on the northeastern flank of Plinth Peak. It was Plinian in nature, sending an eruption column at least [...] high into the stratosphere. As prevailing winds carried ash of the column eastwards, it deposited across British Columbia and Alberta. Subsequent pyroclastic flows were sent down Meager's flanks for [...] and were later succeeded by the eruption of a lava flow that demolished many times. This created thick agglutinated rubble that successfully blocked the adjacent Lillooet River to form a lake. Subsequently, the breccia dam collapsed to produce a catastrophic flood that deposited house-sized boulders more than [...] downstream. After the flood took place, a small dacite lava flow was erupted that later solidified to form a series of well-preserved columnar joints. This is the last phase of the 2350 BP eruption, and subsequent <b>stream</b> <b>erosion</b> has cut though this lava flow to form a waterfall.|$|E

2500|$|The fault-block Hanging Hills {{were formed}} 200 {{million years ago}} during the Triassic and Jurassic periods and are {{composed}} of trap rock, also known as basalt, an extrusive volcanic rock. Basalt is a dark colored rock, but the iron within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending the ledges a distinct reddish appearance. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique [...] "postpile" [...] appearance. Huge slopes made of fractured basalt scree are visible beneath many of the ledges of the Hanging Hills; they are particularly visible along the base of East Peak where it plunges into Merimere Reservoir. The basalt cliffs {{are the product of}} several massive lava flows hundreds of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa. These basalt floods of lava happened over a period of 20 million years. Erosion occurring between the eruptions deposited deep layers of sediment between the lava flows, which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock. The resulting [...] "layer cake" [...] of basalt and sedimentary sheets eventually faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion wore away the weaker sedimentary layers a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today. The best way to imagine this is to picture a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between. Subsequent scour by moving glacial ice plucked away the basalt from the steep southern end of the crest of the broken ridge, creating overhanging cliffs. In the Meriden region, numerous northeast-trending normal faults offset the volcanic flows and intervening sedimentary rocks. Several of these faults break the Metacomet Ridge north of Meriden. <b>Stream</b> <b>erosion</b> and glacial ice carved canyons along these faults, dividing the ridge into the finger-like promontories of the Hanging Hills.

50|$|Valley or <b>stream</b> <b>erosion</b> {{occurs with}} {{continued}} water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both downward, deepening the valley, and headward, extending the valley into the hillside, creating head cuts and steep banks. In the earliest stage of <b>stream</b> <b>erosion,</b> the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical V cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some base level is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens {{the valley floor}} and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream meanders across the valley floor. In all stages of <b>stream</b> <b>erosion,</b> {{by far the most}} erosion occurs during times of flood, when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load.
