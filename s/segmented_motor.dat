40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{structure}} of precision motion system built {{on the basis of}} a circular multi-coordinate synchronous <b>segment</b> <b>motor</b> and reconfigurable parallel kinematic mechanism. The multi-coordinate synchronous <b>segment</b> <b>motor</b> may have from two to six movable segments depending on the design, and number of the segments generally defines an internal mobility of the motor. A specific feature of the parallel kinematic mechanism consists in the possibility of its structure reconfiguration by serial connection of two neighboring rods with the help of free elements of their spherical joints into triangular circuits with one spherical hinge at the common vertex. As result of this, the controlled motion of <b>motor</b> movable <b>segments</b> is transformed into the complex spatial displacement of circular platform with number of degrees of freedom up to six inclusively. A mathematical model for solution of the kinematic problem in the investigated parallel mechanism has been offered in the paper. The model allows to calculate a position of movable segments of multi-coordinate synchronous motor depending on the desired position and orientation of the executive circular platform. The parametric definition of base point positions in the <b>motor</b> <b>segments</b> in time allows eventually to form algorithms of programmable motions. The paper substantiates ability to embed the developed motion system into projection unit of opto-mechanical equipment while preserving traditional configuration scheme. This provides the possibility of adaptive adjustment of optical elements during operation; it allows to adjust the optical elements when the geometry of projection system is changed due to deterioration. As result, main characteristics of projection system: resolution, depth of field and image contrast and distortion are maintained at the required level. The developed motion system can be used as a coordinate system of positioning, alignment and scanning in the assembly and other precision equipment.  </p...|$|R

The close coupling between the igniter and the head-end segment and the high length-to-diameter ratio make understanding of the longitudinal pressure waves essential. The igniter performance along with igniter to head-end segment geometry govern the induction interval and head-end segment ignition.

40|$|Abstract: Ultrasonic motors {{have many}} {{excellent}} performance {{features such as}} high-holding torque, high driving torque at low speed, silent operation, compactness, and no electromagnetic interferences. Due to such characteristics these motors have a potential for many applications such as automation, and robotics. The performance estimation of the ultrasonic motor {{is a function of}} operating conditions such as stiffness, number of piezoelectric <b>segments,</b> <b>motor</b> diameter, etc. Such performance is modeled using the accurate parameters of the motor. In this paper, the derivation of a mathematical model for traveling wave ultrasonic motors and its experimental validation is presented. The different components of the motor have been modeled individually. The resulting submodels are then assembled together to give the model of the complete motor. In order to validate the model, it is simulated with properly parameters and compared with experimental results obtained from an actual traveling wave ultrasonic motor "Shinsei USR 60 ". Good agreement is obtained between simulated and experimental results...|$|R

For many years, NASA has been actively engaged in removal of asbestos from the shuttle RSRM motors due to occupation health concerns where technicians are working with an EPA banned material. Careful laboratory and subscale testing has lead to the downselect of a organic fiber known as Polybenzimidazol to replace the asbestos fiber filler in the existing synthetic rubber copolymer Nitrile Butadiene - now named PBI/NBR. Manufacturing, processing, and layup of the new material has been a challenge due to {{the differences in the}} baseline shuttle RSRM internal insulator properties and PBI/NBR material properties. For this study, data gathering and reduction procedures for thermal and chemical property characterization for the new candidate material are discussed. Difficulties with test procedures, implementation of properties into the Charring Material Ablator (CMA) codes, and results correlation with static motor fire data are provided.

Now, humans possess these powers as well, due to the medical {{ultrasound}} imaging and sound navigation. Ultrasound, a type of sound we cannot hear, has enabled us to see a world otherwise invisible to us.

Skeletal muscle tissue is functionally composed by so called motor units which are the smallest voluntarily activatable units and is of primary interest in this study.

The addition of either epinephrine or sodium bicarbonate {{to the local}} anaesthetic enhances the ef®cacy of epidural block. We assessed the block of lumbo-sacral segments in lumbar epidural anaesthesia adding epinephrine and/or bicarbonate to lidocaine. Methods. Twenty-seven patients undergoing lumbar epidural anaesthesia with lidocaine 2 %, 17 ml at L 4 - 5 or L 5 -S 1 were randomly divided into three groups. Plain lidocaine, lidocaine with 1 : 200 000 epinephrine or lidocaine±epinephrine±bicarbonate was administrated via an epidural catheter. The pain threshold after repeated electrical stimulation {{was used to assess}} the sensory block at the L 2, S 1, and S 3 <b>segments.</b> <b>Motor</b> block was evaluated using the Bromage scale.

40|$|Cholera toxin (CT) is well {{established}} to produce diarrhea by producing hyperactivity of the enteric neural circuits that regulate water and electrolyte secretion. Its effects on intestinal motor patterns are less well understood. We {{examined the effects of}} luminal CT on motor activity of guinea-pig jejunum in vitro. Segments of jejunum were cannulated at either end and mounted horizontally. Their contractile activity was video-imaged and the recordings were used to construct spatiotemporal maps of contractile activity with CT (1. 25 or 12. 5 μg/ml) in the lumen. Both concentrations of CT induced propulsive motor activity in jejunal segments. The effect of 1. 25 μg/ml CT was markedly enhanced by co-incubation with granisetron (5 -HT 3 antagonist, 1 μM), which prevents the hypersecretion induced by CT. The increased propulsive activity was not accompanied by increased segmentation and occurred very early after exposure to CT in the presence of granisetron. Luminal CT also reduced the pressure threshold for saline distension evoked propulsive reflexes, an effect resistant to granisetron. In contrast, CT prevented the induction of segmenting contractions by luminal decanoic acid, so its effects on propulsive and segmenting contractile activity are distinctly different. Thus, in addition to producing hypersecretion, CT excites propulsive motor activity with an entirely different time course and pharmacology, but inhibits nutrient-induced segmentation. This suggests that CT excites more than one enteric neural circuit and that propulsive and <b>segmenting</b> <b>motor</b> patterns are differentially regulated...|$|R
40|$|During the {{developmental}} static fire program for NASAs Reusable Solid Rocket Motor-V (RSRMV), an anomalous erosion condition {{appeared on the}} nozzle Carbon Cloth Phenolic nose ring {{that had not been}} observed in the space shuttle RSRM program. There were regions of augmented erosion located {{on the bottom of the}} forward nose ring (FNR) that measured nine tenths of an inch deeper than the surrounding material. Estimates of heating conditions for the RSRMV nozzle based on limited char and erosion data indicate that the total heat loading into the FNR, for the new five <b>segment</b> <b>motor,</b> is about 40 - 50 % higher than the baseline shuttle RSRM nozzle FNR. Fault tree analysis of the augmented erosion condition has lead to a focus on a thermomechanical response of the material that is outside the existing experience base of shuttle CCP materials for this application. This paper provides a sensitivity study of the CCP material thermo-structural response subject to the design constraints and heating conditions unique to the RSRMV Forward Nose Ring application.
