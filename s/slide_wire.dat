50|$|In this arrangement, a {{fraction}} of a known voltage from a resistive <b>slide</b> <b>wire</b> is compared with an unknown voltage by means of a galvanometer. The sliding contact or wiper of the potentiometer is adjusted and the galvanometer briefly connected between the sliding contact and the unknown voltage. The deflection of the galvanometer is observed and the sliding tap adjusted until the galvanometer no longer deflects from zero. At that point the galvanometer draws no current from the unknown source, and the magnitude of voltage can be calculated from the position of the sliding contact.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this work was to design a system for {{measuring}} the velocity of a powder actuated fastener or drivepin during penetration. This system would provide a tool for further investigation into drivepin penetration characteristics. The main characteristic of interest is the instantaneous acceleration from which the forces on the drivepin can be determined. This acceleration was determined by designing a transducer whose output is drivepin position versus time and calculating the instantaneous velocity and acceleration, graphically and numerically, from these data. A powder actuated drivepin is a special nail-like pin which is driven into hard materials {{by the force of}} a charge of gunpowder. The powder actuated tool is similar to a pistol except the projectile is the drivepin and the charge is in a separate brass jacket. The penetration velocity previously referred to is the velocity spectrum during the total time the drivepin is in motion. Some of the transducers that were considered are listed with comments which affected their evaluation. Among these transducers, the linear resistance potentiometer was selected for this measuring system. It has the following characteristics: a. Simplicity b. High frequency response c. Good linearity d. Marginal mechanical strength e. Low, but sufficient output With this potentiometric transducer, an oscilloscope and camera were added to provide a time base and a permanent record. The test results or data are recorded as photographs of the oscilloscope trace. Various techniques for differentiating these data are discussed. These techniques include graphical, approximating polynomials by the method of finite differences, and best fitting curve by the method of least squares. Additional mathematical presentations are included to show the measuring system's linearity and frequency response and the equations of motion of the powder actuated tool and piston. The final configuration of the measuring system is a battery energized <b>slide</b> <b>wire</b> mounted inside a barrel and a collector mounted opposite the <b>slide</b> <b>wire.</b> The head of the drivepin contacts the <b>slide</b> <b>wire</b> during penetration and transfers this voltage to the collector. The collector voltage is fed into an oscilloscope for display as a function of time. The external trigger signal for starting the display is obtained from the first motion of drivepin as it passes through a metal foil {{on the surface of the}} material to be penetrated. This potentiometric measuring system was found to be adequate for the purpose intended. However, some mechanical modifications are recommended...|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} processingof serum protein electrophoresisis {{described}} that utilizes a Disc integrator, automatic digital readout, and programmabledesk-top computer. This configuration {{has proven to}} be highly efficient and accurate. 1 ’I’HE TECHNIC of serum protein electrophoresis includes serial opera-tions of widely varying efficiency and accuracy. Integration of the areas under the curves obtained for each fraction in the densitometric scan of tile stained strip and the subsequent calculations are steps that can be time-consuming aiid potential sources of error. Toward the reduction of these problems, a novel configuration of instruments, consisting of a Disc integrator, automatic digital printer, amid programmable desk-top computer has been assembled, tested, and found highly advantageous. Methods Serum protein electrophoresis was carried out on cellulose acetate by the method of Kohmi (i), with modifications (2). The strips were analyzed in a recording electrophoresis densitometer (Photovolt Densicord, Model 542 A*) equipped with a 565 nm filter. A Disc inte-grator (Model 260 t) was mounted on the recording densitometer so that the action of the pen <b>slide</b> <b>wire</b> directly activated the integrator. Tile integrator drew a cumulative integral tracing below the densi-tometric record. An automatic digital printer (Model 610 t) also was activated by the integrator. The system was set so that an upward deflection of 0. 1 - 0. 3 % of the total height of the densitometer chart paper caused tile integrator both to indicate with a marker blip the position of this event on the integration record and to initiate the printing and counting mechanism in the digital printer.

40|$|Considerable {{study has}} been given to the problem of a cathode-follower {{coupling}} circuit for matching a B-wall tube to a properly terminated coaxial cable. A matched circuit makes it possible to obtain faster counting rates independent of practical cable lengths. A breadboard circuit has been built and first results indicate that a two millivolt signal at the input of the cathode-follower will operate the Model 162 Instrument Development Laboratory Scaling Unit when adjusted for maximum gain. This is comparable to the voltage available when the B-wall tube is coupled to its amplifier through a coaxial cable. Shielded room measurements have been completed in the ``R`` Building. One log-amplifier (EL- 257) was delivered to group 32, one scaler-multiplier (EL- 252) to group 34, one four-input GM mixer (EL- 247 to Group 24, and the plating control regulation checker (EL- 258) plus the portable pulse generator (EL- 261) to Group 12. The scaler-multiplier (EL- 253) is 20 per cent complete and the motor-driven <b>slide</b> <b>wire</b> and the four-input gamma mixer (EL- 262) are 95 per cent complete. The manufacturing specifications for plating controls and the instruction book for the portable pulse generator (EL- 2561) have been submitted for duplication and should be completed by January 31, 1949. The two (2) 6 volt, 60 ampere rectifiers in Room R- 107 have been checked and re-finished. All of the automotive-type batteries delivered to R- 107 were almost completely discharged and some had bulged cases, which looked as through they had been frozen. They are now being charged, a few at a time, to determine which ones are serviceable. The plating controls installed for Group 18 were checked and repaired.

40|$|Upon {{completion}} of preliminary {{tests on the}} satisfactory operation of the Vibrating Reed Electrometer as a sensitive indication of alpha activity at the cathode of a plating cell, attention was directed toward {{the study of the}} detection of activity at the anode of the cell. Group 3 anticipates a lengthy study of cathodic and anodic deposition potentials of radioactive elements in solution. With the standard Research Plating Control, cathodic studies could be accomplished with relative ease, but the study of anodic deposition could only be done in an exploratory manner. This would provide meager information and lengthen the study considerably. To overcome the above objections, it was decided to modify the plating control so that it would provide linear control of the anode-solution potential. Study of the problem indicated that two simple changes were necessary; namely the reversal of current through the plating cell (since the anode instead of the cathode would be at ground potential) and the addition of a phase inverter in the amplifier circuit of the plating control to supply the control tube with a voltage change of the proper phase. Several tests made by Group 3 indicate that the use of the modified plating control will be satisfactory. Measurements of the three shielded rooms in the ``E`` Building have been completed. One scaler-multiplier EL- 251, has been completed. First tests indicated that most of the scaling stages were scaling through when operated by the output of an Instrument Development Laboratory Model 162 scaler, apparently due to interstage coupling by way of the leads to the ``scale selector`` switch of the scaler. Work continues on the mechanical portion of the motor-driven <b>slide</b> <b>wire.</b> The gear box, providing three changes of speed (approximately 103, 1 - 9, and 1 - 27) worked well on the dry run test, but when loaded, would not operate...|$|E

40|$|Braided wire stents {{demonstrate}} distinct characteristics {{compared to}} welded ones. In this study, both braided and welded wire stents {{with the same}} nominal dimensions were crimped inside a sheath and then deployed into a stenosed artery using finite element analysis. The braided wire stent was generated by overlapping wires to form crisscross shape. A welded wire stent was created by welding the intersection points of <b>wires</b> to avoid <b>sliding</b> between <b>wires.</b> The effect of fabrication technique on mechanical behavior of Nitinol wire stents was evaluated. The results showed that relative <b>sliding</b> between <b>wires</b> reduced the deformation of the braided stent, which led to less radial strength than the welded one; therefore, the deployed braided stent was more conformed to the anatomic shape of the lesion and much less efficient for restoring the patency of the stenotic artery. Post balloon-dilation was commonly used to improve its performance in terms of lumen gain and deployed shape of the stent. On the contrary, the welded wire stent exhibited a high capacity for pushing the occlusion outward. It reached an approximately uniform shape after deployment. The welded joints caused larger deformation and high strain on the stent struts, which indicate a potential earlier failure for the welded stent. In addition, higher contact pressure at the stent-lesion interface and higher arterial stresses were observed in the artery supported by the welded stent. The peak stress concentration may increase the occurrence of neointimal hyperplasia...|$|R

To address these challenging topics, we often used lipid bilayer membranes as compartmentalizing platform and have introduced rigid-rod molecules as privileged scaffolds that bypass all folding problems {{because they do not}} fold. This approach provides access to motifs such as rigid-rod barrels, helices, stacks, <b>slides,</b> and <b>wires</b> that can act as smart, stimuli-responsive photosystems, pores, ion channels, hosts, sensors, and catalysts. The selected examples focus on naphthalenediimides (NDIs), a compact, organizable, colorizable, and functionalizable n-semiconductor. This versatile module is used in rigid-rod molecules to mediate transmembrane anion transport by anion–p interactions, as sticky p-clamp within pore sensors to catch otherwise elusive analytes by aromatic electron donor–acceptor interactions, or in blue, transmembrane p-stack architecture to collect and convert photonic energy. These specific examples with multifunctional NDI nanoarchitecture are of help to outline, on the one hand, possibilities to contribute to advanced functional materials such as multianalyte sensors or solar cells and, on the other hand, to keep on wondering about an enormous structural and functional space waiting to be explored. We describe the construction of nanobarrels (figure), helices, stacks, <b>slides,</b> and <b>wires</b> using lipid bilayers as platform, rigid-rod molecules as scaffolds, and naphthalenediimides as multifunctional modules to gain access to advanced functions such as multianalyte sensing (arrows) or artificial photosynthesis...|$|R
