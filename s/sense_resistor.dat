5000|$|The simple {{transistor}} {{current source}} from Figure 4 {{can be improved}} by inserting the base-emitter junction of the transistor in the feedback loop of an op-amp (Figure 7). Now the op-amp increases its output voltage {{to compensate for the}} [...] drop. The circuit is actually a buffered non-inverting amplifier driven by a constant input voltage. It keeps up this constant voltage across the constant <b>sense</b> <b>resistor.</b> As a result, the current flowing through the load is constant as well; it is exactly the Zener voltage divided by the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor.</b> The load can be connected either in the emitter (Figure 7) or in the collector (Figure 4) but in both the cases it is floating as in all the circuits above. The transistor is not needed if the required current doesn't exceed the sourcing ability of the op-amp.

50|$|The HSDL4220 {{infrared}} LED is originally {{unsuitable for}} 10 Mbit/s operation. It has a bandwidth of 9 MHz, where 10 Mbit/s Manchester-modulated systems need bandwidth of around 16 MHz. Operation in a usual circuit with current drive {{would lead to}} substantial signal corruption and range reduction. Therefore, Twibright Labs developed a special driving technique consisting of driving the LED directly with 15-fold 74AC04 gate output in parallel with RF voltage applied current-unlimited directly to the LED through large capacitors. As the voltage to keep the nominal LED average current (100mA) varies with temperature and component tolerances, an AC-bypassed current <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> is put in series with the LED. A feedback loop measures voltage on this resistor and keeps it at a preset level by varying supply voltage of the 74AC04 gates. Therefore, the nominally digital 74AC04 is operating as a structured power CMOS switch completely in analog mode.|$|E
5000|$|Current sense {{amplifiers}} (also called {{current shunt}} amplifiers) are special-purpose amplifiers that output a voltage {{proportional to the}} current flowing in a power rail. They utilize a [...] "current-sense resistor" [...] to convert the load current in the power rail to a small voltage, which is then amplified by the current-sense amplifiers. The currents in the power rail {{can be in the}} range of 1 A to 20 A, requiring the current-sense resistor to be a resistor typically in the range of 1 to 100 mΩ. These amplifiers are designed to amplify a very small [...] "sense voltage" [...] of 10 to 100 mV, in the presence of very large common-mode voltages of 5 to 30 V. DC precision (low input offset voltage) and high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) are distinguishing characteristics of these amplifiers. Some current sense amplifiers measure current flowing in a single direction; bidirectional amplifiers measure current flow in both directions through the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chopper drive {{circuits}} {{are referred}} to as constant current drives because they generate a somewhat constant current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage. On each new step, a very high voltage is applied to the winding initially. This causes the current in the winding to rise quickly since dI/dt = V/L where V is very large. The current in each winding is monitored by the controller, usually by measuring the voltage across a small <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> in series with each winding. When the current exceeds a specified current limit, the voltage is turned off or [...] "chopped", typically using power transistors. When the winding current drops below the specified limit, the voltage is turned on again. In this way, the current is held relatively constant for a particular step position. This requires additional electronics to sense winding currents, and control the switching, but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than L/R drives. Integrated electronics for this purpose are widely available.|$|E

This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a <b>sensing</b> <b>resistor</b> is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the <b>sensing</b> <b>resistor</b> and trip the breaker.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design and}} analysis of a high common-mode input auto-zero comparator {{for use in a}} Hot Swap controller. Comparators are essential building blocks within the current limit detection schemes of Hot Swap controllers. However, the current limit detection scheme places a <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> in the current path, burning static power. Reducing this power consumption while maintaining the overall accuracy of the detector can be done by decreasing the full scale sense voltage across the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor,</b> decreasing the size of the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor,</b> and increasing the overall accuracy of the comparator. This is realized by using an auto-zero comparator designed in Linear Technology's 0. 6 [mu]m BiCMOS process. The overall topology uses the closed loop offset storage with an auxiliary amplifier scheme. The input and auxiliary amplifier are based on the fully differential folded cascode topology with some key changes. The comparator is a typical PMOS comparator with internal hysteresis and additional circuitry added to maintain symmetry for as long as possible. A Widlar bandgap-based circuit provides the necessary internal reference. The comparator was designed and verified using LTspice and Linear Technologys in house models. The resulting design has an absolute accuracy better than +/- 200 [mu]V over temperature, increasing the relative accuracy with the <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> value halved from previous designs. Additionally, the comparator can handle inputs from zero to sixty volts and settles to a new offset sample in less than 3 [mu]s. by Anders Wen-Dao Lee. Thesis: M.

40|$|Switching power {{converters}} are an indispensable {{part of every}} battery-operated consumer electronic product, nourishing regulated voltages to various subsystems. In these circuits, sensing the inductor current is not only necessary for protection and control but also is critical {{to be done in}} a lossless and accurate fashion for state-of-the-art advanced control techniques, which are devised to optimize transient response, increase the efficiency over a wide range of loads, eliminate off-chip compensation networks, and integrate the power inductor. However, unavailability of a universal, integrable, lossless, and accurate current-sensing technique impedes the realization of those advanced techniques and limit their applications. Unfortunately, use of a conventional series <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> is not recommended in high-performance, high-power switching regulators where more than 90 % efficiency is required because of their high current levels. A handful of lossless current-sensing techniques are available but their accuracies are significantly lower than the traditional <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> scheme. Among available lossless but not accurate techniques, an off-chip, filter-based method that uses a tuned filter across the inductor to estimate current flow and its accuracy is dependent on the inductance and its equivalent series resistance (ESR) was selected for improvement because of its inherent continuous and low-noise operation. A schemes is proposed to adapt the filter technique for integration by automatically adjusting bandwidth and gain of an on-chip programmable gm-C filter to the off-chip power inductor during the system start-up through measuring the inductance and its ESR with on-chip generated test currents. The IC prototype in AMI s 0. 5 -um CMOS process achieved overall DC and AC gain errors of 8 % and 9 %, respectively, at 0. 8 A DC load and 0. 2 A ripple currents for inductors from 4 uH- 14 uH and ESR from 48 mOhm to 384 mOhm when lossless, state-of-the-art schemes achieve 20 40 % error and only when the nominal specifications of power component (power MOSFET or inductor) are known.

Typical boost converters, such as these, have a reference voltage of 1. 2 V. Since {{this is a}} current sourcing application, the more straightforward approach of directly sensing the boost converter’s reference voltage (Vref), which is 1. 2 V, across a <b>sense</b> <b>resistor</b> would dissipate too much power at the currents required to drive high−power White LED’s.
