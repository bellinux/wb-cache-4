40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of an Active Integrated Antenna (AIA) using a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) for applications in the Industrial Scientific Medical band (2. 4 Ã· 2. 4835 GHz). <b>Surface</b> <b>Mounting</b> <b>Device</b> (SMD) technology has been applied in {{the realization of the}} passive and active components, and low cost FR- 4 dielectric slabs have been employed for the integration of the antenna and the active/transmissive circuits, residing, respectively, on the opposite faces of a Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card. The proposed layout makes use of a properly corrugated ground plane, i. e., a High Impedance Ground Plane (HIGP), to improve the antenna performances and to minimize the coupling between the radiating component and other possible radiating elements and/or electronic circuits residing nearby. The analysis and the design of the radiating element with the HIGP are based on a rigorous full wave Method of Moment (MoM) formulation developed in the Spectral Domain (SD), while the design of the active circuitry is developed through the commercial tool AWR Microwave Office. The final design of the component is obtained hybridizing the two methods and applying a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization tool in order {{to take advantage of the}} HIGP, while keeping the geometrical dimensions of the antenna suitable for mounting on a PCMCIA card, and maintaining the antenna performances acceptable. The measured results show the performances of the VCO, an antenna gain of 19. 4 dBi and an increased front-to-back radiation ratio compared to the one of the same antenna mounted on a standard Perfect Electric Ground Plane (PEGP). This result, thus, demonstrates the minimization of the interferences between the designed antenna and other possible radiating and transmissive devices residing nearby...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Automated {{inspection}} of <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> PCB boards {{is a requirement}} to assure quality and to reduce manufacturing scrap costs and rework. This paper investigates methodologies for locating and identifying multiple objects in images used for <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>device</b> inspection. One of the main challenges for <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>device</b> inspection is component placement inspection. Component placement errors such as missing, misaligned or incorrectly rotated components are {{a major cause of}} defects and need to be detected before and after the solder reflow process. This paper focuses on automated object-recognition techniques for locating multiple objects using grey-model fitting for produc-ing a generalised template for a set of components. The work uses the normalised cross correlation (NCC) template-match-ing approach and examines a method for constraining the search space to reduce computational calculations. The search for template positions has been performed exhaustively and by using a genetic algorithm. Experimental results using a typical PCB image are reported...|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of BGAs {{is that the}} solder balls cannot flex {{in the way that}} longer leads can, so they are not mechanically compliant. As with all <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>devices,</b> bending due to a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between PCB substrate and BGA (thermal stress) or flexing and vibration (mechanical stress) can cause the solder joints to fracture.|$|R

40|$|Package {{designs for}} {{microelectronics}} devices {{have moved from}} through-hole to <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> technology {{in order to increase}} the printed wiring board real estate available by utilizing both sides of the board. The traditional geometry for <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>devices</b> is peripheral arrays where the leads are on the edges of the device. As the technology drives towards high input/output (I/O) count (increasing number of leads) and smaller packages with finer pitch (less distance between peripheral leads), limitations on peripheral <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>devices</b> arise. A solution to the peripheral <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> issue is to shift the leads to the area under the device. This scheme is called areal array packaging and is exemplified by the ball grid array (BGA) package. In a BGA package, the leads are on the bottom surface of the package {{in the form of an}} array of solder balls. The current practice of joining BGA packages to printed wiring boards involves a hierarchy of solder alloy compositions. A high melting temperature ball is typically used for standoff. A promising alternative to current methods is the use of jetting technology to perform monolithic solder ball attachment.

40|$|The {{traditional}} geometry for <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>devices</b> is {{the peripheral}} array where the leads {{are on the}} edges of the device. As the technology drives towards high input/output (I/O) count (increasing number of leads) and smaller packages with finer pitch (less distance between peripheral leads), limitations on peripheral <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> <b>devices</b> arise. The leads on these fine pitch devices are fragile and can be easily bent. It becomes increasingly difficult to deliver solder past to leads spaced as little as 0. 012 inch apart. Too much solder mass can result in bridging between leads while too little solder can contribute to the loss of mechanical and electrical continuity. A solution is to shift the leads from the periphery of the device to the area under the device. This scheme is called areal array packaging and is exemplified by the ball grid array (BGA) package. A system has been designed and constructed to deposit an entire array of several hundred uniform solder droplets onto a printed circuit board in a fraction of a second. The solder droplets wet to the interconnect lands on a pc board and forms a basis for later application of a BGA device.
