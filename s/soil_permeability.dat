50|$|The primary waste liquids {{cleaning}} and purification {{action in a}} drain field is performed by a biofilm in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the <b>soil</b> <b>permeability</b> is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the <b>soil</b> <b>permeability</b> is too high, or is exposed to fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates {{down to the water}} table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the aquifer. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.|$|E

40|$|The <b>permeability</b> of <b>soil</b> to {{fluid flow}} defines the {{magnitude}} of soil gas and groundwater flow under imposed pressure gradients. Pressure gradients exist due to natural effects such as hydraulic gradients (in the case of groundwater) and barometrically imposed gradients (in the case of soil gas). Unnatural gradients are imposed by soil vapor extraction air sparging, active venting, pump-and-treat, and other remediation processes requiring the active movement of fluids through the soil. The design of these processes requires knowledge of the flow characteristics of the soil. The most variable of the soil's flow characteristics is its permeability, which can vary by several orders of magnitude in a given geologic and hydrologic setting. Knowledge of <b>soil</b> gas <b>permeability</b> is needed to design soil vapor extraction systems and predict the general movement of gas in soil. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, or the <b>soil's</b> <b>permeability</b> to liquid flow, is required to predict movement of groundwater in saturated soils.

50|$|Rills cannot form {{on every}} surface, and their {{formation}} is intrinsically {{connected to the}} steepness of the hillside slope. Gravity determines {{the force of the}} water, which provides the power required to start the erosional environment necessary to create rills. Therefore, the formation of rills is primarily controlled by the slope of the hillside. Slope controls the depth of the rills, while the length of the slope and the <b>soil’s</b> <b>permeability</b> control the number of incisions in an area. Each type of soil has a threshold value, a slope angle below which water velocity cannot produce sufficient force to dislodge enough soil particles for rills to form. For instance, on many non-cohesive slopes, this threshold value hovers around an angle of 2 degrees with a shear velocity between 3 and 3.5 cm/s.|$|R

This paper is {{a summary of the}} technical basis for a candidate foundation fill materials standard for new construction in Florida. Field measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> <b>soil</b> air radon, and densities were made in 16 locations throughout Florida. Soil samples were also obtained to make laboratory measurements of additional soil parameters such as radon diffusion coefficient, radium concentration, radon emanation coefficient, ambient moisture, and soil grain sizes. Since radon gas is generated from the radioactive decay of radium, an element that is present in virtually all earthen materials, elevated soil radium concentrations cause elevated rates of radon generation. This, in turn, causes higher radon gas concentrations in the air spaces in the soil. Thus, the recommended standard includes a soil ra&- concentration limit. Since permeability coefficients and diffusion coefficients are closely related, and exhibit similar trends with soil type, compaction, and moisture, the effects of both are included in the analysis supporting a candidate standard, even though the candidate standard only refers explicitly to the permeability coefficient...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{use of the}} {{coefficient}} of permeability as a quality control parameter for earthworks, in particular for landfilling, has resulted in many engineers looking to predict coefficients of permeability for clays from more widely available but often widely scattered ata. In {{a number of cases}} this has led erroneously to the interpretation of the moisture content-coefficient of permeability relationship as the direct inverse of the moisture content-density relationship. This paper re-examines the original theories proposed for movement ofwater through soils of differing grain size and goes on to show that extrapolation of the permeability-density relationship for granular soils to finer grained soils is incorrect. Laboratory permeability ests were conducted on four different soil types using the falling head permeameter o investigate the relation-ships between permeability, dry density and moulding moisture content for each <b>soil.</b> Coefficients of <b>permeability</b> were determined for moisture contents up to the liquid limit of the soil. It is shown that a minimum value of permeability is obtained close to optimum moisture content and that this is maintained to within sensible ngineering limits for moisture contents up to that of the liquid limit. Results obtained for predominantly granular <b>soils</b> confirm that <b>permeability</b> is a function of density but, for more cohesive <b>soils,</b> <b>permeability</b> is unaffected by changes in moisture content wet of optimum. Conclusions emphasise that to achieve minimum possible coefficients of permeability {{there is a need for}} soil water content at placement to be at or slightly above optimum moisture content and for pelletization ofclay material...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{simulations of}} Cone Penetration Test (CPT) in water-saturated soft soils {{taking into account}} pore pressure dissipation during installation. Besides modelling interaction between soil skeleton and pore fluid, the problem involves large soil deformations {{in the vicinity of}} the penetrometer, soil–structure interaction, and complex non-linear response of soil. This makes such simulations challenging. Depending on the <b>soil’s</b> <b>permeability</b> and compressibility, undrained, partially drained or drained conditions might occur. Partially drained conditions are commonly encountered in soils such as silts and sand–clay mixtures. However, this is often neglected in CPT interpretation, which may lead to inaccurate estimates of soil properties. This paper aims at improving the understanding of the penetration process in different drainage conditions through advanced numerical analyses. A two-phase Material Point Method is applied to simulate large soil deformations and generation and dissipation of excess pore pressures during penetration. The constitutive behaviour of soil is modelled with the Modified Cam Clay model. Numerical results are compared with experimental data showing good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{remediate}} contaminated land, a new process of electrokinetic purging of heavy metals from saturated soil is examined by laboratory experiments. Electrokinetic soil remediation {{is one of}} the most promising soil decontamination processes as it has high removal efficiency and time-effectiveness in low <b>permeability</b> <b>soils</b> such as clay. Being combined with several mechanisms-electromigration, electroosmosis, diffusion and electrolysis of water, electrokinetic soil processing can remove non-polar organics as well as ionic contaminants. This study suggests that the removal efficiencies for Pb and Cd are significantly influenced by applied voltage and current, type of purging solutions, <b>soil</b> pH, <b>permeability</b> and zeta potential of soil. The removal efficiencies for Pb and Cd were 75 – 85 % for the kaolinite soil and 50 – 70 % for the tailing soil over the duration of 4 days.
