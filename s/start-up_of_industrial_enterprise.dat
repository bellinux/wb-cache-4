40|$|The {{objective}} of this scientific research {{is to develop a}} theoretical model of organizational and technology-related processes <b>of</b> reorganization <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprises,</b> as well as their interaction. Multipoint logic notions of growth and interaction phases are used as research methods. The author describes the basic stages of reorganization, the life cycle <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprises</b> and the cycle of their transformation. The processes are presented as an infographical image that represents a concentric model of interaction. This concentric model represents interaction between two or more phases. The process is entitled infografical modeling on the polyfunctional level. The concentric model moves both clockwise and anti-clockwise. Basic organizational and technological processes <b>of</b> reorganization <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprises</b> that include decision making in terms of expediency of reorganization, design, construction, and performance <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprises</b> at full capacity, and further operation <b>of</b> the <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprise</b> are described in the paper. Attainment of this objective, namely, reorganization <b>of</b> an <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprise,</b> involves a huge amount of resources, including labour resources that need interaction with all parties of reorganization; therefore, the concentric model of interaction describing the basic cycle of reorganization, the life cycle <b>of</b> an <b>industrial</b> <b>enterprise</b> and the cycle of its conversion is a trustworthy representation of this process. The proposed concentric model of interaction should be used in the design of organizational and technology-related processes for integrated consideration of reorganization of enterprises required to understand and improve the efficiency of reorganizations and to control the reorganization <b>of</b> <b>industrial</b> facilities. Рассмотрена поэтапная схема формирования новой модели взаимодействия жизненного цикла и цикла реорганизации.
