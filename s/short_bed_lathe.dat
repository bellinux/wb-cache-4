40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} of the rigidity of an Al-Cu alloy <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> {{to be used for}} high speed machining (HSM) is presented in this work. Mechanical design optimization by means of simulations based on the finite element method (FEM) was applied in order to calculate the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> deflections, the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration amplitudes. For the parametric modeling, a prototype lathe to be used in conventional speed machining (CSM) with a cast iron bed was considered. The optimized parameter was the stress in the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed,</b> considering as a restriction the allowable deflection in a node of the machine-tool structure. The design variables were the height, the thickness, and the length of the wall of the <b>lathe</b> <b>bed.</b> The <b>lathe</b> <b>bed</b> was loaded with cutting and inertial forces due to HSM in order to demonstrate that the evaluated stresses and vibration amplitudes are in an acceptable level according to ISO Standards (system of limits and fits in workpieces). The results show the feasibility of using an Al-Cu alloy instead of cast iron in the fabrication of <b>lathe</b> <b>beds.</b> This increases the flexibility of manufacture...|$|R

50|$|In {{the craft}} of woodturning, a banjo is a common term for a fixture on the wood lathe, mounted on the <b>lathe's</b> <b>bed,</b> for holding the toolrest. It allows for {{adjustment}} of the toolrest in various positions, by the lathe operator, {{making it possible to}} hold the turning tool in the most convenient position for removing material from the spinning wood. The chosen position of the fixture can be locked in place on the <b>lathe's</b> <b>bed</b> in various ways, the most common method being a lever at the forward end of the fixture which acts upon an eccentric shaft with an attached clamp to secure the fixture to the <b>lathe's</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective. This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} specific findings related to acute posttraumatic atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation in pediatric patients. Methods. We studied 14 children with acute atlanto-axial rotatory subluxations {{admitted to a}} hospital over a 5 -year period after craniocervical injury. Clinical and radiological findings were reviewed to identify new findings related to atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation. Results. Most patients exhibited a typical picture of atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation, but one child also experienced transient blindness that was related to peculiar anatomical findings on neuroradiological images. A characteristic C 2 -C 3 anterior pseudo-subluxation was detected among the radiographic signs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no clear break in the alar ligaments, which were oriented horizontally. However, unlike the case in adult anatomy, in these children, the alar ligaments were laterally attached at the occipital condyle-axis condylar joints. In all children, atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation spontaneously reduced {{within a few hours}} after <b>short</b> <b>bed</b> rest without halter traction but with a cervical collar. No recurrence was observed during follow-up. Conclusions. Acute posttraumatic atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation in pediatric-aged patients is a rapidly resolving disease of the cranio-cervical junction. The disease appears to be related to an elasticity of the contralateral alar ligament, which is attached to the occipital condyle-axis condylar joint. Neurological symptoms (blindness) occurred in one patient when the vertebrobasilar blood flow was impaired and no compensation was provided from the anterior circulation. Use of a cervical collar and <b>short</b> <b>bed</b> rest without halter traction is recommended, based on our observations of complete recovery and no recurrence following the use of this treatment strategy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo achieve short mass {{transfer}} zones that enable arsenic removal under high hydraulic loading rates and <b>short</b> empty <b>bed</b> contact times needed for small point-of-use packed bed applications, hybrid media {{was developed and}} tested. Cross-linked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate copolymer support media was synthetized, amino modified and in-situ impregnated by goethite nanoparticles via an oxidative deposition in a hydrophilic/hydrophobic (water/xylene) system. The media properties were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface area analysis. Arsenic removal capabilities of the hybrid goethite impregnated media were evaluated by conducting batch sorption tests, developing isotherms and simulating the breakthrough curve with a pore surface diffusion model (PSDM), after being verified by a <b>short</b> <b>bed</b> column (SBC) test. The high porous media (ep[*]≈[*] 0. 7) contained ∼ 16 % of iron and exhibited Freundlich adsorption capacity parameter of K[*]≈[*] 369 (µg g− 1) (L µg− 1) 1 /n and Freundlich intensity parameter of 1 /n[*]≈[*] 0. 54.
