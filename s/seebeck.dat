25|$|Although Goethe's {{work was}} {{rejected}} by physicists, a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it, including Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck,</b> Arthur Schopenhauer (see: OnVision and Colors), Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolf Steiner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Mitchell Feigenbaum.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Seebeck</b> {{coefficient}} of uranium dioxide {{at room temperature}} is about 750 µV/K, a value {{significantly higher than the}} 270 µV/K of thallium tin telluride (Tl2SnTe5) and thallium germanium telluride (Tl2GeTe5) and of bismuth-tellurium alloys, other materials promising for thermoelectric power generation applications and Peltier elements.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the best}} known {{scientists}} related to Estonia include astronomers Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, Ernst Öpik and Jaan Einasto, biologist Karl Ernst von Baer, Jakob von Uexküll, chemists Wilhelm Ostwald and Carl Schmidt, economist Ragnar Nurkse, matematician Edgar Krahn, medical researchers Ludvig Puusepp and Nikolay Pirogov, physicist Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck,</b> political scientist Rein Taagepera, psychologist Endel Tulving and Risto Näätänen, semiotician Yuri Lotman.|$|E
25|$|Ideal {{thermoelectric}} {{materials have}} a high <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. Low thermal conductivity is necessary to maintain a high thermal gradient at the junction. Standard thermoelectric modules manufactured today consist of P- and N-doped bismuth-telluride semiconductors sandwiched between two metallized ceramic plates. The ceramic plates add rigidity and electrical insulation to the system. The semiconductors are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel.|$|E
25|$|In 1800, English chemists William Nicholson and Johann Wilhelm Ritter {{succeeded in}} {{separating}} water into {{hydrogen and oxygen}} by electrolysis. Soon thereafter, Ritter discovered the process of electroplating. He also observed {{that the amount of}} metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic process depended on the distance between the electrodes. By 1801 Ritter had observed thermoelectric currents, which anticipated the discovery of thermoelectricity by Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1821, the Estonian-German physicist, Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck,</b> {{demonstrated}} the electrical {{potential in the}} juncture points of two dissimilar metals {{when there is a}} temperature difference between the joints. He joined a copper wire with a bismuth wire to form a loop or circuit. Two junctions were formed by connecting the ends of the wires to each other. He then accidentally discovered that if he heated one junction to a high temperature, and the other junction remained at room temperature, a magnetic field was observed around the circuit.|$|E
500|$|Wittekind and sister-ship Willehad {{were both}} quickly {{found to be}} {{deficient}} in cargo space, and plans were made to lengthen both vessels (though Willehad was never lengthened). Wittekind 's bridge was moved forward and a cargo hatch was installed behind it. After this, the ship was cut into two parts forward of the bridge's new position, and a new [...] section was inserted, which greatly increased the cargo capacity. Sources disagree as to where the procedure was performed with one reporting it was performed at the <b>Seebeck</b> Yard in Germany, while another claims it was done by Tyne Pontoons & Drydock Co., at Newcastle. Wherever the work was performed, it was completed by March 1900.|$|E

2500|$|Sales of stamps to {{collectors}} {{who do not}} {{use them}} for mailing can result in large profits. Good examples of excessive issues have been (1) the stamps produced by Nicholas F. <b>Seebeck</b> and (2) stamps produced for the component states of the United Arab Emirates. <b>Seebeck</b> operated in the 1890s {{as an agent of}} Hamilton Bank Note Company. He approached Latin American countries with an offer to produce their entire postage stamp needs for free. In return he would have exclusive rights to market stamps to collectors. Each year a new issue would be produced, but would expire {{at the end of the}} year. This assured <b>Seebeck</b> of a continuing supply of remainders. In the 1960s, printers such as the Barody Stamp Company contracted to produce stamps for the separate Emirates and other countries. The sparse population of the desert states made it wholly unlikely that many of these stamps would ever be used for mailing purposes, and earned them the name of the [...] "sand dune" [...] countries. Another example of what might be considered by some to be excessive issues is that, at the time of the millennium, the United Kingdom issued 96 different stamps over about 24 months, all for pre-existing values with the same four rates for each set.|$|E
2500|$|In 1821, Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck</b> {{discovered}} that a thermal gradient formed between two dissimilar conductors produces a voltage. [...] At {{the heart of the}} thermoelectric effect is the fact that a temperature gradient in a conducting material results in heat flow; this results in the diffusion of charge carriers. The flow of charge carriers between the hot and cold regions in turn creates a voltage difference. In 1834, Jean Charles Athanase Peltier {{discovered that}} running an electric current through the junction of two dissimilar conductors could, depending on the direction of the current, cause it to act as a heater or cooler. The heat absorbed or produced is proportional to the current, and the proportionality constant is known as the Peltier coefficient. Today, due to knowledge of the <b>Seebeck</b> and Peltier effects, thermoelectric materials can be used as heaters, coolers and generators (TEGs).|$|E

2500|$|In 1821, the German {{physicist}} Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck</b> {{discovered that}} when different metals are {{joined at the}} ends {{and there is a}} temperature difference between the joints, a magnetic field is observed. At the time <b>Seebeck</b> referred to this as thermo-magnetism. The magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use, the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures. [...] The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire used. [...] Generally, the voltage is in the microvolt range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement. [...] Although very little current flows, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction. [...] Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a thermopile, is common.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{solar panels}} were not {{practical}} at Jupiter's {{distance from the}} Sun; the spacecraft would have needed a minimum of [...] of panels. Chemical batteries would likewise be prohibitively large due to technological limitations. The solution was two radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) which powered the spacecraft through the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. The heat emitted by this decay was converted into electricity through the solid-state <b>Seebeck</b> effect. This provided a reliable and long-lasting source of electricity unaffected by the cold environment and high-radiation fields in the Jovian system.|$|E
2500|$|He did not {{recognise}} that {{an electric}} current was being generated when heat {{was applied to}} a bi-metal junction. He used the term [...] "thermomagnetic currents" [...] or [...] "thermomagnetism" [...] to express his discovery. Over the following two years, he reported on his continuing observations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences, where he described his observation as [...] "the magnetic polarization of metals and ores produced by a temperature difference." [...] This <b>Seebeck</b> effect became {{the basis of the}} thermocouple, which is still considered the most accurate measurement of temperature today. [...] The converse Peltier effect was seen over a decade later when a current was run through a circuit with two dissimilar metals, resulting in a temperature difference between the metals.|$|E
2500|$|Turnbull {{played the}} first seven games of the 1998 season, again as a back-up ruckman to Gardiner, but was dropped after a round 7 game against [...] where he only managed one {{disposal}} and one hit-out. He was recalled for the round 12 game against Hawthorn, but re-dropped after again managing only one disposal and one hit-out. He {{spent the rest of}} the 1998 season with East Perth in the WAFL. Turnbull did not play for the Eagles in the 1999 season, with Gardiner and Jason Ball the first-choice ruck combination. He played 17 games for East Perth in the WAFL, and was considered one of the favourites for the Sandover Medal, eventually losing to Gus <b>Seebeck</b> by one vote. He also won a third F. D. Book Medal as East Perth's best and fairest. Turnbull re-established himself in the Eagles' team for the 2000 season, playing all 22 games. He played as the first-choice ruckman in the second half of the season after an injury to Gardiner.|$|E
6000|$|... 349. With {{regard to}} thermo-electricity, (that {{beautiful}} form of electricity discovered by <b>Seebeck,)</b> the very {{conditions under which}} it is excited are such as to give no ground for expecting {{that it can be}} raised like common electricity to any high degree of tension; the effects, therefore, due to that state are not to be expected. The sum of evidence respecting its analogy to the electricities already described, is, I believe, as follows:--Tension. The attractions and repulsions due to a certain degree of tension have not been observed. In currents: i. Evolution of Heat. I am not aware that its power of raising temperature has been observed. ii. Magnetism. It was discovered, and is best recognised, by its magnetic powers. iii. Chemical decomposition has not been effected by it. iv. Physiological effects. Nobili has shown[A] that these currents are able to cause contractions in the limbs of a frog. v. Spark. The spark has not yet been seen.|$|E
5000|$|If the Thomson {{coefficient}} of a material is measured {{over a wide}} temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients. This {{needs to be done}} only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute <b>Seebeck</b> {{coefficient of}} the reference material. (for more details on absolute <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient determination, see <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient) ...|$|E
50|$|Although only {{relative}} <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients {{are important}} for externally measured voltages, the absolute <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient can be important for other effects where voltage is measured indirectly. Determination of the absolute <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient therefore requires more complicated techniques and is more difficult, however such measurements have been performed on standard materials. These measurements only had to be performed once for all time, and for all materials; for any other material, the absolute <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient {{can be obtained by}} performing a relative <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient measurement against a standard material.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Seebeck</b> {{coefficients}} generally vary {{as function}} of temperature, and depend strongly on {{the composition of}} the conductor. For ordinary materials at room temperature, the <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient may range in value from −100 μV/K to +1,000 μV/K (see <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient article for more information).|$|E
50|$|In {{the table}} below are <b>Seebeck</b> {{coefficients}} {{at room temperature}} for some common, nonexotic materials, measured relative to platinum.The <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient of platinum itself is approximately −5 μV/K at room temperature, and so the values listed below should be compensated accordingly. For example, the <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients of Cu, Ag, Au are 1.5 μV/K, and of Al −1.5 μV/K. The <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient of semiconductors very much depends on doping, with generally positive values for p doped materials and negative values for n doping.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} voltage shift {{expressed}} by the <b>Seebeck</b> effect cannot be measured directly, since the measured voltage (by attaching a voltmeter) contains an additional voltage contribution, due to the temperature gradient and <b>Seebeck</b> effect in the measurement leads. The voltmeter voltage is always dependent on relative <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients among the various materials involved.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Seebeck</b> {{coefficient}} {{is about}} 450 μV/K {{at room temperature}} for pure MoTe2, but this drops to 0 for MoTe1.95. The <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient increases as temperature drops.|$|E
50|$|In 1854, Lord Kelvin found {{relationships}} between the three coefficients, implying that the Thomson, Peltier, and <b>Seebeck</b> effects are different manifestations of one effect (uniquely characterized by the <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Seebeck</b> {{coefficient}} (also {{known as}} thermopower, thermoelectric power, and thermoelectric sensitivity) of a material {{is a measure}} of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across that material, as induced by the <b>Seebeck</b> effect. The SI unit of the <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient is volts per kelvin (V/K), although it is more often given in microvolts per kelvin (μV/K).|$|E
50|$|The use of {{materials}} {{with a high}} <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient {{is one of many}} important factors for the efficient behaviour of thermoelectric generators and thermoelectric coolers. More information about high-performance thermoelectric materials {{can be found in the}} Thermoelectric materials article. In thermocouples the <b>Seebeck</b> effect is used to measure temperatures, and for accuracy it is desirable to use materials with a <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient that is stable over time.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} the absolute <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient {{is difficult to}} measure directly, since the voltage output of a thermoelectric circuit, as measured by a voltmeter, only depends on differences of <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients. This is because electrodes attached to a voltmeter must be placed onto the material {{in order to measure}} the thermoelectric voltage. The temperature gradient then also typically induces a thermoelectric voltage across one leg of the measurement electrodes. Therefore, the measured <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient is a contribution from the <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient of the material of interest and the material of the measurement electrodes. This arrangement of two materials is usually called a thermocouple.|$|E
50|$|Deschimag was {{dissolved}} after war but AG Weser and <b>Seebeck</b> AG shipyards again {{survived and}} continued in shipbuilding. Due to mismanagement and unsatisfactory and too late responses to market demands AG Weser was declared bankrupt in 1983 and operations {{were shut down}} while <b>Seebeck</b> shipyard {{became part of the}} Bremer Vulkan Verbund AG. Later in 1988 it merged with Schichau Shipyard to SSW Schichau <b>Seebeck</b> Shipyard GmbH, which closed in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1808, <b>Seebeck</b> {{was first}} to produce and {{describe}} the amalgam of potassium. In 1810, he observed the magnetic properties of nickel and cobalt. In 1818, <b>Seebeck</b> discovered the optical activity of the solutions of sugar.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "thermoelectric effect" [...] {{encompasses}} three separately identified effects: the <b>Seebeck</b> effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect. The <b>Seebeck</b> and Peltier {{effects are}} different {{manifestations of the}} same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the Peltier-Seebeck effect (the separation derives from the independent discoveries of French physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier and Baltic German physicist Thomas Johann <b>Seebeck).</b> The Thomson effect {{is an extension of}} the Peltier-Seebeck model and is credited to Lord Kelvin.|$|E
5000|$|In the Drude-Sommerfeld {{degenerate}} {{free electron}} gas with scattering, {{the value of}} [...] is of order [...] , where [...] is the Fermi temperature, and so a typical value of the <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient in the Fermi gas is [...] (the prefactor varies somewhat depending on details such as dimensionality and scattering). In highly conductive metals the Fermi temperatures are typically around 104 - 105 K, {{and so it is}} understandable why their absolute <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients are only of order 1 - 10 μV/K at room temperature. Note that whereas the free electron gas is expected to have a negative <b>Seebeck</b> coefficient, real metals actually have complicated band structures and may exhibit positive <b>Seebeck</b> coefficients (examples: Cu, Ag, Au).|$|E
