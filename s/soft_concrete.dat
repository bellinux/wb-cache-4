Result shows that ground material has great influence on the crashworthiness of civil aircraft.

The ground was graded upwards beyond the end of the runway to cover the tunnels. Earlier in the decade, a 500 ft overrun area was added to the east (10) end of this runway. An Engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS) of about 200 ft was added to this extension. The EMAS consists of <b>soft</b> rubberized <b>concrete</b> into which an overrunning aircraft's wheels can sink, and the aircraft ostensibly be stopped safely before it veers onto the grass.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, microanalytical {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} disintegrated field concrete {{that had been used}} to construct a weir within a coal mine in South Africa. The concrete was in contact with polluted mine water, commonly referred to as acid mine drainage (AMD). Accordingly, the concrete weir had been exposed to dynamic conditions associated with flowing AMD. Investigations were conducted by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The field concrete samples examined consisted of <b>soft</b> broken <b>concrete</b> chunks and whitish powdery substance that had crystallized and formed a surface coating on the widely cracked locations of the deteriorated concrete. No evidence of sulphate attack or pyrite oxidation was found in the investigation; acid attack mechanism was diagnosed...|$|R

It {{should also be noted that}} in the perpendicular side of the trench (which was much deeper than is represented in Fig. 8) three recent burrows were seen, which ran obliquely far down beneath the base of the old wall.|$|R
50|$|Science Expo is {{also known}} for their Ambassadors Program. The Ambassadors Program {{consists}} of more than 80 high school students from across Canada representing 40 different cities and regions. As an Ambassador for Science Expo, students support the Outreach Team by organizing various activities, initiatives, and events. Every November, more than 30 information sessions are organized, with the aim to catalyze a chain reaction of awareness on STEM opportunities. The purpose of this event is to inspire interest in STEM and {{to encourage students to}} participate academically outside of school. The value of this event does not lie in showcasing large scale opportunities though, but instead locally based opportunities and personal experiences. From the Ambassadors Program, students leave with developed <b>soft</b> and <b>concrete</b> skills, but also with experience, expanded professional networks, new friends, and the most important a memorable experience.|$|R

This notable increase in deformation capacity of the heat-damaged columns is attributed to the heat-induced micro-cracking and the removal of water which makes <b>concrete</b> <b>soft</b> and more porous. As such, concrete that has been subjected to elevated temperatures is expected to exhibit more lateral dilation, as compared to unheated concrete, under axial compression.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new instrumented Proctor test using a Hopkinson bar {{which allows for}} the original measurement of forces and velocities during the impact loading on <b>soft</b> fresh <b>concrete</b> samples. For this purpose, the specific points of using low impedance Nylon bar {{as well as the}} two-point measurement method to recover coupled waves are discussed. The whole test consists of successive impacts of low velocity (less than 3 m/s) exerted on the compressible specimen of a fresh concrete. The proposed original measurement allows for a quantitative comparison of the behaviour of the fresh concrete submitted to quasi-static and impact compaction. It shows that impact compaction is more efficient than quasi-static case. However, the increase of the impact velocity seems to reduce the efficiency. There exists probably an optimal loading path. The further understanding of the behaviour of fresh concrete under low velocity impact should be an interesting way to improve the industrial compacting process...|$|R

40|$|This paper formulates an {{appropriate}} seismic design approach for tall buildings in Hong Kong. Particular care is given for local consideration of Hong Kong and a unique proposal is put forward. A single 2475 -year return period hazard level is fostered as the performance goal, {{followed by a}} site specific design spectrum. Cracked stiffness is suggested for <b>softer</b> damaged <b>concrete</b> behaviour, implicitly considering material non-linearity in a pseudo inelastic response spectrum analysis. Material expected strength and unity value of material safety factor are proposed to avoid over-conservatism considering non-collapse performance state. The capacity design philosophy is incorporated with identification of force-controlled and deformation-controlled actions on members, allowing over-strength factor to elevate the demand on force-controlled members. Simplified global (drift) and local component (strength) acceptance criteria are suggested with associated procedures and limit. Also, a typical 41 -story reinforced concrete building in Hong Kong is used as an example to further demonstrate the proposed Performance Based Seismic Design (PBSD) approach. The outcome of the analysis and design is well within the acceptable range, with minimal additional cost penalty imposed on the building. The proposed PBSD approach is superior for low-to-moderate seismicity region with no earthquake design consideration {{in the past but}} filled with abundance of “prescriptive code-exceeding” building...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the conceptual underpinnings of Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of “symbolic violence ” {{as a recent}} entry in the sociological tradition that {{is concerned with the}} critique of domination. The concept is a source of some debate and confusion and there is an attempt to clarify its meaning and usage through analysis and examples. The paper also considers the usefulness of the concept in examining forms of domination emerging in the present crisis phase of post 9 / 11 neo-liberalism, and calls for the application of the concept in analyses of human rights violations. It is also proposed that there is a dialectical relationship between symbolic violence and the perpetration of repressive physical violence. Both symbolic violence (<b>soft)</b> and <b>concrete</b> (hard) violence are understood sociologically as forms of social control, and not as biological or psychological expressions of human aggression. The paper reminds the reader of the various challenges in defining violence more generally and also that the way we understand violence has implications for its amelioration. “You cannot cheat with the ‘law of the conservation of violence’: all violence is paid for, and, for example, the structural violence exerted by the financial markets, in the form of layoffs, loss of security, etc., is matched sooner or later in the form of suicides, crime and delinquency, drug addiction, alcoholism, a whole host of minor and major everyday acts of violence...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of using kaolin, a very small particle clay, as partial replacement of fine aggregates in Portland cement concrete (PCC). Kaolin clay is a locally available (Macon, GA, USA) and inexpensive clay mineral. The product, KaMin 90 ©, used has an average particle size of 1. 5 microns and has a low embodied energy. The slump, air void content and compressive strength were examined on samples of PCC with different % of Kaolin. This research indicated the maximum kaolin substitution of fine aggregate for workability. An optimal dosage range for PCC cylinder compressive strength was also defined and found to be 33 % greater than the control group. It was also noted that Kaolin engenders a <b>soft</b> and cohesive <b>concrete</b> mix that prevents segregation.

30|$|Recycled asphalt {{pavement}} (RAP) use in construction of {{asphalt pavement}}s {{is a common}} practice. Recent research studies examined the feasibility of incorporating RAP in Portland cement concrete (Huang et al. 2005, 2006). Two gradations of RAP (coarse and fine) materials were considered to replace the fresh aggregate from a control concrete mixture. The slump of concrete made with only coarse or fine RAP was {{lower than that of}} control concrete. While the slump of concrete made with both coarse and fine RAP was higher than that of control mix. The reason could be probably attributed to the asphalt coating around both coarse and fine RAP so that less water could be absorbed by the aggregates (Huang et al. 2005, 2006). The strength of concrete made with both coarse and fine RAP decreased the most among the RAP mixtures. The authors attributed the reduction in strength {{due to the fact that}} asphalt film around the aggregate particle was much <b>softer</b> than the <b>concrete</b> matrix and aggregate. Concrete made with only coarse RAP shows the least reduction in the strength of the RAP concretes and significant increase in toughness. Thus it might be more practical to incorporate a certain portion of coarse RAP to replace coarse aggregate (CA) (Huang et al. 2005, 2006).|$|R

The objective of the research was to assess the legal and political grounds for functioning national minority councils as participation and consultative mechanisms, scope of responsibilities and capacities in relation to their effectiveness and impact and to identify relevant good practices on such mechanisms. The political and decision-making structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrated lack of actual commitment to the realization of the rights of minorities referring to participation in decision-making processes. Bearing in mind formal position within parliaments, visibility, and a significant promotional capacity for presence in the public sphere, the councils on national minorities may represent a significant body and channel for the minority – majority dialogue. However, at the moment, the national minority councils’ capacity to ensure participation of national minorities in Bosnian political life and their influence in decision-making process remains insufficient. In general, the consultative mechanisms, within their mandated responsibilities, have had insignificant and minimal impact on the practical, political and legislative segment...|$|R
