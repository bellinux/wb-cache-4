The combined use of different electro-magnetic and magneto-elastic quantities enables the evaluation of <b>stress</b> <b>states</b> of parts with an inhomogeneous microstructure and characterization of microstructural states in terms of hardness of strength values.

Such understanding will be valuable for predicting the ductility of the alloy. The <b>stress</b> <b>states</b> of Si particles are estimated by Raman technique and compared with the microstructure-based FEM simulations.

The residual stress, the stress in the elastic-plastic regime and the stress which causes fracture of the particles is estimated by Raman technique. FEM study demonstrates that the stress distribution is uniform in modified Si, whereas the unmodified Si shows higher and more complex <b>stress</b> <b>states.</b> The onset of plastic flow is observed at sharp corners of the particles and is followed by localization of strain between particles. Clustering of particles generates more inhomogeneous plastic strain in the matrix. Particle stress estimated by Raman technique is in agreement with FEM calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the <b>stress</b> <b>state</b> within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous <b>stress</b> <b>state</b> found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost.

2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial static stress field. This is a non-linear effect of the constitutive relation between mechanical stress and finite strain in a material of continuous mass. In classical linear elasticity theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress.

40|$|Abstract: Building {{processes}} {{are associated with}} impacts on the ground. The ground's ability to resist the load created by structures or to withhold the impact of earth-moving machines is estimated by the plasticity theory methods. The article presents a theoretical analysis of the <b>stressed</b> <b>state</b> of a layer of disc-shaped bulk material. The obtained theoretical models of the minimal, maximal and extreme <b>stressed</b> <b>states</b> of a layer of the material represent all the possible cases of {{an impact on the}} ground. The equations of theoretical models cannot produce a concrete analytical solution to all of the material's space which is why a method has been evolved for solving the model equations by means of terminal differences. This is substantiated by an example of calculations made in case when the ground sustains an impact of a jet of fluid used by earth-moving machines and other tools of hydraulic mechanization of construction works. The obtained solution makes it possible to create a slide line field containing cycloidal (slide lines are cycloidal) and transient zones. Under the load exceeding critical, the material moves along the slide lines away from the axis (minimally <b>stressed</b> <b>state)</b> and protrudes from the surface outside the stress zone (maximally <b>stressed</b> <b>state).</b> It is noteworthy that once an extra load is added in the protrusion zone, the ground hardens rather than fails.
