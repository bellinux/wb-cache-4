50|$|Captain Voettler found a {{solution}} with the German command of Olgiate Olona, located {{a few meters}} from Prospiano train station from which the material could be easily sent, either to Milan or directly to Mendrisio. General Karl Wolff approved the request and ordered {{the construction of a}} bunker close to the German command of Olgiate Olona to protect the material. The operation was granted to General Hans Layers, responsible of the RuK, located in Como, by the specific request of Captain Joseph Voettler. For the construction of the bunker, General Hans Leyers asked for the collaboration of the German military specialized in defense building, at the time engaged close to the Brennero area. The workforce was recruited and after two months of work, digging under Marnate and removing about 600 mÂ³ of material, the bunker was ready to receive the first shipments of gold.For the final transformation of the gold into blocks, Captain Voettler made an agreement with the Azienda Minerali Metallici Italiani firm located in Milan. Supplied with the blocks, they should have been sent in Marnate, kept in the bunker, and then sent in Mendrisio, Switzerland. However, because of the daily bombing on Milan, the possibility was considered of sending the <b>semi-finished</b> <b>gold</b> directly from Marnate to Switzerland.|$|E
