5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering <b>some</b> <b>serious</b> medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that {{his use of the}} word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first to use the term in a publication.|$|E

5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but <b>some</b> <b>serious</b> injuries also occurred.|$|E
50|$|Cervantes {{intended}} {{his novels}} {{should be to}} Spanish nearly what the novellas of Boccaccio were to Italians. Some are anecdotes, some are romances in miniature, <b>some</b> are <b>serious,</b> <b>some</b> comic; they are written in a light, smooth, conversational style.|$|R

5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. <b>Some</b> <b>serious</b> genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s WNO {{continued}} {{to expand in}} scope. Handel (Rodelinda, 1981) and Martinů (The Greek Passion, 1981) {{were added to the}} company's repertoire, and in 1983 Das Rheingold was staged in the WNO's first Ring cycle, followed by the other three operas of the cycle over the next two years. Das Rheingold, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung were conducted by the company's musical director, Richard Armstrong; Die Walküre (1984) was conducted by Goodall; it was seen as a coup for the company to secure his services – he was described by The Guardian as the greatest living Wagnerian conductor – but the casting of the whole cycle was criticised for <b>some</b> <b>serious</b> weaknesses among the principal singers, and reviewers were generally unimpressed by Göran Järvefelt's production.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{fortress}} had been captured, Murad placed his own garrison of Janissaries and ordered {{his men to}} repair the walls. Perlati and his soldiers came to Skanderbeg, begging for mercy. Skanderbeg pardoned his soldiers for the surrender and even thanked them for holding out {{for as long as}} they did. Skanderbeg continued to shadow the Ottoman army as it headed back home in the hopes of dealing <b>some</b> <b>serious</b> damage, but his forces were not strong enough to risk provoking them. In October of the same year, Murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on John Hunyadi's forces in Kosovo. Skanderbeg had planned to join Hunyadi's offensive with 20,000 men, but he was not able to get there in time due to Đurađ Branković blocking the roads to Kosovo.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{by their}} nature, {{arbitration}} proceedings {{tend not to}} be subject to appeal, in the ordinary sense of the word. However, in most countries, the court maintains a supervisory role to set aside awards in extreme cases, such as fraud {{or in the case of}} <b>some</b> <b>serious</b> legal irregularity on the part of the tribunal.

25|$|In 1989 Frank Salemme, a close confidant of {{the elder}} Patriarca's, was {{released}} from prison.
