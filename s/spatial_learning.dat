5|$|Piglets {{that were}} fed with a formula {{containing}} milk phospholipids and gangliosides to mimic levels in human milk made choices more rapidly and with fewer errors in a spatial T-maze cognitive test compared to controls, implying improved <b>spatial</b> <b>learning.</b> Similarly, Vickers et al. (2009) demonstrated that administration of complex milk lipids to rats from postnatal day 10 through adulthood (day 80) led to {{significant improvements in}} learning and memory tasks compared to control animals.

5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with <b>spatial</b> <b>learning</b> deficits.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in <b>spatial</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in <b>spatial</b> <b>learning</b> is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E

40|$|The human {{cognitive}} system is stunningly powerful {{in some respects}} yet surprisingly limited in others. We can recognize an object or a face in a single glimpse and type 70 words per minute, yet we cannot hold {{more than a few}} objects at a time in working memory or split our attention to several locations. Attention and working memory impose major capacity limitations on cognitive processing. This study focuses on implicit visual learning, a process that allows us to overcome cognitive limitations. We examined variability across individuals in their ability to <b>learn</b> <b>spatial</b> context, and the neural substrates underlying learning. Results showed that variations across normal adults in <b>spatial</b> context <b>learning</b> do not correlate with an individual’s episodic memory or spatial ability, suggesting that limits in an individual’s episodic memory or spatial abilities do not constrain visual implicit learning. The variations are inconsistent across testing sessions, with no single individuals persistently failing to learn.

40|$|In macaque monkeys (Macaco mulatta), {{memory for}} scenes {{presented}} on touch screens is fornix dependent. However, scene learning {{is not a}} purely spatial task, and existing direct evidence for a fornix role in spatial memory comes exclusively from tasks involving learning about food-reward locations. Here the authors demonstrate that fornix transection impairs <b>learning</b> about <b>spatial</b> stimuli presented on touch screens. Using a new concurrent <b>spatial</b> discrimination <b>learning</b> task, they found that fornix transection did not impair recall of preoperatively learned problems. Relearning, on the other hand, was mildly impaired, and new learning was strongly impaired.

25|$|Rats are {{commonly}} used as models of schizophrenia patients. Experimenters create lesions in the ventral hippocampal area shortly after birth, a procedure known as neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioning(NVHL). Adult rats who with NVHL show typical indicators of schizophrenia such as hypersensitivity to psychostimulants, reduced social interactions and impaired prepulse inhibition, working memory and set-shifting. Similar to schizophrenia, impaired rats fail to use environmental context in <b>spatial</b> <b>learning</b> tasks such as showing difficulty completing the radial arm maze and the Moris water maze.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years {{researchers}} {{have used the}} serial reaction time (SRT) task to investigate the nature of <b>spatial</b> sequence <b>learning.</b> They have used the task to identify the locus of <b>spatial</b> sequence <b>learning,</b> identify situations that enhance and those that impair learning, and identify the important cognitive processes that facilitate this type of learning. Although controversies remain, the SRT task has been integral in {{enhancing our understanding of}} implicit sequence learning. It is important, however, to ask what, if anything, the discoveries made using the SRT task tell us about implicit learning more generally. This review analyzes the state of the current <b>spatial</b> SRT sequence <b>learning</b> literature highlighting the stimulus-response rule hypothesis of sequence learning which we believe provides a unifying account of discrepant SRT data. It also challenges researchers to use the vast body of knowledge acquired with the SRT task to understand other implicit learning literatures too often ignored {{in the context of this}} particular task. This broad perspective will make it possible to identify congruences among data acquired using various different tasks that will allow us to generalize about the nature of implicit learning...|$|R

40|$|The dual-representation {{model of}} {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD; Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, & Burgess, Psychological Review, 117, 210 - 232 2010) argues that intrusions occur when people fail to construct context-based representations during adverse experiences. The present study tested a specific prediction flowing from this model. In particular, we investigated whether the efficiency of temporal-lobe-based <b>spatial</b> configuration <b>learning</b> would account for individual differences in intrusive experiences and physiological reactivity in the laboratory. Participants (N = 82) completed the contextual cuing paradigm, which assesses <b>spatial</b> configuration <b>learning</b> that is believed to depend on associative encoding in the parahippocampus.

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to HZE nuclei on <b>spatial</b> <b>learning,</b> memory behavior, and neuronal signaling have been tested, and threshold doses have also been considered for such effects. It {{will be important to}} understand the mechanisms that are involved in these deficits to extrapolate the results to other dose regimes, particle types, and, eventually, astronauts. Studies on rats were performed using the Morris water maze test 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u 56Fe-ions. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment that was similar to that seen in aged rats. This leads to the possibility that an increase in the amount of ROS may be responsible for the induction of both radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} ethanol to impair both spatial {{long-term}} memory and spatial working memory in various tasks. Chronic ethanol exposure causes deficits in <b>spatial</b> <b>learning</b> and memory tasks. These deficits persist even {{when exposed to}} long periods of ethanol-free time after ethanol exposure, suggesting a long-lasting change in structure and function of the hippocampus, a change in its functional connectome. Whether these changes are due {{to a change in}} place cells or a change in neurotransmission, neuroanatomy, or protein expression in the hippocampus is unknown. However, impairments in using non-spatial components such as cues are not evident in various tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to developmental functions, Notch proteins and ligands {{are expressed in}} cells of the adult nervous system, suggesting a role in CNS plasticity throughout life. Adult mice heterozygous for mutations in either Notch1 or Cbf1 have deficits in <b>spatial</b> <b>learning</b> and memory. Similar results are seen in experiments with presenilins1 and 2, which mediate the Notch intramembranous cleavage. To be specific, conditional deletion of presenilins at 3 weeks after birth in excitatory neurons causes learning and memory deficits, neuronal dysfunction, and gradual neurodegeneration. Several gamma secretase inhibitors that underwent human clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and MCI patients resulted in statistically significant worsening of cognition relative to controls, which {{is thought to be}} due to its incidental effect on Notch signalling.|$|E
