This company was formed after a meeting with Sir Clive and Paul Andrews who {{conceived}} the Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega games console, this was backed by members of the public on a crowd funding site raising over £150,000, and delivered successfully to backers that same year. A second portable console the ZX Spectrum Vega+ was proposed, and crowd funded again, but two of the four founding directors (Paul Andrews and Chris Smith) left the company in April 2016 before the crowd funding finished. They left citing irreconcilable differences between them and the last remaining director Levy. Levy continued with the company installing two replacement directors, Suzanne Martin, and Dr. Janko Mrsic-Flogel, both long term associates of Levy. The Vega+ console was originally intended to be delivered to backers in September 2016, but as of August 2017 the device remains unreleased amid claims of [...] "infighting and legal battles".

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "From 1945 through 1962, the United States {{conducted a series of}} above-ground atomic weapons tests as it built up its Cold War nuclear arsenal. Many people who were exposed to radiation resulting from the nuclear weapons development and testing program subsequently developed serious diseases, including various types of cancer. On October 15, 1990, in order to establish a procedure to make partial restitution to these victims for their suffering associated with the radiation exposure, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) was enacted. RECA provided that the Attorney General be responsible for processing and adjudicating claims under the act. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP), which is administered by its Civil Division. RECP began processing claims in April 1992. RECA has been amended several times, including on July 10, 2000, when the RECA Amendments of 2000 were enacted. The amendments of 2000 broadened the scope of eligibility for benefits coverage to include new victim categories and modified the criteria for determining eligibility for compensation. The 2000 amendments also included a mandate that we report to the Congress on DOJ's administration of RECA not later than 18 months after the enactment of the amendments and every 18 months thereafter. We have reported twice previously on DOJ's administration of RECA. In our last report, we identified the potential for a funding shortage in the compensation trust fund. We recommended that the Attorney General consult with the congressional committees of jurisdiction to develop a strategy to address the gap between current funding levels and the amount of funding estimated to be needed to pay claims projected to be approved over the 2003 to 2011 period. This report follows up on our previous recommendation and updates information on the status of the RECA program, including the (1) <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> available to pay claims and pay program administration costs; (2) status of claims approved, denied, and pending; (3) processing times; and (4) the total of compensation awards. ...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2001, Congress has provided the Department of Defense (DOD) with $ 888 billion in supplemental and annual appropriations, as of June 2009, primarily for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DOD's reported annual obligations for OCO have shown a steady increase from about $ 0. 2 billion in fiscal year 2001 to about $ 162. 4 billion in fiscal year 2008. For fiscal year 2009 OCO, Congress provided DOD with about $ 65. 9 billion {{in the fiscal year}} 2009 DOD Appropriations Act and about $ 80. 0 billion in a supplemental appropriation enacted in June 2009. A total of $ 59. 6 billion has been obligated through the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 through March 2009. The United States' commitments to OCO will likely involve the continued investment of significant resources, requiring decision makers to consider difficult trade-offs as the nation faces an increasing long-range fiscal challenge. The magnitude of future costs will depend on several direct and indirect cost variables and, in some cases, decisions that have not yet been made. DOD's future costs will likely be affected by the pace and duration of operations, the types of facilities needed to support troops overseas, redeployment plans, and the amount of equipment to be repaired or replaced. DOD compiles and reports monthly and cumulative incremental obligations incurred to support OCO in a monthly report commonly called the Contingency Operations <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Funds</b> Report. DOD leadership uses this report, along with other information, to advise Congress on the costs of the war and to formulate future OCO budget requests. DOD reports these obligations by appropriation, contingency operation, and military service or defense agency. DOD has prepared monthly reports on the obligations incurred for its involvement in OCO since fiscal year 2001. Section 1221 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires us to submit quarterly updates to Congress on the costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom based on DOD's monthly cost-of-war reports. This report, which responds to this requirement, contains our analysis of DOD's reported obligations for overseas contingencies through March 2009. Specifically, we assessed (1) DOD's cumulative appropriations and reported obligations for military operations in support of overseas contingencies and (2) DOD's fiscal year 2009 reported obligations from October 2008 through March 2009, the latest data available for OCO by military service and appropriation account. ...|$|E

40|$|Earmarked {{funds are}} {{mentioned}} in the Polish Public Finances Act {{as one of the}} five organisational legal forms of budget management. This article deals with their legal status. Establishing the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds</b> requires a comparative analysis based on administrative and tax law. As an introduction the author discussed the notion <b>of</b> a <b>fund</b> both in colloquial and legal language. Next she analysed the dogmatic and legal definition of this notion on the basis of regulations in force and the doctrine of financial law, pointing to inaccuracies in legal regulations. As a result there are considerable interpretative difficulties e. g. in establishing a catalogue <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds.</b> From the financial and legal point of view it was necessary to consider the legal nature c f revenue and expenditure and the nature of financial plan <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds.</b> The relation between plans <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds</b> and budgetary acts and resolutions was also emphasised. The issues of the legal from <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds</b> and the nature of property administered by the funds required a civil legal analysis. The analysis <b>of</b> administrative legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds</b> is based on the organisational and territorial structures <b>of</b> particular <b>funds,</b> the nature and competence <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> agencies. It seems that the essence <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> was not taken into consideration properly in the Polish tax law. Earmarked funds functioning on the basis of regulations in the Public Finances Act enjoy exemption from tax. Still, the way the issue is settled is debatable. Legal forms on which earmarked funds are based are non-uniform and casuistic. For that reason establishing a catalogue of universal legal properties <b>of</b> earmarked <b>funds</b> is problematic...|$|R

40|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>of</b> Relief Services for Handicapped Children in the Liberec Region The {{theoretical}} part, {{divided into}} eight chapters, defines the following concepts: {{family of a}} handicapped child and society, relief services, domestic public sources to fund relief services, care subsidy, European sources to fund the relief service projects in 2007 [...] 2013, funding relief services by corporate sponsors, funding relief services through foundations and foundation funds, other sources to fund relief services. The objective of the thesis is to summarize the system, possibilities and forms <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> relief services for handicapped children in the Liberec Region. Within my research, I applied the combination of semi-controlled interviews with the relief service providers and semi-controlled interviews with handicapped childrens parents. I also performed content analysis of documents. The semi-controlled interviews with the relief service providers showed that the current <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>of</b> the organizations providing relief services is not systematic. The results of the semi-controlled interviews with handicapped childrens parents indicate that the parents taking care of handicapped children in the Liberec Region barely use relief services. The interviewed parents do not distinguish between relief services and the other types of social services, {{do not know the}} organizations providing relief services in the Liberec Region and do not have even a vague idea of service costs. The research results lead to three hypotheses: the relief service providers in the Liberec Region must learn to utilize strategically both domestic and foreign financial resources. The relief service providers in the Liberec Region have the opportunity to start a long-term cooperation with corporate and individual sponsors. Handicapped childrens parents do not distinguish between relief services and the other types of social services.
