50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a <b>straight</b> <b>thread.</b> In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|E

However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure of the driving shaft thread. The three-dimensional simulation model of driving shaft’s connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory.

40|$|It {{is known}} that in the ladder {{approximation}} the relativistic two-fermion bound-state equation of Bethe and Salpeter has solutions corresponding to the binding energy equal to the total mass of the particles. The study of these massless states {{has been carried out}} only for the bound system at rest. Of course, such composite boson can not be in the state of rest. But it is more importantly that this approach for the massless boson can not be interpreted as the limiting case of a nonzero mass system because the phase velocity of the boson wave must equal to the speed of light. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation, we have obtained the wave equation for the massless bound states of two fermions with equal masses and the electromagnetic interaction between them. Neglecting retardation of the interaction, solutions corresponded to the stationary wave states of the composite boson, have been found. The boson wave function can be represented as an infinite, <b>straight</b> <b>thread,</b> the transverse radius of which is more than the Compton wavelength of the fermion. Two energy branches of the bosons with quantized energies have been determined. The appearance of these branches is due to the strong renormalization of the fine structure constant for the massless states. Comment: 20 pages, no figure...|$|E

Torlen FY HT PES 13. 3 tex multifilament yarn distinguished by increased strength {{was used as}} raw material. Two PES yarns were fed to the nozzle as core threads and one as wrap effect. The properties of threads manufactured alternatively with thermosetting and without it are studied in dependence on overfeed of wrap yarn and pressure of air fed into the texturing nozzle. ZWICK/ROELL BDO-FBO. 5 TH testing machine with a 50 N load cell was used performing the tests. Mechanical properties of the PES multifilament yarns are markedly changed by air-texturing. Breaking tenacities of PES/PES air-textured sewing threads are only one half of those of the raw PES yarn due to core-wrap structure of the air-textured threads and the disordering of filaments of core threads during air-texturing. PES/PES threads are pretty less responsive to loop testing if comparing with <b>straight</b> <b>thread</b> test than the raw PES yarn. Air-pressure and overfeed in texturing are influential factors in respect of stress-strain properties and loop strength of air-textured PES/PES sewing threads. Their influence is markedly affected by thread thermosetting: lower air pressure and overfeed values are advantageous factors while texturing without thermosetting but they are disadvantageous ones while texturing with thermosetting. The thermosetting of threads does not markedly influences relaxation behaviour of air-textured PES/PES threads, but the thermoset threads show to have more stable elastic power at higher strains...|$|E

One of the important nu- merical methods having widespread application in various fields of engineering sciences is the finite element method. Among its wide applications, the study of distribution of power in complex structures can be noted. Objectives: The aim of this research was to assess the geometric effect and the type of implant thread on its performance; we also made an attempt to determine the created stress using finite element method. Materials and Methods: In this study, the three dimensional model of bone by using Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) of the patient has been provided. The implants in this study are designed by Solid Works software. Loading is simulated in explicit dynamic, by struck of a rigid body with the speed of 1 mm/s to implant vertically and horizontally; and the maximum level of induced stress for the cortical and trabecular bone in the ANSYS Workbench software was calculated. Results: By considering the results of this study, it was identified that, among the designed samples, the maximum imposed stress in the cortical bone layer occurred in the first group (<b>straight</b> <b>threads)</b> and the maximum stress value in the trabecular bone layer and implant occurred in the second group (tapered threads). Conclusions: Due to the limitations of this study, the implants with more depth thread, because of the increased contact surface of the implant with the bone, caused more stability; also, the implant with smaller thread and shorter pitch length caused more stress to the bone...|$|R

This thread guide is also positioned retroperitoneally from cranial to caudal, then the vaginal membrane is perforated with this thread guide and the threads executing traction are threaded extraabdominal/extravaginal and then also pulled outside the abdominal wall. Outside the abdomen the threads are held taut by a traction device and tightened daily so that a constant stretching pressure is exerted on the vaginal membrane.|$|R

A detection in the TeV (VHE) was also reported by the MAGIC consortium during this flaring episode. Two prominent sub-flares, peaking about 5 -days apart, were seen in almost all the energy bands.

30|$|As {{a result}} of {{continuous}} changes in business environment and uncertainty of demand and production processes, manufacturing industries are having to develop and evolve rapidly. Therefore, in the future, the production system should be flexible and {{able to respond to}} factor alterations quickly. The system should create high quality products, support small production volumes and meet all needs of customer specifications. Modern production systems consist of high-performance technology and equipment, which increase production capacity. However, at the same time, the system operations become more sophisticated and complex. Manufacturing processes involve inputs from various departments including management, production, finance, marketing, and engineering etc. Hence, the created production system should be able to allow relevant departments to influence the manufacturing operations conveniently and effectively. The production system should consist of the following three components of inputs including manpower, raw materials, machines, energy, money and information; processes including preparation of materials, assembly of all components into various shapes as well as packaging for distribution and outputs including products or outputs in the form of goods or services. Turning is a basic process that is commonly used in various industries. The operation involves rotating the work-piece while moving a cutting tool linearly toward the work-piece to improve the work-piece. Turning can cut or decrease the size of a work-piece by removing external surface with a cutting tool positioned vertically to its rotating axis. Types of turning methods include facing, <b>straight</b> turning, <b>thread</b> turning, boring, necking and parting.

Under the assumption of axial symmetry, implemented by a paraxial array of <b>straight</b> vortices that <b>thread</b> the entire neutron superfluid, {{we are able to}} project exactly the 3 D hydrodynamical problem to a 1 D cylindrical one. In the presence of density dependent entrainment the superfluid rotation is non-columnar: we circumvent this by using an auxiliary dynamical variable directly related to the areal density of vortices. The main result is a system of differential equations that take consistently into account the stratified spherical structure of the star, the dynamical effects of non-uniform entrainment, the differential rotation of the superfluid component and its coupling to the normal crust. These equations represent a mathematical framework in which to test quantitatively the macroscopic consequences of the presence of a stable vortex array, a working hypothesis widely used in glitch models. Even without solving the equations explicitly, we are able to draw some general quantitative conclusions; in particular, we show that the reservoir of angular momentum (corresponding to recent values of the pinning forces) is enough to reproduce the largest glitch observed in the Vela pulsar, provided its mass is not too large.

40|$|Abstract-Various linear enigmas {{exist in}} ancient sacred landscapes world-wide. These include {{examples}} of Native American landscape lines, {{such as the}} Chacoan "roads", New Mexico, and the Nazca "lines", Peru; Neolithic linear earthworks, called "cursuses", in Britain; stone rows in Europe, Malaysia and elsewhere; temple alignments in Indonesia. There is also the ar-chaeologically heretical idea of "leys " (alignments of ancient sites), put for-ward by Englishman Alfred Watkins in 1921. Although the ley theory has long been derided by mainstream scholarship, new German and Dutch find-ings show {{that there was a}} medieval tradition of straight "Doodwegen " (death roads) or "Geisterwege " (ghost paths). It seems Watkins may have unwitting-ly uncovered vestiges of these features. Certainly Watkins had no concept of current "New Age " notions of "energy leylines", which are modem fantasies. It is argued that such medieval features arise out of a deep-seated, universal conceptual complex associating "spirit ways " with straight lines: <b>straight</b> cords and <b>threads</b> in ancient traditional healing practices as well as straight tracks and other ceremonial landscape markings. It is suggested that these ideas have their roots in archaic shamanism, which, throughout Eurasia, in-fluenced later, ceremonial aspects of monarchy. A proto-Indo-European lan-guage vestige is cited. Preliminary evidence is presented indicating that the spirit- line associa-tion derived from the ecstatic "journey " experienced during the shamanic trance. This gave rise to images of "flying shamans " in tribal societies throughout the world, and, ultimately, to the "magical flight of the sovereign " in proto-state and state societies. It is this "flight of the soul " that seems to have been translated onto ancient sacred landscapes as straight lines, which later became variously acculturated as sacred ways, spirit and fairy paths, roads of the dead or of ghosts, or Royal Routes. The neuro-logical aspects of the so-called out-of-body state, and its possible associa-tion with modem psychological epidemics such as "UFO abductions", is al-luded to...|$|R
