Large machines may only have amortisseur bars in the individual pole faces, not interconnected between poles. Because the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>winding</b> is not large enough to dissipate the heat of continuous operation, large synchronous machines often have protective relays to detect when the machine has fallen out of synchronization with the supply voltage.|$|E

Some larger motors have aluminium or copper bars which are welded or brazed to end-rings. Since the voltage developed in the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>winding</b> is very low, no intentional insulation layer is present between the bars and the rotor steel.|$|E
50|$|A {{synchronous}} motor {{may have a}} squirrel-cage winding embedded in its rotor, used to increase the motor starting torque and so decrease the time to accelerate to synchronous speed. The <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> <b>winding</b> of a synchronous machine will generally be smaller than for an induction machine of similar rating. When the rotor is turning {{at the same speed}} as the stator's revolving magnetic field, no current is induced into the squirrel-cage windings and the windings will have no further effect on the operation of the {{synchronous motor}} at steady-state.|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} wind {{energy into the}} power grid, researchers have started focusing more on control and coordination of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) with the other components at system level, especially during fault. It is important to implement a suitable fault ride through control strategy to avoid tripping of the generators when the power system is subjected to voltage dips normally below 90 % of nominal voltage. The dips below 90 % {{may lead to a}} significant loss of generation and frequency collapse, followed by a blackout. This article implements and assesses the methodologies to deal with such situations for <b>squirrel</b> <b>cage</b> induction generator-based <b>wind</b> energy conversion systems employing fully rated power electronic converters. Three distinct control techniques—namely, balanced positive sequence control, positive negative sequence control, and dual current control—have been simulated and applied to grid side converter of SCIG-based WECS. The performance of all the three control strategies has been compared and presented in this work. During this study, the system is subjected to the most common unsymmetrical line to ground (LG) fault and most severe symmetrical LLL fault on grid for the purpose of anaysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a high penetration of <b>Squirrel</b> <b>Cage</b> Induction Generator <b>wind</b> turbines (SCIGs) on the voltage regulation and reactive power compensation on a grid. It shows that SCIGs slow down voltage restoration after a voltage drop and can lead to voltage and rotor speed instability. When the voltage is restored, SCIGs will absorb reactive power and, if the voltage does not return quickly enough, the generator accelerates and consumes larger amounts of reactive power. This situation is exacerbated if the wind turbine is connected to a weak power system. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), can be utilised to maintain the voltage profile and to overcome a transient disturbance after faults. However, existing STATCOMs utilise fixed gain PI controllers that are unable to respond when the system is under extreme conditions such as a three phase to ground fault, sudden wind speed changes, load fluctuations and weak grid support. Therefore, in this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) based self-tuning PI controller is proposed. Simulation studies were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in maintaining the system stability under such conditions...|$|R
