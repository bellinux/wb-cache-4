5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated <b>soundproof</b> blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{businesses}} sometimes use <b>soundproofing</b> technology, {{especially when}} they are an open office design. There are many reasons why a business might implement <b>soundproofing</b> for their office. One of the biggest hindrances in worker productivity are the distracting noises that comes from people talking such as on the phone, or with their co-workers and boss. Noise <b>soundproofing</b> is important in mitigating people from losing their concentration and focus from their work project. It {{is also important to}} keep confidential conversations secure to the intended listeners.|$|R
50|$|Two {{distinct}} <b>soundproofing</b> {{problems may}} need to be considered when designing acoustic treatments - to improve the sound within a room (See anechoic chamber), and reduce sound leakage to/from adjacent rooms or outdoors. Acoustic quieting, noise mitigation, and noise control can be used to limit unwanted noise. <b>Soundproofing</b> can suppress unwanted indirect sound waves such as reflections that cause echoes and resonances that cause reverberation. <b>Soundproofing</b> can reduce the transmission of unwanted direct sound waves from the source to an involuntary listener through the use of distance and intervening objects in the sound path.|$|R
25|$|Isolation — Richard Wiseman {{and others}} argue {{that not all of}} the studies used <b>soundproof</b> rooms, so it is {{possible}} that when videos were playing, the experimenter could have heard it, and later given involuntary cues to the receiver during the selection process. It could even have been possible that the receiver themselves could hear the video.|$|E

25|$|Boeing {{considered}} {{safety features}} highly, building in structural strength {{as well as}} incorporating design elements that enhanced customer comfort and well-being, such as the thermostatically-controlled, air conditioned and <b>soundproof</b> cabin. The crew included a pilot and copilot {{as well as a}} flight attendant who could tend to passenger needs. The main landing gear did not fully retract; a portion of the wheels extended below the nacelles, typical of designs of the time, as a means of reducing structural damage in a wheels-up landing. The tailwheel was not retractable. While the Model 247 and 247A had speed-ring engine cowlings and fixed-pitch propellers, the Model 247D incorporated NACA cowlings and variable-pitch propellers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of our {{development}} is increasing the sound insulation abilities to maximum possible value. <b>Soundproofing</b> panel {{with a maximum}} <b>soundproofing</b> ability, protected by patent to Russia, pertains to technical protection facility against noise spreading by sound insulation that is to anti-noise panel. The most efficient is using such panels as filler structure for so named reverberated cameras, where {{it is necessary to}} provide frequentative reflection of the sound (that means big coefficient of the reflection and small coefficient of the sound transmission through filler structure). The technical result of the {{development is}} full minimization of coefficient of sound transmission through internal cavity, that leads to provision maximum possible <b>soundproofing</b> ability. Besides, expansion of the structured sound is prevented by the special design with the noncontact attachment point. Anti-noise panel with maximum sound insulation ability today is the most efficient <b>soundproofing</b> facility among such devices...|$|R
25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized <b>soundproof</b> booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E
25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. Every bit of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point where it does not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a <b>soundproof</b> room back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E

In addition to his existing work he accepted a lectureship in composition at the University of Reading and joined Vaughan Williams in teaching composition at their alma mater the RCM. Inspired by Adrian Boult's conducting classes at the RCM, Holst tried to further pioneer music education for women by proposing to the High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School that he should invite Boult to give classes at the school: [...] "It would be glorious if the SPGS turned out the only women conductors in the world!" [...] In his <b>soundproof</b> room at SPGS he composed the Ode to Death, a setting of a poem by Whitman, which according to Vaughan Williams {{is considered by many}} to be Holst's most beautiful choral work.|$|E

500|$|Farmer first {{married in}} the mid-1950s, to a woman from South America; the couple had one son, Arthur Jr, who died in 1994, and they {{divorced}} after about a year. Farmer's second wife was a distant cousin; this also ended in divorce. He married again, to a Viennese banker named Mechtilde Lawgger, and their son, Georg, {{was born in the}} early 1970s. They lived together in a house that they had built in Vienna, and Farmer reported contentment with his lifestyle; notably, in contrast with his homeland, he did not experience racism in Europe. Farmer described himself in 1985 as [...] "an introvert, and kind of reclusive"; a <b>soundproof</b> room in his Austrian house allowed him to practice alone for the four or five hours a day that he desired. His personality was often described by others as mirroring his playing: Leonard Feather, for instance, observed in 1990 that Farmer was [...] "mellow, relaxed and [...] gentle".|$|E
500|$|At {{the behest}} of XL owner Richard Russell, the xx {{recorded}} their debut album at the label's small, in-house recording studio—XL Studio—making them the first act to record there. It was once the head office building's rear garage before Russell transformed it {{at the beginning of}} 2008 into a makeshift writing, rehearsal, and demo space for XL's artists. McDonald was assigned in September to manage and properly equip the room, which he liked because it was <b>soundproof</b> and [...] "isolated {{from the rest of the}} office, so it wasn't like you were working in the record company's presence." [...] Croft, on the other hand, called it a [...] "pretty confined space" [...] the size of a bathroom. Over the next few months, McDonald and Pawson prepared a budget for the label to fund the studio's preliminary setup, which would have recording equipment specifically suited for the xx, including a modestly sized soundboard ideal for recording a small group.|$|E
500|$|Storyboards {{were used}} {{throughout}} the season, to [...] "put the director, stunts, camera, FX and the crew on the same page", though Joss Whedon did not use them for the pilot. One of the storyboard artists, Warren Drummond, noted the process was different to that on films, because there was limited time to complete the work, and because the storyboard artists were often working with different directors for each episode. Most of the sequences storyboarded were action or science fiction sequences. The main recurring setting for the season is the Bus, a retrofitted Boeing C-17, that serves as both the transportation and headquarters of the titular team. The Bus includes such features as a <b>soundproof</b> interrogation room, a forensics and research lab located on the lower deck, where Fitz and Simmons work, and a cargo hold directly outside the lab where the team parks its SUV and Lola, Coulson's prized 1962 Corvette.|$|E
