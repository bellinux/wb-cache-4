50|$|Amphimallon solstitiale, {{also known}} as the <b>summer</b> <b>chafer</b> or European june beetle, is a beetle similar to the {{cockchafer}} but much smaller, approximately 20 mm in length. They are declining in numbers now, but where found they are often seen in large numbers. At dusk they actively fly around tree tops looking for a mate and can often be found drowning in pools of water the following morning. They are also attracted to light and come in through open, lit windows and fly around lamps, making quite a racket while bumping into lights. They are found throughout the Palearctic region, commonly seen from June to August, living in meadows, hedgerows, and gardens, and eating plants and tree foliage.|$|E
