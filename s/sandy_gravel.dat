5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or <b>sandy</b> <b>gravel.</b> It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E

25|$|In {{the centre}} a {{carriageway}} {{was built on}} a raised agger after stripping off soft topsoil, using the best local materials, often sand or <b>sandy</b> <b>gravel.</b> The two strips of ground between the agger and the boundary ditches were used by pedestrians and animals, and were sometimes lightly metalled. The agger was sometimes, but not always, bordered by deep ditches to take rainwater and keep the road structure as dry as possible.|$|E

60|$|He {{turned off}} the light; there {{was the end of}} the stick, and there was the little patch of <b>sandy</b> <b>gravel,</b> which he stepped upon, {{stamping}} heavily as he did so. He then retired outside the screen. Professor Tippengray turned to the audience.|$|E
60|$|Besides, {{look at it}} {{in another}} light. Over large areas together, the {{conditions}} of air, climate, and rainfall are practically identical. But soil differs greatly from place to place. Here it's black; there it's yellow; here it's rich loam; there it's boggy mould or <b>sandy</b> <b>gravel.</b> And some soils are better adapted to growing certain plants than others. Rich lowlands and oolites suit the cereals; red marl produces wonderful grazing grass; bare uplands are best for gorse and heather. Hence everything favours for the practical man the mistaken idea that plants and trees grow mainly out of the soil. His own eyes tell him so; he sees them growing, he sees the visible result undeniable before his face; while the real act of feeding off the carbon in the air is wholly unknown to him, being realizable only by the aid of the microscope, aided by the most delicate and difficult chemical analysis.|$|E
60|$|Further on {{for several}} miles the drive lay through an open heath, dotted {{occasionally}} with fir plantations, the trees of which told the tale of their species without help from outline or colour; they spoke in those melancholy moans and sobs which give to their sound a solemn sadness surpassing even that of the sea. From each carriage-lamp the long rays stretched like feelers into the air, and somewhat cheered the way, until the insidious damp that pervaded all things above, around, and underneath, overpowered one of them, and rendered every attempt to rekindle it ineffectual. Even had the two men's dislike to each other's society been less, the general din of the night would have prevented much talking; as it was, they sat in a rigid reticence that was almost a third personality. The roads were laid hereabouts with a light <b>sandy</b> <b>gravel,</b> which, though not clogging, was soft and friable. It speedily became saturated, and the wheels ground heavily and deeply into its substance.|$|E

40|$|Over its 25 km. length the Norwood esker {{traverses}} two morphologically different areas, {{a northern}} section of kame, and a southern section of elongated drumlins. In the north the esker consists of single and multiple ridges: where multiple, the ridges are superimposed on a lower, broader, plateau-like base. In the south a high, steep-sided single ridge is present. In both areas, where single, the ridge splits locally into two narrower ridges which region {{a short distance}} downstream. Internally, the esker contains mostly cross-laminated sands, tough-shaped and tabular sets of cross-bedded sands and <b>gravel,</b> and matrix-supported <b>sandy</b> <b>gravels.</b> The cross-laminated sands occur most frequently on the flanks of northern sections and at high stratigraphic levels in the southern. The cross-bedded sands and gravels make {{up most of the}} core: in the north they area overlain by matrix-supported <b>sandy</b> <b>gravels</b> and in the south by cross-laminated sands. The reults of the investigation indicate that: a) the Norwood esker formed within a subglacial tunnel that was flowing full near the end of ablation as indicated by the upper stratigraphic position of the sliding bed, b) the larger, more complex ridge system of the Norwood esker developed within a well integrated system of channels, c) the granule layer that formed between layers of fine sand marks an erosional boundary separating sequences of lower flow velocity, and as such may provide a clue to the number of depositional units, possibly related to diurnal, seasonal and cyclonic effects on discharge, d) the fact that the sliding bed is present as two separate layers within the sedimentary column of the esker indicates that it is likely a frequent mode of transport within en- and subglacial channels...|$|R
