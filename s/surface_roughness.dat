In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of <b>surface</b> <b>roughness,</b> and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E

For perfectly specular reflection, the <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (2.5 cm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few millionths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflection.|$|E

25|$|The {{wind blows}} faster at higher altitudes {{because of the}} reduced {{influence}} of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, <b>surface</b> <b>roughness,</b> and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. Typically, the increase of wind speeds with increasing height follows a wind profile power law, which predicts that wind speed rises proportionally to the seventh root of altitude. Doubling the altitude of a turbine, then, increases the expected wind speeds by 10%, and the expected power by 34%.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors can be {{manufactured}} {{to a wide}} range of engineering tolerances, including reflectivity, surface quality, <b>surface</b> <b>roughness,</b> or transmissivity, depending on the desired application. These tolerances can range from low, such as found in a normal household-mirror, to extremely high, like those used in lasers or telescopes. Increasing the tolerances allows better and more precise imaging or beam transmission over longer distances. In imaging systems this can help reduce anomalies (artifacts), distortion or blur, but at a much higher cost. Where viewing distances are relatively close or high precision is not a concern, lower tolerances can be used to make effective mirrors at affordable costs.|$|E
25|$|Chemical etching {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale. Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} surface treatment for changing the <b>surface</b> <b>roughness.</b> The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with nanotopographies.

The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} <b>surface</b> <b>roughness</b> features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area.
