5|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} kinetic properties of an enzyme are how quickly the enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate, and the maximum rate it can achieve. Knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can <b>show</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions.|$|E
5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay <b>show</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E

5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to <b>show</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
