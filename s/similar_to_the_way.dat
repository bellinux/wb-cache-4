5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm autotomy, {{in a manner}} <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.|$|E
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it was <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} context, {{fundamentalism}} {{can be a}} pejorative rather than a neutral characterization, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that calling political perspectives [...] "right-wing" [...] or [...] "left-wing" [...] can, for some, have negative connotations.|$|R

5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. Using these balus, players handle the agung <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E
5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} Basque grammar, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live {{on the coast of}} Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country.|$|E
5000|$|Klein {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the paper tool through an examination of Berzelian formulas and their impact on inorganic and organic chemistry. [...] Berzelian formulas were particularly important because they connected a world of signs with the world of laboratory experimentation. They enabled scientists to describe complex materials and reactions in organic chemistry in organized <b>ways,</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which chemists had identified and classified inorganic substances.|$|R
50|$|Compound {{exercises}} work several {{muscle groups}} at once, and include movement around {{two or more}} joints. For example, in the leg press, movement occurs around the hip, knee and ankle joints. This exercise is primarily used <b>to</b> develop <b>the</b> quadriceps, but it also involves the hamstrings, glutes and calves. Compound exercises are generally <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that people naturally push, pull and lift objects, whereas isolation exercises often feel a little unnatural.|$|R

5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that following the success of Bustracker, an application had been developed for the iPhone that is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Bustracker works. It allows people to download an application to their iPhone that enables them to see where their nearest bus stop is and when the bus is due. Although not developed by Lothian Buses or The City of Edinburgh Council, the application has now won the backing of both companies. My Bus Edinburgh is an application developed for the Android platform which is similar in functionality to the iPhone application. Like the iPhone application, this application is developed by an independent developer, backed by Lothian Buses and The City of Edinburgh Council, and is available free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E

50|$|It {{is hard to}} {{know whether}} English in Brunei is {{following}} an established pattern and emerging as a distinct variety of English or not. However, many of the trends found, {{such as the use of}} plural nouns such as equipments and the variable use of the 3rd person singular &minus;s suffix on verbs, seem <b>to</b> be <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> English is used as a lingua franca around the world. Furthermore, the avoidance of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables is consistent with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> English is spoken elsewhere in South-East Asia. So Brunei English may be contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that English is evolving around the world today.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image {{that is the same}} as the garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended at Final Resolution by then-champion Samoa Joe {{against the}} {{challenger}} Christopher Daniels. This rivalry started at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on August14 when Joe won the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament to become number-one contender to the TNA X Division Championship held by Daniels. Joe {{went on to}} compete against A.J. Styles and Daniels in a Three Way match at TNA's Unbreakable PPV event on September11, which Styles won to become the new champion. At Genesis, Joe and Daniels competed in a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match, which Joe and Daniels' team won. After the bout, Joe attacked and injured Daniels, thus sidelining him in the storyline. Joe {{then went on to}} defeat Styles at Turning Point to become the new TNA X Division Champion. After their match, Joe attacked Styles and attempted to injure Styles in a manner <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he injured Daniels. At this time Daniels returned from injury to save Styles from the attack. TNA promoted this match for Final Resolution on the January7, 2006 episode of Impact!.|$|E

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} process of acidogenesis results in further {{breakdown of the}} remaining components by acidogenic (fermentative) bacteria. Here, VFAs are created, along with ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, {{as well as other}} byproducts.
