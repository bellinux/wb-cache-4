5|$|After years, Ulmo {{returned}} to Beleriand {{to seek out}} the remaining Teleri. As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother Olwë as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by Ossë. They took Círdan as their leader and became the Falathrim. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the Sindar.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus Zeros <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E
5|$|After the {{enormous}} response to Myst, work quickly {{began on the}} next Myst game. Cyan moved from their cramped garage to a new office and hired additional programmers, designers, and artists. The game was to ship in late 1996, but the release was pushed back a year. Development costs were between $5 and $10 million, many times Mysts budget. After the release of Riven, Robyn Miller left the company to pursue other projects, while Rand <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> {{to work on a}} Myst franchise.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> in San Francisco because she felt obliged {{to care for her}} mother and her seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children.

5|$|Géza's and Solomon's {{relationship}} only {{began to}} worsen {{during the siege}} of the Byzantine fortress of Belgrade in 1071. Its commander preferred to surrender to Géza instead of the king and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp {{after the fall of}} Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, but his brother, Ladislaus <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> with half of the troops of their duchy.|$|E
5|$|In a {{makeshift}} hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The shrapnel {{was removed from}} Alfonso's abdomen, and {{he was expected to}} recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's shrapnel was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both his stomach and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery would need to be completed in an American hospital. Mucci ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners <b>stayed</b> <b>behind</b> to construct the airstrip.|$|E

Jenner admits {{he is the only}} researcher that <b>stayed</b> <b>behind,</b> many of the others having left for their families or committed suicide. A drunk Shane approaches Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) about her callous attitude towards him with Rick's return and attempts to rape her, but backs off when she scratches his neck.|$|E

Knowing that the entire family would be put in jeopardy if his father <b>stayed</b> <b>behind,</b> Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E
