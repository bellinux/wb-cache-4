2500|$|The {{nature of}} prey {{selection}} by two centrarchids (white crappie and bluegill) {{has been presented}} as a model incorporating optimal foraging strategies by Manatunge & Asaeda [...] The visual field of the foraging fish as represented by the reactive distance was [...] analysed in detail to estimate the number of prey encounters per search bout. The predicted reactive distances were compared with experimental data. The energetic cost associated with fish foraging behaviour was calculated based on {{the sequence of events}} that takes place for each prey consumed. Comparisons of the relative abundance of prey species and <b>size</b> <b>categories</b> in the stomach to the lake environment indicated that both white crappie and bluegill (length < 100nbsp&mm) strongly select prey utilizing an energy optimization strategy. In most cases, the fish exclusively selected large Daphnia ignoring evasive prey types (Cyclops, Diaptomids) and small cladocera. This selectivity is the result of fish actively avoiding prey with high evasion capabilities even though they appear to be high in energetic content and having translated this into optimal selectivity through capture success rates. The energy consideration and visual system, apart from the forager's ability to capture prey, are the major determinants of prey selectivity for large-sized bluegill and white crappie still at planktivorous stages.|$|E

2500|$|The PV Act (2013) {{came into}} force {{retrospectively}} on 1April 2012. [...] The tariff cuts {{were up to}} 30%, with the tariff cuts scheduled in the EEG (2012) for 1July 2012 advanced and tightened from their original 15%. [...] The system <b>size</b> <b>categories</b> were changed, now up to 10, 40, 1000, and kWp. [...] A new category of 10–40kWp was introduced, while free-standing systems were limited to 10MWp. [...] The regular standard degression was set to 1% per month, equal to 11.4% per year, and replacing the previous six-monthly adjustment. [...] The flexible cap for the deployment corridor remained unchanged at 2500 to 3500MWp per year. [...] If new additions exceed this corridor, the degression rises by 1.0% up to 2.8%. [...] A hard cap on the total photovoltaic capacity was introduced, set at 52GWp. [...] The self-consumption privilege was removed for new installations, as grid parity was already met: the feed-in tariff for roof systems at 19.5¢/kWh was now lower than the average electricity price for households at 23¢/kWh. [...] Changes to the market integration model reduced the eligibility for remuneration of systems between 10 and 1000kWp to 90% of their electricity production from 2014 onwards. [...] The residual electricity could either be self-consumed or sold on the electricity market.|$|E
2500|$|The rising {{shares of}} {{variable}} renewable generation {{had led to}} concerns {{about the ability of}} the electricity system to cope. [...] The new act included measures for the grid integration of photovoltaic systems. [...] Grid operators could now limit the feed-in of photovoltaics in times of grid overload, with the plant operators receiving compensation for their loss of revenue. [...] A new ordinance required the retrofitting of photovoltaic systems to avoid the 50.2Hz problem – the risk of widespread blackouts as PV systems simultaneously tripped in the face of frequencies above 50.2Hz. [...] Free-standing photovoltaic systems on nature conservation areas were excluded from remuneration. [...] The tariff structure for onshore wind was basically maintained, but the degression was tightened from 1% to 1.5% to incentivize efficiency improvements. [...] The system services bonus for onshore wind was extended and the repowering bonus was improved. [...] Offshore wind gained through improved early starter provisions. [...] The start of the degression was postponed until 2018, but increased from 5% to 7%. [...] Starter tariffs were increased but now last 8 rather than 12years. [...] Biomass tariffs were lowered by 10–15% on average, particularly for small systems. [...] The biomass tariff system itself was greatly simplified, with now four <b>size</b> <b>categories</b> and two fuel categories. [...] The degression for biomass was increased from 1% to 2%. [...] The tariffs for hydroelectricity were simplified, the funding period now uniformly 20years, and the degression rate set at 1%. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised and the start of the degression postponed until 2018, albeit at an increased rate. [...] Electricity storage facilities were fully exempted from grid charges and are to be supported by a special research program.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the term [...] "arquebus" [...] {{was used to}} {{describe}} an assortment of guns, but by the late 16th century the arquebus, caliver, and musket had settled down into <b>size</b> <b>categories</b> for firearms. The three main <b>size</b> <b>categories</b> generally corresponded with the arquebus, caliver, and musket. Continental European powers such as the Iberians, Germans, and French differentiated muskets from arquebuses by size and if they required a fork rest or not. However, the musket - essentially a large arquebus - which had been introduced around 1521, fell out of favor in the mid 16th century due to the decline of armor, but the term stuck around and musket became a generic descriptor for all 'shoulder arms' fireweapons into the 1800s. At least on one occasion the musket and arquebus have been used interchangeably {{to refer to the}} same weapon, and even referred to as an [...] "arquebus musket." [...] A Habsburg commander in the mid-1560s once referred to muskets as [...] "double arquebuses." [...] The matchlock firing mechanism also became a common term for the arquebus after it was added to the firearm. Later flintlock firearms were sometimes called fusils or fuzees.|$|E
