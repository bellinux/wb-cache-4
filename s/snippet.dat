5|$|Something/Anything? is {{a double}} album by Todd Rundgren, {{released}} in February 1972. It was Rundgren's third solo release, and was recorded in late 1971 in Los Angeles, New York City and Bearsville Studios, Woodstock. Three quarters of the album was recorded {{in the studio with}} Rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals, as well as being the producer. The final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short <b>snippet</b> of archive recordings from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund and released on the album on December 13, 2013. It features the singer leading a protesting group in which numerous celebrities make cameo appearances, most notably the singer's former Destiny's Child group bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. The video does not feature lip syncing like the singer's other works and it is shot in slow motion. The song was not performed by Beyoncé but {{was used as a}} <b>snippet</b> in interludes during various performances.|$|E
40|$|Enriched {{by natural}} {{language}} texts, Stack Overflow code <b>snippets</b> are an invaluable code-centric knowledge base of small units of source code. Besides being useful for software developers, these annotated <b>snippets</b> can potentially {{serve as the}} basis for automated tools that provide working code solutions to specific natural language queries. With the goal of developing automated tools with the Stack Overflow <b>snippets</b> and surrounding text, this paper investigates the following questions: (1) How usable are the Stack Overflow code <b>snippets?</b> and (2) When using text search engines for matching on the natural language questions and answers around the <b>snippets,</b> what percentage of the top results contain usable code <b>snippets?</b> A total of 3 M code <b>snippets</b> are analyzed across four languages: C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. Python and JavaScript proved to be the languages for which the most code <b>snippets</b> are usable. Conversely, Java and C# proved to be the languages with the lowest usability rate. Further qualitative analysis on usable Python <b>snippets</b> shows the characteristics of the answers that solve the original question. Finally, we use Google search to investigate the alignment of usability and the natural language annotations around code <b>snippets,</b> and explore how to make <b>snippets</b> in Stack Overflow an adequate base for future automatic program generation.

50|$|Code <b>snippets</b> {{allow the}} {{developer}} {{to add a}} complex coding structure by typing a minimal amount of text. Code <b>snippets</b> can only {{be used in a}} valid context (statements <b>snippets</b> are only offered when you can insert statements).|$|R
50|$|<b>Snippets</b> {{are small}} regions of {{reusable}} script code. <b>Snippets</b> {{are often used}} to save keystrokes, or to assist the user with common scripting patterns. Many text editors support <b>snippets</b> for scripting either as built-in functionality or through plugins.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line <b>snippet</b> which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P. Sippy and Ramesh Sippy; two other producer/director teams had earlier {{rejected}} the idea. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that {{it would be difficult to}} get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} phase, the machine code is built by calling a small <b>snippet</b> of code, {{associated}} with each pattern, to generate the real instructions from the target's instruction set, using the final registers, offsets, and addresses chosen during the reload phase. The assembly-generation <b>snippet</b> may be just a string, in which case a simple string substitution of the registers, offsets, and/or addresses into the string is performed. The assembly-generation <b>snippet</b> {{may also be a}} short block of C code, performing some additional work, but ultimately returning a string containing the valid assembly code.|$|E
25|$|The voice-track audio {{files for}} the week's five shows are {{then sent to}} Chicago, where they are edited for time, and the {{high-resolution}} music selections are added in. This post-production process involves making artistic choices regarding which of Bill's narration samples to use, and how to present and place Bill's piano examples, <b>snippet</b> examples from CDs, and the musical pieces themselves.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>Snippets,</b> a novel {{method for}} improving computerized data entry from paper forms. Using computer vision techniques, <b>Snippets</b> segments {{an image of}} the form into small <b>snippets</b> that each contain the content for a single form field. Data entry is performed by looking at the <b>snippets</b> on the screen and typing values directly on the same screen. We evaluated <b>Snippets</b> through a controlled user study in Seattle, Washington, USA, comparing the performance of <b>Snippets</b> on desktop and mobile platforms to the baseline method of reading the form and manually entering the data. Our results show that <b>Snippets</b> improved the speed of data entry by an average of 28. 3 % on the desktop platform and 10. 8 % on the mobile platform without any detectable loss of accuracy. In addition, findings from a preliminary field study with five participants in Bangalore, India support these empirical results. We conclude that <b>Snippets</b> is an efficient and practical method that could be widely used to aid data entry from paper forms...|$|R

25|$|The machine {{description}} file contains RTL patterns, {{along with}} operand constraints, and code snippets to output the final assembly. The constraints {{indicate that a}} particular RTL pattern might only apply (for example) to certain hardware registers, or (for example) allow immediate operand offsets of only a limited size (e.g. 12, 16, 24, … bit offsets, etc.). During RTL generation, the constraints for the given target architecture are checked. In order to issue a given <b>snippet</b> of RTL, it must match one (or more) of the RTL patterns in the machine description file, and satisfy the constraints for that pattern; otherwise, {{it would be impossible}} to convert the final RTL into machine code.|$|E
5000|$|Cobbler has {{features}} to dynamically change {{the information contained}} in a kickstart template (definition), either by passing variables called ksmeta or by using so-called <b>snippets.</b> An example for a ksmeta variable could be the name of a disk device in the system. This could be inherited from the system's Cobbler profile. <b>Snippets</b> can be dynamic Python code that expands the limited functionality of Anaconda. The combination of profiles, ksmeta and <b>snippets</b> gives Cobbler high flexibility; complexity is avoided by keeping the actual [...] "code" [...] in the <b>snippets,</b> of which there can be one for each task in an installation. There are examples for network setup or disk partitioning; keeping common code in <b>snippets</b> helps minimize the size of the kickstart files.|$|R

25|$|The search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} using the search bars in the Start menu {{and the upper}} right hand corner of Windows Explorer windows, as well as Open/Save dialog boxes. When searching from the Start menu, the results are shown in the Start menu itself, overlapping the recently used programs. From the Start menu, {{it is also possible}} to launch an application by searching for its executable image name or display name. Searching from the search bars in Explorer windows replaces the content of the current folder with the search results. The Explorer windows can also render thumbnails in the search results if a Thumbnail Handler is registered for a particular file type. It can also render enhanced previews of items in a Preview Pane without launching the default application, if the application has registered a Preview Handler. This can provide functionality such as file type-specific navigation (such a browsing a presentation using next/previous controls, or seeking inside a media file). Preview handlers can also allow certain kind of selections (such as highlighting a text <b>snippet)</b> to be performed from the preview pane itself. In the Control Panel, the search bar in the window can also search for Control Panel options. However, unlike WDS, Windows Search does not support creating aliases.|$|E
