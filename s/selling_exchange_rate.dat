The main {{purpose of this study is}} to apply seven APARCH-type models with (1, 1) lags to investigate the behavior of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility for the EUR, JPY, and USD <b>selling</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> to IDR for the duration from January 2010 to December 2015. The competing models include ARCH, GARCH, TARCH, TS-ARCH, GJR-GARCH, NARCH, and APARCH used with Gaussian normal distribution. In order to estimate the model parameters, this study applies the Bayesian inference using the adaptive random walk Metropolis method in the MCMC algorithm. Empirical results based on the deviance information criterion indicate that the GARCH (1, 1), APARCH (1, 1), and TARCH (1, 1) models provide the best fit for the EUR, JPY, and USD data, respectively. In those models, both the JPY and USD data have significant negative leverage effect at the 99 % credible level. Moreover, the JPY returns also have significant Taylor effect in return volatility at the 99 % credible level.   Keywords: APARCH, ARWM, IDR <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> MCMC, volatilit...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the macroeconomic {{factors that affect}} the rental rates and selling prices of office space. The data are {{in the form of}} quarterly time series which are used for the period of 1996 : 1 to 2012 : 4 period. In addition, quantitative methods in the form of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) are also used in this study. The results showed that there is a long-term relationship between macroeconomic variables with the rental rate and selling prices of office space. IRF and FEVD showed that the rental rates and selling prices responded permanently to the shocks that occured on macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the rental rate is predominantly influenced by the rental rate followed by the service sector employment, the <b>selling</b> price, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation, interest rates and economic growth. Conversely, the selling price is predominantly influenced by the rental rate followed by service sector employment, the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> economic growth, the selling price, infllation and interest rates.

40|$|In this paper, the {{triangular}} relationship of money, price and foreign exchange is studied. It is concluded that regulating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> by volume of liquidity {{in a period}} of less than year is not possible, but in annual and biannual analyses we can regulate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> through controlling the liquidity. In other words, in the long run, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is affected by liquidity and price level, but in the short run, price level has only temporary effects on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The results of the study show that: · Liquidity affects the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in the long run · Prices affects the liquidity in the long run · In the long run, liquidity and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> affect prices Our results show that injection of foreign exchange into the parallel exchange market with different lags has little effects with different directions on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The same result is true for the relationship of liquidity and dollar rate. In other words, in spite of the long run relationship between <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and liquidity, we cannot justify this relationship in the short run. The same is true with the balance of payments position and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in the short run. By simulating the relationship between injecting (<b>selling)</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> in the parallel exchange market, liquidity and the cumulative balance of payments all with <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> we can conclude that in the short run, regulating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> by instruments such as <b>selling</b> <b>exchange</b> in the parallel market or controlling the liquidity is not possible, but in the long run, conducting foreign exchange sale policy and controlling the liquidity and the balance of payments position can control the exchange market...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} {{of foreign exchange}} intervention in China {{and its effects on}} the RMB’s <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels and volatility. The research first examines what drives Chinese central bank’s intervention through buying and <b>selling</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> (the CB intervention) in a bivariate probit model and shows that intervention is driven by an array of factors including <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> deviations, conditional volatility, national economic conditions, interest rate differentials. The PBOC conducts intervention in a leaning-against-the-wind fashion in the medium term, while leaning-with-the-wind intervention is used in the short term. The thesis next focuses on the intervention in the central parity rate (the CPR intervention). Evidence from a Bayes Tobit model shows that the CPR intervention is determined by the market price (proxied by the proposed price by designated market makers), broad currency index and the yield curve spread. The PBOC adopts a leaning-against-the-wind strategy for the intervention in that when the market price appreciates (depreciates), the PBOC sets a higher (lower) central parity rate to dampen or even reverse the appreciation (depreciation). To what extent the CB and CPR interventions are effective is then estimated in threshold GARCH models. Results show that while CPR intervention focuses on combating appreciation, intervention by the central bank’s purchase or sale operations (CB intervention) impacts on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels when the RMB depreciates. While interventions would move <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels to the direction desired by the authorities, they tend to increase <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility. Finally, event study methodology is deployed to explore the properties and impacts of China’s oral intervention. The estimation adopts four criteria (event, direction, reversal and smoothing) to test to what extent oral intervention is effective. Evidence indicates oral intervention through <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> communications can influence <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels and the RMB <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is responsive to international pressure. Furthermore, sequential oral interventions can reduce <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{guidance}} on the operational aspects of official {{intervention in the}} foreign exchange market, particularly in developing countries with flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes. A brief survey of the literature and country experience is followed by {{an analysis of the}} objectives, timing, amount, degree of transparency, and choice of markets and counterparties in conducting intervention. The analysis highlights the difficulty of detecting <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> misalignments and disorderly markets, and argues in favor of parsimony in official intervention. Determining the timing and amount of intervention is a highly subjective excercise, and some degree of discretion is almost necessary, though policy rules may serve as "rules of thumb.

40|$|Consensus {{estimates}} put the half-life of {{deviations from}} purchasing power parity (PPP) at {{about four years}} (Rogoff, 1996). However, conventional least squares estimates of half-lives are biased downward. Accordingly, as a preferred measure of the persistence of real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> shocks, this study uses median-unbiased estimators of the half-life of deviations from parity, which correct for the downward bias of conventional estimators. The paper tests for PPP using real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data for 90 developed and developing countries in the post-Bretton Woods period. Support for PPP is found, as the majority of countries experience finite deviations of real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> from parity. The speed of parity reversion {{is found to be}} typically much faster for developed countries than for developing countries, and to be considerably faster for countries with flexible nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes in comparison with countries having fixed nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes.
