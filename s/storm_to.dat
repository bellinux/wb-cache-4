5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front bypassed the <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> the south, and a building ridge behind it turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on January28, an advancing trough turned the <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> the southeast. The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and on January30, the MFO estimated a secondary 10minute wind peak of 85km/h (50mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on January31 well to the south-southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|In a Monthly Weather Review paper {{published}} in 1934, the U.S. Weather Bureau recognized Key West and Pensacola {{as the most}} hurricane-prone cities in the state; Key West experiences both storms developing from the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, while Pensacola has received hurricanes crossing the state as well as storms recurving in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The earliest <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> affect the state was the 1952 Groundhog Day Tropical Storm, and the latest <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> impact the state was a hurricane making landfall on December1, 1925.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} continued {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. With wind shear no longer impinging on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E

5|$|Further {{intensification}} was slowed {{because of}} strong wind shear, which caused the storm's center of circulation to be displaced from {{the bulk of}} convection. Due {{to the lack of}} atmospheric steering currents at the time, Odile assumed a slow, meandering course towards the west. Continued wind shear caused the tropical <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> become disorganized on September11 before abating, allowing for thunderstorms to rebuild over Odile's circulation center on September12. The relaxed wind shear enabled the growth of intense rainbands encircling the tropical cyclone as well as improved outflow aloft. The following day, Odile quickly attained a large central dense overcast; in accordance with Dvorak-derived satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the <b>storm</b> <b>to</b> hurricane intensity.|$|E
