50|$|Traditional breads, still {{popular in}} Iceland, include rúgbrauð, a dense, dark and moist rye bread, {{traditionally}} baked in pots or special boxes used for baking in holes dug near hot springs, and flatkaka, a soft brown rye flatbread.

This done, he carefully put the pieces of dough in his breast-pocket {{in such a way that}} they were not likely to be crushed, and, with a smile of satisfaction, returned to his chair, helped himself to a glass of port, and dozed off.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{historical}} {{consumer preference}} for refined flour and the traditionally higher per-unit cost of whole grain, whole-wheat flour products are ascendant {{largely due to}} changing consumer attitudes.

In another visible example, whole-wheat bread has reached approximate parity with <b>soft</b> white <b>bread</b> as measured by slice volume in the United States; as of 2010, whole-wheat <b>bread</b> narrowly exceeds <b>soft</b> white <b>bread</b> as measured by dollar volume.|$|R

60|$|Alleyne {{had gone}} no great {{distance}} {{for all the}} many small passages that had befallen him. Yet to him, used as he was {{to a life of}} such quiet that the failure of a brewing or the altering of an anthem had seemed to be of the deepest import, the quick changing play of the lights and shadows of life was strangely startling and interesting. A gulf seemed to divide this brisk uncertain existence from the old steady round of work and of prayer which he had left behind him. The few hours that had passed since he saw the Abbey tower stretched out in his memory until they outgrew whole months of the stagnant life of the cloister. As he walked and munched the <b>soft</b> <b>bread</b> from his scrip, it seemed strange to him to feel that it was still warm from the ovens of Beaulieu.|$|E
6000|$|The {{building}} operations had {{for some}} time proceeded more slowly, from the higher parts of the lighthouse requiring much longer time than an equal tonnage of the lower courses. The duty of the landing-master’s crew had, upon the whole, been easy of late; for though the work was occasionally irregular, yet the stones being lighter, they were more speedily lifted from the hold of the stone vessel to {{the deck of the}} praam-boat, and again to the waggons on the railway, after which they came properly under the charge of the foreman builder. It is, however, a strange, though not an uncommon, feature in the human character, that, when people have least to complain of, they are most apt to become dissatisfied, as was now the case with the seamen employed in the Bell Rock service about their rations of beer. Indeed, ever since the carpenter of the floating light, formerly noticed, had been brought to the rock, expressions of discontent had been manifested upon various occasions. This being represented to the writer, he sent for Captain Wilson, the landing-master, and Mr. Taylor, commander of the tender, with whom he talked over the subject. They stated that they considered the daily allowance of the seamen in every respect ample, and that, the work being now much lighter than formerly, they had no just ground for complaint; Mr. Taylor adding that, if those who now complained ‘were even to be fed upon <b>soft</b> <b>bread</b> and turkeys, they would not think themselves right.’ At twelve noon the work of the landing-master’s crew was completed for the day; but at four o’clock, while the rock was under water, those on the beacon were surprised by the arrival of a boat from the tender without any signal having been made from the beacon. It brought the following note to the writer from the landing-master’s crew:— ...|$|E

60|$|His career thenceforth {{was one of}} {{unbroken}} shame. He did not drink, he {{was exactly}} honest, he was never rude to his employers, yet was everywhere discharged. Bringing no interest to his duties, he brought no attention; his day was a tissue of things neglected and things done amiss; and from place to place, and from town to town, he carried the character of one thoroughly incompetent. No man can bear the word applied to him without some flush of colour, as indeed there is none other that so emphatically slams in a man's face the door of self-respect. And to Herrick, who was conscious of talents and acquirements, who looked down upon those humble duties {{in which he was}} found wanting, the pain was the more exquisite. Early in his fall he had ceased {{to be able to make}} remittances; shortly after, having nothing but failure to communicate, he ceased writing home; and about a year before this tale begins, turned suddenly upon the streets of San Francisco by a vulgar and infuriated German Jew, he had broken the last bonds of self-respect, and, upon a sudden impulse, changed his name and invested his last dollar in a passage on the mail brigantine, the City of Papeete. With what expectation he had trimmed his flight for the South Seas, Herrick perhaps scarcely knew. Doubtless there were fortunes to be made in pearl and copra; doubtless others not more gifted than himself had climbed in the island world to be queen's consorts and king's ministers. But if Herrick had gone there with any manful purpose, he would have kept his father's name; the alias betrayed his moral bankruptcy; he had struck his flag; he entertained no hope to reinstate himself or help his straitened family; and he came to the islands (where he knew the climate to be <b>soft,</b> <b>bread</b> cheap, and manners easy) a skulker from life's battle and his own immediate duty. Failure, he had said, was his portion; let it be a pleasant failure.|$|E

50|$|Rye bread (Ruisleipä or hapanleipä (lit. sour bread) in Finnish) is a dark, sour bread {{produced}} {{in quantity in}} Finland, where {{it is the most}} popular type of bread. Compared with the more internationally popular German style, Finnish rye-breads tend to be less oily or moist in texture. The most common types of Finnish rye breads are not sweet nor contain spices like caraway, unlike Swedish rye breads. As well as traditional <b>breads</b> more modern, <b>softer</b> <b>breads</b> exist as well these days. Rye bread is notable for its resistance to spoiling; it may store for weeks or months without developing mold. Additionally, if left on the table, it quickly dries into a crisp that stores indefinitely.|$|R

5000|$|Up {{until the}} 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was {{considered}} a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types {{compared to that of}} wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with afternoon tea. Some of the <b>softest</b> <b>bread,</b> including Wonder Bread, is referred to as [...] "balloon bread".|$|R
