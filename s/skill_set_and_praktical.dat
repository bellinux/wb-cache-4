40|$|Abstract: Police {{agencies}} have, for {{the most}} part, not yet integrated the principles and methods of problem-oriented policing into their routine operations. This is so for several reasons. First, many police officials lack a complete understanding of {{the basic elements of}} problemoriented policing and how problem solving fits {{in the context of the}} whole police function. Second, the police have not yet adequately developed the <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> knowledge bases to support problemoriented policing. And third, the police have insufficient incentives to take problem-oriented policing seriously. This paper begins by articulating what full integration of problem-oriented policing into routine police operations might look like. It then presents one framework for integrating the principles and methods of problem-oriented policing into the whole police function. The paper then explores the particular <b>skill</b> <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> knowledge bases that will be essential to the practice of problem-oriented policing within police agencies and across the polic...|$|R
