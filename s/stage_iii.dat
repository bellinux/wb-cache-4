5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in <b>stage</b> <b>III</b> and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have <b>stage</b> <b>III</b> or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%.

The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a veliger (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are <b>Stage</b> <b>III,</b> and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In <b>stage</b> <b>III</b> and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the reproductive cycle of termite queens, incipient colonies of Reticulitemes speratus (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) were established under laboratory conditions, and {{the transition of}} colony development was observed at 0. 5, 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5, and 7. 5 months (stages I-V, respectively) after colony foundation. Ovarian development, vitellogenin gene expression, and Juvenile Hormone (JH) titres are examined in the queens and in non-physogastric nymphoids collected from natural colonies. A reproductive cycle in queens is observed, in which the oviposition rate is relatively higher during stages I and II, and then decreases during <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV. Vitellogenic oocytes are not observed in the ovary during <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV, and the expression level of the vitellogenin gene is low, suggesting that egg production in queens is repressed during these stages. However, vitellogen gene expression and egg deposition in queens resumes during stage V. Juvenile Hormone levels rise during the transition from nymphs to stage-I queens, and elevated JH titres are observed also during <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV. The decrease in JH titre in queens at stage II precedes the decline in vitellogenesis at <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV. Thus, JH titre and vitellogenesis are correlated in an offset pattern. However, non-physogastric nymphoid reproductives do not have vitellogenic oocytes in their ovaries, and their JH titre is two-fold {{higher than that of}} queens, suggesting that elevated JH titre precedes vitellogenesis as in queens...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the efficacy of using the developmental stages of the canines and third molars to predict the timing of skeletal maturity in the Saudi population. Material and methods: The lateral cephalometric radiographs and orthopantograms of 239 Saudi patients, 106 males and 133 females, aged 9 to 21  years, were collected from several dental centers. Orthopantograms were used to assess the developmental stages of the upper and lower canine teeth and third molars using two popular methods: that of Nolla and that of Demirjian. Cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) stage was assessed on the lateral cephalometric images according to the method of Baccetti et al. Trained observers with no knowledge of patient age or gender performed assessments. Data were analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient at a significance level of P ≤ . 05. Result: Skeletal CVM <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV had a stronger correlation with mandibular left canine developmental stage than with maxillary canine developmental stage in the two methods used (correlation with Nolla stage 10 and Demirjian stage H: root completely formed with apex closed), especially for male patients (r =  0. 700, P < . 001). In contrast, the maxillary third molars at Nolla stages 5 and 7 (crown completed to 1 / 3 of the root formed) showed an association with CVM <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV (r =  0. 540 for females and r =  0. 639 for males, P ≤ . 001 for both) and with Demirjian stages D, E, and F. Males had slightly higher correlation values than females (r =  0. 578 and 0. 5010, respectively; P ≤ . 001) at CVM <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV. Interestingly, canine teeth showed a stronger correlation than third molars with skeletal maturation in Saudi children.

Methods: In 60 obese schoolchildren (body mass index 95 th percentile) {{between the ages of}} 8 and 13 y who were recruited from one school in Chile, multicompartmental body composition was estimated with the use of isotopic dilution, plethysmography (BodPod), radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA), and anthropometric equations. These results were compared to those of the 4 C model, which is considered the gold standard. Results: For body fat, the 4 C model showed the best agreement with DEXA for boys in Tanner stages I and II (r ¼ 0. 971) and with isotopic dilution for boys in Tanner <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV (r ¼ 0. 984). The best agreement in girls occurred with isotopic dilution, regardless of pubertal stage (r ¼ 0. 948 for Tanner stages I and II; r ¼ 0. 978 for Tanner <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV). Both isotopic dilution and the Huang, Ellis, and Deurenberg anthropometric equations underestimated body fat in boys; by contrast, DEXA, BodPod, and the Slaughter equation overestimated body fat in boys. All of the equations underestimated body fat in girls. For fat-free mass in both boys and girls, the 4 C model showed the best agreement with isotopic dilution, regardless of pubertal stage. The Huang equation showed the best agreement for boys (r ¼ 0. 730 for Tanner stages I and II; r ¼ 0. 695 for Tanner <b>stages</b> <b>III</b> and IV) and for girls in Tanner stages I and II (r ¼ 0. 884).

40|$|Background: non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) remains a major {{global health problem}} because of its {{prevalence}} and poor prognosis. Treatment options are limited and {{there is a need to}} explore alternatives. This systematic review evaluates the role of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in association with chemotherapy for NSCLC. Methods: english and Chinese databases were searched for RCTs comparing CHM with conventional biomedical treatment or placebo. Papers were reviewed systematically and data were analysed using standard Cochrane software Revman 5. Results: fifteen Chinese trials involving 862 participants met the inclusion criteria. All trials were of poor quality with a considerable risk of bias. There was a significant improvement in quality of life (QoL) (increased Karnofsky Performance Status) (RR 1. 83, 95 % CI 1. 41 - 2. 38, p< 0. 00001 for both <b>stages</b> <b>III,</b> IV only NSCLC and all stages NSCLC) and less anaemia (RR 0. 37, 95 % CI 0. 15 - 0. 91, p= 0. 03 for <b>stages</b> <b>III,</b> IV only NSCLC; p= 0. 005 for all stages NSCLC) and neutropenia (RR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 82, p= 0. 01 for <b>stages</b> <b>III,</b> IV only NSCLC; p< 0. 00001 for all stages NSCLC) when CHM is combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. There was no significant difference in short term effectiveness and limited inconclusive data concerning long term survival. Five promising herbs have been identified. Conclusion: it is possible that oral CHM used in conjunction with chemotherapy may improve QoL in NSCLC. This needs to be examined further with more rigorous methodology...|$|R
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to <b>stage</b> <b>III</b> (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach <b>stage</b> <b>III.</b> Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{and radiation}} therapy are the mainstays {{of treatment for}} most head and neck cancers and remain the standard of care in most cases. For small primary cancers without regional metastases (stage I or II), wide surgical excision alone or curative radiation therapy alone is used. More extensive primary tumors, or those with regional metastases (<b>stage</b> <b>III</b> or IV), planned combinations of pre- or postoperative radiation and complete surgical excision are generally used. More recently, as historical survival and control rates are recognized as less than satisfactory, {{there has been an}} emphasis on the use of various induction or concomitant chemotherapy regimens.|$|E
25|$|Taken as a whole, if {{the disease}} {{is limited to the}} kidney, only 20–30% develop metastatic disease after nephrectomy.

For larger tumors confined to the kidney without venous invasion, survival is still relatively good at 80–85%. For tumors that extend through the renal capsule and out of the local fascial investments, the survivability reduces to near 60%. Factors as general health and fitness or the severity of their symptoms impact the survival rates. For instance, younger people (among 20–40 years old) have a better outcome despite having more symptoms at presentation, possibly due to lower rates spread of cancer to the lymph nodes (<b>stage</b> <b>III).</b>|$|E
