The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins.

5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923.

Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to <b>sing</b> <b>at</b> the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males <b>sing</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning and the}} peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E
