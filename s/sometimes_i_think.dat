25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E

500|$|Dave Marsh was {{the first}} music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he {{described}} ? and the Mysterians, {{one of the most}} popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in Creem, [...] "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," [...] he wrote, [...] "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> those were the best days ever." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> those were the best days ever".|$|E
500|$|In {{film editor}} Susan Korda's 2005 lecture, [...] "We'll Fix It in the Edit!?", at the Berlinale Talent Campus, she broadly {{explained}} {{the contribution of}} editing to the film: [...] "What is fascinating in Jaws is that the shark has a personality, the shark has an intelligence, indeed <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the shark {{has a sense of}} humor, morbid as it might be. And that was all achieved in the first two acts of the film before you see the shark. So the cutting was very essential for that." [...] David Bordwell has used the second shark attack scene in Jaws as (literally) a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in the late 1960s. The innovation, which Fields herself named the [...] "wipe by cut", can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a telephoto lens. The cut to a different framing of the character occurs during the interruption by a figure who passes between the camera and the character. The cut thus masks itself, and avoids drawing the viewer's attention away from the narrative of the scene.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, Irene, {{investor}} John [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney {{and film}} editor Hal Kern {{drove out to}} Riverside, California to preview it at the Fox Theatre. The film was still a rough cut at this stage, missing completed titles and lacking special optical effects. It ran for four hours and twenty-five minutes, but would later be cut down to under four hours for its proper release. A double bill of Hawaiian Nights and Beau Geste was playing, and after the first feature {{it was announced that}} the theater would be screening a preview; the audience were informed they could leave but would not be readmitted once the film had begun, nor would phone calls be allowed once the theater had been sealed. When the title appeared on the screen the audience cheered, and after it had finished it received a standing ovation. In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the film had even started [...] "was the greatest moment of [...] life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings", with Selznick describing the preview cards as [...] "probably the most amazing any picture has ever had." [...] When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how he felt about the film, he said: [...] "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you need to save me." ...|$|E

District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud {{to the court}} during the trial {{in the fall of}} 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her condition, the pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: [...] "I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if I could tell mamma, but I can't.

2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it will be good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E
