25|$|For {{an object}} {{to be in}} static equilibrium, not only must {{the sum of the}} forces be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a {{two-dimensional}} situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the forces requirement is two equations: ΣH = 0 and ΣV = 0, and the torque a third equation: Στ = 0. That is, to solve <b>statically</b> <b>determinate</b> equilibrium problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.|$|E
40|$|Buildup of {{internal}} self-stresses in hyperstatic adaptive structures resists actuation. A recent paper by Guest and Hutchinson shows that periodic infinite truss structures cannot be both <b>statically</b> and kinematically <b>determinate</b> structures; therefore, a rigid infinite lattice bar framework must be hyperstatic. This paper {{shows that it}} is possible to design adaptive periodic infinite truss structures that can achieve any state of uniform strain without energy cost by actuating only a subset of the bars in a coordinated fashion. We show that actuation of only 3 bars in two dimensions or 6 bars in three dimensions per unit cell is required. A mathematical apparatus is developed and an example of such a bitriangular lattice structure is given, along with accompanying illustrations.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the static and kinematic behavior of two chain-like bar-and-joint assemblies which have the same topology. One is a structure which is both statically and kinematically indeterminate, and constitutes a higher-order infinitesimal mechanism. The other is a structure which is both <b>statically</b> and kinematically <b>determinate,</b> introduced by Leonardo da Vinci in the Codex Madrid. Proceeding along the internal joints from the bottom {{to the top of the}} assembly, the lateral components of the displacements of the internal joints of the infinitesimal mechanism show an exponential decay, and the forces in the internal bars of Leonardo’s structure show an exponential growth. It is pointed out that, in the elastic model of Leonardo’s structure, the propagation of displacements of internal joints and the propagation of forces in internal bars also show an exponential character in a modified form. This work also provides some hints for overcoming difficulties arising in higher-order infinitesimal mechanisms, and corrects minor mistakes made by Leonardo. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Probabilistic {{prediction}} of the confidence limits on long-time deflec-tions and internal forces of prestressed concrete segmental box-girder bridges is developed. The {{uncertainty of the}} predictions based on the existing models for concrete creep (the prior) is very large, {{but it can be}} greatly reduced by Bayesian updating on the basis of short-time measurements of the deflections during con-struction or of short-time creep and shrinkage strains of specimens made from the same concrete as the bridge. The updated (posterior) probabilities can be obtained by latin hypercube sampling, which reduces the problem to a series of deterministic creep structural analyses for randomly generated samples of random parameters of the creep and shrinkage prediction model. The method does not require lineariza-tion of the problem with regard to the random parameters, and a large number of the random parameters can be taken into account. Application to a typical box-girder bridge with age differences between its segments and with a change of struc-tural system from <b>statically</b> indeterminate to <b>determinate</b> is illustrated numerically. The results prove that design for extreme, rather than mean, long-time deflections and internal forces is feasible. Adoption of such a design approach would improve long-term serviceability of box-girder bridges...|$|R
25|$|Engineers in {{the nineteenth}} century {{understood}} that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers patented continuous bridges with hinge points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a <b>statically</b> <b>determinate</b> system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations. Engineers could more easily calculate the forces and stresses with a hinge in the girder.|$|E
25|$|When , the truss {{is said to}} be <b>statically</b> <b>determinate,</b> {{because the}} (m+3) {{internal}} member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2j equilibrium equations, once we know the external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member is taken out (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the load carrying capacity of the members.|$|E

2500|$|A truss that {{is assumed}} to {{comprise}} members that are connected by means of pin joints, and which is supported at both ends by means of hinged joints or rollers, is described as being <b>statically</b> <b>determinate.</b> Newton's Laws apply to the structure as a whole, {{as well as to}} each node or joint. In order for any node that may be subject to an external load or force to remain static in space, the following conditions must hold: the sums of all (horizontal and vertical) [...] forces, as well as all moments acting about the node equal zero.

2500|$|The Young's modulus {{enables the}} {{calculation}} {{of the change in}} the dimension of a bar made of an isotropic elastic material under tensile or compressive loads. [...] For instance, it predicts how much a material sample extends under tension or shortens under compression. The Young's modulus directly applies to cases of uniaxial stress, that is tensile or compressive stress in one direction and no stress in the other directions. Young's modulus is also used in order to predict the deflection that will occur in a <b>statically</b> <b>determinate</b> beam when a load is applied at a point in between the beam's supports. Other elastic calculations usually require the use of one additional elastic property, such as the shear modulus, bulk modulus or Poisson's ratio. Any two of these parameters are sufficient to fully describe elasticity in an isotropic material.|$|E
