40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{theoretical}} approach for mapping and determining the effectiveness of green spaces and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> as providers of urban ecosystem services and urban services {{in the case of}} Adana, Turkey. Firstly, green spaces and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> per capita have been determined and indexed for the neighbourhoods in the city. Then, a distancebased method for estimating the effectiveness of these facilities was used. The distances between the various neighbourhoods and between a given facility and the farthest threshold have been measured and these values have been used to determine the facility effectiveness change value for each neighbourhood. Then, effective values have been calculated and indexed by incorporating the green space and sociocultural facility values and the effectiveness change values for the neighbourhoods. Finally, point-based effective green spaces and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> index values have been converted to continuous surface values in a GIS (geographic information system) environment in order to utilize as a base map for urban physical planning purposes. According to the outcomes of this study, the distribution of green spaces and sociocultural facilities of the neighbourhoods are imbalanced and index values o...|$|E
40|$|To bring {{together}} the individuals who {{are living in the}} metropolitan cities with high levels of education and unit them under the same roof with respect to their common areas of interest is a big issue in Turkey. Until 1960 s the big cities in Turkey are taking a big migration. The new comers who are different in their social constitution and life style, have problems of adaptation to the cities. Thats why it is necessary in our country to operate <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> to solve these two big problems. A study was carried out in zmir the third biggest town in western part of Turkey with a population of more than two million. Two hundred fifty citizen families and two hundred fifty immigrant families were observed with a questionnaire from two socio culturally distinct sections of the city. One of the areas chosen are located and the other one was a neighboring area, Ornekkoy, which is inhabited by immigrants of 1960 s who have very low levels of income and education. According to the results the program schemes have been formed which is necessary for the architects to organize and design their projects...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are of {{the main}} causes of mortality {{in the world and}} impose a heavy economic, social, and health burden on society. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the barriers and strategies for identifying and managing risk factors of CVD in levels of preventing, screening, and treating. Methods: During present qualitative study with phenomenological approach, 60 subjects of cardiologists, nurses, patients, and their relatives were selected based on purposive sampling from educational-medical cardiothoracic subspecialty centers. Data were collected using an open-ended questionnaire and was extracted and analyzed with content analysis method. Results: Barriers were divided into three groups of individual barriers (low awareness, delay in referring for treatment and screening, incorrect beliefs, and not caring about health), socio-economic barriers (high costs, lack of resources, mental and psychological pressures), and health care barriers (non-alignment of doctors, being therapy-oriented, managerial and planning weaknesses, and lack of health care facilities). The most important presenting strategies are: providing public educations, improving family physician program, reduction of costs, cooperation of patients, and using functional indices to evaluate and improve the quality of services. Conclusion: Low awareness of people, high costs of services, lack of health care <b>facilities,</b> <b>socio-cultural</b> problems of people, and delay in referring of people, for treatment and screening {{are of the}} most important barriers of proper identifying and managing risk factors of CVD. Strategies provided in this study to overcome these barriers could be used...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the historical development of Camp 5, a leper camp on Pulau Jerejak. Pulau Jerejak Leper Settlement was operated from 1871 until 1969. During this period, six camps were built scattering around the island. One of the most important camps was Camp 5, completed in 1936. The camp was planned against the conservative idea of prison-like strict segregation. Camp 5 was planned {{in such a way that}} leprosy patients could freely conduct socio-cultural events, practice their faiths, establish their own families, be appointed as inmate workers, and et cetera. The houses were planned in clusters with well-planned agriculture plots and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities.</b> The layout plan of Camp 5 is important to suggest how leprosy patients could have been segregated more humanely. Today, most of the structures in Camp 5 are in semi-ruined conditions, Besides, there is lack of information can be used to reconstruct the planning of the settlement for the purpose historical research. Therefore, this research was conducted using three methods; archival research, interview and field works. The preliminary findings of the research enable researchers to discuss the theoretical discourse and provide historical lessons of modern segregations in dealing with diseases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPeople {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their lifetime having a good career with the aim of a high quality life. Universities have an enormous influence in determining individuals’ quality of life and careers. Although universities are not institutions which have the obligation to be vocationally oriented, students view universities as vocational institutions which lead to employment. Therefore, students choose among a variety of universities in order to reach the jobs in their vision. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the factors students consider when choosing a university. The study was conducted by means of survey method aided by qualitative and quantitative research models. The sample comprised 290 students selected by stratified random sampling out of 535 freshman year students enrolled in 7 different programs at Kocaeli University, Faculty of Education in fall 2011. Questionnaires and interview forms were employed as data collection instruments. The collected qualitative data will be analyzed via content analysis; as for the quantitative data, they were evaluated by means of arithmetic mean. The results point out that students make a serious amount of research on their own as well as with their family and teachers’ help when choosing university and department. The foremost reason why teacher candidates choose their profession is that they love teaching, their ÖSYS (university entrance exam) score is sufficient for teaching and that teaching graduates have little difficulty finding employment. Another finding is that students consider factors apart from the ÖSYS score when selecting department and universities. In general, the factor that influences students most in department and university selection is the physical conditions of the university. This is followed by the city where the university is located, the university's <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> and the informal information, rumors, and stories about the university...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to share the {{historical}} development of Camp 5, a leper camp on Pulau Jerejak. Pulau Jerejak Leper Settlement was operated from 1871 until 1969. The settlement has been an important collection center for leprosy patients in British Malaya before Sungai Buloh Leper Settlement was built in 1930 s. During this period, six camps were built scattered around the island. One of the most important camps was Camp 5, completed in 1936. The camp was planned against the conservative idea of strict segregation where leprosy patients were segregated rigidly in prison-like environment. Camp 5 was planned in such ways where leprosy patients could freely conduct social-cultural events, practice their faiths, establish their own families, appointed as inmate workers, and etc. The houses were planned in clustered manner with well-planned agriculture plots and <b>socio-cultural</b> <b>facilities.</b> The planning layout of Camp 5 is an important historical clue to suggest how leprosy patients could have been segregated more humanely. Today, most of the structures in Camp 5 are in semi-ruined conditions. The available information is insufficient to support the current research. Therefore, this research had to rely on three methods; archival researches, interview and field works. Archival materials such as governmental annual reports and old illustrations will help to reconstruct its chronological developments, and the indexed remnants from the field works will be used to analysis and overlay with its chronological developments. Interviews are crucial to obtain deliberate information to reconstruct the previous living and built environment of Camp 5. By understanding the segregation idea implemented in Camp 5, researchers may be able to interpret and argue the theoretical discourse of modern segregations in dealing with diseases and suggest some historical lessons...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Recreation Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Several factors affect {{sports and}} {{recreation}} participation in human communities. Such factors include sports and recreation {{knowledge and skills}} of people, availability of time, interest and disposable income etc. Through expressing their various social needs, community residents are able to show the adequacy and or the inadequacy in the factors influencing sports and recreation participation in their communities. Several {{studies have indicated that}} inadequacy in the factors influencing sports and recreation participation such as inadequate programmes, lack of interest, lack of disposable income, lack of facilities result in low participation in sports and recreation activities. Low participation in sports and recreational pursuits could result in increased hypokinetic morbidity and other social and economic problems such as: crime, substance and drug abuse, juvenile delinquency, alienated anti-social behaviours, work absenteeism, medical and social justice costs in communities. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to find different sports and recreation needs of three communities in Botswana. Five hundred (500) residents of the three communities aged 18 - 40 years were randomly selected in the three communities in Botswana to participate in the study. The questionnaire that was prepared and administered on the randomly selected residents of the three communities attempted to gather the following information: general sports and recreation participation profile of the respondents of the three communities, participation in sports and recreation activities in the three communities' recently constructed integrated sports facilities, problems responsible for low participation in sports and recreation activities and finally to identify which of the five barrier categories; aptitude, socio-economic, socio-cultural, awareness of community integrated sports facilities and facility constraints constrained sports and recreation in the three communities. Descriptive statistics and frequency, T-test and ANOVA were used to analyse data. The results showed low participation that ranged from 0. 0 % to 47. 4 % in sports activities in the three communities, participation in few recreational activities, low participation in the three communities' integrated sports facilities accounted by 29. 5 % in Molepolole, 26. 1 % in Serowe and 53. 4 % in Masunga for both men and women. The results showed problems perceived to constrain sports and recreation participation in the three communities. Descriptive data analysis also showed that out of the five barrier categories (aptitude, <b>socio-cultural,</b> awareness of <b>facilities</b> and facility constraints) respondents of the three communities were mainly constrained by the socio-economic barriers. Facility constraints were only found to constrain participation in Masunga. T-test analysis showed no significant differences between males and females of each of the three communities in the five barrier categories. The ANOVA test of variance showed significance difference between females of the three communities in four of the five barrier categories and a no significant difference in one of the five barrier categories. No significant difference was found between males of the three communities in four barrier categories and a significant difference was only found in one barrier category. These results led to the acceptance of the hypothesis that 'the three communities in Botswana have similar sports and recreation needs' and the partial acceptance of the hypothesis that 'there is no significant difference between respondents of the three communities in the way they experienced the five barrier categories.
