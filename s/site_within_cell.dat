40|$|International audienceLipid droplet {{metabolism}} and secretory pathway trafficking both require {{activation of the}} Arf 1 small G protein. The spatiotemporal regulation of Arf 1 activation is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of the GBF and BIG families, but the mechanisms of their localization to multiple <b>sites</b> <b>within</b> <b>cells</b> are poorly understood.

An amphipathic helix within HDS 1 is necessary and sufficient for lipid binding, both in vitro and in cells. The HDS 1 domain of GBF 1 is stably associated with lipid droplets in cells, and the catalytic Sec 7 domain inhibits this potent lipid-droplet-binding capacity.

MR- 1 has attracted wide interest from the research community because of its potential in reducing multiple chemical and metallic electron acceptors.

40|$|Localization of {{proteins}} to specific <b>sites</b> <b>within</b> bacterial <b>cells</b> is often critical to their function. In rod-shaped bacteria, proteins involved in diverse and important cell processes localize {{to the cell}} poles. The molecular mechanisms by which these proteins are targeted to the pole, however, are poorly understood. The Shigella autotransporter protein IcsA, which is localized to the pole {{on the surface of}} the bacterium, is targeted to the pole in the cytoplasm by a mechanism that is conserved across multiple Gram-negative bacterial species and has thus served as an important and informative model for studying polar localization. We present evidence that in Escherichia coli, the establishment of polar positional information recognized by IcsA requires the activity of the cytoplasmic membrane protein insertase YidC. We show that the role of YidC in IcsA localization is independent of the cell septation and cytokinesis proteins FtsQ and FtsEX. FtsQ is required for polar localization of IcsA and, based on cross-linking studies, is inserted in the vicinity of YidC, but, we find, is not dependent on YidC for membrane insertion. FtsEX is a YidC sub-strate, but we find that it is not required for polar localization of IcsA. These findings indicate that polar positional information recognized by IcsA depends on one or more membrane proteins that require YidC for proper membrane insertion.

Synemin associates with the major type III IF protein desmin and/or vimentin forming heteropolymeric intermediate filaments (IFs) <b>within</b> mammalian muscle <b>cells.</b> Previous studies in our lab showed that avian synemin interacts with vinculin and alpha-actinin, {{both of which are}} cytoskeletal proteins present in adhesion sites such as the focal adhesions <b>within</b> <b>cells.</b> Thus, synemin may link the heteropolymeric IFs to adhesion <b>sites</b> <b>within</b> mammalian muscle <b>cells</b> or <b>within</b> some non-muscle <b>cells</b> that express synemin. At least two isoforms of synemin, namely alpha- and beta-synemin, are present in mammals. The larger alpha-synemin is identical with the smaller beta-synemin, with the only exception being that the slightly smaller beta-synemin lacks a 312 amino acid insert (SNTIII) {{near the end of the}} long C-terminal tail domain. Whether the two mammalian synemin isoforms have different functions is unclear. Studies in this dissertation provide evidence that the two large mammalian (human) synemin isoforms interact differentially with several cytoskeletal proteins and thereby may fulfill different cellular functions. Mapping the binding site(s) of human synemins within vinculin and talin by in vitro protein-protein interaction assays revealed that SNTIII, which is absent in beta-synemin, interacts specifically with both vinculin and talin. Transient expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -tagged SNTIII co-localized with vinculin and talin at focal adhesion <b>sites</b> <b>within</b> mammalian <b>cells.</b> Confocal microscope analysis of intracellular localizations of endogenous synemin and vinculin/talin indicated that synemin co-localized with vinculin and talin at the sites of costameres, which are considered specialized focal adhesions located periodically along and immediately subjacent to the sarcolemma of mammalian striated muscle cells. These results indicated that mammalian alpha-synemin, but not beta-synemin, interacts directly with the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and talin <b>within</b> mammalian <b>cells.</b> To elucidate the possible functions of, and to identify novel interacting proteins for, the smaller beta-synemin <b>within</b> <b>cells,</b> yeast two-hybrid screening of a human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library was performed using the entire tail domain of human beta-synemin (SNbetaT) as the bait.

Actin filaments form the major component of the cytoskeleton and respond rapidly to serum growth factors. We have previously shown that myoblasts sort the two cytoskeletal / 3 - and-y-actin isoform mRNAs to different intracellular regions and that only/ 3 -actin mRNA was associated with peripheral regions of cell motility (Hill, M. A. and P. Gunning. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 122 : 825 - 832). We now show by in situ hybridization that 3 T 3 fibroblasts similarly sort actin isoform mRNAs and that peripheral/ 3 -actin mRNA is regulated by serum. In the absence of serum, we could not detect / 3 -actin mRNA at the periphery. Addition of serum rapidly redistributed/ 3 -actin mRNA to the pc-riphery. 3,-actin mRNA distribution was not altered by serum addition at any time. Both proteins, as identified by immunochemistry with isoform-specific antibodies, were found in similar cellular structures. Serum-stimulated cell motility is mediated through the GTPase signal transduction pathway. We find that an RNA-binding protein, p 62, {{that is part of}} this pathway, displays a localization pattern similar to/ 3 -actin mRNA. Our results suggest a new biological mechanism which integrates signal transduction with the supply of an architectural component required for membrane remodeling.
