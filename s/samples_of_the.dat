5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> underpricing {{of firms}} that went {{public on the}} Nouveau March between 1996 and 2000 and on the Neuer Markt between 1997 and 2000. Evidence suggests that firms that went public on the Nouveau March experienced lower underpricing than their counterparts that went public on the Neuer Markt. This difference in underpricing is partly explained by <b>the</b> differential performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two stock markets. The stock market performance has a positive significant impact on underpricing in both markets. However, the impact is stronger in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neuer Markt than in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nouveau March. Moreover, underwriter reputation lowers <b>the</b> underpricing <b>of</b> firms in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neuer Markt, while underwriter reputation does not affect <b>the</b> underpricing <b>of</b> firms in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nouveau March...|$|R

(2) Sampling frequency: The {{discrete}} Fourier transform (DFT) has a {{very well}} defined <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequencies, {{in order to be}} both complete and orthonormal.

On the other hand, CWT normally employs an octave scaling for frequencies, which results in an oversam-pled representation at the low frequencies and an under sampled representation at the higher frequencies. QTFDs have a sampling that is similar to the DFT.|$|R

With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E

High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so as not to be overwhelming to players.|$|E
