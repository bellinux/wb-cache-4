40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of IEA SHC Task 42 / ECES Annex 29, a simple tool for the economic evaluation of thermal energy storages has been developed and tested on various existing storages. On that account, the storage capacity costs (costs per installed storage capacity) of thermal energy storages have been evaluated via a Top-down and a Bottom-up approach. The Top-down approach follows {{the assumption that the}} costs of energy supplied by the storage should not exceed the costs of energy from the market. The maximum acceptable storage capacity costs depend on the interest rate assigned to the capital costs, the intended payback period of the user class (e. g. industry or building), the reference energy costs, and the annual number of <b>storage</b> <b>cycles.</b> The Bottom-up approach focuses on the realised storage capacity costs of existing storages. The economic evaluation via Top-down and Bottom-up approach is a valuable tool to make a rough estimate of the economic viability of an energy storage for a specific application. An important finding is that the annual number of <b>storage</b> <b>cycles</b> has the largest influence on the cost effectiveness. At present and with respect to the investigated storages, seasonal heat storage is only economical via large sensible hot water storages. Contrary, if the annual number of <b>storage</b> <b>cycles</b> is sufficiently high, all thermal energy storage technologies can become competitive...|$|R

50|$|For a Type II Communications Scanner, {{processing}} of a received or transmitted character might take fifty <b>storage</b> <b>cycles</b> (forty instructions).

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. Utilizing high-temperature supercritical steam cycles instead of state-of-the-art subcritical ones promises higher CSP plant efficiencies and lower levelized cost of the generated electricity. A new glass composition, Haloglass RX, that can reach the required temperatures, is investigated for the use in central receiver CSP plants. It is compared to Solar Salt and liquid sodium {{in terms of its}} thermophysical properties. The fluid’s high viscosity and disadvantageous heat transfer capabilities make it appear unfeasible as the heat transfer fluid in an active direct <b>storage</b> <b>cycle.</b> However, due to a high volumetric heat capacity and low cost it is suitable as a storage medium with a differing heat transfer fluid. A cycle in which a liquid glass <b>storage</b> <b>cycle</b> separates the sodium receiver cycle and the ultra-supercritical steam generator is proposed. A thermal and economic model is developed and validated to compare the proposed plant layout to a state-of-the-art Solar Salt plant. cf 201...|$|E
