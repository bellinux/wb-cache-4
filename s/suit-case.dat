60|$|As {{the door}} closed behind Julius, he {{returned}} to his <b>suit-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{packed his}} <b>suit-case</b> slowly, {{feeling that he}} was very wicked in leaving Oxford's opportunities.|$|E
60|$|She darted at the bed, yanked {{from beneath}} it her <b>suit-case,</b> and into {{it began to}} throw her toilet articles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-by. Hang on tight," [...] he said, as he {{stooped to}} the heavy <b>suit-cases</b> and marched {{out of the door}} without looking back.|$|R
60|$|Renouard forgot {{himself in}} the thought: “It’s done!” But {{the sight of the}} string of boys marching up to the house with <b>suit-cases</b> and dressing-bags rescued him from that appalling abstraction.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, and we {{are going}} to journey from winter into summer,” added Phil. “It’s good we remembered that when we packed our <b>suit-cases.</b> At first I was going to put in nothing but heavy clothing.” ...|$|R
60|$|As {{though he}} were a betrayed husband {{dramatically}} surprising her, Mr. Schwirtz opened the door, dropped a large <b>suit-case,</b> and stood, glaring.|$|E
60|$|The porter {{was closely}} questioned, but could give no very good {{description}} {{of the man who}} had presented the order for the <b>suit-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|He rather {{hoped that}} he was being noticed as, in his newly pressed clothes, with the adoring porter {{carrying}} his <b>suit-case,</b> he disembarked at Monarch.|$|E
6000|$|But Mother wearied of {{repacking}} {{their two}} cheap wicker <b>suit-cases</b> and the brown pasteboard box, and Father suddenly {{came to the}} front in his true capacity as boss and leader. He announced, loudly, on the evening before they were to depart, [...] "We're {{going to have a}} party to-night, old lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! Here {{he comes}} now!" [...] And as Polly spoke the big {{carryall}} {{of the school}} swung into view, with Jackson Lemond, commonly called [...] "Horsehair," [...] on the driver's seat. The boys made a rush for the carryall, throwing their <b>suit-cases</b> in the rack on top, and piling inside one over the other.|$|R
6000|$|By some {{providence}} he {{was saved}} {{from the crime}} of chilly self-righteousness. On {{the darkness of the}} stairs he felt all at once how responsive a chum the Turk had been. He dropped the <b>suit-cases,</b> not caring how they fell, rushed back into the room, and found the Turk still staring at the door. He cried: ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Howard entered. Her {{lips were}} set grimly together, and {{she carried a}} small <b>suit-case.</b> She looked excited and determined, and {{slightly}} on the defensive.|$|E
60|$|She looked away, past me, in the {{direction}} of the drive. I followed her gaze. A stout figure, carrying a <b>suit-case,</b> was moving slowly down it.|$|E
60|$|I {{found him}} on {{platform}} six. The eleven-twenty was already alongside, and presently I observed my porter cleaving a path towards {{me with the}} <b>suit-case</b> and golf-bag.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} train {{rolled into the}} Grand Central Terminal at Forty-Second Street, New York City, and, alighting, the lads made {{their way through the}} spacious depot to the crowded {{thoroughfare}} beyond. Here taxicabs were numerous, and the youths piled into one, leaving the driver to look after their <b>suit-cases.</b> Dave's trunk had been checked through to Washington.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a certain}} amount of the milk of human-kindness in the frozen husk he had for a time become. But he must be blamed for icily rejecting the Turk's blundering {{attempts}} to make peace. He courteously--courtesy, between these two!--declined the Turk's offer to help him carry his <b>suit-cases</b> to the station. That was like a slap.|$|R
6000|$|The Kennicotts refused Harry Haydock's not too urgent {{offer to}} take them home in his car [...] "if I can manage {{to get it out}} of the garage--terrible day--stayed home from the store--but if you say so, I'll take a shot at it." [...] Carol gurgled, [...] "No, I think we'd better walk; {{probably}} make better time, and I'm just crazy to see my baby." [...] With their <b>suit-cases</b> they waddled on. Their coats were soaked through.|$|R
6000|$|All {{went inside}} the high, carved oak {{railings}} into the banking-room--Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law was welcome anywhere. The clerks were {{pleased to be}} greeted by the good-looking, agreeable {{young man who was}} going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his <b>suit-case</b> down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth, put on Jimmy's hat, and picked up the <b>suit-case.</b> [...] "Wouldn't I make a nice drummer?" [...] said Annabel. [...] "My! Ralph, how heavy it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks." ...|$|E
60|$|Dave {{carried a}} <b>suit-case</b> {{and also a}} big bundle, the latter filled with Christmas {{presents}} for the folks at home. Ben was similarly loaded down, and so were the others.|$|E
60|$|He {{laughed at}} that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping {{out of the}} buggy he put Dorothy's <b>suit-case</b> under the seat and her bird-cage {{on the floor in}} front.|$|E
60|$|The driver consented. He {{gracefully}} {{swung the}} <b>suit-cases</b> and travelling bags {{to the top}} of the vehicle and held the door open while his fares entered. Then he mounted to his seat, took the reins, and spoke to the horses. Some of the other drivers nodded at him cheerfully, but more as if they were sorry he must exert himself than with any resentment at his success in getting the only tourists who had alighted from the train.|$|R
60|$|The {{trunks and}} <b>suit-cases</b> had been shipped off, {{and the big}} six-cylinder car--a new machine {{belonging}} to the Porters--had been brought around, with Dunston Porter at the wheel, for the old hunter and traveler had taken a strong liking to autoing. The girls and boys had piled in, after much handshaking and some kisses, and now the car was rolling out of the grounds, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth, Dave's father, and old Caspar Potts standing on the piazza, waving the travelers adieu.|$|R
60|$|They {{decided to}} leave their heavy baggage at the Hotel du Vesuve, and carried only their <b>suit-cases</b> and light luggage aboard the little steamer that was bound across the bay for Sorrento. The decks were thronged with people as eager {{to get away from}} the {{stricken}} city as were our friends, and Uncle John was only enabled to secure seats for his girls by bribing a steward so heavily that even that modern brigand was amazed at his good fortune.|$|R
60|$|He {{picked up}} his little <b>suit-case,</b> and we went out {{through the open window}} in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and Poirot stood aside to let her pass.|$|E
60|$|In {{half an hour}} Jimmy {{went down}} stairs and through the café. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned <b>suit-case</b> in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't!" [...] gasped {{the colored}} porter, {{and at once}} showed his excitement. [...] "Well, one came here, with a written order for your <b>suit-case,</b> and I done gave it to him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|They stepped uncomfortably {{from the}} safety of the plank {{platform}} and, balancing on their toes, taking cautious strides, ventured along the road. The sleety rain was turning to snow. The air was stealthily cold. Beneath an inch of water was a layer of ice, so that as they wavered with their <b>suit-cases</b> they slid and almost fell. The wet snow drenched their gloves; the water underfoot splashed their itching ankles. They scuffled inch by inch for three blocks. In front of Harry Haydock's Kennicott sighed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not playing}} the game, sir," [...] he told him. [...] "What {{we need is}} capital. We've got to {{interest}} capital, and you've got to do the interesting. Now this very day you've got to buy a couple of <b>suit-cases,</b> hire a taxicab, go sailing {{up to the front}} door of the Bronx Hotel like good pay and be damned. She's a real stylish hotel, but reasonable if you want to make it so. A little room, an inside room, European plan, of course, and then you can economise by eatin' out." ...|$|R
60|$|And his {{was genuine}} surprise, on {{entering}} the steward's room, to behold Michael just rousing from his curled-up {{sleep on the}} floor. But when he left, his surprise would have been shocking could he have seen through the closed door what immediately began to take place. Out through the open port-hole, in a steady stream, Daughtry was passing {{the contents of the}} room. Everything went that belonged to him, including the turtle- shell and the photographs and calendars on the wall. Michael, with the command of silence laid upon him, went last. Remained only a sea-chest and two <b>suit-cases,</b> themselves too large for the port-hole but bare of contents.|$|R
60|$|We {{wait and}} wait. Then in climbs an old peasant, in full {{black-and-white}} costume, smiling in the pleased, naïve {{way of the}} old. After him climbs a fresh-faced {{young man with a}} <b>suit-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|Could {{it be that}} he was {{behaving}} badly toward Claire? The {{thought was}} unpleasant, {{but he could not}} get rid of it. He extracted Claire's photograph from his <b>suit-case</b> and gazed solemnly upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... "What has Shadow got to {{say about}} the wild man?" [...] asked Phil Lawrence, looking up from the <b>suit-case</b> he was packing. [...] "Has he been trying to clean out Oak Hall, or {{anything}} like that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lights {{had been}} {{burning in the}} {{bungalow}} almost all through the night; and with {{the first sign of}} day began the bustle of departure. House boys walked processionally carrying <b>suit-cases</b> and dressing-bags down to the schooner’s boat, which came to the landing place {{at the bottom of the}} garden. Just as the rising sun threw its golden nimbus around the purple shape of the headland, the Planter of Malata was perceived pacing bare-headed the curve of the little bay. He exchanged a few words with the sailing-master of the schooner, then remained by the boat, standing very upright, his eyes on the ground, waiting.|$|R
5000|$|Alon studied from 1988 until 1992 at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem. In 1996 he {{received}} the prize for young artists of the Israeli Ministry for education and Culture. In 1998 he participated in an exchange exhibition in Hamburg. In 2001 {{he received}} a working scholarship as a guest artist to Harburg. Since then he works and lives in Hamburg. He had solo exhibitions in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Schwerin, Bonn, Mannheim, Frankfurt and Hamburg. He preferably develops his sculptures from cast-off everyday life articles such as furniture, <b>suit-cases,</b> lamps, light bulbs and cables, whereby the installations are arranged directly at the place of exhibition and in the reference to these. Thus it obtains an urgent effect with most economical means.|$|R
5000|$|Like many {{previous}} Ostrovsky's plays, {{this one}} has been tried out at informal recitals in friends' literary parties. The first of such readings took place in Mikhail Ostrovsky's home. Inspired by it success and following his brother's advice, soon after its publication Ostrovsky nominated the play for the prestigious Uvarov Prize but hasn't got it. The jury's decision has been criticized by Pavel Annenkov who wrote: [...] "Alexander Nikolayevich has been refused the Prize. Such was the decision of those walking <b>suit-cases</b> stuffed with quasi-scientific nonsense who sit in the Academy's Department of the Russian literature, having... not a drop of taste or poetical feeling; not a trace of understanding what mastery is in literature," [...] he wrote to Mikhail Ostrovsky.|$|R
