40|$|All {{superheterodyne}} receivers use one or {{more local}} oscillators to convert an input frequency to an intermediate frequency before the signal is demodulated. In the ideal receiver, these frequency conversions would not distort the input signal, and all information on the signal could be recovered. In a real-world receiver, both the mixer used for converting the signal’s frequency and the local oscillator will distort the signal and limit the receiver’s ability to recover the modulation on a <b>signal.</b> <b>Mixer</b> degradations, such as undesired mixing products, can be minimized by proper design {{in the rest of}} the receiver. The local oscillator degradations, which are principally random phase variations known as phase noise, cannot be decreased except by improving the performance of the oscillator. Low oscillator phase noise is a necessity for many receiving systems. The local oscillator phase noise will limit the ultimate signal-to-noise ratio which can be achieved when listening to a frequency modulated (FM) or phase-modulated (PM) signal.

40|$|A {{modulated}} wideband converter (MWC) {{has been}} introduced as a sub-Nyquist sampler that exploits a set of fast alternating pseudo random (PR) signals. Through parallel sampling branches, an MWC compresses a multiband spectrum by mixing it with PR signals in the time domain, and acquires its sub-Nyquist samples. Previously, the ratio of compression was fully dependent on the specifications of PR signals. That is, to further reduce the sampling rate without information loss, faster and longer-period PR signals were needed. However, the implementation of such PR signal generators results in high power consumption and large fabrication area. In this paper, we propose a novel aliased modulated wideband converter (AMWC), which can further reduce the sampling rate of MWC with fixed PR signals. The main idea is to induce intentional signal aliasing at the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In addition to the first spectral compression by the <b>signal</b> <b>mixer,</b> the intentional aliasing compresses the mixed spectrum once again. We demonstrate that AMWC reduces the number of sampling branches {{and the rate of}} ADC for lossless sub-Nyquist sampling without needing to upgrade the speed or period of PR signals. Conversely, for a given fixed number of sampling branches and sampling rate, AMWC improves the performance of signal reconstruction.

40|$|The static power {{consumption}} {{became one of}} the key limiting factors on the shrinkage of feature size of VLSI circuit using CMOS technology. One major reason of high static {{power consumption}} is the off-state sub-threshold leakage current of the transistor. At room temperature, the possible steepest sub-threshold swing (SS) for turning off the transistor, is limited to 60 mV/decade due to a constant fundamental thermal dynamical limit (kBT/q) that is not scalable with reduced dimension. This limitation is inherent to CMOS because its off-state is governed by thermally activated diffusive current over a potential gate-controlled potential barrier. Completely different switching mechanism such as using the mechanical degree of freedom is necessary to break the SS limit. Previous studies using nano-electro-mechanical-system (NEMS) have shown suspended-gate MOSFET (SG-MOSFET) as logical switch, while we have previously proposed a suspended nanowire (NW) channel FET (NEMFET) with low pull-in voltage(Vpi) and high Ion/Ioff ratio due to the flexibility of nanowires. Here we report the first demonstration of a NEMFET device using suspended Ge/Si core/shell nanowire channel. The NEMFET channel is suspended over a local metal gate with the air gap thickness defined by the thickness of the supporting source/drain electrodes. DC transfer characteristics on multiple switching NEMFET demonstrates close-to-zero SS (< 6 mV) at room temperature with the slope only limited by measurement equipment resolution.

40|$|Millimeter wave (mmWave) {{communications}} {{has been}} regarded as a key enabling technology for 5 G networks. In contrast to conventional multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, precoding in mmWave MIMO cannot be performed entirely at baseband using digital precoders, as {{only a limited number}} of <b>signal</b> <b>mixers</b> and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be supported considering their cost and power consumption. As a cost-effective alternative, a hybrid precoding transceiver architecture, combining a digital precoder and an analog precoder, has recently received considerable attention. However, the optimal design of such hybrid precoders has not been fully understood. In this paper, treating the hybrid precoder design as a matrix factorization problem, effective alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithms will be proposed for two different hybrid precoding structures, i. e., the fully-connected and partially-connected structures. In particular, for the fully-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm based on manifold optimization is proposed to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder, which, however, has a high complexity. Thus, a low-complexity AltMin algorithm is then proposed, by enforcing an orthogonal constraint on the digital precoder. Furthermore, for the partially-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm is also developed with the help of semidefinite relaxation. For practical implementation, the proposed AltMin algorithms are further extended to the broadband setting with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. Simulation results will demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed AltMin algorithms over existing hybrid precoding algorithms. Moreover, based on the proposed algorithms, simulation comparisons between the two hybrid precoding structures will provide valuable design insights.
