40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} various {{extensions of}} the so-called two-flux models for prediction of reflectance and transmittance of diffusing media, i. e. the ubelka-Munk model, and the extension <b>of</b> Kubelka-Munk for <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> diffusing layers. A first matrix formulation of the Kubelka-Munk differential equations leads to a matrix framework based on transfer matrices, which can be extended to <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> diffusing layers, <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> nonscattering films, and <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> scattering and non-scatterings films as a generalization of the Williams-Clapper model for prediction of the reflectance of paper photographs, each of these configurations being illustrated through various examples. This paper also exposes the limitsof the two flux approach and shows that the matrix formalism extends in a straightforward manner to multiflux models, where {{the size of the}} matrices is increased...|$|R

5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of {{hexagonal}} {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin {{walls of the}} hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of marine organisms.|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} a 55 kDa protein, named GRASP 55 (Golgi reassembly <b>stacking</b> protein <b>of</b> 55 kDa), as a component <b>of</b> the Golgi <b>stacking</b> machinery. GRASP 55 is homologous to GRASP 65, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive membrane protein required for the <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae in a cell-free system. GRASP 65 exists in a complex with the vesicle docking protein receptor GM 130 to which it binds directly, and the membrane tethering protein p 115, which also functions in the <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae. GRASP 55 binding to GM 130, could not be detected using biochemical methods, although a weak interaction was detected with the yeast two-hybrid system. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that GRASP 65, like GM 130, is present on the cis-Golgi, while GRASP 55 is on the medial-Golgi. Recombinant GRASP 55 and antibodies to the protein block the <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae, {{which is similar to}} the observations made for GRASP 65. These results demonstrate that GRASP 55 and GRASP 65 function in the <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae...|$|R

5|$|Development of {{the eggs}} {{is a mixture of}} deuterostome and protostome characteristics. Early {{divisions}} of the egg are holoblastic (the cells divide completely) and radial (they gradually form a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> circles). The process is regulative (the fate of each cell depends on interaction with other cells, not on a rigid program in each cell), and experiments that divided early embryos produced complete larvae. Mesoderm is formed from mesenchyme originating from the archenteron.|$|E

5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Now {{imagine a}} <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of}} the universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E
5|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} (also {{known as}} the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is composed of separate sacs called cisternae. Its shape {{is similar to a}} <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The Golgi apparatus is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the Golgi apparatus that receives the vesicles from the ER is {{known as the}} cis face, and is usually near the ER. The opposite end of the Golgi apparatus is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. The trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the Golgi apparatus modifies are sent.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E
5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
5|$|I-805 {{continues}} northward through San Diego, {{where it}} intersects SR94, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets SR15, {{the continuation of}} I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for {{his involvement in the}} construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River. The viaduct is the top <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> the Jack Schrade Interchange over I-8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor.|$|E
40|$|A direct model, {{using the}} {{explicit}} geometry <b>of</b> <b>stacked</b> products in boxes, {{was developed and}} used to study the local and average airflow through <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> horticultural products. The discrete element method was employed to generate a random <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> spherical products in the box. A computational fluid dynamics model was then applied to study explicitly the airflow through the air gaps in the box and in the voids between the <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> different random fillings. The flow resistance was affected by the confinement ratio, product size, porosity, box vent hole ratio, and much less by the random filling. The predicted pressure drop over stacks agreed with experimental correlations for porous media. Air velocity profiles inside the boxes compared well to measurements. The methodology was used to obtain more accurate pressure drop correlation for <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> vented boxes that can now be used in large scale simulations of cool rooms.
