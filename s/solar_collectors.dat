The two widely differing fields of application make special demands on the <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> The task is given by the heat pump manufacturer Thermia and the main objective is to find out whether a <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> should be used as a cooler or not. The performance of the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> under varying environmental conditions is investigated using COMSOL Multiphysics 3. 3. Only the cooling properties are investigated here. The performance of the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> as a heat exchanger is estimated using the effectiveness-NTU method, and the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is found to be a good heat exchanger at low wind speeds. The heat transfer coefficients of the convection and radiation are determined for varying temperature and wind speeds. The convective heat transfer coefficient is lowered by tubes above the absorber plate and for a high convective heat transfer rate the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> surface should be smooth. For a high radiative heat transfer rate the surface needs to have a high emissivity. The cooling rate is higher from a warm surface than from a cold and since no temperature change of the heat carrier is necessary the <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> should be kept at a high temperature.
