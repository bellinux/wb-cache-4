40|$|The paper {{explores the}} form and content of {{economic}} interaction of firms based on various concepts of agglomeration and social networks. It uses {{a case study of}} the machinery sector in the region of Styria as empirical background. Starting with types of clustering – the model of pure agglomeration, the industrial-complex model and the social-network model - the paper argues that certain geographical agglomerations allow different types of networks and different patterns of behaviour. Thus different forms of learning, knowledge sharing and knowledge creation. Some “stylized facts” in support of this perspective are derived from an analysis of a regional network. This network comprises individualistic open systems consisting of several areas which overlap. Physical linkages between these networks are weak, but intersections based on cooperative R&D and R&D infrastructure, qualification and informal exchanges are evident. From a regional perspective it can be seen to dominate. Despite evident <b>sectoral</b> <b>concentrations</b> direct links to the prevailing science base appear more significant as binding factors than long term supplier networks. These relationships are interpreted in terms of their need for proximity, their durability and above all their direction of knowledge dependency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between sectoral diversification and economic development. We develop a risk-based methodology to assess countries' extent of industrial diversification. The industrial structure of a country tends to be risky when the country i) has a high <b>sectoral</b> <b>concentration,</b> ii) specializes in highly risky sectors, and/or iii) specializes in sectors highly affected by country-specific fluctuations. We document the following regularities. First, <b>sectoral</b> <b>concentration</b> declines and then increases with development. Second, industry-specific risk declines with development. Hence, at early stages of development, the decline in concentration {{is accompanied by a}} parallel decrease in industry risk, whereas at higher levels of development <b>sectoral</b> <b>concentration</b> and industry risk move in opposite directions. Third, country-specific risk declines along the development path. Fourth, the covariance between industry and country risk increases with development. We also derive indicators of consumption risk that provide direct evidence on the welfare implications of risk. Finally, we compare the overall level of risk with that of the "optimal country portfolio. "Economic development; Industries...|$|E

(JEL F 43, F 15, O 40) This paper characterizes the pattern of sectoral diversification along the development path. Using data on sector-level employment and value added, covering a wide cross section of countries at various levels of disaggregation, we provide new and robust evidence that economies grow through two stages of diversification. At first, sectoral diversification increases, but there exists a level of per capita income beyond which the sectoral distribution of economic activity starts concentrating again.

The second uses as a quasi-natural experiment the deregulations that occurred in the banking and financial sectors in the nineties and estimates differences in differences coefficients.

40|$|How {{effective}} {{are public}} interventions in addressing significant regional disparities in formal manufacturing concentration in a developing economy? The authors examine the aggregate and <b>sectoral</b> geographic <b>concentration</b> of manufacturing industries for Indonesia, and estimate {{the impact of}} factors influencing location choice at the firm level. They distinguish between natural advantage, including infrastructure endowments, wage rates, and natural resource endowments, and production externalities, arising from the co-location of firms in the same or complementary industries. The methodology pays special attention to empirically distinguishing the impact of measured production externalities from unobserved local characteristics. Depending on the sector, the authors find that a mix of both forms of regional advantage explains the geographic distribution of firms. Based on the estimated location choice model, they illustrate the potential impacts of policy interventions on manufacturing distribution by simulating the effectiveness of transport improvements on relocation of firms. Their findings suggest that improvements in transport infrastructure may only have limited effects in attracting industry to secondary industrial centers outside of Java, especially in sectors already established in leading regions. The findings underscore the challenges for addressing the industrial fortunes of lagging regions, either through local decentralized policy interventions or national policies focused on infrastructure development.

Correlation coefficients are calculated to estimate the co-location patterns of LEs and MNEs, allowing {{an investigation of the}} overall impact of stated industrial and regional policy goals on the Irish manufacturing sector. The pattern of spatial changes found suggests that market forces were already driving enterprises out of more concentrated locations prior to the introduction of policies to promote greater spatial dispersion in the late 1990 s. MNEs have become more sectorally specialised over the period, which is not surprising as policy is deliberately selective in attracting MNEs to key high tech manufacturing sectors. The less concentrated sectoral pattern amongst LEs enterprises is consistent with general restructuring in Irish manufacturing from lower- to higher-tech sectors, and the high sectoral correlation for high-tech MNEs and LEs suggests that LEs are following MNEs into the same sectors. geographic <b>concentration,</b> <b>sectoral</b> specialisation, entropy indices, MNEs, LEs, public policy...|$|R

In this paper, we examine {{in the first part}} if monitoring abilities of German cooperative banks and savings banks increase with their specialization on certain industry sectors. We observe that sectoral specialization generally entails better monitoring quality, particularly {{in the case of the}} cooperative banks. In the second part we measure the overall effect of better monitoring and the associated higher sectoral credit concentrations on the credit risk of the portfolio. Our empirical results suggest that specialization benefits overcompensate the impact of higher credit concentrations in the case of the cooperative banks. For savings banks, the results on the net effect depend on how specialization is measured. If specialization is gauged by Hirschman Herfindahl indices, the net effect is an increase of portfolio risk due to the higher <b>sectoral</b> <b>concentration.</b> If specialization is instead measured by distance measures, portfolio risk decreases as the impact of better monitoring abilities prevails.

It extends the literature by increasing country coverage and the types of search processes considered, and by focusing on the links with overall performance in these search processes. After controlling for the necessary relationships as well as fixed effects at the country/commodity group level, the paper finds a clear negative relationship between the concentration of innovation portfolios and performance: countries that are the most successful in these search processes have their successes spread across a broader range of industries than those with poorer performance. Furthermore, the search for export booms exhibits the least amount of <b>sectoral</b> <b>concentration</b> and path-dependence. These findings suggest that public support for these processes need not be focused in a narrow range of sectors, and modeling of these processes in theoretical work, particularly in the search for export booms, should be of a stochastic flavor.

40|$|In {{the lead}} up to the 2004 election, federal member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, infamously argued that Penrith, the main {{locality}} in her electorate, was a ‘pram city’, and did not need improved funding for its university. The image of place invoked essentialist understandings of suburban residents: outer areas {{were meant to be}} working class and anti-intellectual; a commuter belt, where students weren’t welcome, where men travelled from to work in factories and offices, and women looked after children. This hotly contested invocation built on pre-existing imaginary geographies of the city that construct binaries between inner and outer city areas: densely populated vs. sprawl; gentrified terraces vs. new estates; zones of production and creativity vs. sedate, consumer territory. Although such binaries have been long debunked by researchers, we argue in this article that lurking behind recent urban research (particularly the flood of work on creativity and the creative class) has been an unconscious reproduction of such binaries. Though certainly not expressed in Kelly’s regressive terminology, emphasis has been placed on inner metropolitan, gentrified zones of cities, where industries like film, music and advertising have tended to locate. Middle and outer ring suburbs (as well as rural areas) are largely ignored, implied to be ‘uncreative’ zones—places of domestic consumption rather than sites of innovation, the arts and creativity. This article deconstructs these binaries. It critiques indexing measures that portray suburbs as ‘lagging’ and ‘uncreative’, and draws instead on longitudinal research on creative industries in Sydney to reveal a more complex story of social change and <b>sectoral</b> differentiation, of <b>concentration,</b> dispersal and relational networks...|$|R
