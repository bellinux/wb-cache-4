The United States is the world's second largest producer of pork with <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> centered {{in the state of}} Iowa. Conventional confinement facilities are typical of pork industry practice in the United States and are characterized by individual gestation stalls and 1200 head grow-finish buildings with slatted concrete floors and liquid manure systems. The hoop barn-based alternative uses group pens in bedded hoop barns for gestation and finishing. Both systems use climate controlled farrowing facilities with individual farrowing crates as well as climate controlled nursery facilities. Feed is the single largest operating resource in <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems and feed fed to grow-finish pigs accounts for 63 - 65 % of total energy use in raising pigs.

In this study we analyze the determinants of the location of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> in Denmark with particular focus on spatial externalities and the interaction between the location of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> and upstream sector and slaughterhouses. It is the assumption that the location of slaughterhouses is influenced by the location of the primary producers, implying that this variable is endogenous, whereas the location of primary producers is independent of the location of slaughterhouses. This is due to the fact that transportation costs of pigs are paid by the cooperatives owning the slaughterhouses. This assumption is tested applying a spatial econometric model.

For the period of 2010 - 2030, we explored possible effects of technological and managerial measures aimed at improving the performances of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> via scenario analysis. We used and further developed the NUtrient flows in Food Chains, Environment and Resources use (NUFER) model to calculate the feed requirement and consumption, and N and P losses in different <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems for all the years Between 1960 and 2010, <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> has largely shifted from the so-called backyard system to landless systems. The N use efficiencies at fattener level increased from 18 to 28 %, due to the increased animal productivity. However, the N use efficiencies at the Whole system level decreased from 46 to 11 % during this period, mainly due to the increase of landless pig farms, which rely on imported feed and have no land-base for manure disposal. The total N and P losses were 5289 and 829 Gg in 2010, which is 30 and 95 times higher than in 1960. In the business as usual scenario, the total N and P losses were projected to increase by 25 and 55 % between 2010 and 2030, respectively. Analyses of other scenarios indicate that packages of technological and managerial measures can decrease total N and P losses by 64 and 95 % respectively.

This study investigates Chinese consumers' attitudes towards different <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems by means of a conjoint analysis. While there has been a range of studies on Western consumers' attitudes to various forms of food production, little is known about the level of Chinese consumers' attitudes. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 472 participants in 6 Chinese cities. Results indicate that Chinese consumers prefer industrial <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems, where traditional pig breeds are raised, over large-scale and small family farms. Farms with maximum attention to food safety, which furthermore can provide lean meat with consistent quality, are also preferred. Imported pig breeds and tasty but variable meat were rejected.

Cluster 3 (industrial production oriented) stands out by being very positive about industrial, large-size farms and consistent quality.

The total non-solar energy input associated with one 136 kg pig produced in a conventional farrow-to-finish system in Iowa and fed a typical corn-soybean meal diet that includes synthetic lysine and exogenous phytase is 967. 9 MJ.

Socio-cultural sustainability refers to social perceptions of animal farming, including social appreciations and concerns of animal production systems. Integration of social demands and values in the production sector is a prerequisite to justify animal production within a society. The objective {{of the present study}} was therefore to gain further insights into socio-cultural sustainability of <b>pig</b> <b>production.</b> Many citizens may not know what contemporary <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> actually entails. To give people a real life experience with <b>pig</b> <b>production,</b> we conducted farm visits with citizen panels with 18 respondents in the Netherlands and 8 respondents in Denmark. In both countries, respondents were divided over two panels and each panel visited a conventional and an organic pig farm. During the farm visits respondents noted their sensory experiences — what do you smell, hear, see and feel? In addition, each respondent made pictures of six positive and six negative aspects on the farms for which they had to write a motivation. The qualitative analysis resulted in seven socio-cultural themes (SCT) of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> namely: 1) meat production, 2) farm activities, 3) farm income, 4) animals, 5) housing system, 6) environment and nature, and 7) culture and landscape. Each SCT included several socio-cultural aspects (appreciations, SCA) and socio-cultural issues (concerns, SCI). We identified 31 SCAs in the Netherlands and 33 SCAs in Denmark, of which 29 were SCIs in both countries. Although many issues were associated with animal welfare, the results also showed that social concerns of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> extended beyond animal welfare.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Environmental {{impacts of}} {{livestock}} systems, especially <b>pig</b> <b>production,</b> {{have come under}} increasing debate in recent years. The challenge is in meeting the growing demand for food at an affordable cost, without compromising environmental integrity. Previous {{studies have shown that}} feed production is responsible for the majority of CO 2 -eq. emission resulting from pig farming systems. This seems to indicate that feed strategies could be an effective tool to achieve the sustainability of the pork chain. Therefore, dietary crude protein reduction, through the addition of industrial amino acids, lessens the nitrogen excretion by pigs and, consequently, could mitigate the effects on the environment of <b>pig</b> <b>production.</b> In this sense, to effectively evaluate the environmental impacts of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems, life cycle assessment has been widely used in agriculture, but the effects of feed are still understudied in Brazilian conditions. Owing to the importance and the great concern in this research area, we presented in this paper an updated review focusing on the nutritional techniques and their potential to reduce the global warming potential of <b>pig</b> <b>production,</b> considering both the direct effects, related to the choice of feed ingredients and the indirect effects, related to changes in the efficiency of use of nutrient by the animals...|$|R

The difference between the concentrations of methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide measured with SCTS-CL, PTR-MS, and GC-SCD was below 10 %.

The results show a considerably higher amount of MRSA-positive pigs in conventional herds than in pigs of organic herds and in wild boars (no MRSA were found in the tested wild boars). All MRSA isolates belong to the clonal line MRSA ST 398, which is known as livestock-associated MRSA (laMRSA). Our two hypotheses for the considerably higher occurrence of MRSA in conventional <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> arc: a) the circulation of this special clonal line laMRSA ST 398 between conventional pig herds and b) better MRSA transmission conditions because of a higher pig density in conventional <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems than in organic <b>pig</b> <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> systems or in the wild boar population...|$|R
