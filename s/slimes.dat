5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of <b>slimes</b> found throughout the Dragon Quest and Rocket Slime series. These include <b>slimes</b> in different colors, bubble <b>slimes,</b> which look like pools of slime, nautical <b>slimes</b> that wear conch shells, the rare metal <b>slimes,</b> which have high defense, give out large amounts of experience points, and tend to flee from battle, healslimes, which have tentacles, and king <b>slimes,</b> which are very large <b>slimes</b> wearing crowns and come in various versions, such as regular or metal.|$|E
5|$|The Dragon Quest series {{features}} several recurring monsters, including <b>Slimes,</b> Drackies, Skeletons, Shadows, Mummies, Bags o' Laughs, and Dragons. Many monsters in {{the series}} were designed by Akira Toriyama.|$|E
5|$|The Slime {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in Dragon Quest as the first and weakest enemy in the game, and has made a similar appearance in all subsequent Dragon Quest titles. In , the monster is an easy recruit that learns a variety of magic spells. The Slime is also the protagonist of its own spinoff series, beginning with Slime MoriMori Dragon Quest, a Japanese Game Boy Advance title. It was followed by , which was released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, and the Japanese-exclusive title, Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 3 for the Nintendo 3DS. These games follow a nation of <b>slimes</b> who are intelligent and civilized, but also cute and somewhat comical. In the North American localization of the Dragon Quest games for the Nintendo DS, joking references and puns are made about <b>slimes.</b> Slime also appeared in three crossover games along with characters from Nintendo's Mario franchise: Itadaki Street DS, Mario Sports Mix, and Fortune Street.|$|E

5000|$|Emergency <b>Slime</b> Shower and <b>Slime</b> Pit: A slime-dripping shower that poured <b>Slime</b> {{on those}} who pressed its lever. The shower was located over a large pit of Green <b>Slime,</b> and <b>Slime</b> often poured from the sides and top of the tower. The one located at California's Great America still stands, albeit with a new paint job.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of Staphylococcus epidermidis <b>slime</b> with human neutrophils (PMN) was examined by using isolated <b>slime</b> and allowing bacteria to elaborate <b>slime</b> and other extracellular products in situ. S. epidermidis <b>slime</b> {{was found to}} contain a chemoattractant. Incubation of PMN with 50 micrograms or more of <b>slime</b> per ml inhibited subsequent chemotaxis of the PMN to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine by 27 % and to zymosan-activated serum by 44 to 67 % with increasing <b>slime</b> concentrations. S. epidermidis <b>slime</b> stimulated little degranulation of untreated PMN. After pretreatment of PMN with 5 micrograms of cytochalasin b per ml, <b>slime</b> predominantly induced release of specific granule contents (33. 8 % lactoferrin release by 250 micrograms of <b>slime</b> per ml versus 10 % myeloperoxidase release by 250 micrograms of <b>slime</b> per ml). By a surface phagocytosis assay, PMN uptake of radiolabeled S. epidermidis which were incubated for 18 h on a plastic surface for <b>slime</b> expression was less than that for S. epidermidis adhered to the plastic for 2 h or grown in unsupplemented nutrient broth. These results suggest that S. epidermidis <b>slime</b> interaction with PMN may be potentially detrimental to host defense and {{may contribute to the}} ability of this organism to persist on surfaces of foreign bodies in the vascular or central nervous system...|$|R
5|$|The after-battle monster {{recruitment}} {{has been}} removed. In the original 1995 Super Famicon version of Dragon Quest VI, {{certain types of}} monsters can be randomly recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain <b>Slimes</b> that will join you once you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie still remains recruitable.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{recognizable}} symbol of the best-selling video game series in Japan, the Slime has been featured prominently in Dragon Quest-related merchandise. It has its own section called 'Smile Slime' on the Square Enix JP shopping website. Slime merchandise includes plush toys, pencil cases, keychains, game controllers, a stylus, and several boardgames including one titled Dragon Quest Slime Racing. In Japan, pork filled steam buns shaped like <b>slimes</b> have been sold. For Dragon Quest's 25th anniversary, special items were sold including business cards, tote bags, and crystal figurines.|$|E
5|$|Double Dares lasting {{popularity}} {{has led to}} a variety of products being made available. Pressman Toy Corporation released two traditional board games based on the show: The Double Dare home game was released in September 1987 and Wet 'N Wild Double Dare was released in March 1989. Another board game titled Double Dare: The Game was manufactured by Mattel in 2001. GameTek published a PC game in 1988, and a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 based on the program. Containing facts about the show, along with trivia and activities to host a home version of the game, two editions of The Double Dare Game Book were released by Parachute Press in 1988 and 1989. Based on substances referenced on Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, Mattel and Jakks Pacific manufactured a series of toy <b>slimes</b> called Gak and Goooze. Other toys, apparel, lunchboxes, and school supplies have been sold featuring the show's logo and art.|$|E
50|$|The {{first true}} enemy {{featured}} within the journey between both Sanzo and Kongo {{to the western}} heavens. <b>Slime</b> Lord is a large chef like eel who enjoys being the # 1 cook under Dearth Voyd. <b>Slime</b> Lord is first featured in episode 12 of the series, as a ruler of a mountain, and master over Runlay, a dragon spirit who <b>Slime</b> Lord orders to abduct Sanzoh, and have him brought to his lair to become a meal. Soon enough, <b>Slime</b> Lord is challenged by Kongo for custody of Sanzoh, who proves to be a cunning adversary for the <b>Slime</b> Lord, but realizes that his physical attacks {{have no effect on}} <b>Slime</b> Lord due to the latter's body being of rubbery <b>slime</b> like substance. Before <b>Slime</b> Lord has a chance to destroy Kongo, Runlay challenges <b>Slime</b> Lord in defiance. After Kongo manages to retrieve Runlay's dragon stone, the young dragon is able to defeat the <b>Slime</b> Lord with true ease. Following his defeat, <b>Slime</b> Lord would be seen as a small eel (small enough to fit in a small sack). Through Sanzoh's orders, Kongo frees the now rather small <b>Slime</b> Lord into a neighboring pond and then continues on their very long journey west.|$|R

50|$|<b>Slime</b> is a toy product {{manufactured}} by Mattel, sold {{in a plastic}} trash can and introduced {{in the winter of}} 1976. It consisted of a non-toxic viscous, squishy and oozy green or other color material made primarily from guar gum. Different variations of <b>Slime</b> were released over the years, including <b>Slime</b> containing rubber insects, eyeballs, and worms and Masters of the Universe <b>Slime</b> for Hordak's <b>Slime</b> Pit playset in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and <b>slimes</b> were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E
25|$|The blue slime is {{a monster}} from the Japanese Dragon Quest video game series. The Dragon Quest series {{includes}} over 20 types of <b>slimes,</b> {{the majority of}} which are present in these games. As the player rescues other <b>slimes,</b> more {{areas of the world}} are opened up.|$|E

40|$|Light microscopy, {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}}, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} were used to visualize the extracellular <b>slime</b> of Proteus mirabilis swarm cells. <b>Slime</b> was observed with phase-contrast microscopy after fixation in hot sulfuric acid-sodium borate. Ruthenium red was used to stain <b>slime</b> for transmission electron microscopy. Copious quantities of extracellular <b>slime</b> were observed surrounding swarm cells; the <b>slime</b> appeared to provide a matrix through which the cells could migrate. Swarm cells were always found embedded in <b>slime.</b> These observations support the argument that swarming of P. mirabilis {{is associated with the}} production of large quantities of extracellular <b>slime.</b> Examination of nonswarming mutants of P. mirabilis revealed that a number of morphological changes, including cell elongation and increased flagellum synthesis, were required for swarm cell migration. It is still unclear whether extracellular <b>slime</b> production also is required for migration...|$|R

25|$|The {{player can}} also carry enemies or other <b>slimes</b> on his head. Enemies, {{of which he}} can carry up to three, can be thrown as an attack, while friends are {{required}} to be carried to a conveyance back home in order to count as rescued. These modes of transportation include rail carts, airships, and balloons. Occasionally <b>slimes</b> in the village will give quests to the player, which require them to carry enemies or items to these transport points. Picking up a certain enemy, the swordsman, allows the player to perform a sword attack which is faster than the standard stretch attack. If the player is hit by an enemy, everything they are carrying is dropped.|$|E
25|$|The first potash {{application}} was in England in 1993, where Jameson Cells {{were used to}} treat potash <b>slimes</b> (see Potash flotation). It has subsequently been applied at Israel Chemicals Limited's Dead Sea Works and by an unnamed producer in the Saskatchewan province of Canada.|$|E

25|$|The 1853 lease {{required}} {{the company to}} reduce the pollution being washed out of its mills and down the beck. Slime pits were dug to catch the fine sands and <b>slimes,</b> which were then treated {{in a number of}} circular buddles. In these, water-borne fine sands were sprayed onto a sloping conical floor. Heavy lead-rich sands and muds settled near the centre of the buddle and lighter waste flowed to the edges. They helped both to increase lead recovery and reduce pollution.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 {{the company}} shifted its IT systems to a {{terminal}} which communicated with a data center in Oslo. The company had 1547 employees in 1975.

Construction of Melkefoss Power Station was started by Sameiet Skogfoss Kraftverk 1976 and completed two years later. Along with Statskog, the municipality and the power company, Sydvaranger established a workshop company at Pasvik. However, this increased transport costs and Sydvaranger would later walk away from the partnership. From the mid-1970s until 1970, Sydvaranger did not produce sufficient <b>slimes</b> themselves and had to import this.|$|E
50|$|The olive <b>slime</b> is {{a strain}} of monstrous plant life akin to green <b>slime.</b> Contact with olive <b>slime</b> causes the {{creature}} to exude a numbing poison, allowing it to spread itself over the body area of its victim, sending parasitic tendrils to feed on the fluids of the host. The host begins to change, its mind being affected by secretions of the olive <b>slime,</b> so that the mind's main concern becomes to feed, protect, and aid the growth. The host begins a metamorphosis into a vegetable creature after several days, as the olive <b>slime</b> gradually replaces skin and muscle tissue. Once metamorphosis is complete, the host becomes a <b>slime</b> creature, which is able to spread olive <b>slime</b> to other creatures.|$|R
