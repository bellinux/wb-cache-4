50|$|The <b>sungrebe,</b> an aquatic bird, is {{typically}} measured to be 28-31 cm long with a weight of around 130 grams. It possesses a slimly shaped {{body with a}} tail that extends significantly beyond the body in flight. The <b>sungrebe</b> has predominately brown plumage with white stripes down {{both sides of the}} bird's long neck. In addition, both the throat and chin are white. It also has lobed toes that are banded a dull yellow and black and a long red bill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sungrebe</b> or American finfoot (Heliornis fulica) is a bird which breeds in {{tropical}} Central and South America from southern Mexico to northeast Argentina and southern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The African finfoot {{belongs to}} a family, Heliornithidae, whose only other members are the masked finfoot and the <b>sungrebe.</b> Their {{relationships}} between this family and other birds are poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|The African finfoot (Podica senegalensis) is an {{aquatic bird}} {{from the family}} Heliornithidae (the finfoots and <b>sungrebe).</b> The species lives in the rivers and lakes of western, central, and {{southern}} Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sungrebe</b> is a {{relatively}} good diver and may hunt either in the water partially submerged or from low perches. As well as hunting small aquatic animals, it {{has been known to}} also feed upon plant matter found within its habitat.|$|E
50|$|All {{three species}} tend to breed after the wet season, the exact timing {{of which is}} {{dependent}} on the local climate. The breeding behaviour of the masked finfoot is almost entirely unknown. All three species exhibit some changes in appearance prior to breeding - masked finfoots develop a fleshy knob above the bill, and the plumage of the male African finfoot and female <b>sungrebe</b> also change. There is considerable variation within the finfoots on several aspects of breeding; in the <b>Sungrebe</b> the nest building and incubation duties are shared between the sexes, in the African finfoot the female alone incubates. The nests of all finfoots are untidy bowls of sticks, twigs, and reeds suspended in vegetation above water.|$|E
50|$|Sungrebes {{have been}} {{reported}} from Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Though occasionally recorded at higher elevations, the <b>sungrebe</b> is usually associated with lower elevations from around 200 to 500 meters. Because of its very large population, the IUNC evaluates it as being of Least Concern. No population trend has been established, because of uncertainty over the effects of habitat modification on population size. However, the <b>sungrebe</b> population is not believed to be declining rapidly enough to approach the criteria that would label the species as Vulnerable. Because there is no apparent threat, the overall global population has never been exactly quantified.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} in appearance {{between males and}} females are minimal, but they can be distinguished based on cheek coloring. The male possesses white colored cheeks and the female is buff. An unusual trait of this bird species is the ability for males to carry the chicks within skin pouches {{on the underside of the}} wings. Due to the intensity that the male <b>sungrebe</b> grips these chicks, he is even capable of carrying them while flying. This adaptation isn't a mechanism adapted by any other bird species; it is completely unique to the <b>sungrebe.</b> While some other birds may transport while swimming, the ability to fly while carrying the chicks is much less researched and understood due to such a limited number that are capable.|$|E
5000|$|The Heliornithidae [...] are a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} birds with webbed lobes on their feet like those of grebes and coots. The family overall are known as finfoots, although one species {{is known as a}} <b>sungrebe.</b> The family is composed of three species in three genera.|$|E
50|$|The masked finfoot or Asian finfoot (Heliopais personatus) is an {{aquatic bird}} from the fresh and {{brackish}} wetlands {{of the eastern}} Indian subcontinent, Indochina, Malaysia and Indonesia. Like {{the rest of the}} family, the African finfoot and the <b>sungrebe,</b> the relationship to other birds is poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} species. The African finfoot {{is found in}} {{tropical}} Africa on streams in woodland. The masked finfoot has a scattered distribution from Eastern India down through southeast Asia to the Wallace Line. The <b>sungrebe</b> is found in tropical Central and South America. Finfoots are highly secretive and many aspects of their biology are unknown to science.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sungrebe</b> {{has been}} {{frequently}} reported {{as having a}} mating season that begins {{in the middle of}} April during the [...] "early wet season." [...] Both the male and female birds take part in the nest building, which typically consists of twigs, reeds, and dried leaves. The nest is a platform placed about a meter above the water's surface in overhanging vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|Waterbirds {{found in}} the park include the Wood Stork (Mycteria americana),Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors), Black-bellied Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata), Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), Bare-throated Tiger-heron (Tigrisoma mexicanum), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolor), Green Heron (Butorides virescens), <b>Sungrebe</b> (Heliornis fulica), Limpkin (Aramus guarauna), and Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus), ...|$|E
50|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} {{known about the}} diet of the <b>sungrebe.</b> Despite their vast population numbers, because of their solitary behavior {{it is difficult to}} observe them in the wild. They have been reported to eat snails and a variety of insects, and also spiders, small crabs, and small frogs and lizards. Most of their eating takes place in the water and vegetation relatively near the water.|$|E
50|$|There {{are usually}} {{two to four}} eggs in a clutch, all with a white base color that is {{consistently}} covered in brown and pale purple spots. The eggs hatch after an unusually short incubation period of only 10 to 11 days. Both sexes share a responsibility in the incubation of the eggs; the female sits on the nest {{for most of the}} daylight hours and throughout the night, while male incubates them during the middle part of the day. Unlike their close relatives, the African and masked finfoot, the <b>sungrebe</b> chicks are hatched with only sparse down and poorly matured feet and bill. The chicks hatch naked, blind, and defenseless.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and <b>sungrebe</b> (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA fossil humerus {{from the}} hominid {{fossiliferous}} area of Toros Menalla (ca 7 Ma, Chad, Africa) {{belongs to the}} Heliornithidae (Aves, Gruiformes). It is the second documented fossil record for the family, and {{the first in the}} Old World. It is compared with all the living species: the <b>Sungrebe</b> (Heliornis fulica), the Masked Finfoot (Heliopais personata) and the African Finfoot (Podica senegalensis). It belongs to the genus Heliopais, and is very similar to the only species H. personata. The Masked Finfoot appears to have evolved little morphologically since the Miocene. This poorly known and threatened genus and species is today confined to tropical South-East Asia. Its presence in the Late Miocene of Chad is a further Asian element in the late Neogene African avifaunas. Today the distribution of Heliopais is highly relictual, and some Heliornithidae will certainly be encountered in the Paleogene and the Miocene deposits of the Palearctic region. The African Finfoot is today the Heliornithidae geographically the closest to the site area, and occurs in forested regions south of the Sahelian area. Apparently, this genus was already absent further north, where the Asian genus was present, in the Late Neogene. Palaeoecologically, the presence of this Heliornithidae is indicative for Toros Menalla of a freshwater body with thick overhanging vegetation, and partly forested edges. This kind of precise indication about a component of the palaeoenvironment is critical for the study of hominid sites and early hominid evolution. A growing number of fossil birds from African hominid localities is yielding important clues regarding biogeography and environment...|$|E
