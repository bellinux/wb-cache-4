50|$|Bloom {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} genome instability. The most prominent features include short stature and a rash on the face that develops early in life when exposed to the sun. The skin rash is erythematous, telangiectatic, infiltrated, and scaly, it can appear across the nose, on the cheeks and around the lips. As well as these areas the rash will develop on any other sun-exposed areas including, {{the backs of the}} hands and neck. Other clinical features include a high-pitched voice; distinct facial features, including a long, narrow face, micrognathism, and prominent nose and ears; pigmentation changes of the skin including hypo-pigmented and hyper-pigmented areas, cafe-au-lait spots, and telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels), which can appear on the skin and eyes. Moderate immune deficiency, characterized by deficiency in certain immunoglobulin classes has also been related to BS, leading to recurrent pneumonia and ear infections. Most individuals with Bloom syndrome are born with a low birth weight. Hypogonadism is characterized by a failure to produce sperm, hence infertility in males, and premature cessation of menses (premature menopause), hence <b>sub-fertility</b> in females. However, several women with Bloom syndrome have had children. The most serious and common complication of Bloom {{syndrome is}} cancer. Other complications of the disorder include chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, and learning disabilities. There is no evidence that mental retardation is more common in Bloom syndrome than in other people. People with Bloom Syndrome have a shortened life expectancy; the average life span is approximately 27 years. Bloom syndrome shares some features with Fanconi anemia possibly because there is overlap in the function of the proteins mutated in this related disorder.|$|E

This review integrates existing data regarding sub-fertile couple members' individual coping {{and the influence of}} intracouple coping concordance on fertility problem stress. Eleven publications, comprising nine quantitative and two qualitative studies, were identified using a list of selection criteria applied to the results of defined searches in Psycinfo, Web of Knowledge and CINAHL and manual searches of articles' bibliographies. Females were found to experience greater distress and utilise more coping strategies than males, which may be influenced by the importance of motherhood to the female gender role. Couple members' coping was found to influence their partner's distress levels with the extent of intra-couple coping concordance and discordance for several coping strategies being found to impact upon partners' distress levels. The effect of intra-couple coping concordance and discordance upon partners' availability to support each other is considered. Further research specifically focusing upon the measurement of intra-couple coping of concordance/ discordance and the impact upon partners’ <b>sub-fertility</b> related distress within couples is required, as this is currently an under researched area, with little consensus about which coping strategies are investigated and, subsequently, the effects of intra-couple coping concordance.

40|$|The {{reasons for}} <b>sub-fertility</b> in {{patients}} with mild endo-metriosis remain unclear. Peritoneal fluid constituents may alter tubal transport and embryonic cleavage, with subsequent implantation disturbances. We used an animal model to study the influence of endometrial implants on early embryonic development. In 25 rabbits, endometrium from the right uter-ine born was transplanted onto the peritoneum (Experimental group = Group E). In 25 rabbits, fat was transplanted (con-trol group = Group C). After a recovery period of 12 weeks the does were mated, and killed 24 h later. In the experimen-tal group the implants had changed into cysts of 5 - 15 mm in diameter.

40|$|Cryptorchidism or undescended testis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{anomalies}} encountered in paediatric urology and is estimated to affect 1 to 4 per cent of full term and upto 30 per cent of preterm male neonates. The associated problems of <b>sub-fertility</b> or infertility and malignant transformation have been recognized for long. Fertility is impaired after both unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism. The reported paternity rates in adults are about two-third for unilateral undescended testis and less than one-third for bilateral disease. Over the last five decades, the concepts related to cryptorchidism have changed dramatically as knowledge about its effects has accrued from research conducted worldwide. The recommended age of orchidopexy has fallen progressively from adolescence to less than one year. The realization that the infantile testes are not in a state of ′suspended animation′ and the recognition of the defect in the androgen dependent transformation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia in cryptorchidism have been recognized as the primary cause of <b>sub-fertility</b> in these patients.

40|$|Aim. This study {{aimed to}} explore the lived {{experience}} of <b>sub-fertility</b> among Chinese couples in Hong Kong. Background. In Chinese culture, the duty of young married couples is to bear children {{to carry on the}} family line. Married couples who are unable to bear children often experience personal psychological stress and social pressure. Design. Qualitative, exploratory study. Methods. Seven women and four men in Hong Kong were interviewed to explore their lived experiences of being involuntarily childless. Collaizi's phenomenological methods guided data collection and analysis. Results. Sub-fertile couples reported feelings of incompleteness, guilt, shame and isolation from the 'fertile' world. These couples acknowledged that <b>sub-fertility</b> had implications on their marital relationship and regretted not having treatment earlier. Some found ways to replace their 'loss' and to cope with their situation, and some rationalised by finding reasons that favoured being childless. Discussion. It is recommended that family planning should be incorporated into premarital screening and to provide timely support and counselling. Relevance to clinical practice. Family planning and fertility should be incorporated into premarital counselling. Sub-fertile couples should be encouraged to seek medical help, being provided with early referral for investigation and treatment and with support and counselling. Health care professionals should respect the decisions of sub-fertile couples with regard to investigations or assisted reproductive services. They should also assess how each partner interprets the situation if they encountered difficulty in dealing with the situation. School of Nursin...|$|E

40|$|National audienceIn insects, {{reproductive}} success and survival {{are affected by}} temperature. Reproduction is more sensitive than other physiological traits. While the effects of heat stress on females are well known, the effects on males are less clear. Hymenopteran parasitoids are valuable for studying the consequences of heat stress on male reproduction. In these species, through arrhenotoquous parthenogenesis, the sex ratio of the offspring is directly dependent on the sperm stock acquired by females during copulation. In the lab, heat temperature treatments (32 – 44 °C) were applied for 3 days in the pupal stage of Anisopteromalus caland-rae males, and development was completed at 30 °C. Three different effects were observed depending on the temperature: mortality above 42 °C, sterility of emerging males at 40 °C, and <b>sub-fertility</b> at 38 °C. This <b>sub-fertility</b> {{is characterized by a}} dramatic decrease in male sperm supplies, of up to 7 % compared to control males. In the course of ageing, the sperm stock of sub-fertile males increases but never reaches the level of control males. Survival was significantly higher in control (30 °C) males than those treated at 38 °C. Male mating ability was similar whatever the treatment (control and 38 °C), but females mated with 38 °C-treated males stored 100 times less sperm on average than those mated with control males. The offspring sex ratio of females mated with 38 °C-treated males was strongly male biased. The physiological mechanisms are as yet unknown. The relationship between temperature, sperm stock and sex ratio should be taken into account in the management of parasitoids for integrated pest management...|$|E
