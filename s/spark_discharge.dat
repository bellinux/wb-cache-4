A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s.

This gas {{presents}} several curious {{points in}} relation to the bright and dark parts of <b>spark</b> <b>discharge.</b> When bright sparks passed between the rod ends 0.3 of an inch in diameter (1544.), very sudden dark parts would occur next to the brightest portions of the spark. Again with these ends and also with balls (1422.), the bright sparks would be sometimes red, sometimes green, and occasionally green and red {{in different parts of the}} same spark. Again, in the experiments described (1518.), at certain intervals a very peculiar pale, dull, yet sudden discharge would pass, which, though apparently weak, was very direct in its course, and accompanied by a sharp snapping noise, as if quick in its occurrence.|$|E
6000|$|... 1444. I {{have nowhere}} said, {{nor does it}} follow, that the air is charged only where the {{luminous}} brush appears. The charging may extend beyond those parts which are visible, i.e. particles to the right or left of the lines of light may receive electricity, the parts which are luminous being so only because much electricity is passing by them to other parts (1437.); just as in a <b>spark</b> <b>discharge</b> the light is greater as more electricity passes, though it has no necessary relation to the quantity required to commence discharge (1370. 1420.). Hence the form we see in a brush may by no means represent the whole quantity of air electrified; for an invisible portion, clothing the visible form to a certain depth, may, at the same time, receive its charge (1552.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1533. It {{is curious}} {{to observe the}} {{relation}} of glow, brush, and spark to each other, as produced by positive or negative surfaces; thus, beginning with <b>spark</b> <b>discharge,</b> it passes into brush much sooner when the surface at which the discharge commences (1484.) is negative, than it does when positive; but proceeding onwards {{in the order of}} change, we find that the positive brush passes into glow long before the negative brush does. So that, though each presents the three conditions in the same general order, the series are not precisely the same. It is probable, that, when these points are minutely examined, as they must be shortly, we shall find that each different gas or dielectric presents its own peculiar results, dependent upon the mode in which its particles assume polar electric condition.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>discharges</b> in {{dielectric}} fluids {{result in}} the formation of highly conductive plasma-vapour cavities between the electrodes. These cavities have extremely high internal pressure (up to several GPa) and expansion velocities. In water for example, the spark plasma cavity can expand with a velocity of 100 to 1000 m/s. Such hydro-dynamic parameters make plasma transient cavities a useful source of high power ultrasound (HPU) pulses in dielectric liquids. The HPU pulses generated by the plasma discharges are extremely wide band and can be used in practical applications. The <b>spark</b> <b>discharges</b> can be generated by two approaches: using free discharges in the fluid and by placing a thin guide wire between the electrodes. Both free and wire-guided <b>spark</b> <b>discharges</b> have their advantages which are discussed in the paper. The paper also presents a phenomenological approach to the calculation of the dynamic resistance of the plasma in the cavity and pressure of the acoustic pulses radiated by the cavity. This model is based on the plasma channel energy balance equation used by Braginskii and links the hydrodynamic characteristics of the plasma with the parameters of the electric driving circuit. Several practical applications of the HPU pulses are also discussed...|$|R
6000|$|... 1568. The effect {{described}} is {{also probably}} influential in causing those variations in <b>spark</b> <b>discharge</b> {{referred to in}} the last series (1386. 1390. 1391.): for if a particle of dust were drawn towards the axis of induction between the balls, it would tend, whilst at some distance from that axis, to commence discharge at itself, in the manner described (1566.), and that commencement might so far facilitate the act (1417. 1420.) as to make the complete discharge, as spark, pass through the particle, though it might not be the shortest course from ball to ball. So also, with equal balls at equal distances, as in the experiments of comparison already described (1493. 1506.), a particle being between one pair of balls would cause discharge there in preference; or even if a particle were between each, difference of size or shape would give one for the time a predominance over the other.|$|E
6000|$|... 1463. In all the gases, the {{different}} forms of disruptive discharge may be linked together and gradually traced from one extreme to the other, i.e. from the spark to the glow (1405. 1526.), or, it may be, to a still further condition to be called dark discharge (1544-1560.); but it is, nevertheless, very surprising {{to see what a}} specific character each keeps whilst under the predominance of the general law. Thus, in muriatic acid, the brush is very difficult to obtain, and there comes in its place almost a dark discharge, partaking of the readiness of the spark action. Moreover, in muriatic acid, I have never observed the spark with any dark interval in it. In nitrogen, the spark readily changes its character into that of brush. In carbonic acid gas, {{there seems to be a}} facility to occasion <b>spark</b> <b>discharge,</b> whilst yet that gas is unlike nitrogen in the facility of the latter to form brushes, and unlike muriatic acid in its own facility to continue the spark. These differences add further force, first to the observations already made respecting the spark in various gases (1422. 1423.), and then, to the proofs deducible from it, of the relation of the electrical forces to the particles of matter.|$|E
6000|$|... 1529. Rarefaction {{of the air}} wonderfully favours {{the glow}} phenomena. A brass ball, {{two and a half}} inches in diameter, being made {{positively}} inductric in an air-pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter, when the pressure was reduced to 4.4 inches of mercury. By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with this light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inches in diameter, and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the phenomena, at high degrees of rarefaction, were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over the positive ball, and gradually increased in brightness, until it was at last very luminous; and it also stood up like a low flame, half an inch or more in height. On touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame was affected, assumed a ring form, like a crown {{on the top of the}} ball, appeared flexible, and revolved with a comparatively slow motion, i.e. about four or five times in a second. This ring-shape and revolution are beautifully connected with the mechanical currents (1576.) taking place within the receiver. These glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted in beauty by a <b>spark</b> <b>discharge</b> at the conductor (1551. Note.).|$|E

Sometimes a brush may be formed of only {{six or seven}} branches, these being broad and highly luminous, of a purple colour, and in some parts an inch or more apart: by a <b>spark</b> <b>discharge</b> at the prime conductor (1455.) single brushes may be obtained at pleasure. Discharge {{in the form of}} a brush is favoured by rarefaction of the air, in the same manner and for the same reason as discharge {{in the form of a}} spark (1375.); but in every case there is previous induction and charge through the dielectric, and polarity of its particles (1437.), the induction being, as in any other instance, alternately raised by the machine and lowered by the discharge. In certain experiments the rarefaction was increased to the utmost degree, and the opposed conducting surfaces brought as near together as possible without producing glow (1529.): the brushes then contracted in their lateral dimensions, and recurred so rapidly as to form an apparently continuous arc of light from metal to metal. Still the discharge could be observed to intermit (1427.), so that even under these high conditions, induction preceded each single brush, and the tense polarized condition of the contiguous particles was a necessary preparation for the discharge itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of microsecond and sub-microsecond electric impulses of sufficient magnitude to water triggers {{a wide range}} of pre-breakdown processes which may include the formation of ionisation waves and gas-filled cavities. These processes can lead to the development of an intensive plasma-filled channel, which expands due to Joule heating of the hot ionised gases inside the channel and drives a sound wave into the surrounding water. Plasma <b>spark</b> <b>discharges</b> can be used as acoustic underwater sources for industrial applications, including material and mineral processing, waste treatment and sonar systems. From a different perspective, acoustic emissions from <b>spark</b> <b>discharges</b> in water-filled plasma closing switches employed in pulsed power systems can be considered as an energy loss mechanism. Therefore, further investigation of the mechanisms of electrical breakdown in water will help to optimise existing technologies and may result in the development of new practical applications of plasmas in water.
