40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the effects}} <b>of</b> government <b>expenditures</b> on German business cycle fluctuations {{by means of}} an estimated DSGE model based on low frequency oscillations. The results highlight that fiscal policy has a strong impact on the amplitude of fluctuations while hardly any on the duration of business cycles. To the extent that fiscal policy shocks are an important source for triggering economy-wide fluctuations, fiscal policy also strongly reacts to shocks originating elsewhere. Thus standard <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> government <b>expenditures</b> in terms <b>of</b> simple AR(1) processes ignore the fact that there can indeed be a strong dependence of governmental variables on economic fluctuations.

30|$|The MyGTAP model {{removes the}} single {{regional}} household {{of the standard}} GTAP model. It introduces a separate government and multiple private households. The government household has separate income and expenditure accounts. There are two sources of the income of the government, i.e., taxes and foreign aid. It exhausts its income into expenditure on goods and services, {{and the rest is}} saved—also called government savings. The model identifies various sources of private households’ income. These include factors’ earnings, foreign remittances and capital income. Private household spends income on goods and services according to either constant difference expenditure (CDE) specification or linear <b>expenditure</b> system (LES) <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>expenditure</b> function. According to Walmsley and Minor (2013), MyGTAP model has several distinctions over the GTAP model. These include allowing (a): more flexibility in the treatment of government savings and expenditure, (b): the inter-regional transfers, i.e., remittances and capital income, and (c): tailor made tool to study the impact of a policy shock on different types of households and factors {{within the framework of the}} global CGE model.|$|R

30|$|The {{share of}} zero {{consumption}} {{is a point}} of particular interest. Zero consumption means that the left side of equation (4) (budget share) is left censored at zero in the case of demand systems. Besides a short collection period, which may play a special role in the context of beverages, there are other determinants for zero consumption like income restrictions that force households into a corner solution or forgoing preferences for certain products (see e.g., Perali and Chavas [2000]; Thiele [2008]). On the aggregated level (stage 1), zero consumption is low, but at the stage 2 level, a large proportion of households did not consume at all during the collection period. This has serious implications for the model <b>specification.</b> Censoring <b>of</b> the <b>expenditure</b> data should therefore be considered, in particular at stage 2, to avoid biased parameter estimates.|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> {{an indirect}} utility function in terms Oaf expenditure and two unit cost functions is proposed. <b>Specification</b> <b>of</b> these unit cost functions {{in terms of}} regular functions leads {{to the notion of}} an 'effectively globally regular' system of demand equations; that is, a system of demand equations that is regular over a cone in expenditure-price space, and for which the regular region includes all points in any given sample, and all values <b>of</b> nominal <b>expenditure</b> and prices generating higher values <b>of</b> real <b>expenditure</b> than the sample minimum.

Partial compensation is favored and biparental care is stable when future fitness is a concave-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is more costly than the previous).
