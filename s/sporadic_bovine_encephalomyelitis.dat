40|$|The {{infectious}} agent of <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> {{has now been}} propagated {{for nearly three years}} in developing chick embryos. This has afforded a convenient method of propagation while studying the causal agent. It is interesting that during all of this time in chick embryos, which represents more than 135 passages in series, there has been no apparent variation in the character of the {{infectious agent}}. It is as pathogenic for guinea pigs and cattle as when first isolated. Failure to recognize anything in the tissues of affected animals that would indicate the exact nature of the entity which causes the disease, led to an extension of the histological study to infected chick embryos, especially their membranes and yolk sacs...|$|E
40|$|DNAs {{from eight}} Chlamydia psittaci {{isolates}} (koala conjunctivitis, avian psittacosis, avian ornithosis, ovine abortion, ovine polyarthritis, <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> and feline conjunctivitis) and one Chlamydia trachomatis isolate (lymphogranuloma venereum) were compared by restriction endonuclease and DNA probe analyses. Digestion with HindIII yielded {{a series of}} discrete fragments which allowed the differentiation of most isolates. A gene probe, pFEN 207, which encodes the chlamydia-specific component of the lipopolysaccharide group antigen was used in Southern hybridizations. The probe was chlamydia specific and hybridized to a single BamHI fragment and multiple HindIII fragments in each isolate. The variation in size of the hybridizing fragments allowed easy differentiation of the isolates and may eventually lead to a meaningful subgrouping of the diverse group of disease agents presently included in the species C. psittaci...|$|E
40|$|A chlamydial plasmid, 6. 2 kb in size, was {{isolated}} from an avian strain of Chlamydia psittaci and cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC 13. A restriction enzyme cleavage {{map of the}} resultant clone, pAPp, was {{very similar to the}} published map of the plasmid cloned from the C. psittaci meningopneumonitis strain Cal- 10. Southern hybridisation analyses using pAPp as a probe, revealed the presence of plasmids with homologous DNA sequences in avian psittacosis, avian ornithosis, ovine polyarthritis and <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> strains of C. psittaci, as well as the LGV strain of Chlamydia trachomatis. Plasmid was not detected in koala conjunctivitis, ovine abortion or feline conjunctivitis isolates. The plasmid-containing isolates could be grouped according to size (6. 2 or 7. 2 - 7. 3 kb) and restriction endonuclease pattern. These three plasmid categories correlate with previously reported C. psittaci biotypes, immunotypes and serotypes. The absence of plasmid from three infectious, pathogenic strains of C. psittaci suggests that, in this species at least, plasmid-encoded genes are not essential for survival, infectivity or virulence of the parasite...|$|E

40|$|Infections {{with the}} {{intracellular}} bacterium Chlamydophila (C.) pecorum are highly prevalent worldwide in cattle. These infections cause significant {{diseases such as}} polyarthritis, pneumonia, enteritis, genital infections and fertility disorders, and occasionally <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis.</b> Subclinical respiratory infections of calves with C. pecorum {{have been associated with}} airway obstruction, pulmonary inflammation, and reduced weight gains. This investigation examined four chlamydial strains with biological properties of C. pecorum isolated from feces of clinically normal cattle, from calves with pneumonia, and from bulls with posthitis. The objective was to characterize the evolutionary relationships of these bovine chlamydial isolates to other chlamydiae by genetic analysis of the ompA gene, and by the immunological cross-reactivities in Western immunoblot analysis. PCR typing of the ompA gene identified these isolates as C. pecorum. The OmpA-deduced amino acid dissimilarities between these four strains spanned 10 - 20 %. In phylogenetic analysis, the four isolates clustered with C. pecorum ruminant, porcine, and koala strains of different geographic origins rather than with each other. All four isolates showed different patterns of Western immunoblot reactivity with antiserum against bovine C. pecorum strain LW 63, and, interestingly, no cross-reactivity of the OmpA proteins with the anti-LW 613 OmpA antibodies. These data underscore the polyphyletic population structure of C. pecorum and suggest that the spectrum of C. pecorum OmpA proteins in a host species can occupy the entire evolutionary bandwidth within C. pecorum. The variant immunoblot reactivities support the notion of considerable genomic plasticity of C. pecorum...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular Chlamydia (C.) {{bacteria}} {{cause in}} cattle some acute but rare {{diseases such as}} abortion, <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> kerato-conjunctivitis, pneumonia, enteritis and polyarthritis. More frequent, essentially ubiquitous worldwide, are low-level, asymptomatic chlamydial infections in cattle. We investigated {{the impact of these}} naturally acquired infections in a cohort of 51 female Holstein and Jersey calves from birth to 15 weeks of age. In biweekly sampling, we measured blood/plasma markers of health and infection and analyzed their association with clinical appearance and growth in dependence of chlamydial infection intensity as determined by mucosal chlamydial burden or contemporaneous anti-chlamydial plasma IgM. Chlamydia 23 S rRNA gene PCR and ompA genotyping identified only C. pecorum (strains 1710 S, Maeda, and novel strain Smith 3 v 8) in conjunctival and vaginal swabs. All calves acquired the infection but remained clinically asymptomatic. High chlamydial infection associated with reduction of body weight gains by up to 48 % and increased conjunctival reddening (P, 1024). Simultaneously decreased plasma albumin and increased globulin (P, 1024) suggested liver injury by inflammatory mediators as mechanisms for the growth inhibition. This was confirmed by the reduction of plasma insulin like growth factor- 1 at high chlamydial infection intensity (P, 1024). High anti-C. pecorum IgM associated eight weeks later with 66 % increased growth (P = 0. 027), indicating a potential for immune protection from C. pecorum-mediated growth depression.

40|$|Background: Despite {{its global}} {{recognition}} as a ruminant pathogen, cases of Chlamydia pecorum infection in Australian livestock are not well documented. In this report, C. pecorum specific Multi Locus Sequence Analysis scheme was used to characterise the C. pecorum strains implicated in two cases of <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> confirmed by necropsy, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. This report provides the first molecular evidence {{for the presence of}} mixed infections of C. pecorum strains in Australian cattle. Case presentation Affected animals were two markedly depressed, dehydrated and blind calves, 12 and 16 weeks old. The calves were euthanized and necropsied. In one calf, a severe fibrinous polyserositis was noted with excess joint fluid in all joints whereas in the other, no significant lesions were seen. No gross abnormalities were noted in the brain of either calf. Histopathological lesions seen in both calves included: multifocal, severe, subacute meningoencephalitis with vasculitis, fibrinocellular thrombosis and malacia; diffuse, mild, acute interstitial pneumonia; and diffuse, subacute epicarditis, severe in the calf with gross serositis. Immunohistochemical labelling of chlamydial antigen in brain, spleen and lung from the two affected calves and brain from two archived cases, localised the antigen to the cytoplasm of endothelium, mesothelium and macrophages. C. pecorum specific qPCR, showed dissemination of the pathogen to multiple organs. Phylogenetic comparisons with other C. pecorum bovine strains from Australia, Europe and the USA revealed the presence of two genetically distinct sequence types (ST). The predominant ST detected in the brain, heart, lung and liver of both calves was identical to the C. pecorum ST previously described in cases of SBE. A second ST detected in an ileal tissue sample from one of the calves, clustered with previously typed faecal bovine isolates. Conclusion This report provides the first data to suggest that identical C. pecorum STs may be associated with SBE in geographically separated countries and that these may be distinct from those found in the gastrointestinal tract. This report provides a platform for further investigations into SBE and for understanding the genetic relationships that exist between C. pecorum strains detected in association with other infectious diseases in livestock...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Immunohistochemistry {{and flow}} cytometric {{analysis}} were used with monoclonal antibodies {{to examine the}} phenotype of neoplastic cells from cattle with <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> leukosis (three cases of calf form, two cases of thymic form, and three cases of intermediate form). Three cases of calf form and two cases of intermediate form were positive for B cell lineage in immunohistologic examination and in flow cytometric analysis for B-B 2 +, sIgM+, and major histocompatibility class II+. Two cases of thymic form and one case of intermediate form were CD 2 +, CD 5 +, CD 6 +, and CD 8 + in immunohistologic examination and in flow cyto-metric analysis.

40|$|The {{cause of}} the {{original}} case or cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) remains an enigma. Sheep scrapie or a previously undetected <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) have long been considered as candidates, but no convincing evidence to support these proposals has come to light. We present a new theory, with three related hypotheses: (1) that BSE was acquired from a human TSE (prion disease); (2) that the route of infection was oral, through animal feed containing imported mammalian raw materials contaminated with human remains; and (3) that the origin was the Indian subcontinent, from which large amounts of mammalian material were imported during the relevant time period. Human remains {{are known to be}} incorporated into meal made locally, and may still be entering exported material.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{cohort study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the risk of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) transmission to uninfected cattle by adjacent infected cattle in 6 dairy farms. Animals were initially tested in 2010 – 2011 using a commercial ELISA kit. Uninfected cattle were repeatedly tested every 4 to 6 months until fall of 2012. The Cox proportional hazard model with frailty showed that uninfected cattle neighboring to infected cattle (n= 53) had a significant higher risk of seroconversion than those without any infected neighbors (n= 81) (hazard ratio: 12. 4, P= 0. 001), implying that neighboring infected cattle were a significant risk factor for BLV transmission. This finding provides scientific support for animal health authorities and farmers to segregate infected cattle on farms to prevent spread of BLV.

40|$|Strategies to {{investigate}} the possible existence of <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) require systematic testing programs to identify cases in countries considered to {{have little or no}} risk for orally acquired disease or to detect a stable occurrence of atypical cases in countries in which orally acquired disease is disappearing. To achieve 95 % statistical confidence that the prevalence of sporadic BSE is no greater than 1 per million (i. e., the annual incidence of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] in humans) would require negative tests in 3 million randomly selected older cattle. A link between BSE and sporadic CJD has been suggested on the basis of laboratory studies but is unsupported by epidemiologic observation. Such a link might yet be established by the discovery of a specific molecular marker or of particular combinations of trends over time of typical and atypical BSE and various subtypes of sporadic CJD, as their numbers are influenced by a continuation of current public health measures that exclude high-risk bovine tissues from the animal and human food chains. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first recognized in 1986 in the United Kingdom and quickly reached epidemic proportions, affecting> 30, 000 cattle per year by 1992. Because of continuing exportation of both live cattle and meat and bone meal rendered from the carcasses of slaughtered cattle, the disease spread throughout most of Europe and a few non-European countries. By 2006, 20 years after its first appearance in the United Kingdom, the disease had been reported in an additional 24 countries (1) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Biopsies of {{skin from}} a 2 -year-old heifer with spontaneously regressing dermal {{leukosis}} were examined. The heifer was not infected with bovine leukemia virus and was negative for tumor-associated antigens of enzootic bovine lymphosarcoma. By hematological standards for bovine leukemia, the heifer was positive at about 60 days post-occurrence {{of the disease}} (POD). At 53 days POD, lymphoblastic neoplastic cells in the dermis reacted with anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody by the avidin biotin peroxidase complex method. The cells had intracytoplasmic clustered dense bodies under electron microscopy. From 53 to 83 days POD, figures of the transepithelial elimination (TE) against neoplastic cells and perivascular infiltration of small lymphocytes were in the dermis. Small lymphocytes reacted with anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody. At necropsy there were no neoplastic lesions; there were flat lymph node-like tissues in the subcutis. Many germinal centers were seen in the lymphatic organs. Blood lymphocytes at 46 days POD were stimulated by phytohem-agglutinin-P and concanavalin A. Sera, taken until 75 days POD and at necropsy, showed an inhibitory effect on mitogen-induced blastogenesis of normal bovine lymphocytes. These results suggested {{the existence of a}} spontaneous regressive mechanism against neoplastic lesions by TE and tumor immunity. Bovine skin leukosis (cutaneous lymphosarcoma) is one of the <b>sporadic</b> <b>bovine</b> leukoses which include calf, thymic, and skin types. * Another type, enzootic adult leukosis, is caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). 17 Skin leukosis is usually seen in cattle 1 to 3 years old, and the annual incidence is reported to be one to three per rn i l l i~n. ~ Clinically, the disease begins with a sud-den onset of urticaria-like skin lesions followed by mul-tiple nodular cutaneous lesions which may regress or regress and reappear. 3, 7 J 5 Js. 24, 2...|$|R
40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie in sheep, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and <b>bovine</b> <b>sporadic</b> {{encephalopathy}} in cattle {{are characterized}} by the accumulation of a misfolded protein: the pathological prion protein. Ever since <b>bovine</b> <b>sporadic</b> encephalopathy was discovered as the likely cause of the new variant of CJD in humans, parallels between human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies must be viewed under the aspect of a disease risk for humans. In our study we have compared prion characteristics of different forms of sheep scrapie with those of different phenotypes of sporadic CJD. The disease characteristics of sporadic CJD depend considerably on the prion type 1 or 2. Our results show that there are obvious parallels between sporadic CJD type 1 and the so-called atypical/Nor 98 scrapie. These parelleles apply to the deposition form of pathological prion protein in the brain, detected by the paraffin-embedded-tissue blot and the prion aggregate stability with regard to denaturation by the chaotropic salt guanidine hydrochloride. The same applies to sporadic CJD type 2 and classical scrapie. The observed parallels between types of sporadic CJD and types of sheep scrapie demonstrate that distinct groups of prion disease exist in different species.

Here, we report a study designed to assess feasibility and safety of transplantation of autologous human mesenchymal stem cells expanded in autologous human serum in stroke patients. We report an unblinded study on 12 patients with ischaemic grey matter, white matter and mixed lesions, in contrast to a prior study on autologous mesenchymal stem cells expanded in foetal calf serum that focused on grey matter lesions. Cells cultured in human serum expanded more rapidly than in foetal calf serum, reducing cell preparation time and risk of transmissible disorders such as <b>bovine</b> spongiform <b>encephalomyelitis.</b> Autologous mesenchymal stem cells were delivered intravenously 36 – 133 days post-stroke. All patients had magnetic resonance angiography to identify vascular lesions, and magnetic resonance imaging prior to cell infusion and at intervals up to 1 year after. Magnetic resonance perfusion-imaging and 3 D-tractography were carried out in some patients. Neurological status was scored using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scores. We did not observe any central nervous system tumours, abnormal cell growths or neurological deterioration, and there was no evidence for venous thromboembolism, systemic malignancy or systemic infection in any of the patients following stem cell infusion. The median daily rate of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale change was 0. 36 during the first week post-infusion, compared with a median daily rate of change of 0. 04 from the first day of testing to immediately before infusion. Daily rates of change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores during longer post-infusion intervals that more closely matched the interval between initial scoring and cell infusion also showed an increase following cell infusion. Mean lesion volume as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was reduced by > 20 % at 1 week post-cell infusion. While we would emphasize that the current study was unblinded, did not assess overall function or relative functional importance of different types of deficits, and does not exclude placebo effects or a contribution of recovery {{as a result of the}} natural history of stroke, our observations provide evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of delivery of a relatively large dose of autologous mesenchymal human stem cells, cultured in autologous human serum, into human subjects with stroke and support the need for additional blinded, placebo-controlled studies on autologous mesenchymal human stem cell infusion in stroke...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{reconstruction}} of past pastoral activities based on microscopic methods (pollen and coprophilous fungal ascospores) does not accurately identify the domestic species involved. In contrast, source-specific DNA markers, commonly employed in water quality microbial source tracking (MST) studies, {{may represent a}} promising tool for retrospectively identifying species-specific fecal contamination in sediment deposition. In the present study, molecular methods were used to quantify Bacteroidales and identify ovine and bovine mitochondrial DNA extracted from sediment cores from two forest hollows comprising 2000 [*]years of deposition. The DNA marker abundance was contrasted with the abundance of ascospores and plant-specific pollen throughout the sediment chronosequence. The distribution of DNA markers indicated an agro-pastoral practice transition from pasture/crop production to forested landscape from the second Iron Age/classical Antiquity {{to the end of}} the Roman period/modernity, in correlation with microscopic markers. During the second Iron Age/classical Antiquity, hollows were likely used to water herds, whereas during the late Antiquity, low Bacteroidales abundances and the <b>sporadic</b> detection of <b>bovine</b> and ovine DNA markers confirm the progressive afforestation observed using pollen data. For the end of the Roman period and modern times, reforested areas are characterized by the absence of ovine and bovine DNA markers while low Bacteroidales abundances suggest the presence of wild herbivores.
