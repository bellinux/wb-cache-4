40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} transmission of traction power from the traction vehicle to the train and presents {{an analysis of the}} current state of operation of the <b>slip</b> <b>regulator</b> on the III. generation heavy freight locomotive Škoda factory designation 93 E. It was necessary to use Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to acquire, process and record the data. The introductory part of the thesis is an introduction to the field of the FPGAs and briefly summarizes the history of these integrated circuits. The basic elements of the traction power transmission system are the traction motor, the mechanical system of the traction motor-wheelset and its rotary mass and the wheel-rail contact. From {{the point of view of}} the traction motor and its regulator, an analysis of the influence on damping of the mechanical system oscillations by the traction motor and its excitation was performed. The most extensive part of the thesis deals with the motor-wheelset three-mass mechanical system model and its influence on the locomotive's adhesion properties. The model parameters were obtained by analyzing measured speed data of the traction system and the resulting model is compared with other previously published three-mass locomotive traction system models. The last, but most important, element of the traction power transmission system is the wheel-rail contact. This thesis presents currently widely accepted model of the adhesion characteristics on the wheel-rail contact. This model is based on Kalker's linear creep theory and has been further adapted by various authors to better match empirical data. The "zebra" method is described in detail and is utilized to obtain the wheel speed data needed to perform the analysis, including the "autocorrelation" method of data processing. The data obtained were also used to create a mathematical model of traction power transmission from traction machine to the wheelset. Some of the developed measurement methods are generally usable and can be deployed on both current and new locomotives to increase control accuracy. Multiple problems have been identified that cause the suboptimal operation of the <b>slip</b> <b>regulator</b> of the Škoda 93 E locomotive and solutions that do not require any mechanical intervention to the design of the current locomotive has been proposed. Some problems that have been identified by studying the model can be generalized to other types of locomotives. Katedra elektrických pohonů a trakc...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{feedback}} {{in the design}} of aircraft stability and control is becoming increasingly important. The basic reason driving this trend is the necessity to cope with a growing number of more stringent requirements, which are sometimes conflicting. This work presents a design methodology applicable to flight control laws, which can be either a control and stability augmentation system (CSAS) or an automatic flight control system (AFCS). A key feature of the proposed method is the definition of a simple cost function, which incorporates both performance and robustness requirements. The optimization of this cost function is employed to tune some of the control law parameters. It is also presented how to integrate this optimization procedure with the other important design steps, such as requirements definition, data filtering, control law structure definition, shaping the input-output transmission via pre-filters, etc. It is emphasized, at this point, that the format of this cost function is able to encapsulate, in a straightforward manner, the requirements normally applicable to the feedback portion of flight control laws. It is also flexible enough to accommodate different choices of data preprocessing, as well as different choices {{of feedback}} structure. The final design step is the setting of appropriate scheduling function for each of the defined scheduled parameters. For illustration purposes, four design examples are presented, namely a yaw damper, a bank angle rate/side <b>slip</b> angle <b>regulator,</b> a pitch attitude rate regulator and a pressure altitude regulator. The aircraft model under consideration is based on available data from Boeing 747. Sensors and actuators dynamics, as well as transport delays due to digital control implementation, are considered. The results show that the proposed methodology is able to satisfactorily fulfill the design requirements normally applicable to flight control laws...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of fuzzy-based control strategies has recently gained enormous recognition as an approach for the rapid development of effective controllers for nonlinear time-variant systems. This paper describes the preliminary research {{and implementation of}} a fuzzy logic based controller to control the wheel slip for electric vehicle antilock braking systems (ABSs). As {{the dynamics of the}} braking systems are highly nonlinear and time variant, fuzzy control offers potential as an important tool for development of robust traction control. Simulation studies are employed to derive an initial rule base that is then tested on an experimental test facility representing the dynamics of a braking system. The test facility is composed of an induction machine load operating in the generating region. It is shown that the torque-slip characteristics of an induction motor provides a convenient platform for simulating a variety of tire/road - driving conditions, negating the initial requirement for skid-pan trials when developing algorithms. The fuzzy membership functions were subsequently refined by analysis of the data acquired from the test facility while simulating operation at a high coefficient of friction. The robustness of the fuzzy-logic <b>slip</b> <b>regulator</b> is further tested by applying the resulting controller over a wide range of operating conditions. The results indicate that ABS/traction control may substantially improve longitudinal performance and offer significant potential for optimal control of driven wheels, especially under icy conditions where classical ABS/traction control schemes are constrained to operate very conservatively...|$|E
40|$|Heavy goods {{vehicles}} exhibit poor {{braking performance}} in emergency situations {{when compared to}} other vehicles. Part of the problem is caused by sluggish pneumatic brake actuators, which limit the control bandwidth of their antilock braking systems. In addition, heuristic control algorithms are used that do not achieve the maximum braking force throughout the stop. In this article, a novel braking system is introduced for pneumatically braked heavy goods vehicles. The conventional brake actuators are improved by placing high-bandwidth, binary-actuated valves directly on the brake chambers. A made-for-purpose valve is described. It achieves a switching delay of 3 – 4 [*]ms in tests, which is an order of magnitude faster than solenoids in conventional anti-lock braking systems. The heuristic braking control algorithms are replaced with a wheel <b>slip</b> <b>regulator</b> based on sliding mode control. The combined actuator and slip controller are shown to reduce stopping distances on smooth and rough, high friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 9) surfaces by 10 % and 27 % respectively in hardware-in-the-loop tests compared with conventional ABS. On smooth and rough, low friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 2) surfaces, stopping distances are reduced by 23 % and 25 %, respectively. Moreover, the overall air reservoir size required on a heavy goods vehicle is governed by its air usage during an anti-lock braking stop on a low friction, smooth surface. The 37 % reduction in air usage observed in hardware-in-the-loop tests on this surface therefore represents the potential reduction in reservoir size that could be achieved by the new system...|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{and traffic}} safety {{is a major}} concern in the society today. Many {{accidents}} take place because the vehicle is not following the trajectory that the driver desires. To avoid such accidents, an increasing number of active safety systems are introduced in modern vehicles. Still, most of the time, those systems are designed independently, which can lead to non-optimal performances and unexpected interactions. To properly consider the coupling between the different actuators like the brakes and steering, coupling coming for example from the nonlinear tyre dynamics, a Global Chassis Control strategy is necessary. This thesis defines a new 2 -level framework for Global Chassis Control. At the chassis level, the distribution of the total control action to all the actuators is formulated as a constrained convex optimization problem, independent from uncertain parameters. As the driver is constantly changing his inputs to the vehicle, the solution of the optimization should be constantly updated. For that purpose, a new continuous optimization method, the Hybrid Descent Method, has been developed. This method defines a dynamical system such that its trajectory converges, first to a solution allowed by the constraints, and then to the optimum of the related optimization problem. In order to introduce the right number of degrees of freedom in the optimization, the actuators are grouped into building blocks depending on their coupling with the different tyre forces. Tyre constraints are handled in a realistic way, without the common assumption that the whole tyre characteristic in known long in advance. At the wheel level, the control of the tyre forces is made simple and robust to uncertainties in the road conditions thanks to the use of tyre force measurement. Such tyre forces measurement is at the moment too expensive to be implemented. In current production vehicles, only sensors measuring motion are available, like accelerometers or gyroscopes. At the moment, SKF is developing a technology enabling the measurement of the load in their bearings. This technology allows the introduction of cheap force sensors in all vehicles, which will allow the implementation of new control algorithms like those presented in this thesis. A particularly critical problem in vehicle dynamics control is to get the largest possible braking force out of the tyres while maintaining vehicle stability. This thesis contributes to the development and experimental validation of Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). As a result of a collaboration with CNRS/Supelec, Paris, France, a theoretical hybrid ABS based on wheel deceleration has been improved to handle actuation delay; and a new wheel <b>slip</b> <b>regulator</b> based on a cascaded approach has been implemented. Furthermore, new algorithms using force measurement are shown to be simpler to tune, better performing and more robust to road conditions than acceleration-based alternatives. The first ABS algorithm directly considering the loss of potential to generate lateral tyre forces because of braking is an achievement of this thesis. All algorithms for straight-line braking have been validated on the tyre-in-the-loop experimental facility, which was made suitable for ABS testing during this research.
