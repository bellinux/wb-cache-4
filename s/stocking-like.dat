40|$|Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are {{inherited}} through autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked patterns, {{and may be}} seen sporadically (1 - 4). Cerebellar {{findings are}} the main clinical characteristics of SCA. Pyramidal findings, polyneuropathy and involvement of dorsal columns and other neuroanatomic structures may also be seen (1 - 4). Case A 19 -year-old male was admitted to our department with a 3 -year history of gait disturbances. He was one of 4 children from a nonconsanguineous marriage. He stated that his cousin had been followed {{up with the same}} diagnosis by our clinic (Figure 1). Physical examination revealed pes planus and left-curved scoliosis (Figures 2, 3). Neurological examination showed titubation in the head, and nystagmus with rapid phase {{in the direction of the}} gaze. Fundoscopic examinations were normal. In addition, there were dysarthric speech, bilateral dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesis in the upper and lower limbs, an ataxic gait (he could walk only with support), moderately and severely reduced vibration sense in the upper and lower limbs, respectively, and loss of position sense in the lower extremities. The romberg sign was positive. <b>Stocking-like</b> hypoesthesic was detected. Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were absent in all extremities. The Babinski sign was bilaterally indifferent. Motor power in all extremities was normal. In laboratory examinations, complete blood count, blood biochemistry, oral glucose tolerance, hormonal screening, lactic and pyruvic acid, vitamin B 12 and folic acid levels were normal. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were not significant. Abdominal an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Introduction: Complex {{regional}} pain syndromes (CRPS) are disabling pain syndromes {{that can}} develop after minor tissue injury or trauma and {{are characterized by}} sensory, motor, and autonomic abnormalities distributed in a glove-like or <b>stocking-like</b> manner. Complex regional pain syndrome {{is well known in}} adults, but is relatively rare in children. Most of the reported cases of CRPS in children are clinical diagnoses that are not supported by examinations such as three-phase bone scintigraphy. Furthermore, different centres often use different diagnostic criteria for CRPS, which sometimes questions the diagnosis of CRPS. Objective/Methods: Although, recurrences and in particular relapses of CRPS have been observed, a periodically, nearly self-limiting course of disease without any residues in pain-free episodes and without any new obvious injury in CRPS is rather unusual. We present the case of a 16 -year-old girl who reported recurrent spontaneous pain which lasted for 2 to 3 weeks and occurred approximately 2 times a year after the patient had experienced a mild trauma 3 years ago. Results: The pain was accompanied by swelling, temperature asymmetry, and decreased range of motion of the right hand without any complains in pain-free episodes. Recurrent symptoms occurred without any obvious trauma. Diagnosis of CRPS was made from clinical findings including quantitative sensory testing, increased periarticular radioisotope uptake in the delayed phase of three-phase bone scintigraphy and examination during anaesthesia. Multimodal inpatient pain treatment resolved her symptoms substantially. Conclusion: Complex regional pain syndrome in children may imitate rheumatologic diseases, and the course is different from adults despite similar clinical findings...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{acceleration}} {{can cause}} petechial hemorrhages, called G measles. Petechiae usually start to develop between 5 and 9 G {{with a high}} interindividual variance. Centrifuge training delays the onset to higher G levels. One might expect onset at lower G levels after bed rest; however, {{there is no evidence}} in the literature. A case of petechiae formation after bed rest is presented here. Case report: Orthostatic tolerance was tested using a tilt table and lower body negative pressure before and after bed rest in both campaigns of a 2 3 21 -d bed rest study with 6 Â° head-down tilt. A 42 -yr-old male Caucasian without any history of thrombosis, venous disease, hemorrhage, or petechiae, and with a negative thrombophilia screening, took part in the bed rest study as 1 out of 10 subjects. He was the only one to develop petechiae during the orthostatic tests after, but not before, bed rest in both campaigns. Petechiae were distributed throughout the lower legs and most pronounced at the shin in a <b>stocking-like</b> fashion, surprisingly reoccurring in an identical pattern of distribution. Petechiae appeared slowly over minutes during hyperemia. Discussion: This case indicates that prolonged bed rest decreases the threshold for petechiae formation. A reproducible distribution pattern suggests that factors predisposing to petechiae formation keep their local distribution over time (possibly due to local vessel structures). Mechanisms of adaptation and interindividual variance are unclear. Findings are of clinical relevance as such cases might occur after prolonged bed rest in patients without need of expensive testing...|$|E
