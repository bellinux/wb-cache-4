The most apparent is {{the damage caused}} by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that [...] "naïve" [...] divers who are participating in underwater photography are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef. As the cost of underwater photography equipment has reduced and the availability increased it is inevitable that there will be an increase of direct damage to reefs by divers. Other direct impact include over-fishing for [...] "marine curios," [...] sedimentation and in-fill. There is also direct environmental impact due to disturbed and altered species behaviour from fish feeding, as well as import of invasive species and pollution caused by dive-boats.

40|$|Lake {{management}} is extremely complex and requires a coordinated effort of research institutions, community groups, individuals, landowners, and government. Lakes constitute an important group {{of natural resources}} due to their ecosystem services and often unique cultural environments. Climate change is a growing concern, which particularly strongly affects shallow lakes. The adverse impact of climate change is enhanced by extreme water level fluctuations and human factors such as environmental pollution from waste water discharge, large scale agriculture and <b>shoreline</b> <b>constructions</b> reducing or eliminating valuable wetlands. Since eutrophication is {{a leading cause of}} impairment of freshwater ecosystems, specific strategies to address a lake's nutrient enrichment must focus on activities in the watershed and, if needed, in-lake restoration techniques. Analyzing the key factors of sustainable local and regional development in the vicinity of lakes, assessing the environmental risks of pollution, large scale agriculture, waste management and energy production, we propose a complex, stakeholder based management system and holistic regional development in lake areas, which will preserve natural ecosystems without compromising the sustainable use of ecosystem services. There are available technologies to develop ecologically acceptable water level regulations, promote organic agriculture applying grey water irrigation, stop leachate from landfills and control invasive species. Regional and local production and use of renewable energy is essential both for environmental and economical sustainability. Renewable energy production should be well coordinated with agriculture, forestry, waste management and management of water resources of lakes and their watershed areas in a sustainable, holistic way through a participatory approach. This is particularly pronounced in connection with tourism as one of the main uses of lake-ecosystem services, but also an environmental risk for natural ecosystems when mass tourism and short-sighted profit are the driving forces...|$|R

40|$|Submerged aquatic {{vegetation}} (SAV) provides {{many important}} ecosystem functions, but SAV has been significantly reduced in many estuaries. We used spatial-statistical models to identify estuarine shoreline characteristics that explain variations in SAV abundance among subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and mid-Atlantic Coastal Bays. We summarized digital spatial data on <b>shoreline</b> <b>construction,</b> shoreline land use, physical characteristics, watershed land cover, and salinity for each subestuary. We related SAV abundance to shoreline characteristics and other stressors using univariate regression and multivariate models. The strongest univariate predictors of SAV abundance were percent shoreline forest, percent shoreline marsh, {{the percentage of}} shoreline that is 5 - 10 m tall, percent riprap, the percentage of subestuary area 5. 4 % riprap. SAV abundance has increased steadily since 1984 in subestuaries with 5. 4 % riprap. Some shoreline characteristics interact with larger-scale factors like land cover and salinity zone to affect the distribution of SAV, while the effects of other shoreline characteristics are consistent among subestuaries with different salinities or local watershed land covers. Many shoreline characteristics can be controlled by management decisions, and our results help identify factors that managers should consider in efforts to increase SAV abundance...|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} coastal and Great Lakes {{states have some}} type of <b>shoreline</b> <b>{{construction}}</b> setback or construction control line requiring development to be a certain distance from the shoreline or other coastal feature (OCRM, 2008). Nineteen of 30 coastal states currently use erosion rates for new construction close to the shoreline. Seven states established setback distances based on expected years from the shoreline: the remainder specify a fixed setback distance (Heinz Report, 2000). Following public hearings by the County of Kauai Planning Commission and Kauai County Council, the ‘Shoreline Setback and Coastal Protection Ordinance’ was signed by the Mayor of Kauai on January 25, 2008. After a year of experience implementing this progressive, balanced shoreline setback ordinance several amendments were recently incorporated into the Ordinance (# 887; Bill # 2319 Draft 3). The Kauai Planning Department is presently drafting several more amendments to improve the effectiveness of the Ordinance. The intent of shoreline setbacks is to establish a buffer zone to protect shorefront development from loss due to coastal erosion - for a period of time; to provide protection from storm waves; to allow the natural dynamic cycles of erosion and accretion of beaches and dunes to occur; to maintain beach and dune habitat; and, to maintain lateral beach access and open space for the enjoyment of the natural shoreline environment. In addition, a primary goal of the Kauai setback ordinance is to avoid armoring or hardening of the shore which along eroding coasts has been documented to ultimately eliminate the fronting beach.

40|$|Reconstruction of palaeo-sea levels {{provides}} a framework for determining Quaternary ice volumes and assisting in modelling predictions of future sea-level change. Commonly, records of palaeo-sea level derived from past shorelines only extend back to the last interglacial, marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 e, due to erosion of older coastal successions by successive sealevel changes on tectonically stable coastlines. On the Mount Gambier coastal plain, southern Australia, palaeo-shorelines of the Bridgewater Formation, a succession of aeolianite barriers, are preserved by the gentle uplift {{of the region and}} the strongly indurated calcrete horizons which blanket the regional landscape, and provide a sea-level archive extending back to at least MIS 17 (680 - 710 ka). The southern continental margin of Australia is within the far-field of former Quaternary ice sheets. Palaeo-sea level records from this region are significant as {{they are more likely to}} reflect ice-equivalent sea level with minor but spatially variable hydroisostatic signals for different coastal sectors. This thesis {{provides a}} geochronological framework for the deposition of interglacial barrier shorelines on the Mount Gambier coastal plain using amino acid racemisation (AAR), radiocarbon, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Depositional environments of barrier successions were reconstructed through stratigraphical analysis and assessments of facies architecture. Fixed and relational palaeo-sea level indicators were identified in the form of back barrier lagoonal and beach facies. Petrological analysis of bioclastic sediments identified that the carbonate content of the barriers ranges from 66 % to 99 %. The percentage of quartz increases in inland barriers reflecting greater dissolution of carbonates in older successions. Thin section analysis identified an increase in sparite cements within the calcarenite with age, while XRD analysis highlighted a decrease in proportions of aragonite and an increase of low-Mg calcite. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of foraminifera indicated that test surface textures reflect transportation and diagenetic environments. Findings reveal a correlation between diagenesis and proposed age of the barriers and aid in constraining the evolution of the coastal plain. This thesis reveals that the barrier shoreline complexes were formed during successive interglacial sea-level highstands and correlate with the shoreline barriers on the Robe coastal plain, 100 km northwest of the study area. Several barriers are found to be composite features, with facies deposited during separate interglacials. For example, Compton Range, 23 km landward of the present coastline, has a core of MIS 13 subaqueous sediment and overlying MIS 11 aeolian sands. Stacked aeolianites within Robe Range, at the present coastline, were deposited during successive interstadial highstands (MIS 5 c, MIS 5 a) of the last interglacial. Geochronological analysis also identified several episodes of reworking of older sediments into younger successions during sea-level regression and subsequent transgressional cycles further highlighting the complexity of coastal evolutionary processes within the region. Using a predefined uplift rate for this region, the combination of stratigraphical, petrographical and geochronological analyses allowed for the construction of a palaeo-sea level record of interglacial highstands over the past 680 ka. This thesis identifies the first recorded example of subaqueously deposited late Pleistocene interstadial coastal strata above present sea level in Australia, represented by a flint conglomerate beach facies with interstratified shells. This deposit is constrained to MIS 5 c in age and an uplift-corrected minimum palaeo-sea level of - 14 ± 2 m is derived. OSL analysis confirms that MacDonnell Range, located 7 km from the present coastline, is MIS 5 e (124 ± 10 ka) in age and a correlative of the Woakwine Range which formed during the sea-level highstand of the last interglacial maximum. Palaeo-sea level is also derived for MIS 7 and MIS 9 as 1. 5 m and - 3. 5 m respectively, while minimum sea-level is derived from barrier shorelines deposited during MIS 11, MIS 13 and MIS 17. The sediment volume of individual barriers, predicted using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, corresponds with proposed interglacial intensity. The largest barriers on the coastal plain were formed during the more intense interglacials of MIS 5 e and MIS 11 whereby warmer temperatures are proposed to have resulted in increased carbonate productivity on the Bonney Shelf, increasing the volume of available sediment for onshore transportation and barrier <b>shoreline</b> <b>construction.</b> AAR analyses revealed that individual foraminiferal tests provide a more accurate indicator of barrier age than AAR whole-rock analyses which are based on the averaging the D/L value of several thousand bioclastic carbonate grains. Analyses of single foraminifer tests allows for the identification and immediate rejection of contaminated, reworked or significantly diagenetically altered grains and provides numeric ages of greater accuracy and precision. The results of this thesis are generally consistent with palaeo-sea level estimates from other tectonically uplifted coastal successions from the far-field of Quaternary ice sheets and oxygen isotope records. The palaeo-sea level record and coastal evolutionary processes derived from this research will provide an important dataset for modelling Quaternary ice volumes and interglacial climate dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Laterally extensive, {{well-developed}} clinoforms {{have been}} mapped in Early Cretaceous deposits {{located in the}} northeastern 27, 000 km 2 of the Colville Basin, North Slope of Alaska. Using public domain 2 -D seismic data, well logs, core photographs, and grain size data, depositional geometries within the Nanushuk and Torok formations were interpreted in order to constrain the transport conditions associated with progradation of the <b>shoreline</b> and <b>construction</b> of the continental margin out of detritus shed from the ancestral Brooks Range. Using STRATA, a synthetic stratigraphic modeling package, constructional clinoform geometries similar to those preserved in the North Slope clinoform volume (32, 400 km 3) were simulated. Sediment flux, marine and nonmarine diffusivities, and basin subsidence were systematically varied until a match was found for the foreset and topset slopes, as well as progradation rates over a 6 million year period. The ability of STRATA to match the seismically interpreted geometries allows us to constrain measures of possible water and sediment discharges consistent with the observed development of the Early Cretaceous clinoform suite. Simulations indicate that, in order to reproduce observed geometries and trends using constant input parameters, the subsidence rate must be very small, {{only a fraction of}} the most likely rate calculated from the seismic data. Constant sediment transport parameters can successfully describe the evolution of the prograding margin only in the absence of tectonic subsidence. However, further work is needed to constrain the absolute magnitude of these values and determine a unique solution for the NPR-A clinoforms. by Christina Marie Kaba. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Marine {{life in the}} Mediterranean Sea is {{threatened}} by intensive human activities such as fisheries, ship traffic, pollution and coastal development. Cetaceans and other vertebrates are affected not only by chemical pollution, but also by noise pollution (Richardson et al., 1995; Simmonds et al., 2004). Noise has become a ubiquitous form of marine pollution, especially in areas of heavy maritime traffic and along developed coasts. Intense underwater noise is generated by airguns, widely used for geophysical exploration in {{the oil and gas}} industry as well as for academic and government research purposes; by high power sonar, either military or civilian; by ship traffic; by <b>shoreline</b> and offshore <b>construction</b> works; and by a number of other commercial, scientific, military and industrial sources. The most powerful noises (from airguns, sonars, and explosions) may directly injure animals in the vicinity of the source. General ship traffic, heavy industries on the coast and a variety of other human activities generally do not generate such intense noise, but the acoustic pollution they produce is constant over time and may affect large areas. It may be a serious hazard not only to individual animals, but also to entire populations. Such increased background noise affects underwater life just as airborne noise affects terrestrial animals, including human beings. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Coastal erosion that is {{generated}} by {{the reduction of the}} annual sediment yield at river outlets, due to the construction of dams, constitutes one of the main environmental problems {{in many parts of the}} world. Nestos is one of the most important transboundary rivers, flowing through Bulgaria and Greece, characterized by its great biodiversity. In the Greek part of the river, two dams, the Thisavros dam and the Platanovrysi dam, have already been constructed and started operating in 1997 and 1999, respectively. The present paper investigates the reservoir sedimentation effect on the coastal erosion for the case of the Nestos River delta and the adjacent shorelines, through a combination of mathematical modeling, modern remote sensing techniques and field surveying. It is found that the construction and operation of the considered dams have caused a dramatic decrease (about 83 %) in the sediments supplied directly to the basin outlet and indirectly to the neighbouring coast and that this fact has almost inversed the erosion/accretion balance in the deltaic area as well as the adjacent <b>shorelines.</b> Before the <b>construction</b> of the dams, accretion predominated erosion by 25. 36 %, while just within five years after the construction of the dams erosion predominates accretion by 21. 26 %...|$|R

In this paper I compare the wave energy density {{in the western}} and eastern ends of the Strait of Juan de Fuca with the wave energy density at the Elwha River delta. This indicates seasonal high- and low-energy regimes in the energy density data. I group multi-year surveys of four cross-shore transects in FWB along this seasonal divide and search for seasonal trends in profile on the foreshore. After documenting changes in elevation at specific datums on the foreshore, I compare digital images of one datum to determine the particle sizes that are transported during deposition and scour events on {{this section of the}} FWB foreshore. Repeat surveys of four cross-shore transects over a five-year period indicate a highly mobile slope break between the upper foreshore and the low-tide delta. Post- 2011, profiles in eastern FWB record deposition in the landward portion of the low-tide terrace and also in the upper intertidal. Western FWB experiences transient deposition on the low-tide terrace and high intra-annual variability in beach profile. Profile elevation at the slope break in western FWB can vary 0. 5 m in the course of weeks. Changes in surface sediment that range from sand to cobble are co-incident with these changes in elevation. High sediment mobility and profile variation are inconsistent with shoreline stability and decreased sediment from the presumed source on the Elwha River delta...|$|R

40|$|According {{to specialists}} over fifteen million people {{each year are}} forced to leave their former place of {{residence}} {{as a result of}} major development projects (M. M. Cernea and H. Mathur, 2008; M. M. Cernea 2009). It is estimated that major development projects such as dams, roads and exploitation of raw materials led to the involuntary relocation of over 200 million people between 1988 and 2008. Alongside natural disasters, economic development {{is one of the greatest}} causes of contemporary internal displacement worldwide. The irreversible nature of many displacements caused by development can be compared only with the displacements in consequence of climate change and natural disasters or industrial accidents affecting large territories (such as the Asian tsunami of 2004 or the Chernobyl disaster in 1986). Just as in many cases of desertification, land degradation or <b>shoreline</b> erosion, the <b>construction</b> of large dams or creation of open-pit mines can make it impossible to resettle in the territory. The irreversibility of such displacements is one of the most important factors in their huge economic, social and cultural consequences. Especially dangerous is the displacement to far distant places due to irreversible interference with the natural environment. The result of the creation of large dams, expansion of mining, or oil exploitation does not have to be direct large-scale displacement. The negative environmental impact caused by development may lead to a substantial incidence of “secondary” forced migration of rural populations to cities or other territories. Developmentinduced displacement is primarily an socioeconomic issue associated with loss or significant reduction of access to basic resources on which communities depend. The most serious social consequences have accompanied displacement to territories which are completely different from those previously inhabited. Resettlement plans implemented in China and India should consider the displacement of the population of particular nearby economic territories into others similar to those previously abandoned. Displacement – understood as dislocation from the homeland territory without social support in the new place of residence – is a violation of the most fundamental human rights and should be entirely prohibited. Resettlement can be defined as a planned and organized relocation to a strictly specified new place of residence, accompanied by social support mechanisms and compensation for lost goods.
