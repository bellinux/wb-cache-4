50|$|<b>Scarlet</b> <b>GN,</b> or C.I. Food Red 1, Ponceau SX, FD&C Red No. 4, or C.I. 14700 {{is a red}} azo dye {{once used}} as a food dye. As a food additive, it has the E number E125. It usually used as a {{disodium}} salt.|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of food colorants, {{containing}} new coccine, ponceaue 6 R and <b>scarlet</b> <b>GN</b> were simultaneously {{analyzed by}} spectrophotometry without previous chemical separation. Sixty mixtures of colorants with three-components were evaluated and the spectrograms were smoothed {{through the use}} of seven experimental points. The multivariate data consisted of normal, first- and second-derivative absorbance spectra (&# 8710;&# 955;= 5 nm) registered from 300 - 650 nm. The data obtained from experiments were processed by PLS method and the proposed method was applied satisfactorily for determination of these colorants in two commercial food products...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the types and doses of coloring additives used {{in the making of}} jajan Sirat which was sold at Pasar Umum Negara, Jembrana, Bali. Before taking samples, surveys and interviews were conducted to the traders and consumers regarding their understanding on coloring additives. The samples were taken from some traders at Negara public market, District of Negara, Jembrana, Bali. Then, the samples were prepared by using woolen thread absorption technique. Qualitative analytical procedure were conducted using chromatographic paper analysis, while quantitative analysis were conducted using spectrophotometer UV-VIS. Paper chromatography analysis showed, the samples contained restricted synthetic coloring substances (<b>GN</b> <b>scarlet,</b> orange G and sudan I) and allowed coloring substances (tartrazine, sunset yellow, karmoisin, amaranth, and eritrosin). Spectrophotometric analysis showed that most of samples contained coloring substances exceeding the prescribed dosage. The percentage of samples containing overdosed coloring substances was 58. 33 %, whereas the percentage of samples containing coloring substances under permitted dosage was 16. 67 %. The percentage of samples containing banned dye was 25. 00 %...|$|R
