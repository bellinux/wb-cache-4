Bulk polymers and spherical polymer nanoparticles based on methacrylic acid and {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} as the functional monomer and crosslinker, respectively, were prepared in acetonitrile. The selectivity was evaluated by radioligand binding assays. The imprinted polymers were very specific to β-estradiol since the control polymers bound virtually none of the radioligand. The bulk polymer was then employed to screen endocrine disrupting <b>chemicals.</b> <b>Structurally</b> <b>related</b> steroids like α-estradiol, estrone and ethynylestradiol showed, respectively, 14. 0, 5. 0 and 0. 7 % of relative binding to the β-estradiol polymer, whereas most unrelated chemicals did not bind at all.

Significant increases in tumors have been observed in the forestomach of female mice and the liver and forestomach {{of male and female}} rats administered BaP by the oral route. BaP was shown to be genotoxic in studies in vivo and in vitro. DNA adducts have been observed in animals following exposure to BaP.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{fate of a}} compound is determined by numerous factors including its chemical structure. Although the metabolic options {{for a variety of}} functional groups are well understood and can often provide a rationale for the comparison of toxicity based on structural analogy, at times quite minor structural variations may have major consequences for metabolic outcomes and toxicity. In this perspective, the effects of structural variations on metabolic outcomes is detailed for a group of related hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted allyl- and propenylbenzenes. These classes of compounds are naturally occurring constituents of a variety of botanical-based food items. The classes vary from one another by {{the presence or absence of}} alkylation of their para-hydroxyl substituents and/or the position of the double bond in the alkyl side chain. We provide an overview of how these subtle structural variations alter the metabolism of these important food-borne compounds, ultimately influencing their toxicity, particularly their DNA reactivity and carcinogenic potential. The data reveal that detailed knowledge of the consequences of subtle structural variations for metabolism is essential for adequate comparison of <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Taken together, it is concluded that predictions in toxicological risk assessment should not be performed on the basis of structural analogy only but should include an analogy of metabolic pathways across compounds and species...|$|R
40|$|Marine diatoms have a {{key role}} in the global carbon {{fixation}} and therefore in the ecosystem. We used Thalassiosira pseudonana as a model organism to assess the effects of exposure to environmental pollutants at the gene expression level. Diatoms were exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons mixture (PAH) from surface sediments collected at a highly PAH contaminated area of the Mediterranean Sea (Genoa, Italy), due to intense industrial and harbor activities. The gene expression data for exposure to the sediment-derived PAH mixture was compared with gene expression data for in vitro exposure to specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The data shows that genes involved in stress response, silica uptake, and metabolism were regulated both upon exposure to the sediment-derived PAH mixture and to the single component. Complementary monitoring of silica in the diatom cultures provide further evidence of a reduced cellular uptake of silica as an end-point for benzo[a]pyrene exposure that could be linked with the reduced gene and protein expression of the silicon transporter protein. However some genes showed differences in regulation indicating that mixtures of <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds can elicit a slightly different gene expression response compared to that of a single component. The paper provides indications on the specific pathways affected by PAH exposure and shows that selected genes (silicon transporter, and silaffin 3) involved in silica uptake and metabolism could be suitable molecular biomarkers of exposure to PAHs.

40|$|Metabolites of two <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemical</b> carcinogens, benzo[a]pyrene and 1 -nitropyrene, were {{compared}} {{for their ability}} to cause cytotoxicity and induce mutations in normally repairing or nucleotide excision repair-deficient diploid human fibroblasts; {{for their ability to}} induce mutations in a defined gene sequence, supF, when a plasmid containing adducts formed by these carcinogens replicates in human 293 cells; and for their ability to induce homologous recombination between duplicated genes in mouse L cells. Both of the metabolites tested, i. e., (+/-) - 7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy- 9 alpha, 10 alpha, epoxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BPDE) and 1 -nitrosopyrene (1 -NOP), form adducts on guanine. BPDE binds principally at the N 2 position of guanine; 1 -NOP binds to guanine at the C 8 position. Results of the studies in diploid human cells indicated that when compared on the basis of equal numbers of DNA adducts, BPDE is more effective than 1 -NOP in inducing mutations in DNA repair-proficient cells, but when compared in repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum human cells that do not remove such adducts from their DNA, the frequency of mutants induced per adduct is equal. These results suggest that during the time available for repair of potentially mutagenic lesions, repair-proficient human cells excise 1 -NOP adducts more rapidly than they excise BPDE adducts. Molecular analysis of the specific kinds of mutations induced when a plasmid containing BPDE residues was allowed to replicate in human cells showed that BPDE induces mainly base substitution mutations, predominantly G:C to T:A transversions.

40|$|Acrylonitrile (ACN) and {{acrylamide}} (AA), structurally similar vinyl monomers, {{are both}} animal carcinogens. ACN is weakly mutagenic in bacteria and induces sister-chromatid exchange, unscheduled DNA synthesis and cell transformation in cells in culture. AA induces chromosomal aberrations in bone mar-row, blood and germ cells in vivo, and dominant lethal mutations in the germ cells of male mice and rats. In the current study, {{the ability of}} AA and ACN to induce domi-nant lethal mutations in the germ cells of male Fischer 344 rats was compared. Three groups of 50 males were gavaged daily for 5 days with ACN (60 mg/kg in normal saline), AA (30 mg/kg in normal saline) or vehicle only; an additional group of 20 males received a single i. p. injection of 0. 2 mg/kg triethylenemelamine (TEM) {{on the afternoon of}} day 5. Start-ing 1 day after exposure, each male was bred to one female per week for 4 weeks (TEM-exposed group) or 10 weeks (ACN, AA and control groups). Mating rates were reduced only during week 1 in the TEM-treated group; pregnancy rates were reduced only during week 2 in the AA-exposed group and week 4 in the TEM-treated group. Females were necropsied 13 days {{after the end of the}} appropriate mating week and the amount of pre- and post-implantation loss calculated. ACN treatment of male rats induced no increases in either pre- or post-implantation loss in females in any of the 10 weeks post-exposure examined. AA induced significant-ly elevated amounts of post-implantation loss for 3 weeks after exposure and pre-implantation loss for 4 weeks post-exposure; both measures returned to control values for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. The positive control TEM caused both indices to increase during all 4 weeks examined. We conclude that AA is a dominant lethal mutagen in male rat germ cells in vivo, specifically in mature spermatozoa and late-stage spermatids. In contrast, the <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemical</b> ACN has neither fertility nor dominant lethal effects in the male Fischer 344 rat after oral administration, and may not pose a significant mutagenic risk to germ cells...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, in situ {{exposure}} of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and subsequent biomarker analyses {{were used to}} examine the impact of three different WWTP effluents on the health status of the fish. Two of the investigated facilities were conventional treatment plants, combining mechanical, biological and chemical treatment. The third one, the WWTP Langwiese (Ravensburg, Germany), has been equipped with an additional powdered activated carbon stage in September 2013. To characterize fish health, two biomarkers were analyzed: (1) to reveal genotoxic effects, micronuclei were investigated in peripheral fish blood cells. Micronuclei are formed during cell division due to a failed reintegration of chromosomal fragments or whole chromosomes into the daughter nuclei. Although this may also happen spontaneously, high frequencies of micronuclei are considered indicative for the presence of genotoxic compounds in the water [27, 28]. (2) As a second biomarker, alterations in the level of the biotransformation enzyme CYPIA 1 (cytochrome P 450 IA 1) were measured by the EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) assay. CYPIA 1 is mainly present in liver tissue and is involved in the detoxification of numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds [29]. Previous studies showed high induction of EROD activity in fish after exposure to organic compounds, including dioxin-like substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as several pharmaceuticals and pesticides [29 – 31]. Thus, high levels of CYPIA 1 and, consequently, high EROD levels can be used as an indicator for exposure to such organic substances [29, 32].|$|R
40|$|N'-coumaroyl spermidine (NlCSpd) is a plant derived {{chemical}} {{which is}} proposed {{to belong to}} a class of low molecular weight neuroactive substances called phenolic polyamines. NlCSpd is stnicturally similar to glutamate receptor blocking toxins found in certain spiders and wasps, such as JSTX- 3 and NSTX- 3 found in Nephila spiders. The goal {{of the present study was}} to determine if plant-derived phenolic polyamines act like other <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemicals</b> found in Arthropod venoms, such as JSTX- 3, and whether they can be classified in the same pharmacological group as the spider and wasp toxins. A comparison was made to determine the relative potencies of various phenolic polyamines fi-om plants and insect venoms. This comparison was done by measuring the effect of various concentrations ofNlCSpd on the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited in muscle of the crayfish Proccanbarus clarkii. NlCSpd was also tested on L-glutamate induced potentials to determine if a postsynaptic component to sj^naptic block occurs. NlCSpd and an analogue with an a longer polyamine chain, NlCSpm, blocked EPSPs in a dose dependent manner, NlCSpd having an IC 50 of lOOnM. NlCSpd also blocked L-glutamate induced potentials. The two main components of the NlCSpd molecule alone are insufficient for activity. NlCSpd acts postsynaptically by interfering with crayfish glutamatergic synaptic transmission, likely blocking glutamate receptors by interacting with the same site(s) as other phenolic polyamines. Certain moieties on the polyamines molecule are necessary for activity while others are not...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{naturally}} occurring and <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemical</b> compounds on mushroom tyrosinase and B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells were examined. For each natural product or related compound, the detailed mechanism of regulatory effect on tyrosinase-catalyzed melanin synthesis was elucidated, and occasionally, the optimal mechanism of cytotoxicity on B 16 melanoma cells exhibited by chemical compounds are evaluated. Arbutin (hydroquinone-o-&# 946;-D-glucopyranoside), a well-known depigmenting reagent, was oxidized by tyrosinase to the corresponding o-quinone with an extremely slow rate, and this reactive metabolite caused melanocytotoxicity, {{resulting in the}} antimelanogenic effect. Another monophenol derivative, thymol (5 -methyl- 2 -isopropylphenol), on the other hand, did not act as either a substrate or an inhibitor, but it acted as a redox inhibitor, due to its prooxidative property, to disrupt the melanin formation. This prooxidant effect also triggered the prooxidative-related toxicity on melanoma cells. In the case of cardols (5 -alkylresorcinol), naturally occurring resorcinolic lipid, hydrophilic head, and hydrophobic tail concept {{was applied to the}} mechanism of both tyrosinase inhibition and cytotoxicity. More specifically, resorcinol moiety quickly and reversibly bound to binuclear copper of tyrosinase, and then, hydrophobic tail portion slowly and irreversibly interacted with the hydrophobic portions proximate to the active site of the enzyme. However, this inhibitory mechanism was only observed when the hydrophobic alkyl chain was long enough to interact with the hydrophobic portion of the enzyme. In the case of cellular effect, cardol (C 15 : 3) preferentially acted as a surfactant to disrupt the function of cellular membrane while cardol (C 5 : 0) produced prooxidant-related toxicity. Alkyl- 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzoate and 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenyl alkanoate with various lengths of alkyl chain were examined to clarify the effect of the lengths of alkyl chain on inhibitory and toxic effect. In the cases of both alkyl- 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzoate and 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenyl alkanoate, basically, both compounds with alkyl chain longer than C 9 caused a two-step inactivation on mushroom tyrosinase. In addition, alkyl- 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzoate acted as a surfactant to cause cytotoxicity while 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenyl alkanoate were decomposed in the growth medium. Alkyl- 3, 5 -dihydroxybenzoate, interestingly and importantly, inhibited melanogenesis without affecting any cell growth, which is due to the combined effect of the two-step tyrosinase inactivation and surfactant activity. Finally, the effect of polyphenolic compounds, resveratrol and luteolin, were subjects to elucidate their effect on tyrosinase and B 16 melanoma cells. In both cases, tyrosinase oxidized them to the corresponding o-quinone. However, in the case of resveratrol (trans- 3, 5, 4 '-trihydroxystilbene), the corresponding o-quinone irreversibly interacted with tyrosinase, indicating that kcat type (suicide) inhibition was the mechanism of inhibition. Resveratrol did not show any toxicity up to 200 &# 956;M, and at 200 &# 956;M, melanogenesis was suppressed with the addition of resveratrol. Luteolin (2 -(3, 4 -Dihydroxyphenyl) - 5, 7 -dihydroxy- 4 -chromenone), on the other hand, the corresponding o-quinone did not inhibit tyrosinase but did act as a redox cycler, which oxidized leukodopachrome to dopachrome when luteolin was coexisted L-DOPA and tyrosinase. In the case of luteolin, luteolin o-quinone was also an active principle for the toxicity. Through the investigation, the biological significance of each molecule was observed. Based on the dynamic perspective and the biological significance, the possible utilization of these chemicals was also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are long-lived toxic organic compounds and are of major concern for human and ecosystem health. Although {{the use of}} most POPs is banned in most countries, some organochlorine pesticides are still being used in several parts of the world. Although environmental levels of some POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have declined, newly emerging POPs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been increasing considerably. Exposure to POPs {{has been associated with}} a wide spectrum of effects including reproductive, developmental, immunologic, carcinogenic, and neurotoxic effects. It is of particular concern that neurotoxic effects of some POPs have been observed in humans at low environmental concentrations. This review focuses on PCBs as a representative chemical class of POPs and discusses the possible mode(s) of action for the neurotoxic effects with emphasis on comparing dose-response and structure-activity relationships (SAR) with other <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemicals.</b> There is sufficient epidemiological and experimental evidence showing that PCB exposure is associated with motor and cognitive deficits in humans and animal models. Although several potential mode(s) of actions were postulated for PCB-induced neurotoxic effects, changes in neurotransmitter systems, altered intracellular signalling processes, and thyroid hormone imbalance are predominant ones. These three potential mechanisms are discussed in detail in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SAR was conducted on other structurally similar chemicals to see if they have a common mode(s) of action. Relative potency factors for several of these POPs were calculated based on their effects on intracellular signalling processes. This is a comprehensive review comparing molecular effects at the cellular level to the neurotoxic effects seen in the whole animal for environmentally relevant POPs...|$|R

Perfluorinated chemicals are synthesized compounds that are structurally derived from hydrocarbons, but have carbon-hydrogen bonds replaced with carbon-fluorine bonds. They {{have been shown}} to inhibit respiration in rat liver mitochondria in vitro. The objective of this investigation was to explore whether structure-activity relationships exist for the effects of perfluorinated chemicals on mitochondrial respiration. Freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria were incubated with increasing concentrations of one of fifteen different perfluorinated chemicals, after which oxidative phosphorylation was recorded polarographically with an oxygen electrode. Each analysis was performed with five concentrations of the respective perfluorinated chemical, and repeated with mitochondria isolated from five individual animals. The respiration profiles of <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> perfluorinated <b>chemicals</b> were then compared to each other. For some perfluorinated chemicals, increased carbon-chain length corresponded with an increased impact on mitochondrial respiration.

40|$|Marine mammals possess high body {{burdens of}} {{persistent}} organic pollutants, including PCBs and dioxin-like compounds (DLC). Chronic environmental or dietary exposure to these chemicals can disrupt {{the function of}} reproductive and immune systems, as well as cause developmental defects in laboratory animals. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, mediating {{the expression of a}} suite of genes in response to exposure to DLC and <b>structurally</b> <b>related</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Species-specific differences in AHR structure can affect an organism's susceptibility to the effects of DLC. The structures and functions of several cetacean AHRs were investigated using in vitro molecular cloning and biochemical techniques. Using a novel combination of remote biopsy and molecular cloning methods, RNA was extracted from small integument samples from living North Atlantic right whales to identify the cDNA sequence for AHR and other genes of physiological importance. Biopsy-derived RNA was found to be of higher quality than RNA extracted from stranded cetaceans, and proved a good source for identifying cDNA sequences for expressed genes. (cont.) The molecular sequences, binding constants, and transcriptional activities for North Atlantic right whale and humpback whale AHRs cDNAs were determined using in vitro and cell culture methods. Whale AHRs are capable of specifically binding dioxin and initiating transcription of reporter genes. The properties of these AHRs were compared with those from other mammalian species, including human, mouse, hamster, and guinea pig, and other novel marine mammal AHRs, using biochemical, phylogenetic, and homology modeling analyses. The relative binding affinities for some marine mammal AHRs fall between those for the high-affinity mouse AHRb- 1 and the lower affinity human AHR. Species-specific variability in two regions of the AHR ligand binding domain were identified as having the greatest potential impact on AHR tertiary structure, yet does not sufficiently explain differences observed in ligand binding assays. Additional studies are necessary to link exposure to environmental contaminants with potential reproductive effects in marine mammals, especially via interactions with steroid hormone receptor pathways. by Joy M.
