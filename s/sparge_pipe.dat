40|$|The {{purpose of}} the air {{distribution}} system in a fluidised bed combustor {{is to provide a}} reasonably uniform spread of combustion air over the entire horizontal cross-sectional area of the bed. One of the simplest, and hence cheapest, forms of air distributor is the <b>sparge</b> <b>pipe</b> design, in which an array of horizontal pipes is fitted {{at the base of the}} bed. Combustion air is then supplied to one end of each pipe and is subsequently distributed to the bed through a series of downward facing holes. The paper describes the development of an improved <b>sparge</b> <b>pipe</b> system for a large coal fired fluidised bed producing hot combustion gases for drying of pressed sugar beet pulp. The air flow out of the holes varied by a factor of three along the length of the pipes with the existing system and in addition the overall flow and hence the thermal output of the bed was unduly restricted. Excessive erosion of the pipe walls near some of the holes was also a problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was undertaken of the flows along the pipes using FLUENT and the results validated by flow and pressure measurements on full scale laboratory models. The flow distribution was substantially improved and the overall flow rate increased by approximately 9 % by varying the hole diameters and pitches. Wear tests were also undertaken in near ambient temperature fluidised beds using multiple thin layers of different coloured paints on the outside of the pipes to assess the erosion patterns. These patterns were found to be similar to those observed on actual sparge pipes removed from the combustor at the end of an operating campaign. The rate of wear can be substantially reduced by reducing the angle of inclination of the downward facing holes in the pipes. Consequently an improved <b>sparge</b> <b>pipe</b> air distributor was designed for this large fluidised bed combustor. 1...|$|E
50|$|The {{deaerated}} {{water flows}} {{down into the}} horizontal storage vessel from where it is pumped to the steam generating boiler system. Low-pressure heating steam, which enters the horizontal vessel through a <b>sparger</b> <b>pipe</b> {{in the bottom of}} the vessel, is provided to keep the stored boiler feedwater warm. External insulation of the vessel is typically provided to minimize heat loss.|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} part of 1999, Triangle Limited {{experienced}} problems at their Ethanol plant with low yeast populations and incomplete fermentations that resulted in very poor yields. Similar problems in 1990 were attributed to toxic levels of copper in one of the nutrients added in pre-fermentation (Madaree et al., 1991). However, in this case, laboratory analysis had indicated no abnormally high levels of copper or other metals. In an effort to solve this problem and to improve fermentation yields the following strategies were implemented:-l Food grade sulphuric acid was imported from South Africa to replace the sulphuric acid available locally. The preparation procedure for the yeast culture, which involves the addition of sulphuric acid, was modified to prevent the low pH previously obtained. l An extra air blower was added to the plant and more holes drilled in the pre-fermenter <b>sparge</b> <b>pipes</b> to improve aeration of the yeast culture. l A fed batch system of adding nutrients to the yeast culture was introduced to improve yeast propagation. The concept of fed batch cultures is introduced and the results of this implementation are presented. The above modifications, allied to stringent sterilisation procedures and closer supervision have resulted in improved yields. In this paper actual plant data are presented to show the fermentation yields before and after these modifications...|$|R
40|$|For the {{reported}} series of tests, the largest reductions in NOx emissions were achieved (together with maximum combustion efficiencies) {{by using a}} primary-to-secondary-air ratio of for the fluidised bed (FB). Under such an operating condition, high freeboard-temperatures could be attained, e. g. up to 200 Â° C above that of the bed, so promoting the combustion of unburnt carbon-fines in the freeboard zone, i. e. secondary combustion ensued. This tended to counteract {{the effect of the}} reduced rate of carbon combustion in the bed, i. e. {{as a result of the}} increased rate of oxidation occurring in the freeboard. Reductions in both the NOx and SO 2 emissions could be achieved by using such a two-stage combustion process, without affecting adversely the overall combustion efficiency. If a primary-to-secondary-air ratio of (rather than) was employed, the rate of SO 2 emissions fell, but the temperature uplift in the freeboard zone was less pronounced and a reduction in combustion efficiency of 2 % was observed. The rates of emissions of NOx and SO 2 could also be reduced by the adoption of wise choices for the design and operation procedure of the fluidised-bed combustor (FBC). For example, a 45 % decrease in the rate of NOx emissions was achieved in one test merely by halving the bed's depth. The lower the available oxygen-concentration (including that provided by recycled flue-gases) within the bed, the smaller was this decrease. On the other hand, a doubling of the bed's depth led to a reduction in the SO 2 emission of approximately 4 %, provided that the in-bed oxygen concentration was maintained sufficiently high, so as to promote sulphation of the ash and any limestone present in the bed. The location of the secondary-air nozzle (i. e. in the freeboard zone) also had significant influences on the emission rates of the NOx and SO 2. A 13 % reduction in the rate of NOx emissions was achieved by increasing the height (above the <b>sparge</b> <b>pipes)</b> of the secondary-air's nozzle from 1 Â· 5 to 2 Â· 6 m. The larger this height, the greater the opportunity for char-NOx-reducing reactions (for which high-temperature conditions are preferred within the freeboard) to ensue, prior to the secondary-air injection. However, the rates of SO 2 emission fell by ~ 10 % when the height of the secondary-air's nozzle was reduced from 2 Â· 6 to 1 Â· 5 m above the <b>sparge</b> <b>pipes.</b> This was due presumably to the increased residence times of the ash and limestone sorbents (for facilitating sulphation) in the freeboard, under the oxidising condition (following secondary-air injection), which favours the complete sulphation of the sulphidated ash/lime to CaSO 4. In the presently reported series of tests, the rate of NOx emissions could be reduced by up to 83 % merely by adjusting the bed's depth and the secondary-air's nozzle-height, although these alterations led simultaneously to a 14 % increase in the rate of SO 2 emissions, and vice versa. Thus, the emissions of NOx and SOx could be controlled by the use of an appropriate design of FBC. The choice made, in practice, usually depends on which of these emission rates is critical with respect to complying with the environmental-pollution directives. Great care must be taken when comparing emission rates from the FBs, either of different sizes or incorporating alternative methods of air distribution, in order to take account of scaling effects. It is unwise, for instance, to use observations from a laboratory-size FBC to predict the quantitative behaviour of an industrial-size (i. e. large) FBC unit. This arises because of the variations in the oxygen concentration, resulting from the usually non-homogeneous, relatively less effective fluidisation achieved in the large bed; the rates of NOx emissions from the large FBC tend to be smaller (as a result of the existence of pockets of relatively low concentration oxygen in the bed) and simultaneously the rates of SO 2 emission are invariably higher. In the presently reported tests, under otherwise nominally similar conditions, an approximate halving of the rate of NOx emissions resulted when using the larger FBC (rather than the small one) together with a doubling of the SO 2 -emission rates, even though the average percentages of oxygen present in the flue gases remained identical for both the small and large FBC units. The recommended bed-depth depends upon what emission one seeks to reduce. However, where feasible, for an industrial-size combustor, it is wise to employ a shallow bed (~ 340 mm depth, when static) in order to incur relatively low operating costs. ...|$|R
