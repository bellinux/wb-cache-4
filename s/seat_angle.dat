5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behaviour}} of beam-column joint {{plays an}} important role in the response of a steel moment resisting framed structure especially under seismic excitation. Semi rigid connections like bolted joints, allow better energy dissipation and provide good response under lateral loads. In this paper the ductility and energy dissipation characteristics of semi rigid bolted connections using double web angle with top and <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> is discussed based on experimental investigation. Non-linear analysis was also performed using finite element method to compare the results. The study revealed that ductile behaviour of beam-column connection is improved by increasing the number of bolts on the top and <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> and the thickness of top and <b>seat</b> <b>angles.</b> The analytical results are in agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is the {{experimental}} and numerical investigation of the unilateral contact effect to the structural response of top and <b>seated</b> <b>angle</b> with double web angle bolted connections. The experimental study {{is focused on the}} study of ductility, deformability, moment capacity, bolts prying force and contact zone of these connections. Six full-scale top and <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> with double web angle bolted connections were tested. Static vertical load was applied until the specimens to reach a condition that cannot resist any additional load after that. In parallel, a finite element analysis was developed to simulate the aforementioned test and in particular, to determine the contact area between the top angles with the column flange, given rise to additional forces, the so-called prying forces. The finite element results were compared to the experimental ones and to those derived theoretically from the application of a model that recently has been proposed in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of adhesively bonded connections in FRP frame structures is explored, {{for the first}} time, {{as an alternative to}} bolted connections. In particular, the influence of <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> on the failuire load is analyzed experimentally. Three full-scale GFRP beam-column are tested and their failure mode, strength and rotational stiffness are investigated. A single pultruded GFRP I-profile is used for the two members. The beam-column assembly forms an inverted L-shape frame, with the column being fixed at the bottom and attached to the beam near the top. The beam, acting as a cantilever, is loaded by a point load near its free end, which subjects the connection to bending and shear. The test results reveal that increasing the stiffness of the <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> there is a less abrupt fall of the load after the peak. Anyway, the connection can have at least the same strength as the corresponding bolted connection, irrespective of whether GFRP or steel bolts are used to make the connection, hence the current prohibition against the use of adhesive beam-column connections in GFRP frame structures may be unjustified...|$|R

50|$|Major {{repairs to}} the bridge were {{conducted}} in 1950 and 1974. The timber fenders at the swing-span piers have been reconstructed several times. In 1950 the original concrete jack arch deck was replaced with a reinforced slab and the stringers were encased. In 1974 the truss lower chord was reinforced for its full length, plates were added at the bottom flanges of the end floor beams, and new stringer <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> connections were added at the floor beams. While the original decorative metal railings were left intact on the approach spans, chain-link fences were placed along the sidewalks on the swing span. While the bridge once had a load-carrying capacity of 20 tons, it was later limited to 3 tons because of rust and corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a tri {{specific}} bicycle was pioneered by Ralph Ray and Dan Empfield in the late 1980s.

50|$|An <b>angle</b> <b>seat</b> {{piston valve}} is a pneumatically-controlled valve with a piston {{actuator}} providing linear actuation {{to lift a}} seal off its seat. The seat is set {{at an angle to}} provide the maximum possible flow when unseated. <b>Angle</b> <b>seat</b> piston valves are particularly suited to applications where high temperatures and large flowrates are required, such as steam or water.

50|$|The {{critical}} angles in bicycle geometry are {{the head}} angle (the {{angle of the}} head tube), and the <b>seat</b> tube <b>angle</b> (the <b>angle</b> of the <b>seat</b> tube). These <b>angles</b> are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a <b>seat</b> tube <b>angle</b> around 73 degrees, with a head tube angle of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{connection}} are generally {{considered in the}} design of steel structures in practice. These are classified as completely rigid (fixed) and simple (pin) connections. In theory, completely rigid connections cannot undergo rotation and simple connections cannot transfer moment. Nevertheless, in reality, rigid connections have a relative flexibility which makes them to rotate and simple connections have some reserve capacity to transfer moments. However, in an effort {{to increase the amount of}} data on the rotational stiffness of top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> available to researchers, this thesis presents the modeled and non linear analysis of different theoretical top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> connections. The finite element modeling software, ABAQUS, is used to create moment-rotation curves for these theoretical connections such as top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> connection with bracket and top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> connection with gusset plate. To demonstrate finite element modeling’s ability to accurately predict the response of the theoretical connections, the results of several experiments performed on top and seat connections are reproduced in ABAQUS. The result of this study shows that initial stiffness of top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> connection increased when attached bracket or gusset plate in connection zone. It is also found that this type of connection can be classified as rigid connection...|$|E

An experimental program was conducted to investigate the behaviour of two typical Riveted Stiffened <b>Seat</b> <b>Angle</b> Connections and the improvement in their behaviour when retrofitted using two suggested retrofitting techniques. Large inelastic cyclic tests were conducted on connections taken from an 83 years old building and their hysteretic moment-rotation curves were obtained.

The force deformation and moment rotation curves are analytically described by a four parameter formula which provides {{the basis for the}} analytical connection model. These connection models consist of rigid bars and nonlinear springs representing the angle segments in either tension or compression. Design curves giving the four parameters of the moment rotation curves are generated for the double web angle connection.

40|$|International Paralympic Committee Athletics {{classification}} aims {{to place}} athletes who throw from a seated position into classes {{according to how}} much their neuromusculoskeletal impairments affect that activity, so that impairment severity does not influence competition outcome. Current classification methods are not evidence based and their development requires research in which athletes with varying impairments throw from standardized throwing frame configurations, thereby permitting quantification of impairment impact. Unfortunately athletes throw from highly individualized (not standardized) positions. This study aimed to establish two standardized seating configurations – one with assistive pole, one without – which would permit conduct of the required research. Using a custom-built, adjustable throwing frame, 47 non-disabled males self-selected their preferred seated throwing configurations with an assistive pole and without. Seventeen repeated the self-selection process within a week. All then completed three maximal throws from their self-selected configurations. Mean configuration without pole was 34 ° (<b>seat</b> <b>angle)</b> and 17 % sitting height (backrest). Mean configuration with a pole was 32 ° (<b>seat</b> <b>angle),</b> 15 % sitting height (backrest), 75 ° elbow extension, and 127 ° pelvic angle (pole position). Results establish the seated throwing configurations preferred by non-disabled people, providing a valid guide for researchers wishing to evaluate the impact of impairment on seated throwing performance...|$|E
40|$|Fully-welded {{connections}} for earthquake {{resistance of}} steel frames are costly and their performance is {{adversely affected by}} weld defects and low-cycle fatigue. An alternative to welded connections is the bolted top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> connection. The latter configuration can be designed to exhibit moment capacities that are lower than both the connected beams and columns. Such ???partial strength connections??? provide attractive seismic design features by alleviating the overstrength requirements that codes impose on column design, to ensure a weak beam-strong-column performance. Towards this end, an experimental program was initiated at the University of Illinois, as described below. Full-scale hybrid simulation of a semi-rigid steel frame is conducted and its ductility and drift ratios are studied. The experimental component of the simulation comprises a beam-column subassembly with top and <b>seat</b> <b>angle</b> with double web angle connection and is instrumented to measure moment-rotation characteristics, as well as strains on the individual angle plates and slip of bolts. The simulation setup and software is described in detail. Simulation results are presented including story drift and base shear time histories. In addition, the moment-rotation diagrams from the hybrid simulation and cyclic testing are presented. Finally, a phenomenological model based on the Bouc-Wen formulation is fitted to the moment-rotation data. The model is suitable for extensive parametric studies {{on the type of}} connection tested, to guide future large scale testing and to derive design guidance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{work on the}} cyclic behavior of bolted and welded beam-to-column connections in steel portal frame.

All specimens were tested under cyclic loading conditions in order to simulate the effects of earthquakes. We also conclude that with appropriate design and careful consideration of connection strength and stiffness, the steel project economy may be maximized...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{feasibility}} of adhesively bonded connections in FRP frame structures is explored {{as an alternative to}} bolted connections. Eight full-scale GFRP beam-column connections are tested and their failure mode, strength and rotational stiffness are investigated. A single pultruded GFRP I-profile is used for the two members. In four of the specimens the beam and the column are connected by epoxy adhesive and GFRP <b>seat</b> <b>angles,</b> similar to the so-called ‘‘standard bolted connection”. In the remaining four specimens, the <b>seat</b> <b>angles</b> are supplemented by additional GFRP angles and stiffeners to strengthen the column flange and web. The beam-column assembly forms an inverted L-shape frame, with the column being fixed at the bottom and attached to the beam near the top. The beam, acting as a cantilever, is loaded by a point load near its free end, which subjects the connection to bending and shear. The current standard connection failed by debonding within the column flange while the improved/strengthened connection failed within the adhesive or at the adhesive-column flange interface. The test results reveal that both the standard and improved connection can have at least the same strength as the corresponding bolted connection, irrespective of whether GFRP or steel bolts are used to make the connection. Hence, the current restrictions against the use of adhesive beam-column connections in GFRP frame structures may be unjustified. In making this comparison, the observed failure load of each connection is normalized by the ultimate moment capacity of the GFRP profile in the beam-column assembly...|$|R
