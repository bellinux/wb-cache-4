25|$|The {{two major}} Chinese {{philosophical}} schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced {{the idea of}} law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.|$|E

The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E

50|$|Parts of {{the tactics}} and warfare of the Vikings were driven by their {{cultural}} beliefs, itself rooted in Norse culture and religion, and vividly recalled {{in the later}} Icelandic sagas. In the early Viking Age, during the late 8th century {{and most of the}} 9th, Vikings consisted of smaller tribal bands with a lack of any clear central authority, governance being rooted in tribal assemblies. Rooted in honour - a vital concept in Nordic pagan tradition - violence was used as a measure to moderate disputes with other tribal groups. This emphasis on violence as a decisive tool regarding disputes was not limited to a man, but extended to a man's kin. Violence was seen as a measure to defend honor. Honor was extremely important to Norsemen, and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> one's honor extended beyond physical and material injuries. Honor could be shamed from mere insults, where Norsemen were expected to react with violence often resulting in death. Thus, with this prevalence of violence came the expectation of fearlessness.|$|R

500|$|From April to June 2000, Hamasaki {{released}} the [...] "Trilogy", {{a series of}} singles consisting of [...] "Vogue", [...] "Far Away", and [...] "Seasons". The lyrics of these songs focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment {{that she had not}} expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> of her public image. Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album, Duty (September 2000), involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities. She described her feelings after the writing as [...] "unnatural" [...] and [...] "nervous". The musical style was darker as well; in contrast with Loveppears, Duty was a rock-influenced album with only one dance song, [...] "Audience". Duty resonated with fans: the [...] "Trilogy" [...] were [...] "hit singles" [...] ("Seasons" [...] was a million-seller), and the album became Hamasaki's best-selling studio album. At the end of 2000, Hamasaki held her first New Year countdown concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} {{performance of the}} album, Pornography was not well received by most music critics upon its release. NME reviewer Dave Hill was ambivalent towards the album, writing that it [...] "portrays and parades its currency of exposed futility and utterly naked fear with so few distractions or adornments, and so little <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>shame.</b> It really piles it on. The Cure have applied themselves to catching a related collection of the very purest feelings endemeic to their age, and holding them right on the spot in their intangible, unspecified, unmanageable and most unpleasantly real form." [...] Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "It's downhill all the way, into ever-darkening shadows... passing through chilly marbled archways to the final rendezvous with the cold comfort of the slab". Dave McCullough of Sounds felt that despite a [...] "genuine talent still at work", Pornography [...] "has too much music too cluttered a backing for Smith's well-intended observance [...] Robert Smith seems locked in himself, a spiralling nightmare that leaves The Cure making a pompous sounding music that is, when all's said and done, dryly meaningless". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, derided Smith's [...] "glum" [...] lyrics and felt that he should [...] "cheer up". Rolling Stone critic J. D. Considine commented that the lyrics seem [...] "stuck in the terminal malaise of adolescent existentialism", concluding, [...] "Pornography comes off as the aural equivalent of a bad toothache. It isn't the pain that irks, it's the persistent dullness". Trouser Press Charles McCardell, on the other hand, found that the Cure [...] "imposes an order that at first seems contrary to the basic preconceptions of rock 'n' roll" [...] – noting that [...] "for them, lyrics are everything" [...] and that instruments had been relegated to [...] "merely creating atmosphere" [...] – and hailed Pornography as an [...] "uncompromising and challenging" [...] work." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact that shame can have on people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{identity}} and how {{this can be a}} major factor in exacerbating feelings of loss. Whilst acknowledging the considerable contemporary theoretical interest in the affect <b>of</b> <b>shame,</b> attention is drawn to the methodological difficulties inherent in studying shame. It is argued that shame is an important aspect of human experience but is one that provides a challenge not only to quantitative methods, but also to conventional qualitative methods of enquiry. A methodology based on psychodynamically-informed interviews and analysis is therefore utilised. Extracts of interviews with families (drawn from a larger study of the impact of serious mental illness on families) are used to argue that the <b>shame</b> <b>of</b> having a family member suffer from mental illness can very directly threaten people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity. <b>Shame,</b> it will be argued, helps us understand the well-recognised phenomenon of ‘chronic grieving’ amongst relatives of people with severe mental health problems. Shame keeps people out of the dialogue with others through which new narratives of self might be developed. Theoretical links between this construct <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> and chronic grieving can be made with observations of the associations between shame and depression...|$|R
