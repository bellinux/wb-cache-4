40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the formation temperature of nonwovens from bio-degradable aliphatic polyesters (trade name Bionolle) on their structure and mechanical properties. Nonwovens were produced by <b>spun-bonded</b> technique at a laboratory installa-tion at IBWCh, changing one of the process parameters i. e. the temperature of the polymer. Basic parameters of the polymer were evaluated {{in order to determine the}} <b>spun-bonded</b> process condition. Phase transition temperature- glass transition temperature (Tg),-melt-ing point (Tm) and mass flow index (MFI) were assessed. The effect of manufacturing condi-tions on the properties of the nonwovens obtained was identified on the basis of the analysis of their mechanical parameters, the sorption rate, crystallinity and compost biodegrada-tion rate. It has been shown that 238 °C is the best formation temperature to produce non-wovens with good mechanical properties and at the same time accessible biodegrability.

40|$|In this work, 3 -D fibrous {{geometries}} {{are developed}} {{to resemble the}} microstructure of <b>spun-bonded</b> and electrospun filters media and used here to simulate their filtration efficiency and pressure drop. For the sake of simplicity, a continuum flow theory was considered to prevail for the case of <b>spun-bonded</b> media (microfiber media) whereas our electrospun media (nanofiber media) were assumed {{to be in a}} free molecular flow regime. Our simulations results are in good general agreement with the experimental data. Especially, in predicting media’s pressure drop, our results show better predictions when compared to some of the existing models. We also quantitatively demonstrated that by decreasing the fiber diameter, the minimum collection efficiency of the media having identical pressure drops increases. This effect is accompanied by a decrease in the particle diameter associated with these minimum efficiencies – the most penetrating particle diameter. Studying the influence of the gas temperature, we showed that filter’s efficiency increases as the gas temperature increases. Conversely, the filter’s pressure drop decreases by increasing the gas temperature...|$|E

In most instances, the cotton/polyester absorbed and maintained the initial inoculation rate over the sampling times. Polypropylene was somewhat absorbent, but contamination rates were slightly lower than on cotton/polyester. Polyethylene material was non-absorbent and performed the best, especially with Listeria monocytogenes. The data indicate that the non-absorbent property of polyethylene does not provide a reservoir for microorganisms, allows run-off, and therefore potentially reduces the opportunity for cross-contamination of food products...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports the}} {{investigation}} of the shear behaviour of six geo-synthetics with two granular soils. The test equipment, soils, and geosynthetics prop-erties are described and the soil-geosynthetic interaction behaviour is studied. The influence of soil particle size, geosynthetic structure, and test method are discussed by analysing the results of inclined plane tests. The main conclusions of the study are as follows: geosynthetic structure has an important influence on the soil-geosynthetic interface friction angle; higher soil-geosynthetic interface friction angles are measured when the geosynthetic surface has significantly sized apertures (e. g., geogrids) or allows the penetration of soil particles into the geosynthetic (e. g., nonwoven, <b>spun-bonded</b> geotextiles); geosynthetic surface roughness (e. g., geomembranes) is associated with higher soil-geosynthetic interface friction angles; soil particle size has an impor-tant influence on the soil-geosynthetic interface friction angle; broadly graded soils with large average soil particle sizes allow an increase in the soil-geosynthetic interface resistance; the method of test does not significantly influence the soil-geomembrane or soil-geotextile interface friction angles (geosynthetics with continuous surfaces); an...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} an optoelectronic setup designed {{to evaluate the}} surface parameters of fabrics that influence their tactile feel. The developed texturometer uses the periodic structure of a textile material {{and its ability to}} reflect light to evaluate its surface properties through its polarimetric properties. The device scans the surface with a laser line and performs a temporal Fourier analysis of the reflected light, which allows us to consider the periodical structure of the material's surface. Instead of using the overall reflected energy, the analysis is performed on the degree of polarization of light. Results obtained with this new texturometer are compared to those obtained with a nonpolarimetric device that uses overall reflected energy. Emerized and nonemerized twill fabrics are tested, as well as <b>spun-bonded</b> nonwovens. We show that discrimination between samples is enhanced with this polarimetric texturometer. For emerized fabrics, the results exhibit a decrease in depolarization as emerizing intensity increases. For nonwovens, a complementary study in polarimetric imaging has been performed to better understand the phenomena. Nonwoven thermobonded points exhibit lower depolarization of the lightwave {{than the rest of the}} structure. Moreover, their depolarization differentiates the tested nonwovens...|$|E

New barrier garments were designed from <b>spun-bonded</b> olefin that, in particle penetration tests, was 100 times better as a filter than cotton cloth. Three designs, a gown, a loose coverall and a close overall, were compared {{with each other and}} with conventional cotton gowns in experimental exercise and nursing procedures. Staphylococcus aureus from burned patients were used as markers. The close coverall was 4 - 7 times better than the loose coverall or gown in preventing the soiling of clothes worn underneath it, but appeared to permit substantially more transfer from garments underneath it to a mock 'patient' and to the air than did the looser garments. A cotton gown reduced the soiling of clothes underneath it by more than 10 times and the contamination of a mock patient by more than 30 times as compared with no barrier garment. The close coverall further diminished the contamination of clothes but not the transfer to the patient.

40|$|The {{question}} of the recycling of the polyurethane (PU) foam, especially in the automotive industry {{represents one of the}} main technology thrust and challenge of the car manufacturers and the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) since 2000. Indeed, it is nowadays necessary for car industry to promote ecological methods of development in regard to new consumer sensibility. New textile products present the best alternative solutions to answer this issue of replacement of the PU foam. Based on this fact, a new three-dimensional (3 D) fibrous structure made of polyester (PET) material has been developed in order to replace PU foam in automotive trim. These new manufactured 3 D fibrous structures are laminated with needle-punched and <b>spun-bonded</b> sheets. The sheets are made of 100 % PET, in order to obtain a mono component product.

40|$|It {{is known}} that solar driven vapour {{transport}} inward to vapour open constructions such as wood frame walls with a vapour tight finishing at the inside may occur and may lead to an undesired wetting of wooden elements and gypsum board. Although {{the origin of this}} inward vapour transport may be well understood, the quantification of the moisture damage risks remains not well understood, since the effect of material properties and climate on the two-dimensional hygrothermal behaviour of the walls is not yet adequately addressed. Therefore, a research project, subsidized by ASHRAE TC 4. 4, studies solar-driven inward vapour flow combining small- and large-scale wall assemblies tests under comparable conditions. The objective of the tests were to produce precise measurements on wetting and drying behavior of internal parts of the back wall, when a wetted masonry cladding is loaded under cyclic temperature loading. The specimens were composed of: brick veneer, weather resistive membrane (<b>spun-bonded</b> polyolefin), oriented-strand board (OSB) sheathing, glass fiber insulation, gypsum board and interior finish (acrylic paint or vinyl wall covering). It is found that, due to the temperature gradient, an important vapour flow is generated to the back wall, wetting the OSB sheathing, mineral wool and gypsum board. The vapour permeance of the interior finishing determines the wetting of the gypsum board: a vapour tight vinyl wall covering leads to significant wetting of the gypsum board and very lo...|$|E
