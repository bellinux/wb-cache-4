40|$|Background In 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{assessed}} guidance (DG 7) {{on the use}} of tauroselcholic (75 <b>selenium)</b> <b>acid</b> (also {{known as}} SeHCAT) for the investigation of diarrhoea due to bile acid malabsorption (BAM) in patients with IBS-D and in patients with Crohn’s disease who have not had an ileal resection. NICE concluded that tauroselcholic (75 <b>selenium)</b> <b>acid</b> was recommended for use in research only. NICE will be reviewing the decision to update the guidance for tauroselcholic (75 <b>selenium)</b> <b>acid,</b> for these populations, in March 2017. Aim Our aim is to summarise advances in BAM, also known as bile acid diarrhoea (BAD), and encourage clinicians to re-evaluate their understanding of this disorder. Approach We review the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of BAD/BAM. We describe the new evidence available since the original NICE review in 2012, and discuss the economic issues associated with failure to diagnose or to treat BAD/BAM accurately. Evidence update There is new and compelling evidence available since DG 7, which shows that tauroselcholic (75 <b>selenium)</b> <b>acid</b> scanning is a powerful tool in the diagnosis of BAD/BAM. We summarise published prevalence data (approximately 1...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} impact of ascorbic acid and/or methionine supplementation on selenium absorption and metabolism. These relationships might be of importance in determining either minimum selenium nutritional requirements or levels of intake at which this mineral becomes toxic. Three related studies compose the project. ^ The first study involved the feeding of weanling mice. Rations varied in <b>selenium,</b> ascorbic <b>acid,</b> and methionine content. Supplementation with selenium resulted in decreased growth and increased selenium content of feces, liver tissue, and kidney tissue. Ascorbic acid supplementation in addition to selenium supplementation resulted in increased fecal selenium content and tended to decrease liver and kidney selenium content. Methionine supplementation with selenium also resulted in increased fecal selenium losses and decreased liver selenium content but tended to increase kidney tissue selenium content. ^ In study II, nine young adult men and women were fed a laboratory-controlled diet with and without supplements of selenium or <b>selenium</b> plus ascorbic <b>acid.</b> <b>Selenium</b> supplementation resulted in increased selenium content of urine and feces. Concurrent ascorbic <b>acid</b> supplementation with <b>selenium</b> supplementation resulted in a small increase in fecal selenium loss which was insufficient to explain the dramatic decrease in urinary selenium excretion. ^ In study III, a survey was conducted of food intakes of healthy adolescent boys and girls eating self-selected diets in relationship to blood serum and whole blood selenium content. Several other hematological and anthropometric parameters were measured. No relationships between dietary ascorbic acid or protein intakes and circulating selenium levels were found. Correlation coefficients suggested but did not prove that growth and/or sex as independent or related variables influenced blood serum and whole blood selenium levels. ...|$|R
30|$|Herein, {{we report}} the {{successful}} synthesis of CdS and alloyed CdSxSe 1 −x quantum dots without injection and nucleation initiators by simply heating the reaction medium. All the source chemicals used including cadmium acetate, sulfur, <b>selenium,</b> oleic <b>acid</b> and 1 -octadecene are air-stable and inexpensive relatively. The optical {{properties of the}} obtained quantum dots can be tuned by changing the OA/Cd or the S/Se feed molar ratio. The former and latter changing of feed molar ratio results in the change of the size and the composition, respectively. This synthetic approach developed is very simple and highly reproducible and thus suitable for large-scale preparation of CdS and CdSxSe 1 −x nanocrystals.|$|R

40|$|Background & Aims: Some {{studies have}} found that {{patients}} with idiopathic bile acid diarrhea (BAD) present with symptoms of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS). However, these studies were either retrospective, did not define D-IBS according to current criteria, or included patients with chronic functional diarrhea. We performed a prospective study of the prevalence of idiopathic BAD in consecutive patients fulfilling the Rome III criteria for D-IBS. Methods: We analyzed data from 118 consecutive adult patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for D-IBS (mean age, 41. 7 years; 72. 9 % female), seen at 2 gastroenterology clinics in the UK. We excluded patients with risk factors for BAD (previous history of cholecystectomy, terminal ileal Crohn's disease, terminal ileal resection or right hemicolectomy, pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy, celiac disease, or microscopic colitis). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (on demographics, hospital anxiety, somatization, and depression, as well as the patient health questionnaire- 12 and the short form- 36 [SF- 36]), and then received the (75) <b>selenium</b> homocholic <b>acid</b> taurine retention test. Retention of (75) <b>selenium</b> homocholic <b>acid</b> taurine 7 days after administration was used to identify patients with idiopathic BAD (mild BAD, 10 %- 14. 9 %; moderate BAD, 5. 1 %- 9. 9 %; and severe BAD, ≤ 5 %). Results: Twenty-eight were found to have BAD (23. 7 % of total), with similar percentages at each study site (25. 3 % and 20 %; P=. 54). Eight patients had mild BAD (28. 6 %), 8 had moderate BAD (28. 6 %), and 12 had severe BAD (42. 8 %). There was no statistical difference in age or sex, or depression, patient health questionnaire- 12, or SF- 36 scores, between individuals with vs without BAD. However, patients with BAD had a higher mean body mass index than those without BAD (31. 6 vs. 26. 4; P=. 003). Physical activity (based on the SF- 36) was significantly lower in subjects with moderate (43. 8) or severe BAD (41. 7), compared to patients with mild BAD (87. 5) (P=. 046). Conclusion: Almost 25 % of patients presenting with D-IBS have idiopathic BAD; most cases are moderate to severe. Guidelines should advocate testing to exclude BAD before patients are diagnosed with D-IBS...|$|R

The animals were fed these diets up to 1. 9 years, and during this period the following age-related parameters were measured: ac-cumulation of fluorescent aging pigments, calcium uptake in muscle microsomes, kidney function, mortality rates, and voluntary and forced activity. Of the 3 diets, the one supplemented {{with high levels of}} antioxidants significantly inhibited accumulation of fluorescent products in testes and heart, while the mortality rate and other age-related indices were not affected.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} serum-free medium which would support the growth of a human tumour cell line, RPMI 2650. Serum is used almost universally as a medium {{supplement}} to support growth of cells in culture, but investigators in the field have long recognised the problems associated with the undefined, complex and variable composition of serum whereas serum-free media permit growth of cells in a precisely-defined environment. In order to gain experience in the techniques used to grow cells in culture in the absence of serum, initial work was carried out on a canine kidney cell line (MDCK), for which a serum-free medium had already been developed. Growth of RPMI 2650 was initially examined in reduced serum conditions at clonal cell densities and the effect of various growth factors, hormones and other nutritional factors was examined. Significant growth stimulation was observed due to the addition of a number of factors (transferrin, insulin, EGF and selenium).
