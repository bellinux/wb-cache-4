In the article by D. Kreimer and E. W. Mielke [1] {{the existence of a}} chiral anomaly in spaces with torsion as reported by us in [2] is challenged. Their result is presumably based on standard diagramatic techniques and regularization prescriptions. Our results, on the other hand, are derived using functional methods to evaluate formally the expectation value of the divergence of the chiral current as the regularized trace of the chiral operator.

40|$|AIM: To assess linear {{endoscopic}} ultrasound (L-EUS) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in biliary tract dilation and suspect small ampullary tumor. METHODS: L-EUS and MRI data were compared in 24 patients with small ampullary tumors; all with <b>subsequent</b> histological <b>confirmation.</b> Data were collected prospectively and the accuracy of detection, histological characterization and N staging were assessed retrospectively using the results of surgical or endoscopic treatment as a benchmark. RESULTS: A suspicion of ampullary tumor was present in 75 % of MRI and all L-EUS examinations, with 80 % agreement between EUS and histological findings at endoscopy. However, L-EUS and histological TN staging at surgery showed moderate agreement (κ = 0. 54).

40|$|Quadrigeminal lipoma {{is a rare}} tumor {{that has}} been {{categorized}} as developmental malformation rather than a hamartoma or true neoplasm, due to its origin from abnormal persistence and mal-differentiation of meninx primitiva during {{the development of the}} subarachnoid cisterns. Reported admixture of adipose tissue with heterotopic elements also supports a developmental origin. Quadrigeminal lipomas are frequently asymptomatic and detected incidentally. Though a favorable clinical course is usually expected, recurrences may occur due to partial removal of lesions in close relation to vital structure. We describe the role of intraoperative squash smear cytology as a diagnostic aid in quadrigeminal cistern lipoma and an alternative to frozen sections that are technically difficult to obtain due to presence of lobules of fibro-adipose tissue. With radiological correlation, squash cytology can be an economical method for intraoperative diagnosis, pending <b>subsequent</b> histopathological <b>confirmation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} an {{international}} survey of 15 major cancer centres have clarified how randomization is being implemented in cancer trials. As regards {{the mechanics of}} obtaining treatment assignment for each patient a system of telephone registration to a central randomization office was widely used. We also advise formal checks for patient eligibility immediately before treatment assignment, and <b>subsequent</b> written <b>confirmation</b> of randomization to the investigators. As regards statistical methods, stratification of randomization by one or two prognostic factors (and institution in multicentre trials) is commonplace. Most centres used the standard approach of random permuted blocks within strata though some others used "dynamic" institution-balancing or "minimization" methods instead. The value of stratified allocation is chiefly for the trial's credibility in having comparable treatment groups, rather than for statistical efficiency. One should avoid overstratification and use only the really important prognostic factors. One essential is that randomization should in practice work for every patient, so undue complexity is to be avoided...|$|R
