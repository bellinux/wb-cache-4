This is a difficult problem, because of the substantial complexity and variety in human behavioral strategies. We report an investigation into a new approach using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to condition model parameters to data and prior knowledge. As the case study we examine menu interaction, where we have click time data only to infer a cognitive model that implements a search behaviour with parameters such as fixation duration and recall probability. Our results demonstrate that ABC (i) improves estimates of model parameter values, (ii) enables meaningful comparisons between model variants, and (iii) <b>supports</b> <b>fitting</b> models to individual users.

40|$|Objective: Research {{has shown}} that {{widening}} participation students can encounter many barriers on their journey to higher education. Some manage to overcome them, gain a place at university, {{and go on to}} achieve academic success; others fall at the last hurdle, dropping out before commencing their course. This research addresses a gap in the current evidence by finding out about the challenges students face in the period before starting university which might contribute to them not registering for their place. Design: Online survey and telephone interviews. Setting: A Russell Group university. Participants: 271 widening participation students that had accepted a place at a Russell Group university. Results: A number of challenges were identified: lack of academic preparedness and familial <b>support,</b> <b>fitting</b> in socially, and making the transition from the parental home to living alone. Other challenges such as finance and those more pertinent to local students seemed more significant offered some explanation for why students might change their minds about university at the last minute. Conclusions: Universities can try and address some of the challenges that widening participation students face in the period before starting university by offering more support, and practical suggestions are made as to how this may be achieved; but it is important that initiatives to offer support continue throughout the university journey to ensure students are retained for the duration of their course...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a full-color {{photovoltaic}} (PV) module, {{called the}} artist PV module, is developed by laser processes. A full-color image source is {{printed on the}} back of a protective glass using an inkjet printer, and a brightened grayscale mask is used to precisely define regions on the module where colors need to be revealed. Artist PV modules with 1. 1 × 1. 4 m 2 area have high a retaining power output of 139 W and an aesthetic appearance making them more competitive than other building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) products. Furthermore, the installation of artist PV modules as curtain walls without metal frames is also demonstrated. This type of installation offers an aesthetic advantage by introducing <b>supporting</b> <b>fittings,</b> originating from the field of glass technology.

40|$|The {{quality of}} atomistic {{simulations}} depends decisively on {{the accuracy of}} the underlying energy function (force field). Of particular importance for condensed-phase properties are nonbonded interactions, including the electrostatic and Lennard-Jones terms. Permanent atomic multipoles (MTPs) are an extension to common point-charge (PC) representations in atomistic simulations. MTPs are commonly determined from and fitted to an ab initio Electrostatic Potential (ESP), and Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters are obtained from comparison of experimental and computed observables using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For this a set of thermodynamic observables such as density, heat of vaporization, and hydration free energy is chosen, to which the parametrization is fitted. The current work introduces a comprehensive computing environment (Fitting Wizard (FW)) for optimizing nonbonded interactions for atomistic force fields of different qualities. The FW <b>supports</b> <b>fitting</b> of standard PC-based force fields and more physically motivated multipolar (MTP) force fields. A broader study including 20 molecules ranging from N-methyl-acetamide and benzene to halogenated benzenes, phenols, anilines, and pyridines yields a root mean squared deviation for hydration free energies of 0. 36 kcal/mol over a range of 8 kcal/mol. It is furthermore shown that PC-based force fields are not necessarily inferior compared to MTP parametrizations depending on the molecule considered...|$|R

The maximum likelihood approach becomes unstable or even fails in small samples with relatively large number of predictors. The ML estimates also do not exist with complete separation in the data.

The proposed method uses pseudo observations to regularize the observed responses by sharpening {{them so that they}} become close to the underlying probabilities. The estimates can be computed easily with all commonly used statistical packages <b>supporting</b> the <b>fitting</b> of proportional odds models with weights.

40|$|Abstract: Flexible hazard {{regression}} models based on penalised splines allow {{to extend the}} classical Cox-model via the inclusion of time-varying and nonparametric effects (Kneib & Fahrmeir 2007). Despite their immediate appeal in terms of flexi-bility, these models introduce additional difficulties when performing model choice and variable selection. Boosting (cf.

By using component-wise base-learners, variable selection and model choice can be performed in the boosting framework. We introduce a boosting algorithm for survival data that permits the inclusion of time-varying effects in a parametric form or in a flexible way, using P-splines. Thus we can fit flexible, additive hazard {{regression models}} and have a fully automated procedure for variable selection and model choice at hand. The properties and performance of the algorithm are investigated in simulation studies. In an application, we present the analysis of retrospective data of surgica...|$|R

The 19 -Å structure of TRPV 1 determined by using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy exhibits fourfold symmetry and comprises two distinct regions: a large open basket-like domain, likely corresponding to the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal portions, and a more compact domain, corresponding to the transmembrane portion.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, it {{is shown}} that a three-valued autoepistemic logic {{provides}} an elegant unifying framework {{for some of the}} major semantics of normal and disjunctive logic programs and logic programs with classical negation, namely, the stable semantics, the well-founded semantics, <b>supported</b> models, <b>Fitting's</b> semantics, Kunen's semantics, the stationary semantics, and answer sets. For the first time, so many semantics are embedded into one logic. The framework extends previous results—by Gelfond, Lifschitz, Marek, Subrahmanian, and Truszczynski —on the relationships between logic programming and Moore's autoepistemic logic. The framework suggests several new semantics for negation-as-failure. In particular, we will introduce the epistemic semantics for disjunctive logic programs. In order to motivate the epistemic semantics, an interesting class of applications called ignorance tests will be formalized; it will be proved that ignorance tests can be defined by means of the epistemic semantics, but not by means of the old semantics for disjunctive programs. The autoepistemic framework provides a formal foundation for an environment that integrates different forms of negation. The role of classical negation and various forms of negation-by-failure in logic programming will be briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Accepted???. Received???; in {{original}} form??? We examine {{the evolution of}} the Tully–Fisher relation (TFR) using a sample of 89 field spirals for which we have measured confident rotation velocities (Vrot). This sample covers the redshift range 0. 1 � z � 1, with a median of 〈z 〉 = 0. 33. The best-fitting TFR has a slope consistent with that measured locally, and we find no significant evidence for a change with redshift, although our sample is not large enough to well constrain this. By plotting the residuals from the local TFR versus redshift, we find evidence that these luminous (MB � M ∗ B) spiral galaxies are increasingly offset from the local TFR with redshift, reaching a brightening of − 1. 0 ± 0. 5 mag, for a given Vrot, by z ∼ 1. This is <b>supported</b> by <b>fitting</b> the TFR to our data in several redshift bins, suggesting a corresponding brightening of the TFR intercept. Since selection effects would generally increase the fraction of intrinsically-bright galaxies at higher redshifts, we argue that the observed evolution is probably an upper limit.

Compared to conventional traps comprising 51 -mm mesh throughout, those with the same mesh size and escape gaps caught significantly fewer (by 95 %) undersize (< 85 mm carapace length [...] CL) crabs while maintaining legal catches. Traps made from 101 -mm mesh (but with the same funnel entrances as conventional designs) and with and without escape gaps similarly retained fewer undersize crabs and also yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus australis (the key bycatch species) by up to 94 %, but there were concomitant reductions in fishing power for legal sizes of S. serrata.
