5|$|By {{the end of}} December 2015, most {{hospitals}} in Chennai had wholly or partially restored services. State health authorities in Tamil Nadu reported post-flooding sanitation efforts had been successful, and that {{there had not been}} any flood-related outbreaks of disease. While floodwaters had largely receded by 19 December, areas of <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> covered parts of Tamil Nadu into January 2016, notably around Cuddalore and Tuticorin. Central government survey teams conducted studies on the extent on the flooding in early January.|$|E
5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with <b>stagnant</b> <b>water,</b> and {{outbreaks}} of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. <b>Stagnant</b> <b>water</b> caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the damage on Saint Martin, officials in the Netherlands Antilles issued {{an appeal to the}} European Parliament for assistance from the international community. Due to their small population and area, the small islands of the eastern Caribbean required international funding to repair the damage from the hurricane and return to normal. In Antigua and Barbuda, officials worked quickly to repair roads and clean Barbuda's water system. However, 20,000people in Antigua remained without water for a week after the hurricane, and the <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> caused an increase in mosquitoes. The government of Dominica provided 42families with temporary shelters. With a loan from the Caribbean Development Bank, the government worked to complete a sea wall along a highway south of its capital Roseau. The Saint Lucian government provided housing to 70families. In Grenada, workers repaired the road system to allow fuel transportation across the island and began to reclaim land near its airport to mitigate erosion. Regions in Antigua and Grenada were declared disaster areas. Across the eastern Caribbean, local Red Cross offices provided food and shelter to affected citizens. High damage to tourist areas caused a decrease in cruise lines. A damaged hotel in Nevis left 800people unemployed due to its closure.|$|E
5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Navy orchestrated a {{disaster}} relief operation {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Alok Bhatnagar, the Flag Officer Commanding Tamil Nadu, Puducherry Naval Area (TNNA). The Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy rushed an amphibious warfare vessel, the INS Airavat, to Chennai on 2 December, with a complement of 20 divers, five Gemini boats, four landing craft and two boats. Three naval flood relief teams, comprising 86 trained swimmers and divers and three officers, were rushed to Tamil Nadu, along with several hundred food packets. The INS Rajali naval air station at Arakkonam functioned as a makeshift airport for transporting relief materials and evacuating stranded people. On 3 December, the Eastern Naval Command despatched the fleet tanker INS Shakti and the stealth guided missile frigate INS Sahyadri to Tamil Nadu; the ships brought 105 additional divers, 200 tents, 3000 towels, 1000 blankets, 10 field kitchens and food, milk powder, medicines, 5000 litres of bottled water and 700 tonnes of fresh water. General Dalbir Singh Suhag, the Chief of the Army Staff, flew to Chennai on 4 December to supervise the Army's rescue efforts; he and the General Officer Commanding, Dakshin Bharat Area, conducted an aerial reconnaissance. An additional 15 NDRF teams were planned to arrive in a day or two. With rainfall gradually becoming less intense, the pace of relief efforts intensified by 5 December. By then, more than 11 lakh (1,100,000) people had been evacuated to safer places and thousands more temporarily housed in relief camps across the city and adjoining districts. People in many localities began draining <b>stagnant</b> <b>water,</b> while government relief efforts were supplemented by thousands of NGO volunteers and individuals with food packets, drinking water, clothes, blankets and medicines. 92 mobile medical teams were deployed across Chennai on 4 December to tend to the needy, while 200 special medical camps became operational on 5 December, in addition to more than 210 camps already operating.|$|E

25|$|Any {{factor that}} causes {{increased}} nutrient concentrations can potentially lead to eutrophication. In modeling eutrophication, {{the rate of}} water renewal plays a critical role; <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> is allowed to collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies. It {{has also been shown}} that the drying of wetlands causes an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent eutrophication blooms.|$|E

50|$|Macrognathus pentophthalmos, the Sri Lanka five-eyed spiny eel, is a {{small fish}} endemic to Sri Lanka. It usually is found in running and <b>stagnant</b> <b>waters</b> of {{freshwater}} and brackish waters. It is 19.5 cm in length.|$|R
25|$|C. perspicillata is {{primarily}} found in Mexico, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Trinidad, and Tobago. They are mostly found in forests, both deciduous and evergreen. It is usually found near <b>stagnant</b> <b>water,</b> {{in areas with}} {{a large amount of}} free internal space, usually below elevations of 1000 meters. As a result, this bat is among the most common that are caught at ground level, based on their foraging habits.|$|E
25|$|Increased climate variability, that is {{associated}} with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. People are often stranded inside their homes and are exposed to water-borne diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis. Better early warning systems are needed to manage the risk associated with increased rainfall.|$|E
25|$|There are swampy {{areas on}} Valenzuela {{and there is}} a <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> in Tullahan River on the south, which make {{citizens}} vulnerable to mosquito-linked diseases such as dengue and malaria. Though malaria is not a common case in Valenzuela–the city ranks consistently among top five dengue-infected regions in the Philippines with around 560% chance of recurrence every year. In the second quarter of 2008, however, only 500% increase was reported compared to the same period in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Leaching or the {{soaking in}} water removes {{chemical}} inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. Rain and melting snow naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in <b>stagnant</b> <b>water,</b> {{can result in}} oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.|$|E
25|$|Water can {{dissolve}} or deform ceramics {{that have}} been low fired, i.e. temperatures around 600°C. Ceramic fired in high temperatures may also be susceptible to water if their mineral particles are soluble in water, for example Gypsum or calcite. Additionally the different compounds in water can flux and react in different ways to different ceramics. In naturally occurring water, carbon dioxide is dissolved and can create a chemical reaction with minerals in clay bodies that may form calcium bicarbonate which is very soluble. <b>Stagnant</b> <b>water</b> is less damaging because the carbon dioxide is not exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Taro can {{be grown}} in paddy fields where water is {{abundant}} or in upland situations where water is supplied by rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Taro {{is one of the}} few crops (along with rice and lotus) that {{can be grown}} under flooded conditions. This is due to air spaces in the petiole, which permit underwater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. For a maximum dissolved oxygen supply, the water should be cool and flowing. Warm, <b>stagnant</b> <b>water</b> causes basal rotting. For maximum yields, the water level should be controlled so that the base of the plant is always under water.|$|E
