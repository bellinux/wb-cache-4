50|$|In the teams' {{first ever}} meeting, Penn State was {{expected}} to handily defeat Massachusetts (UMASS), who was 0-3 entering the game.Although UMASS's offense was capable of scoring lots of points despite a lackluster rushing attack, the Nittany Lions' tenacious run defense and <b>solid</b> <b>pass</b> rush ostensibly inhibited much chance of offensive success for the Minutemen. Penn State defensive tackle Anthony Zettel was a key for the Nittany Lions' defense; he entered the game among the NCAA's leader in tackles for loss. Offensively, the Nittany Lions sought to continue their quest in establishing a running game with solid offensive line play. Penn State was a 30-point favorite to win, and was unanimously selected as the winner by prognosticators from Big Ten Network and ESPN's Big Ten blog.|$|E

Running back Walter Payton, {{who was then the}} NFL's all-time leading rusher with 14,860 yards, rushed for 1,551 yards. He also caught 49 passes for 483 yards, and scored 11 touchdowns. Linebacker Mike Singletary won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award by recording three sacks, three fumble recoveries, and one interception.|$|R
50|$|Being a {{conservative}} sweeper with no urge {{to join the}} attack of his teams, Schulz focused on marshalling his defense. He was noted for his calmness even under pressure, his positional play, his strength at man-to-man duels, his <b>solid</b> <b>passing</b> game, aerial ability and a special expertise at sliding tackling. For these traits {{as well as his}} consistency at the top level, Schulz was revered by West German national team coach Helmut Schön, who preferred Schulz at the sweeper position to the younger and more adventurous Franz Beckenbauer, who had to play in midfield instead.|$|R
50|$|Murray enjoyed {{excellent}} success {{during his}} redshirt junior {{season at the}} University of Georgia as the Bulldogs finished at 12-2 and as SEC Eastern Division Champions. He had a victory in a bowl game with his win over Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl. Numbers wise, it was Murray's best season by far as he completed 249-of-386 passes for 3,893 yards with 36 touchdowns, 10 interceptions, and a <b>solid</b> <b>pass</b> efficiency rating of 174.82. He also set individual career records. Against Kentucky (October 20, 2012), Murray's 73rd career TD gave him the UGA record, breaking David Greene's record set from 2001-04. And then against Alabama in the 2012 SEC Championship Game, he broke Peyton Manning's career touchdown record which was 89. Murray now has 95 touchdown passes for his career at UGA.|$|E
5000|$|DeShawn Shead, at 6 ft 2 in, 220 lb, {{signed with}} the Seahawks as an undrafted rookie free-agent in 2012. Shead, a collegiate Decathlon star, is a special-teams {{standout}} who excelled as the team's 'Swiss-Army Knife' multipurpose defensive back, and became the starter at right cornerback, opposite Sherman. He is a fast-and-physical player with elite body control, who displays his prowess intuitively as a quick and reliable tackler against the run, and as a <b>solid</b> <b>pass</b> defender with excellent speed downfield. Shead demonstrates uncanny athleticism, and {{has a knack for}} stripping the ball and forcing fumbles. When utilized as an additional weak-side 'bandit/hybrid' safety, or as a 'big nickel' defensive back, Shead matches up effectively against taller, larger and more physical receivers and tight ends. During the 2015 season, Shead started games at five different positions, designated as the primary backup at free- and strong-safety positions, both outside cornerback positions, and inside at nickelback, and ultimately earned the starting job at right cornerback. From 2012-present, in the regular season, DeShawn Shead has produced 132 tackles, 21 passes defensed, 1 sack, 2 interceptions, and 3 forced fumbles.|$|E
5000|$|Penn State {{entered the}} game relying on its rush defense, {{the best in}} the NCAA, to stop Northwestern's rushing attack, which was the key to its offense. Northwestern's offense, {{although}} led by a [...] "sharp, effective quarterback" [...] in Trevor Siemian, was without many playmakers, as star running back Venric Mark transferred in the offseason, and multiple wide receivers were injured. As such, Penn State ostensibly had the edge when Northwestern possessed the football. Offensively for Penn State, Christian Hackenberg sought to bounce back after an inconsistent performance against Massachusetts. However, Northwestern had a <b>solid</b> <b>pass</b> rush and looked to pressure Hackenberg. Penn State also planned to continue working on their rushing attack. York Daily Record columnist Frank Bodani predicted that Northwestern would utilize a [...] "bend-but-don't-break approach" [...] to avoid relinquishing big plays. Panelists from ESPN's Big Ten Blog unanimously selected the Lions to defeat the Wildcats, as did the panelists from Big Ten Network. Because of homecoming, Penn State took their names off their jerseys to pay homage to a long-standing Penn State tradition. Nyeem Wartman, Penn State's starting outside linebacker, had his arm in a sling before the game and did not dress for the game. There was no indication prior to the game that he was injured.|$|E
50|$|By {{relating}} equation 3 to equation 1, {{the relationship}} of the centrifugal force is shown to be proportional to the filtration rate. As pushers often deal with fragile crystals, the movement of the pusher plate and acceleration in the feed funnel matter, because they can break some of the particles. In addition to the movement plate, G can cause breakage and compaction, and volatile matter in the cake increases. The gentle movement of cake in low G, single stage, long basket designs results in low particle attrition. As more <b>solids</b> <b>pass</b> through, residence time decreases, which increases volatile matter in the discharge cake.|$|R

40|$|This study situates itself amongst {{research}} into spoken English grammars, learner success {{and descriptions of}} linguistic progression within the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001). It follows previous corpus research which has sought to document the language required by learners {{if they are to}} progress through levels and ultimately ‘succeed’ when operating in English. In the field of language testing, for which the CEFR has been a valuable tool, qualitative descriptions of learner competence and abilities may not provide sufficient detail for students, assessors and test designers alike to know which language is required and used by learners at different levels. This particular study therefore aims to identify the language and abilities demonstrated by successful C 1 candidates taking the University of Central Lancashire’s English Speaking Board [UCLanESB] speaking exams. Using a learner corpus of C 1 exam performance (26, 620 words), examinations of vocabulary profiles, word frequencies, keywords, lexical chunks and can-do occurrence were conducted to identify the lexico-grammar required for C 1 students to obtain <b>solid</b> <b>pass</b> scores. It was found that vocabulary belonged largely to the first two thousand most frequent words in English, lexis and chunks displayed some parallels with native-speakers, and language relating to can-do occurrence performed a more productive than interactive or strategic purpose...|$|E

50|$|In 1885 Hancock {{was elected}} as captain of Cardiff, and he revolutionised {{the way the}} team played.

Traditionally the forwards in a rugby side would retain the ball, engaging in prolonged scrums and mauls. Hancock encouraged his forwards to release {{the ball to the}} half-backs, and they in turn would neither run nor kick the ball away, but would move the ball out to the centres. The centres job was, through low accurate passing to, transfer the ball to the wings who should take the ball on the run. <b>Solid</b> <b>passing</b> was primary in Hancock's vision of winning through scoring tries. In the 1885/86 season Cardiff scored a remarkable 131 tries but not a single penalty or drop goal. It is said that Hancock aggressively shouted down one of this team who attempted a drop goal during a game. Hancock was single minded and dictatorial in his approach as a captain, but his tactics were extremely successful, winning all bar one game and seeing just four tries scored against them.|$|R
40|$|The {{tribology}} of {{a bubble}} rubbing on a solid surface is studied via interferometry. A unique experimental setup {{is designed for}} monitoring the thickness profiles of a wetting film, intercalated between the bubble and hydrophilic glass moving with speed up to 412 um/s. The determination of the 3 D film thickness profiles allows us to calculate 3 D maps over the wetted surface of the local capillary, disjoining and lift pressures, viscous stress and friction force. In this way the average friction force and the corresponding friction coefficient are obtained. A theoretical model for the dependence of the friction coefficient on the film thickness is developed. The relevant slip coefficient, being a measure for the slip between liquid and solid, is determined {{as a function of}} the speed of the solid surface. It is found out that below 170 um/s a friction regime exists which formally resembles dry friction, while at larger speed the friction force between the bubble and <b>solid</b> <b>passes</b> through a maximum. Furthermore, the friction coefficient has a large value at low speed of the solid and reduces substantially with the speed increase...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of management of the chemical?physical pretreatment step in a platform for the treatment of liquid wastes. The aim of the work was to optimize the organization of the flow scheme to achieve the best performances in the chemical?physical pretreatment step. Starting from the initial situation (Jan?Apr 1997), the types, amounts, and characteristics of the wastewater and the treatment methodologies were critically discussed. The process management was subsequently (Jul?Aug 1997) modified in order {{to take advantage of the}} synergic power among the different liquid wastes to reduce the use of strong oxidative treatments (i. e., the Fenton process) which determined, during the first research period, a large increase of the total dissolved solids and salinity in the effluent, without meaningful chemical oxygen demand reductions. Moreover, the N?NH 4 removal was performed by struvite precipitation, using phosphate-rich wastewater or pure chemicals. A good indicator of the reliability of the new flow scheme was the salinity reductiona loss of 2800 mg/Lduring the first 2 months. A larger reduction was obtained after a further 3 months (total dissolved <b>solids</b> <b>passed</b> from 17000 to 5000 mg/L).

30|$|The nanocrystalline MFI {{prepared}} {{in the absence}} of sepiolite could not be filtered, as all the <b>solid</b> <b>passed</b> the filter, and had to be recovered by centrifugation, as noted in the experimental section. Washing this zeolite also required successive centrifugation steps. By contrast, the solids that contained sepiolite could be recovered by filtration although with different levels of efficiency, as shown in Table  1. For the experiment with the smallest sepiolite content, 0.37  %, a whitish filtrate suggested some zeolite product still passed the filter and the amount of solids recovered was roughly half of the amount recovered in the experiments with the highest sepiolite content. Interestingly, increasing the sepiolite content in the synthesis mixture to 1.11  % yielded a more transparent filtrate, although still slightly whitish, and allowed to recover almost the maximum amount of zeolite, actually more than obtained by centrifugation in the sepiolite-free experiment. For higher sepiolite contents, a transparent and colorless filtrate with maximum solid yield revealed the complete retention of the zeolite product in the filter. The yield of zeolite recovered increased from 35 (nMFIsep 1) up to 83  g of zeolite per 100  g of SiO 2 (nMFIsep 3 and nMFIsep 4), surpassing the 61 % obtained by centrifugation of the sepiolite-free synthesis.|$|R
40|$|International audienceChondrules are millimeter-sized {{silicate}} spherules {{ubiquitous in}} primitive meteorites, but whose origin remainsmysterious. One {{of the main}} proposed mechanisms for producing them is melting of solids in shock waves inthe gaseous protoplanetary disk. However, evidence is mounting that chondrule-forming regions were enrichedin solids well above solar abundances. Given the high velocities involved in shock models, destructive collisionswould be expected between differently sized grains after passage of the shock front {{as a result of}} differential drag. We investigate the probability and outcome of collisions of particles behind a one-dimensional shock using analyticmethods as well as a full integration of the coupled mass, momentum, energy, and radiation equations. Destructionof protochondrules seems unavoidable for solid/gas ratios 0. 1, and possibly even for solar abundancesbecause of “sandblasting” by finer dust. A flow with 10 requires much smaller shock velocities (∼ 2 versus 8 km s− 1) in order to achieve chondrule-melting temperatures, and radiation trapping allows slow cooling of theshocked fragments. Initial destruction would still be extensive; although re-assembly of millimeter-sized particleswould naturally occur by grain sticking afterward, the compositional heterogeneity of chondrules may be difficultto reproduce.

The degree of transformation was varied via the ratio of CTAOH solution to initial silica gel rather than synthesis duration. The transformed samples were characterized by N 2 sorption at 77 K, mercury intrusion porosimetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
