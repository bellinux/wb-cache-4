40|$|Abstract The brand-new {{small output}} <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> which is over than 800 MHz has an {{all-in-one}} interior antenna. We suggested new measuring method and developed related <b>equipment</b> because all-in-one <b>radio</b> <b>equipment's</b> performance evaluation requests old way, which is measuring transmitter output and antenna capacity separately, to be changed. That is, origin of small <b>radio</b> <b>equipments</b> with the 360 degree field measured {{by measuring the}} TRP, and also 360 degree opposite reception level measured at the <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> by measuring the TIS to make a quantitative evaluation was to be. Furthermore, we made managing frequencies, all-in-one <b>radio</b> <b>equipment's</b> best design and capacity management efficiently by measuring the gain of an antenna mounted on a PCB, the circuit around the genetic material, conductive material {{on the effects of}} radiation or the reception level...|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} systems, manufacturers {{stopped making}} cross band mobile <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> with acceptable specifications for public safety {{systems in the}} early 1980s. At the time, some systems were dismantled because new <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> was not available.|$|R
50|$|As <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> {{became more}} powerful, compact, {{and easier to}} use, smaller {{vehicles}} had two-way <b>radio</b> communication <b>equipment</b> installed. Installation of <b>radio</b> <b>equipment</b> in aircraft allowed scouts to report back observations in real-time, not requiring the pilot to drop messages to {{troops on the ground}} below or to land and make a personal report.|$|R
