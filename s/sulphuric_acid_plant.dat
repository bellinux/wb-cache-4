Main drivers to execute revamp project will be discussed: e. g. changing environmental requirements, increased demand for acid production, increased demand for energy production as byproduct or changes in production profile. Other aspects might target lower operating costs, better availability or longer operating periods between shutdowns. Finally, worn-out equipment must be replaced and decision must be taken either to go like-for-like or to use the chance to combine the replacement with an upgrade to more developed solutions. The paper will also cover the various aspects and influencing factors, which contribute to the decision making in a revamp project. Such aspects might be budget or schedule restrictions as well as restricted resources for labour and material at site during {{the execution of the}} project. OUTOTEC will present its portfolio of possible services covering engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning as well as operating and maintenance support, spare parts business or operator training. Depending on the project setup the split of scope and responsibilities has to be carefully chosen and agreed between the involved parties to obtain the optimum result.

The industries {{that have been}} investigated include power and/or heat generation, energy-from-waste generation, nuclear power generation, <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> production, ethylene production, petrochemical production, and waste incineration. The study investigated multiple facilities worldwide {{for each of these}} industrial categories. The different potential contaminants characteristic of each industry type have been investigated and the emissions of these contaminants under non-steady state have been compared to the steady state emissions. Where available, trends have been developed to identify the circumstances, i. e., the industrial sector and contaminant, under which the assessment and consideration of emissions from start-up and shut-down events is necessary for each industry. These trends differ by industrial sector and contaminant. For example, the study shows that sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions should be assessed for the start-up operations of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> production <b>plants,</b> but may not need to be assessed for the start-up operations of a conventional power generation facility. The trends developed as part of this research paper will help air permit applicants to effectively allocate their resources when assessing emissions related to non-steady state operations. Additionally, it will ensure that emissions are assessed for the worst-case scenario. This is especially important when emissions under start-up and shut-down operations have the potential to exceed enforceable emission limits. Thus, assessing emissions for the worst-case scenario can help in preventing the emissions from adversely impacting public health and the environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} between exposure to As 2 O 3 fumes and dust, and the urinary excretion of inorganic arsenic metabolites (monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, unchanged inorganic arsenic) {{has been studied}} in 18 workers from a <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> producing <b>plant.</b> The concentration of arsenic in the breathing zone of each worker was measured during five consecutive days and urine samples were obtained after one shift and before the next. The collection efficiency of the air sampling system exceeded 95 %. The time weighted average exposure (TWA) concentrations of As 2 O 3 ranged from 6 to 502 micrograms As/m 3 and were log normally distributed. Although exposure probably occurred by ingestion as well as inhalation, statistically significant correlations (log scales) were found between airborne TWA of As 2 O 3 and the inorganic arsenic metabolites in urine collected immediately after the shift, or just before the next shift. For a TWA of 50 micrograms As/m 3, the mean concentration of {{the sum of the}} three inorganic arsenic metabolites in a postshift urine sample amounted to about 55 micrograms arsenic/g creatinine (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 47 - 62). Higher estimates of urinary arsenic reported by other authors are probably due either to the influence of dietary organoarsenicals when total arsenic is measured in urine or to a low retention efficiency of the air sampling system for As 2 O 3 in the vapour phase...|$|R

Precise determination of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration is crucial factor for prediction of nucleation rates and subsequent growth. In our study, we have noticed a substantial discrepancy between <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> monomer and total sulphate concentrations measured from the same source of <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> vapour. The discrepancy of about one to two orders of magnitude was found with similar formation rates.

Sulphuric acid-water nucleation experiment was done using a laminar flow tube.
