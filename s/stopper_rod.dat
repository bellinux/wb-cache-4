5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{spray forming}} work {{was based on}} a resistively heated electric holding furnace. The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in spray forming applications were bottom pour induction units, which offer many benefits. In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the atomiser head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the atomiser. A <b>stopper</b> <b>rod</b> runs through the melt {{to the top of the}} pouring nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to drain through the nozzle. Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|E

40|$|A device using {{electromagnetics}} {{offers many}} advantages for better {{control of the}} flow of molten steel. The device avoids the need for highfrequency currents, has relatively simple magnetic requirements, and could have a very compact magnetic structure. Iron Flux Return Conventional flow control devices include metering nozzles, <b>stopper</b> <b>rods.</b> and slide gates. These devices all suffer from operational problems. Electromagnetic flow control has also been successfully used in industrial metal pouring, most notably in using an electromagnetic mold for ingot casting of aluminum. However, this approach has significant problems with flow control in continuous casting of steel.

40|$|A furnace {{has been}} built {{for the purpose of}} {{producing}} anisotropic porous metals through solid-gas eutectic solidification. This process allows control of continuously formed anisotropic pores in metals and was discovered at the State Metallurgical Academic' University in Dnepropetrovsk Ukraine. The process incorporates hydrogen gas within the metal as it solidifies from the molten state. Metals which do not form hydrides, including iron, nickel, aluminum, copper and others can be formed in this manner. The furnace is housed within a ~. 64 meter&sup 3; (30 ft&sup 3;) ASME code stamped cylindrical stainless steel vacuum/pressure vessel. The vessel is a water chilled vertical cylinder with removable covers at the top and bottom. It can be evacuated to 20 mTorr or pressurized to 5. 5 MPa (800 psi). A charge of 2700 cc (167 in&sup 3;) of molten metal can be melted in a crucible in the upper portion within a watercooled 30 cm (12 in.) ID induction coil. A 175 kW Inductotherm power source energizes the coil. Vertical actuation of a ceramic <b>stopper</b> <b>rod</b> allows the molten metal to be tapped into a solidification mold beneath the melting crucible. The cylindrical mold rests on a water cooled copper base inducing directional solidification from the bottom. Mixtures of hydrogen and argon gases are introduced during the process. The system is remotely controlled and located in a structure with frangible walls specially designed for possible ambient pressure excursions as a result of equipment failure. This paper includes a general description of the furnace and operating procedure and {{a detailed description of the}} control, monitoring and interlock systems...|$|E
40|$|Continuous casting is the {{dominating}} {{process to}} cast steel. Liquid steel is continuously fed from a tundish {{to a mould}} through a casting nozzle. The flow conditions in the mould {{are influenced by the}} flow pattern inside the casting nozzle as well as the level of steel in the tundish. The flow into the mould is regulated by a <b>stopper</b> <b>rod</b> or a slide gate. The surface of the strand solidifies quickly in the mould and it is important to maintain a constant level of steel to avoid surface defects. A new physical model that simulates continuous casting has been developed. A physical model of this type is unique. The scale of the model is a commonly used full-scale casting machine at slab casters, except the dimension of the tundish. It is possible to generate different types of flow conditions at simulation in the model. Water and liquid steel has similar kinematic viscosity and water is therefore often used for simulation of the continuous casting process. This simulation has been performed using an alloy with a low melting point. The alloy has besides the low melting point, similar physical properties as steel. Measurements with a compact laser vibrometer have been performed to examine the possibility to quantify the volumetric flow of alloy in the model. The compact laser vibrometer measures the vibrations {{on the surface of the}} casting nozzle as the alloy flows through during simulation. The flow of alloy in the model is determined by the velocity of the pump. A calibration of the pump was done to specify the volumetric flow at a specific pumping velocity. This provides the possibility to examine the signal from the sensor during controlled circumstances. The investigation was performed during simulation at specific single phase flows. It was found that the compact laser vibrometer shows a trend of increasing frequency at higher flow rates. A background noise was created by the engine of the pump and measurements were done to be able to exclude this type of disturbance. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} {{model of a}} ten-strand billet caster tundish was established to {{study the effects of}} various flow control devices on the melt flow. Before and after the optimization of the melt flow, the inclusion removal in the tundish was evaluated by plant trials. The {{physical model}}ing results show that when combined with a baffle, the turbulence inhibitor, instead of the impact pad, can significantly improve the melt flow. A turbulence inhibitor with a longer length of inner cavity and without an extending lip {{at the top of the}} sidewall seems to be efficient in the improvement of the melt flow. Various types and designs of baffles all influence the flow characteristics significantly. The “V” type baffles are better than the straight baffles for flow control. The “V” type baffle with four inclined holes at the sidewall away from the <b>stopper</b> <b>rods</b> is better in melt flow control than the one with one inclined hole at each sidewall. The combination of a well-designed turbulence inhibitor and an appropriate baffle shows high efficiency on improving the melt flow and an optimal proposal was presented. Plant trials indicate that, compared with the original tundish configuration in prototype, the inclusions reduce by 42 % and the inclusion distribution of individual strands is more similar with the optimal one. The optimal tundish configuration effectively improves the melt flow in the ten-strand billet caster tundish...|$|R

40|$|Employed {{either in}} metal holding ladles/ tundishes, <b>stopper</b> <b>rods,</b> or metal {{delivery}} shrouds/ nozzles; the service life of refractory bodies {{plays an important}} role in the commercial feasibility of continuous casting of steel. A suitable selection of oxide–graphite refractory material for a specific application is usually based on the fundamental understanding of its high temperature corrosion behaviour. Slag attack is particularly important. The structural strength of refractory may be critically reduced by the solvent action of liquid slags. Typically, in the conventional method of the continuous casting of liquid steel whether refining slags in the metal holding ladle, or casting powder in mould – they are almost always composed of high basic oxide constituent (CaO) concentration. Therefore, corrosion studies having CaO as one of the constituent oxides, has been the subject of many research work. However, with the advent of modern near–net–shape continuous casting of steel not only thin walled refractory bodies are being employed but role and composition of meniscus slags has also changed making the control of corrosion a big challenge. The lack of available information on the corrosive action of the menisci slags of the modern continuous casting of steel, which are usually composed of high MnO and SiO 2 contents (having no or very little concentration of CaO), on the refractory bodies needs to be thoroughly studied. In general, uncertainties also exist regarding the fraction of graphite content in the refractory mix because an increase of the graphite content of refractory does not always minimize corrosion process. An experimental study, using static corrosion test, was conducted at the usual steel casting temperature (1550 C) to develop a fundamental understanding by comparing the transient progresses of corrosion reactions of several commonly available oxide–graphite refractory in their interaction with menisci slags that are generated during the near–net–shape casting of liquid steel. Factors such as the presence of solid fractions and the low wetting characteristic of molten slag phase seems to promote the entrapment of gas bubbles at the vi interface, which was found to favourably impact the corrosion resistance property of refractory by minimizing its contact with the corrosive slag phase. MgO–graphite refractories showed higher resistance to the corrosive actions of both the menisci slags due to the formation of two inhibitive layers: a thin layer of dense MgO and Olivine phase. It has also been found that the corrosion performance of some oxide–graphite refractory completely changes with the change of meniscus slag composition. Exhibiting different corrosion behaviours against the two menisci slags, refractories composed of (Y–PSZ) ZrO 2 as oxide aggregate phase while performed poorly in interaction with ternary meniscus slag, a satisfactory corrosion performance of the refractory was noted when it interacted with binary meniscus slag composition. Examining the effect of graphite content on the corrosion performances of refractories by ternary meniscus slag (MnO–SIO 2 –Al 2 O 3), we found that while an inverse relationship existed for Al 2 O 3 –graphite refractory, the corrosion performance of MgO–graphite refractory improved when these were composed of higher graphite contents...|$|R
