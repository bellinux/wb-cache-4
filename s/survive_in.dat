Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to <b>survive</b> <b>in</b> water at low salt concentrations, {{but these are not}} reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E

The books end with an alliance of the freedom-loving states defeating the evil regime states and peace returning to the Earth.|$|R
