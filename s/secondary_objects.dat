If the desires are low placed, if they extend to little beyond physical comfort, and the show of riches, the immediate results of the energy will not be much more than the continual extension of man's power over material objects; but even this makes room, and prepares the mechanical appliances for the greatest intellectual and social achievements; and while the energy is there, some persons will apply it, and it will be applied more and more, to the perfecting, not of outward circumstances alone, but of man's inward nature. Inactivity, unaspiringness, absence of desire, are a more fatal hindrance to improvement than any misdirection of energy, and is that through which alone, when existing in the mass, any very formidable misdirection by an energetic few becomes possible. It is this, mainly, which retains in a savage or semi-savage state the great majority of the human race.|$|E

60|$|It is singular, and, indeed, a thing, {{under all}} its circumstances, inconceivable, that {{everything}} should by the Emperor be abandoned {{to the king}} of Prussia. That monarch was considered as principal. In the nature of things, {{as well as in}} his position with regard to the war, he was only an ally, and a new ally, with crossing interests in many particulars, and of a policy rather uncertain. At best, and supposing him to act with the greatest fidelity, the Emperor and the Empire to him must be but <b>secondary</b> <b>objects.</b> Countries out of Germany must affect him in a still more remote manner. France, other than from the fear of its doctrinal principles, can to him be no object at all. Accordingly, the Rhine, Sardinia, and the Swiss are left to their fate. The king of Prussia has no direct and immediate concern with France; consequentially, to be sure, a great deal: but the Emperor touches France directly in many parts; he is a near neighbor to Sardinia, by his Milanese territories; he borders on Switzerland; Cologne, possessed by his uncle, is between Mentz, Treves, and the king of Prussia's territories on the Lower Rhine. The Emperor is the natural guardian of Italy and Germany,--the natural balance against the ambition of France, whether republican or monarchical. His ministers and his generals, therefore, ought to have had their full share in every material consultation,--which I suspect they had not. If he has no minister capable of plans of policy which comprehend the superintendency of a war, or no general with the least of a political head, things have been as they must be. However, in all the parts of this strange proceeding there must be a secret.|$|E

6000|$|But if one, {{by refusing}} to offer a pinch of incense to the elder gods, should thus strip himself of a marked {{opportunity}} of exerting an undoubtedly useful influence over public opinion, or over a certain section of society, is he not justified in compromising {{to the extent necessary}} to preserve this influence? Instead of answering this directly, we would make the following remarks. First, it can seldom be clear in times like our own that religious heterodoxy must involve the loss of influence in other than religious spheres. The apprehension that it will do so is due rather to timorousness and a desire to find a fair reason for the comforts of silence and reserve. If a teacher has anything to tell the world in science, philosophy, history, the world will not be deterred from listening to him by knowing that he does not walk in the paths of conventional theology. Second, what influence can a man exert, that should seem to him more useful than that of a protester against what he counts false opinions, in the most decisive and important of all regions of thought? Surely if any one is persuaded, whether rightly or wrongly, that his fellows are expending the best part of their imaginations and feelings on a dream and a delusion, and that by so doing moreover they are retarding to an indefinite degree the wider spread of light and happiness, then nothing that he can tell them about chemistry or psychology or history can in his eyes be comparable in importance to the duty of telling them this. There is no advantage nor honest delight in influence, if it is only to be exerted in the sphere of <b>secondary</b> <b>objects,</b> and at the cost of the objects which ought to be foremost in the eyes of serious people. In truth the men who have done most for the world have taken very little heed of influence. They have sought light, and left their influence to fare as it might list. Can we not imagine the mingled mystification and disdain with which a Spinosa or a Descartes, a Luther or a Pascal, would have listened to an exhortation in our persuasive modern manner on the niceties of the politic and the social obligation of pious fraud? It is not given to many to perform the achievements of such giants as these, but every one may help to keep the standard of intellectual honesty at a lofty pitch, and what better service can a man render than to furnish the world with an example of faithful dealing with his own conscience and with his fellows? This at least is the one talent that is placed {{in the hands of the}} obscurest of us all.[26] ...|$|E

40|$|Nanoscientists {{have long}} conjectured that {{adjacent}} nanoparticles aggregate {{with one another}} in certain preferential directions during a chemical synthesis of nanoparticles, which is referred to the oriented attachment. For the study of the oriented attachment, the microscopy and nanoscience communities have used dynamic electron microscopy for direct observations of nanoparticle aggregation and have been so far relying on manual and qualitative analysis of the observations. We propose a statistical approach for studying the oriented attachment quantitatively with multiple aggregation examples in imagery observations. We abstract an aggregation by an event of two primary geometric objects merging into a <b>secondary</b> geometric <b>object.</b> We use a point set representation to describe the geometric features of the primary <b>objects</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>object,</b> and formulated the alignment of two point sets to one point set to estimate the orientation angles of the primary <b>objects</b> in the <b>secondary</b> <b>object.</b> The estimated angles are used as data to estimate the probability distribution of the orientation angles and test important hypotheses statistically. The proposed approach was applied for our motivating example, which demonstrated that nanoparticles of certain geometries have indeed preferential orientations in their aggregates.
