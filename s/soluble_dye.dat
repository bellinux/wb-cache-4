40|$|Abstract Background Fatty {{infiltration}} of the skeletal muscle {{is a common}} but poorly understood feature of many myopathies. It is best described in human muscle, where non-invasive imaging techniques and representative histology have been optimized to view and quantify infiltrating fat. However, human studies are limited {{in their ability to}} identify cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating fatty infiltration, a likely prerequisite to developing targeted interventions. As mechanistic investigations move to small animals, studies may benefit from new or adapted imaging tools optimized for high resolution and whole muscle quantification. Results Here, we describe a novel method to evaluate fatty infiltration, developed for use with mouse muscle. In this methodology, muscle cellular membranes and proteins are removed via decellularization, but fatty infiltrate lipid is spared, trapped in its native distribution in a transparent extracellular matrix construct. This lipid can then be stained with visible or fluorescent dyes and imaged. We present three methods to stain and evaluate lipid in decellularized muscles which can be used individually or combined: (1) qualitative visualization of the amount and 3 D spatial distribution of fatty infiltration using visible lipid <b>soluble</b> <b>dye</b> Oil Red O (ORO), (2) quantitative analysis of individual lipid droplet metrics (e. g., volume) via confocal imaging of fluorescent lipid <b>soluble</b> <b>dye</b> boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY), and (3) quantitative analysis of total lipid content by optical density reading of extracted stained lipid. This methodology was validated by comparing glycerol-induced fatty infiltration between two commonly used mouse strains: 129 S 1 /SvlmJ (129 S 1) and C 57 BL/ 6 J (BL/ 6 J). All three methods were able to detect a significant increase in fatty infiltrate volume in the 129 S 1 muscle compared with that in BL/ 6 J, and methods 1 and 2 additionally described a difference in the distribution of fatty infiltrate, indicating susceptibility to glycerol-induced fatty infiltration is strain-specific. Conclusions With more mechanistic studies of fatty infiltration moving to small animal models, having an alternative to expensive non-invasive imaging techniques and selective representative histology will be beneficial. In this work, we present a method that can quantify both individual adipocyte lipids and whole muscle total fatty infiltrate lipid...|$|E
