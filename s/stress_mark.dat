500|$|A <b>stress</b> <b>mark</b> {{typically}} appears before the stressed syllable, and thus marks the syllable break {{as well as}} stress.

2500|$|Russian. Acute accents (technically, stress marks) {{are used}} in {{dictionaries}} to indicate the stressed syllable. They may also be optionally used to disambiguate both between minimal pairs, such as [...] за́мок (read as zámak, means [...] "castle") and замо́к (read as zamók, means [...] "lock"), and between question words and relative pronouns such as что ("what", stressed, or [...] "that", unstressed), similarly to Spanish. This is rare, however, as usually meaning is determined by context and no <b>stress</b> <b>mark</b> is written. The same rules apply to Ukrainian, Rusyn, Belarusian and Bulgarian.|$|E

40|$|Octopus vulgaris is {{a viable}} {{candidate}} for commercial aquaculture, but rearing procedures might stress individuals and result in diminished growth and survival. This study investigated the relationship between possible stress sources (tank transposition and syphoning) when rearing O.  vulgaris paralarvae and the deposition pattern of growth increments in their beak microstructure. Light intensity at the facility was heterogeneous, and accounted for with an experimental design consisting of blocks without replicates. Growth and survival were estimated and possible effects of handling were tested for both parameters. Increments and <b>stress</b> <b>marks</b> were counted in 120 paralarval upper jaws (UJ), {{and the number of}} UJs with a mark on the day of stress application (day 8) was quantified. Differences in light intensity, diet quantity and total number of marks in the UJ were also compared between treatments. Growth and survival were statistically similar between treatments, although the control treatment showed a tendency for higher survival rates. Age at first increment deposition coincided with day 1 of experiment, and a 1  increment day - 1 deposition rate was validated for the experiment duration. The number of <b>stress</b> <b>marks</b> was significantly different between the control and other treatments, indicating that handling might cause <b>stress</b> and that <b>marks</b> {{can be used as a}} biomarker for stress, although the occurrence of <b>stress</b> <b>marks</b> on day 8 was not significantly different. Light intensity and diet might have also been relevant stressors and confounded the results. The results herein presented are important for improving rearing conditions for O.  vulgaris paralarvae...|$|R
50|$|In the {{descendants}} of Serbo-Croatian and in Slovene, the stressed syllable can be short or long and have a rising or falling tone. They use (in dictionaries, orthography, and grammar books, for example) four different <b>stress</b> <b>marks</b> (grave, acute, double grave, and inverted breve). The system is identical both in Latin and Cyrillic scripts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stress</b> <b>marks</b> are {{optional}} in East Slavic languages.
