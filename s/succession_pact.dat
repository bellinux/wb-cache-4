5000|$|Accordingly, both cousins {{instead of}} being allies, became rivals with {{conflicting}} interests; the <b>succession</b> <b>pact</b> went up in smoke and, henceforth, each would try to garner the favor of King Alfonso VI. In 1097, there was a fourth Almoravid invasion. Alfonso received the news {{when he was on}} his way to Zaragoza to assist his vassal Al-Mustain II in his confrontation with King Peter I of Aragon and Navarre. Once again, the Almoravid's objective was Toledo. [...] The Christian troops were again defeated by the Almoravid army at the Battle of Consuegra on 15 August, thus confirming the period of decadence of the reign of Alfonso VI that had already begun in 1086 with the defeat in Sagrajas.|$|E
40|$|The pactum successorium : stepchild of South African law South African {{law does}} not {{generally}} permit a testator to bequeath his estate by means of contract. This rule flows from the general rule in Roman Law that an estate must devolve either by will or {{in terms of the}} law governing intestate succession. Despite the prohibition against <b>succession</b> <b>pacts</b> there have been numerous attempts by contracting parties to regulate devolution of their estates inter vivos by means of contract. Such contracts are commonly called pacta successoria and have been regarded as contra bonos mores and invalid since early law. Although a number of reasons have been put forward for the maintaining of the prohibition against pacta successoria, the main reason for the aversion against the pactum successorium is the fact that they interfere with the testator’s freedom of testation. It is suggested that the existing law in South Africa with regard to the pactum successorium should be changed. This calls for a reappraisal of the principle of freedom of testation. It is clear that South African law takes this principle much further than is the case in other legal systems such as in England and Germany. Furthermore, the South African devotion to the principle of freedom of testation appears strange in view of the obvious conflict with the principle of freedom of contract. Finally, it is suggested that the common law prohibition against the pactum successorium should be abolished. Since {{it is clear from the}} attitude of the courts so far, this can only be effected by legislature. </p...|$|R

No {{offspring}} of his two marriages survived childhood; the only issue he left was a bastard son by Sicilian-born Tarsia Rizzari, Fadrique of Aragon, Count of Luna and Ejerica and Lord of Segorbe, born in 1400/1403, whom Martin II tried to make his successor in the Aragonese Empire. But the effort failed, and Fadrique was denied the <b>succession</b> by the <b>Pact</b> of Caspe. Fadrique married Yolande Louise (Violante Luisa) de Mur and died at Urena in 1438 without issue.|$|R
