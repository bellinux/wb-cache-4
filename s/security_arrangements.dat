The local {{military}} commander, General Michael von Appel, {{proposed that}} troops line the intended route but {{was told that}} this would offend the loyal citizenry.

5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European <b>security</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In the 1930s France started to fear the rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007 someone {{claiming}} to be an al-Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and his disciples either to accept Islam or {{to be prepared to}} die. Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that this letter had been sent from Haridwar, that Rambhadracharya's <b>security</b> <b>arrangements</b> had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out. Gita Devi, secretary of JRHU, said that Rambhadracharya had been threatened by al-Qaeda, as Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Nrityagopal had been in the past.|$|E

50|$|A {{status of}} forces {{agreement}} (SOFA) is an agreement between a host country and a foreign nation stationing military forces in that country. SOFAs are often included, along {{with other types of}} military agreements, as part of a comprehensive <b>security</b> <b>arrangement.</b> A SOFA does not constitute a security arrangement; it establishes the rights and privileges of foreign personnel present in a host country in support of the larger <b>security</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Under international law a {{status of forces}} agreement differs from military occupation.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review <b>security</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive <b>security</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The Protective Security Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney-General's Department, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a Senate committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $170million.|$|E
5|$|This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who {{had worked in the}} Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but {{the first of a series}} of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British <b>security</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.|$|E

5|$|Demonstrations {{were planned}} to take place during the show. A protest rally by Unite Against Fascism (UAF) had been held in London {{on the night of}} Tuesday 20 October, and sixteen coachloads of UAF protesters were {{expected}} on the day. Amid concern over the safety of residents, Hammersmith and Fulham council asked for clarification of the BBC's <b>security</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and pushed for an alternative location. Although the protest organisers UAF rejected suggestions that the protests would be violent, security was stepped up at BBC Television Centre. Simon Darby of the BNP stated there would be no counter-demonstration. Griffin expressed fears over his safety for his arrival and departure. Extra officers of the Metropolitan Police were drafted in to maintain order outside the studios, while the BBC recruited an extra 60 security guards for inside the studio.|$|E
5|$|Despite Australia's greater {{representation}} in London after 1923, Bruce's hope for collective imperial decision-making was dashed once {{more with the}} British decision to recognise the Soviet Union in 1924. This act dismayed the fervently anti-communist Bruce, who disagreed with the decision ideologically and {{on the grounds that}} once again the dominions had not been consulted. Ultimately, though, the differences between Britain's and her dominions' opinions on the matter were too great to be reconciled. Instead, Britain signed the General Treaty with the Soviet Union only on her own behalf, marking the first major split between Britain and Australia on a matter of foreign policy. Despite its applicability solely to European <b>security</b> <b>arrangements,</b> Bruce had criticised Britain's signing of the Locarno Treaties in 1925 without dominion consultation; though the eventual treaty was not binding on the dominions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Cold War, Australian defence {{planning}} assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective <b>security</b> <b>arrangements</b> as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they were expected to operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and RAN.|$|E

5|$|Following the battalion's {{return from}} East Timor {{it was again}} {{restructured}} to resume {{its role as a}} two-company commando battalion. However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG {{to be based on the}} east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed. Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the <b>security</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November.|$|E
5|$|The second {{schedule}} commenced in Manali in late March 2014, after Chopra {{finished her}} other film commitments. Before filming, Chopra had to re-train herself to build muscles. Bhansali planned an elaborate schedule for her, which {{would ensure that}} her physicality and agility were suitable enough for the role. While filming a sequence in a marketplace, more than ten thousand people gathered on the sets. Due to limited <b>security</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the crowds became uncontrollable in what was not {{believed to be a}} heavily populated area. When Chopra stepped out of her van, some fans tried to approach her, causing the general loss of control. As a result, the shoot was cancelled and the whole crew had to leave. Filming in Manali continued till early April 2014, before shifting to Dharamsala. While filming fight sequence in Dharamsala, Chopra suffered an eye injury, which the makeup team exaggerated for effect. The filming in Dharamsala continued till 19 April 2014. Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara used a hand-held camera during the shooting of the film. The filming was done in 57 days over the course of two years.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make <b>security</b> <b>arrangements.</b> And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
