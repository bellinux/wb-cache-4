50|$|The St.-Carolus Borromeuskerk is {{a church}} in Antwerp, located on Hendrik Conscience square (nl). The church was {{formerly}} known for 39 <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces</b> by Rubens that were lost in a fire when it was struck by lightning on 18 July 1718.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located under Roztylská Street {{in the southwestern}} part of the Chodov district. It is a shallow sub-surface station with a <b>straight</b> <b>ceiling</b> and an island {{platform}} 10 m below ground level. Centrum Chodov, the largest shopping centre in the Czech Republic, was built next to the station in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} built in the Neo-Russian style. It is a three-aisled masonry church, which on the plan forms an oblong {{rectangular}} with a polygonal apse and resembles a ship. The cathedral has ten towers with gilded cupolas. The interiors include murals and <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the Story of Cupid and Psyche adorned the {{ceilings}} of Jordaens' house in Antwerp. At least nine decorated the ceiling of a salon in the South wing of the house, with Psyche Received by the Gods forming the centrepiece. Included in the series were Psyche's Father Questions the Oracle in the Temple of Apollo, The Love of Cupid and Psyche, The Curiosity of Psyche, Cupid's Flight, Psyche Received by the Gods and two putti <b>pieces.</b> The <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces</b> are all foreshortenings, seen from below, and the perspective system was borrowed verbatim from Rubens' <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces</b> in the Jesuit church in Antwerp. The paintings are viewed through an octagonal 'aperture' frame. According to the inventory left by Jordaens' grandchildren, these paintings {{were part of the}} sale of the house in 1708.|$|R

25|$|Most {{stations}} {{usually have}} a single island platform in {{the centre of the}} station hall (tunnel) serving both directions. The sub-surface stations have a <b>straight</b> <b>ceiling</b> sometimes supported by columns. The deep-level stations are larger tunnels with the track tunnels on each side. The walls of many stations are decorated using coloured aluminium panels; each station has its own colour. Some stations are considered among the finest in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of the tombs and the manner of burial is different [...] "from anything known from contemporary Palestine. Elements such as entrances located high above the surface, gabled <b>ceilings,</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ceilings</b> with a cornice, trough-shaped resting-places with pillows, above-ground tombs, and inscriptions engraved on the facade appear only here." [...] The stone benches on which bodies were laid out and the small square entrance doors {{are similar to those}} found elsewhere in Judah. David Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the Phoenician cities validates the Biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms.|$|R
50|$|In 1617-1618 Rubens painted two altarpieces. He {{was also}} {{commissioned}} {{to paint the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces,</b> for which he made the designs while the execution was done mostly by pupils, including Anthony van Dyck. A contract was drawn up in 1620 by Jacobus Tirinus and the paintings were delivered a year later {{in time for the}} consecration. Rubens received 7,000 guilders for his works in the church, and though the lavish decorations including sculptures and other artwork were well received, Tirinus was dismissed in 1625 for going beyond his budget.|$|R
50|$|The facade to Hay St had a {{symbolic}} skyscraper effect. There were tall strips of windows; the centre third {{was taller than}} and projected from the remainder. Stepping from the centre of this central bay was the vertical sign which projected above the roof and curved back and down into the modern ziggurat roof form. The auditorium was rather simple in fibrous plaster, striated lines and <b>straight</b> <b>ceiling</b> coves accentuated the long dimension of the room. The slightly lower sections {{each side of the}} ceiling, as well as incorporating indirect lighting coves to wash light across upper ceiling levels and down the walls, probably boxed in the airconditioning ducts.|$|R

[...] However, the stone benches were carved with headrests in a style borrowed from the Egyptian Hathor wig. Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the Phoenician cities validates the biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms, but speculates that {{some or all of}} the tombs may have been built by Phoenician aristocrats living in Jerusalem.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Amsterdam and became a pupil of Jacob de Wit and A. van der Laan. He {{engraved}} book illustrations, bibles, and historic prints. The Sint-Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp was formerly known for 39 <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces</b> by Rubens that were lost in a fire when it was struck by lightning on July 18, 1718. Jan de Wit had made sketches of the paintings and Jan Punt engraved them and published these after the fire. His pupils were Cornelis Bogerts, Marten Corver, Jan Evert Grave, Martinus van der Jagt, Pieter Langendijk (II), and Reinier Vinkeles.He died in Amsterdam.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Corfu; then a {{territory}} of the Republic of Venice. Little is written about his biography and training. He {{is best known for}} an allegorical <b>ceiling</b> <b>piece,</b> The East Offering its Riches to Britannia (1778), commissioned by the East India Company for the Revenue Committee Room in the East India House in London. The painting now generally represents the era's panegyric to Britain's imperial and colonialist domination; it is presently held in the British Library in London. Other works in British National Trust collections include An Illusionistic Gothic Patron's Pew, in the Extension of the Chapel (c.1769/1771).|$|R
50|$|At the Gazelli Art House in London,Brown {{displayed}} {{her body}} in a gallery window, suspended by rope from the <b>ceiling</b> forher <b>piece</b> Rainbow Body Performance. Crystal prisms dangled from her suspended bodycreating rainbow reflections around the gallery space.|$|R
5|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the destruction of}} the mansion {{as a result of the}} gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black <b>ceiling</b> <b>piece</b> that sloped up towards the camera. When the sequence was shot at a high speed, the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} housed in the Dar Menebhi Palace, {{constructed}} {{at the end of}} the 19th century by Mehdi Menebhi. The palace was carefully renovated by the Omar Benjelloun Foundation and converted into a museum in 1997. The house itself represents an example of classical Andalusian architecture, with fountains in the central courtyard, traditional seating areas, a hammam and intricate tilework and carvings. The museum's large atrium (originally a courtyard, now covered in glass and fabric) contains a very large centrally hung chandelier-esque <b>ceiling</b> <b>piece</b> consisting of metal plates decorated with fine geometric and epigraphic cuttings. Several features of the original courtyard, including the floor-set basins and mosaics have been retained. The museum holds exhibits of both modern and traditional Moroccan art together with fine examples of historical books, coins and pottery of Berber, Moroccan Jewish and Islamic cultures.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} common for a ball-and-socket fan to be designed such that the canopy (<b>ceiling</b> cover <b>piece)</b> can optionally be screwed directly into the top of the motor housing; then the whole fan can be secured directly onto the ceiling mounting bracket. This is known as a [...] "close-to-ceiling" [...] mount.|$|R
50|$|The {{manor house}} had {{originally}} two stories, with a rectangular ground-plan. The building has a block character, and is {{situated at the}} edge of an extensive park. Its frontal façade creates the border of the square. Considering the usage of space, the entrance parts of the ground floor are conceived in a rather grandiose style. Other rooms are connected to the entrance corridor. Cellars are built under a part of the object with a 9 meter deep well located in the basement. A wide, wooden staircase provides access to the first floor. The rooms in the ground-floor have simple arches without any distinct ornaments. The only exception is the so-called „writing-room“, with a plastic motive on the ceiling, corresponding with its purpose: a sealed envelope with four hearts. According to the legend, this is where the countess’s love letters were written. Most rooms on the first floor have <b>straight</b> <b>ceilings.</b> A representative character can be observed in a room with a rococo-classical furnace. Inside one can find original doors and rococo-classical forged rails at the ground-floor windows.|$|R
5000|$|Preissler {{was born}} and died in Nuremberg. According to the RKD {{he was the son}} and pupil of Johann Daniel Preissler and the brother of Georg Martin and Johan Martin. Like his father before him, he took a grand tour as a young man and {{travelled}} extensively in Italy (Venice, Florence Rome Naples). [...] On his return he married the glasspainter Susanna Maria Dorsch (1738). He became director of the Nuremberg Academy (founded by his father) in 1742, and in 1752 he became director of the drawing academy. His copies of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>pieces</b> by Rubens and Van Dyck in the Carolus Borromeuskerk were published by his brother Georg Martin in 1735. They form an historic record of those paintings, as lightning struck the church in 1718 and caused a fire which caused the roof to collapse. The Teylers Museum in Haarlem has a copy of this book as well as other works by Preissler.|$|R
50|$|Raymone Bain is an unsung hero, who has {{cracked the}} glass <b>ceiling</b> into tiny <b>pieces,</b> and without much fanfare. Her {{representation}} {{of some of}} the most herald athletes and entertainers are testament to this fact.|$|R
50|$|The {{trust fund}} Cornelius {{had left her}} {{produced}} a yearly income of $250,000, which was just enough to maintain both houses. Alice held on {{as long as she}} could, but by the outbreak of World War I Alice was forced to sell it. She had no hope for the house's preservation because she knew that developers (led by real estate developer Frederick Brown) had paid a hefty $7,000,000 for the land, and not for the house that stood on it. A week before the wrecking ball was scheduled to demolish the 43-year-old home, Mrs. Vanderbilt arranged to have it opened to the public for fifty cents admission which would be donated to charity. Before selling it, she donated as many elements from the interiors as she could, including the baronial August St. Gaudens designed fireplace which had graced the entrance hall and the Moorish <b>ceiling</b> <b>piece</b> from the smoking room. She also donated the 10-foot-tall metal front entryway gates. After being forced to sell the house for $7,000,000, she later bought the George J. Gould House for $800,000. 1 West 57th Street was demolished {{to make way for the}} Bergdorf Goodman department store.|$|R
50|$|Later that day, 24 {{years after}} his crime, Hill was {{executed}} through lethal injection {{by the state of}} Florida, at the Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida. He did not reply when asked if he had a last statement, staring <b>straight</b> at the <b>ceiling,</b> awaiting start of the lethal injection.|$|R
50|$|It has {{a colonial}} style, with a balcony {{on each side}} and where the {{entertaining}} orchestra is places, when needed. It has a beautiful crystal chandelier, made in quartz from Bohemia, hanging from the <b>ceiling.</b> This <b>piece</b> of huge size weighs around 2,000 kg. It is also remarkable {{the length of the}} table and carved chairs which have a leather back stamped with the Pizarro's shield in gold. The lining of the chairs has different colors for men and women. Paintings by Abraham Brughel and Gerónimo Cenatiempo decorate this unique place.|$|R
5000|$|In Accès aux quais (tableaux parisiens) (1985-6), Baumgarten {{displayed}} a Metro line map, {{the names of}} the stations altered to refer to French colonial activity. In 1976 and 1989, he spent six months traveling the United States by rail and residing on several Indian reservations. A <b>ceiling</b> <b>piece</b> made for the Carnegie Museum of Art in 1988 featured hand-painted letters from the Cherokee alphabet. For Carbon (1989), an installation composed chiefly of bars of color and typographically crisp words, he mapped two overlapping histories around the gallery walls: The network of railroads integral to the settling of the American West and the homes of the indigenous tribes who were displaced, imprisoned or eradicated. What remains are their names, which live on in the network of the railroads: Cheyenne and Northern Railway, Apache Railway, Keokuk Junction Railway or Monongahela Railway. Other names continue to exist only as geographic designations: Potomac River, Coconino County, and Chemehuevi Mountains. The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles commissioned Baumgarten to create a work that incorporated the photo documentation of his trip; however, the intended piece was never realized. Instead, the photographs were later published along with eleven short stories in an artists' book titled [...] "Carbon." [...] For his 1993 six-week solo exhibition at the Guggenheim Baumgarten printed the names of indigenous North American peoples on the inner curves of the rotunda.|$|R

40|$|In 2001 – 2005, the {{mycological}} {{condition of}} some brick, block and wooden buildings used for different purposes in Vilnius has been investigated. Micromycetes are isolated and identified from walls, <b>ceilings,</b> various <b>pieces</b> of equipment, air and dust. The {{majority of them}} belong to the Mitosporic fungi group. The degree of their spread and their potential hazard to those living, working or visiting the buildings are discussed. Factors stimulating the development and spread of micro-mycetes in the various buildings as well as measures to suppress or eliminate their development are examined. Improvement of the conditions in the premises is regarded as essential to reduce the hazard of clinical problems including respiratory disorders, asthma, allergies, skin diseases and mycoses...|$|R
5000|$|According to Jan van Gool and the RKD {{he first}} studied law {{and then took}} drawing lessons from Jan van Dieren (of whom Van Gool had never heard of). Meeting with success, Wassenbergh {{travelled}} to Rotterdam in 1712 where he became a pupil of Adriaen van der Werff. [...] He married Johanna van Oijen after returning to Groningen in 1715, and became quite successful as a history painter and room decorator (making <b>ceiling,</b> over-the-mantel <b>pieces</b> and doorway decorations for the nobility of the town). Many of his room decorations still survive in their original installations.Their daughter Elisabet Geertruda, and son Jan Jr followed their father, while daughter Gertruida Abelia was good at fruit and flowers.|$|R
5000|$|The Silwan necropolis, {{the most}} {{important}} ancient cemetery of the First Temple period, is assumed to {{have been used by}} the highest-ranking officials residing in Jerusalem, the capital city of the Kingdom of Judah. Its tombs were cut between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE. The architecture of the tombs and the manner of burial is different [...] "from anything known from contemporary Palestine. Elements such as entrances located high above the surface, gabled <b>ceilings,</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ceilings</b> with a cornice, trough-shaped resting-places with pillows, above-ground tombs, and inscriptions engraved on the facade appear only here." [...] The stone benches on which bodies were laid out and the small square entrance doors are similar to those found elsewhere in Judah. Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the Phoenician cities validates the Biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms. There are three different types of tombs in the Silwan necropolis, each type concentrated in one specific area. Seven of the tombs feature gabled ceilings and extremely fine stonework. David Ussishkin describes them as [...] "among the most beautifully rock-cut tombs known in the Jerusalem area even when compared with tombs of later periods." [...] In contrast with the extensive family tombs of later periods, these are for single or double burials, with only one of the seven having room for three bodies. Later destruction has effaced the original doorways. A second tomb type described by Ussishkin has flat ceilings and one, two, or three chambers of well-dressed stone carefully squared into spacious rooms. One features a rear chamber of especially [...] "impressive" [...] scale and quality. There are tombs combining characteristics of the two described here above. The third type consists of just three [...] "magnificent" [...] monolith tombs, now located {{in the northern part of}} the village. These have been carved out of the cliff to create free-standing buildings above the underground burial chambers. Hebrew inscriptions survive on these three tombs; these are the only ancient inscriptions that survive in Silwan.|$|R
50|$|The {{installation}} {{is made up}} of {{the main}} tower, which is composed of Horn and Gooseneck-shaped glass pieces, and the pergola ceiling, an area underneath the artwork that serves as the ceiling for the Fireworks of Glass exhibit in the lower level of the museum. The <b>ceiling</b> includes 1,600 <b>pieces</b> of glass in some of Chihuly's favourite shapes such as Putti, Seaforms, and Persians. Other shapes represented in the ceiling are Gooseneck, Mexican hat, twisted horn, split leaf, sea tube, frog foot, starfish, and horn bale.|$|R
50|$|Daniel {{ascribed}} {{his second}} divorce to a charm {{which he had}} unintentionally broken at the old estate. According to a Harrison family legend a bride of long ago who was married beneath the chandelier in the stately main room of the mansion died on her wedding night. Her wedding ring was embedded in the plaster ceiling and the legend was created that whoever disturbed it would meet with bad luck in love. After purchasing Brandon 1926, Daniel ordered renovations made to the dilapidated 160-year-old mansion. While workmen were repairing the <b>ceiling</b> a <b>piece</b> of plaster {{fell to the floor}} containing a wedding ring. The workmen took it to Daniel, who had it cleaned and polished and placed back beneath the chandelier. He said he was aware of the legend and feared the results of disturbing the ring. Two years later Margery sued for divorce.|$|R
