25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could <b>say.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E

50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes.

We should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> wise, but we can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). We should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God <b>is</b> One, but we can state <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{assumed that the}} name [...] "Ogg" [...] comes from the character of Nanny Ogg in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, but the Ogg developers <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not true. Ogg is derived from [...] "ogging", jargon from the computer game Netrek, which came to mean doing something forcefully, possibly without consideration of the drain on future resources. At its inception, the Ogg project {{was thought to be}} somewhat ambitious given the power of the PC hardware of the time. Still, to quote the same reference: [...] "Vorbis, on the other hand is named after the Terry Pratchett character from the book Small Gods".|$|E
2500|$|SHAC 7, six {{animal rights}} activists, who {{were found guilty}} of using their website to incite threats, harassment, {{vandalism}} and attacks against the company Huntingdon Life Sciences and their business partners. Originally seven individuals were charged, leading sympathizers to describe the defendants as the SHAC 7, but the case {{against one of the}} defendants was dropped. Pamelyn Ferdin, the current president of SHAC USA, told the jury that [...] "for the government to say you can't say this and you can't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> going down a very scary path of going toward fascism." [...] However, the US Attorney's Office described the convicts as [...] "thugs who went far beyond protected speech and lawful protest to engage in and incite intimidation, harassment and violence." [...] The judge sentenced the individuals to an aggregate of 24 years in prison, and ordered to pay a joint restitution of $1,000,001.00.|$|E
2500|$|Nasrallah {{negotiated}} a Memorandum of Understanding with the Free Patriotic Movement headed by Michel Aoun, the former premier and a Maronite Christian. Aoun described the ten-point MoU in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal published on 31 July 2006. A key {{point is that}} Hezbollah agreed to disarm upon the return of its prisoners and the occupied Shebaa Farms. It also agreed to the pardon and return of fugitive South Lebanon Army (SLA) members. The Free Patriotic Movement in turn agreed to work for reform of the confessional electoral system of the Parliament of Lebanon and move it {{in the direction of}} one man, one vote. Aoun made the point that the political process was in effect disarming Hezbollah without any loss in lives from unnecessary wars. Critics of this agreement <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not very clear concerning the disarmament, and that it served to strengthen Hezbollah internally, giving it a non-Shiite cover inside [...]|$|E

It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there. And the reason I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because I think the immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes.

2500|$|A plan by the Bush {{administration}} [...] "to privatize {{parts of}} the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership" [...] provoked disagreement within Amtrak's board of directors. Late in 2005 Gunn was fired. Gunn's replacement, Alexander Kummant (2006–08), was committed to operating a national rail network, and, like Gunn, opposed the notion of putting the Northeast Corridor under separate ownership. He said that shedding the system's long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks, and that Amtrak's abandonment of these routes would be irreversible. In late 2006, Amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of $1billion for ten years. In early 2007, Amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year, its highest amount {{since its founding in}} 1970. Politico noted a key problem: [...] "the rail system chronically operates in the red. A pattern has emerged: Congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the White House and appropriates enough funds to keep Amtrak from plunging into insolvency. But, Amtrak advocates <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not enough to fix the system's woes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E
