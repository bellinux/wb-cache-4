5000|$|Gay sex {{was common}} in the {{bathrooms}} of the University of Florida in the 1980s. Alligator in its 26 January 1989, issue published photos of holes drilled in <b>stall</b> <b>walls</b> of bathrooms there. There were two types of holes — large and small. Through the larger holes, also called [...] "glory holes", voyeurs were able to watch others masturbating in the adjacent stall. The larger hole enabled men to insert their penises through it for sex. Through the smaller holes, men were able to voyeuristically watch each other or transfer notes for dating. Sometimes the <b>stall</b> <b>walls</b> had large gaps between their lowest level and the floor, enabling men to have sex without a hole. The paper reported men {{between the ages of}} 17 and 50 having sex in the university bathrooms.|$|R
50|$|St Thomas' chapel is {{the school}} chapel at King William's College, and was built in 1878, and consecrated on 28 January 1879. Designed by local {{architect}} James Cowle, it features a scissor-braced roof, canopied <b>stalls,</b> <b>wall</b> paintings, and stained glass windows. Windows commemorate T. E. Brown, an old boy of the college. The chapel is staffed by a Church of England priest who is employed by the college and licensed by the Bishop of Sodor and Man.|$|R
25|$|Many {{women were}} {{forced out of}} their modest ways of life {{due to lack of}} space and privacy in the {{internment}} camps. For example, at Hastings Park, women and children were housed in an area that was previously used for livestock. Prisoners were forced to share one animal stall per family and personal space was very hard to come by. The partitions were made of the five-foot <b>stall</b> <b>walls</b> and flimsy pieces of fabric. This created very little privacy for the families and caused most women to abandon the previous modest social norms.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1980s, when {{homosexuality}} {{was still}} viewed negatively in American society, many gay men found bathroom sex {{an easy way}} to have sex. Journalist Michael Koretzky wrote in the The Independent Florida Alligator, [...] "Bathroom sex {{is one of the most}} discreet ways for gay men to meet other gay men." [...] A variety of sex acts occurred in those bathrooms.There have been reports of holes drilled in toilet <b>stall</b> <b>walls</b> of some American universities to facilitate bathroom sex.

2500|$|The site of Chunchucmil is also {{notable for}} the likely {{presence}} of a marketplace. [...] Geochemical soil tests combined with careful excavations of an open area in the site center have revealed a possible market for distributing comestibles and other goods. [...] Excavations also revealed ephemeral stone alignments {{that may have been}} brace foundations for perishable market <b>stall</b> <b>walls.</b> [...] High levels of phosphorus correlate with these alignments, suggesting high concentrations of organic decay. [...] Additionally, the distribution of obsidian within the Chunchucmil region itself, especially among a variety of sociocultural contexts, may also indicate the {{presence of a}} market economy, which is relatively rare among Early Classic Maya economies.|$|R
40|$|Although {{mention of}} {{graffiti}} often conjures images of dirty subways or crumbling {{segments of the}} Berlin Wall, many people deal with graffiti in a seemingly much more private place every day-that found in the nearest restroom stall. This paper attempts to explore {{how many of the}} same techniques used to govern, and often eliminate, graffiti in public spaces have made their way into the privacy of restroom stalls. By labeling graffiti as dirty and subversive, society {{has found a way to}} eliminate the graffiti even before it has to be scrubbed off of the <b>stall</b> <b>walls.</b> This paper continues on to examine the consequences of these governing techniques and their implications for our liberal society...|$|R
5000|$|The {{horse was}} named after the folk hero John Henry. As a colt, John Henry {{had a habit of}} tearing steel water and feed buckets off <b>stall</b> <b>walls</b> and stomping them flat. This {{reminded}} his then-owners of the legendary John Henry, who was known as a [...] "steel-drivin' man". He was gelded both for his temperament as well as his lack of good breeding, which meant that he would have been unlikely to be in much demand as a breeding stallion. A Golden Chance Farm foal, John Henry was from breeding that might best be described as plebeian. His sire, Ole Bob Bowers, once sold for just $900 and was not in much demand by breeders. His dam, Once Double, was an undistinguished runner and producer, but was sired by Double Jay, a graded stakes race winner who had proven to be a useful broodmare sire.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to examine the effects, on stator stall margin and performance, of a slotted hub treatment rotating beneath the stator of an axial flow compressor. The compressor was run with this hub treatment and the results compared to those taken with a smooth rotating hub. It was determined that, for the configuration tested, the hub treatment was ineffective in the improvement of stall margin but resulted in a measurably higher static pressure rise across the stator and {{a significant decrease in}} flow deviation and blockage in the stator midspan region. Although it is the hub section of the stator that sets the stall limit in this configuration, measurements of the stator exit flow field indicated that the type of stall that is occurring is a blade stall rather than a pure <b>wall</b> <b>stall.</b> Absence of a <b>wall</b> <b>stall</b> is thus seen as a key possibility for the lack of stall margin improvement.

50|$|Vendor spaces can be {{as simple}} as a cloth on the ground to a simple table or pile of boxes to tables with walls made up of {{interconnecting}} metal poles. Those who sell goods from the ground may have only a few things to sell or their cloth might be filled to the edge. Those with a table have the advantage of having their goods in easier reach of both buyer and seller. Merchandise from these spaces is usually produce, hats, jewelry, pottery and other small, unbreakable items. <b>Stalls</b> with <b>walls</b> allow for the hanging of merchandise such as clothing or the addition of shelves for more delicate wares. These type of stalls can display six times the merchandise than those who sell from the ground or table.|$|R

50|$|The stalls {{here are}} set up {{early in the morning}} and taken down that night. The number of vendors on any given Sunday varies but the number usually exceeds 1,000. Counts have been as high as 1,400 and 1,600. Stalls divide into three types. The first is a simple cloth on the ground, with the vendor sitting or {{kneeling}} behind it and his/her wares all day. This cloth may contain only a few items or it may be full to the edge. The second type is a simple table or stacked boxes. The third is a <b>stall</b> with <b>walls,</b> often constructed of interconnecting metal rods. They type of stall used depends on the economics of the vendors and the types of products they sell. In addition to the stalls, street vendors walk around the market carrying their goods with them, approaching potential customers to ask for a sale.|$|R
5000|$|This 3,000-square-foot model {{home was}} built by Ralph Wilson, Sr., founder of Wilsonart in 1959 in Temple, Texas. Together with his {{daughter}} Bonnie McIninich, Wilson created the home {{to serve as an}} experimental showcase for Wilsonart (then Ralph Wilson Plastics). Experimental uses for laminate appeared throughout the home including kitchen and bath cabinets, shower <b>stalls</b> and <b>walls,</b> using laminates in place of traditional building materials like drywall, wallpaper, paint, wood, ceramic tile and linoleum. The doorless garage, its walls covered with new grades of laminate, allowed Wilson to test his products’ durability. [...] The Wilson house served as Wilson, Sr.’s private residence from 1959 until his death in 1972. In 1997, the home was purchased from Wilson, Sr.’s widow, Sunny Wilson, and restored to its original appearance in 1959. In 1998, the home was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its innovative use of laminate technology. Today, the home serves as a museum and corporate archive.|$|R

50|$|Locker {{rooms were}} an {{essential}} {{feature of the}} gymnasium building. The Huntington YMCA had 3 distinct locker rooms within its facilities. The basement held a large boy’s locker room with lockers for storing athletic clothing and an adjacent large shower room. On the first floor there were two locker rooms. The businessmen’s locker room was the smaller of the two, with individual marble shower <b>stalls,</b> marble <b>walls,</b> granolithic floors and oak benches with white iron bases. The locker room led to the business men’s club room. The men’s club locker room also occupied the first floor. It was split into a large and a small locker room with a group shower lined in terra cotta and marble. The men’s club locker room also offered amenities such as individual shower stalls, fan rooms and steam baths. It too had the marble walls, granolithic floors and oak benches with white iron bases. The separation of spaces, specifically within the 3 distinct locker rooms, correlated to the YMCA’s policy regarding segregation and distinction by class, race and gender.|$|R
2500|$|To {{design the}} cabins at Rapidan Camp, Lou Henry Hoover hired an {{architect}} who had built Girl Scout camps. The facilities were extremely rustic by modern standards. Some {{of the early}} structures such as the original Five Tents had just a wooden floor and [...] walls, with canvas tents above. Even the President's Cabin was built with single-wall uninsulated construction—slats of German Siding nailed to studs and exposed on both sides. There are no interior ceilings; rafters and roof boards are exposed. Shower <b>stalls</b> have tin <b>walls</b> and concrete floors. During Hoover's administration, cabin porches were decorated with boxes filled with geraniums, and interior floors were covered with grass rugs. The camp was modified throughout Hoover's presidency with new cabins and additions to existing cabins.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{study of}} the {{two-dimensional}} diffusers with wake-type inlet velocity profiles in the parallel walls was carried out. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effects of nonuniform inlet velocity profiles on flow regime and performance. In general, a diffuser performance is affected by the relative location of the low velocity core-flow region in the inlet velocity profile. For the wide-angle diffuser with wake-type inlet shear flows, the favorable effects of mixing result in velocity profile flattening and hence the pressure-recovery performance is increased relative to the performance obtained for diffusers with uniform inlet core velocity profiles. However, for small angle diffuser the performance is decreased below that measured for diffusers with uniform inlet velocity profiles. A centerline stall develops in the core region of the flow for diffusers with severe inlet profile distortion. However, the central stall may not affect the diffuser performance than the <b>wall</b> <b>stall...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of axial-flow compressors {{is known to}} be adversely affected by increasing the aspect ratio (the ratio of blade height to chord length). Experimental investigations have been carried out on a single-stage, low speed axial-flow compressor with a parallel annulus and a hub-tip ratio of 0. 750. The tests were conducted at two blade aspect ratios; one and two. The Reynolds number was held constant at 1. 9 x I @ by testing each aspeot ratio at different speeds. The tip clearances and blade row axial spacing at the inner diameter were kept identical for both aspect ratios. The overall performance characteristics show that the compressor of aspect ratio 1 has a wider range of operation and In general a higher static pressure rise than that for the compressor of aspect ratio 2. Traverses show that the three-dimensional flow outside the wall boundary layers is substantially the same for both aspeot ratios. They also show that the major aspect ratio effect is oaused by <b>wall</b> <b>stall</b> which occur...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, soldiers marched {{north from}} the Presidio at Tubac and began {{construction of the}} fort. Initially, it consisted of a scattering of buildings, some inside a wooden palisade. Mismanagement of the funds that were {{to be spent on}} adobe <b>walls</b> <b>stalled</b> their construction. A near disastrous attack by Apache raiders in June 1782 resulted in renewed efforts to complete the fort, which was accomplished in May 1783. The fort measured about 670 ft to a side with square towers at the northeast and southwest corners. The main gate was on the center of the west wall, the presidial chapel was located along the east wall, the commandant's house was in the center, and the interior walls were lined with homes, stables, and warehouses. The massive adobe walls required constant maintenance, especially in times when attacks by Native Americans were anticipated, mostly from Apache. The fortress remained intact until the American arrival in 1856, two years after the Gadsden Treaty transferred southern Arizona to the United States. Afterward, it was rapidly dismantled, with the last standing portion torn down in 1918.|$|R
40|$|Two {{compressor}} ca 80 ade 9 of {{aspect ratio}} 2. 10 ana 4 ea 3 ~ 8 m tested {{up to the}} stall point in a working section with solid aide wells. A change in aspect ratio was obtained by changing the blade chord only [...] The blade section profile wss the lOCb/ 3 OC 50, staggered at 36 degrees with a space-ahord ratio of O& 8, {{and there was no}} tip clearance. Reynolds number similarity was maintained but its value we 8 kept above e "critical" Substantial difference in performance is indicated between the two aspect ratios. The high aspect ratio cascade gives more deflection at the mid-span near stall, but atella first. The long chord, low aspect ratio blade stalls gently whilst a classical type of sudden stall occurs at the other aspect ratio. Higher pressure rise coefficient is observed at the high aspect ratio, increasing slightly with incidence up to the atell. point.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} casing treatments in a one-stage transonic compressor is presented. The reference case {{consists of a}} radially staggered blisk and six circumferential grooves. Speedlines show that this axisymmetric treatment already provided {{a substantial increase in}} operating range with relatively small losses in efficiency. Since the onset of rotating stall in tip-critical high-speed compressors is always linked to the tip-leakage flow and the built-up of blockage within the blade passage, high-resolution measurement techniques have been employed to investigate the corresponding effects. Results with Particle Image Velocimetry show that the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and the shock front cause a blockage area. When throttled further, the blockage increases. The shock structure changes similar to the phenomena of vortex breakdown described by different researchers in the past, but a stagnation point is not present. Before reaching the stability limit, the interface line between the incoming flow and the blocked area moves towards the inlet plane of the rotor indicating spike-type <b>stall</b> inception. <b>Wall</b> pressure measurements confirmed this theory for the smooth wall, but with circumferential grooves applied, a part span stall cell develops prior to the stability limit. In order to assess the performance of circumferential grooves, two additional configurations are presented. The corresponding measurements addressed the questions whether circumferential grooves also provide an operating range extension when applied to an optimized rotor design with higher initial stall margin. Therefore, an identical casing treatment is applied to a forward swept rotor. The second question is, how circumferential grooves perform in direct comparison to a non-axisymmetric endwall structure. Axial slots have been applied to the radially staggered rotor. While the stall margin exceeds all other configurations, detrimential effects in efficiency are observed. A detailed anaylsis of probe data shows the changes of the radial profile at the rotor outlet which allows recommendations for more efficient CT designs. Parameters allowing to evaluate the CT influence are presented...|$|R
50|$|Batak Toba culture centres on Lake Toba and {{the sacred}} island of Samosir that lies within it. Jabu is the Toba {{language}} word for rumah adat. The houses {{are made up}} of three sections. A substructure of large wooden pillars resting on flat stones (or concrete nowadays) protects the structure from rising damp. Some of these pillars support longitudinal beams known as labe-labe, which run the length of the house at head height to carry the massive roof. Other pillars carry two large beams with carved singa heads which, with two lateral beams mortised into them, form a great ring beam bearing the small living area. The substructure is strengthened by beams mortised into the piles which double as night <b>stalls</b> for cattle. <b>Walls</b> are lightweight and lean outwards and provide additional stability to the structure. The wall and the wall plate supporting the rafters hang from the labe-labe with rattan cord, while the base of the wall sits on the ring beam.

In lieu of horizontal bracing battens, diagonal ties - running {{from the middle of the}} labe-labe to the gable ends - provide reinforcement.|$|R
50|$|Two {{people stand}} out in Ely Cathedral's eighteenth century history, one a minor canon and the other an {{architectural}} contractor. James Bentham (1709 - 1794), building {{on the work of}} his father Rev. Samuel Bentham, studied the history of both the institution and architecture of the cathedral, culminating in 1771 with his publication of The History and Antiquities of the Conventual and Cathedral Church of Ely. He sought out original documents to provide definitive biographical lists of abbots, priors, deans and bishops, alongside a history of the abbey and cathedral, and was able to set out the architectural development of the building with detailed engravings and plans. These plans, elevations and sections had been surveyed by the architect James Essex (1722-1784), who by this means was able to both highlight the poor state of parts of the building, and understand its complex interdependencies. The level of expertise that Bentham and Essex brought to the situation enabled a well-prioritised series of repairs and sensitive improvements to be proposed that occupied much of the later eighteenth century. Essex identified the decay of the octagon lantern as the starting point of a major series of repairs, and was appointed in 1757 to oversee the work. 400 years of weathering and decay may have removed many of the gothic features, and shortage of funds allied to a Georgian suspicion of ornament resulted in plain and pared down timber and leadwork on the lantern. He was then able to move on to re-roof the entire eastern arm and restore the eastern gable which had been pushed outwards some 2 ft. Bentham and Essex were both enthusiastic proponents of a longstanding plan to relocate the 14th century choir stalls from under the octagon. With the octagon and east roof dealt with, the scheme was embarked on in 1769, with Bentham, still only a minor canon, appointed as clerk of works. By moving the choir stalls to the far east end of the cathedral, the octagon became a spacious and dramatic public area for the first time, with grand vistas to east and west and spectacular views of the octagon vaulting. They also removed the Romanesque pulpitum and put in a new choir screen two bays east of the octagon, surmounted by the 1690s organ case. Despite their antiquarian interests, Bentham and Essex appear to have dismantled the choir stalls with alarming lack of care, and saw no problem in clearing away features at the east end, and removing the pulpitum and medieval walls surrounding the choir <b>stalls.</b> The north <b>wall</b> turned out to incorporate the bones of seven 'Saxon worthies' which would have featured on the pilgrim route into the pre-reformation cathedral. The bones were rehoused in Bishop West's Chapel. The choir stalls, with their misericords were however retained, and the restoration as a whole was relatively sympathetic {{by the standards of the}} period.|$|R
