5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a numerically superior, {{but less}} {{experienced}} enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, {{taking care to}} select a battleground that favoured them. They chose a naturally strong position, protected by a swamp which, according to Gregoras, they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a <b>solid</b> <b>line,</b> but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition. The Athenian army {{on the other hand}} assembled at Lamia. On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth. On the eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to die with the others. At the same time, however, the Catalans' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them.|$|E

25|$|That the {{original}} {{creators of the}} movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart. While in other countries {{the original}} wave {{in the wake of}} the US or British rock invasions never sustained itself completely and quieted down, in Argentina not only did it continue, it evolved into its own realm and style more independent from rock music of the United States or Britain. From 1965, Argentine rock, with a <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the Spanish-speaking world.|$|E
25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly that it looks like a <b>solid</b> <b>line.</b> The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaigns of}} Pharaoh Thutmose III {{continued}} Egypt's great military rise. Infantry formations were better trained, led and armed. They were usually organized into basic sub-units of 50 fighters, progressing to divisions of around 5,000 men. Archers were better integrated with footmen. The chariot arm was expanded, and generally {{reserved for the}} nobility. Each vehicle carried two men, a driver maneuvered while carrying a huge shield to protect himself and his partner, an assault trooper armed with a powerful composite bow and bronze-tipped arrows provided firepower and a dozen javelins were also carried on board the chariot for close-range work. Behind the chariots came the infantry – solid ranks of spearmen and archers. The archers took the enemy under fire to open combat, while the chariot teams maneuvered around the flanks or across the enemy front. The chariots usually engaged in stand-off battle with arrows against opposing chariots or infantry, or could carry out shock attacks against vulnerable points of the enemy formation. The infantry meanwhile advanced behind, ready to make follow-on attacks, or providing a <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> of defense behind which the chariots could regroup if they ran into problems.|$|E
500|$|Also {{in dispute}} {{is the number}} of Taliban fighters {{involved}} in the ambush. In Luttrell's original after-action report, he stated that he and his teammates were attacked by 20–35 insurgents, while his book places the number at over 200. [...] The screenplay describes [...] "A <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them." [...] The summary of action for Lt. Murphy's posthumous Medal of Honor describes the enemy force as numbering [...] "more than 50," [...] while the official citation puts the number at [...] "between 30 and 40 enemy fighters." ...|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{the sets}} {{demonstrated}} {{a serious problem}} with ground reflections. The broadcast antenna sent out the pulse over a very wide area covering the entire forward side of the aircraft. This meant {{that some of the}} broadcast energy struck the ground and reflected back to the receiver. The result was a <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> across the display at a distance equal to the aircraft's altitude, beyond which nothing could be seen. This was fine when the aircraft was flying at [...] or more and the ground return was at about the maximum useful range, but meant that interceptions carried out at lower altitudes offered increasingly shorter range.|$|E

500|$|The guitar {{interface}} remains relatively unchanged in World Tour. [...] As {{with previous}} Guitar Hero titles, the guitar and bass player must {{hold down the}} correct fret button(s) on the controller while strumming {{in time with the}} notes as they scroll on-screen. One addition to the guitar gameplay is the ability to play notes while holding a sustained note. [...] Additionally, the bass guitar player is required to play notes representing an open E string, which is shown on-screen as a <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> across their note track. [...] To play these notes, the bass guitar player strums the controller without pressing any fret button keys. The drum interface is similar to the guitar's interface, with each on-screen note track equivalent to a colored drum head on the controller, with the bass drum indicated by a line across the note track. [...] The drum player only needs to hit the correct drum pads simultaneously to the note gems to successfully play their track. There are also marked sections indicating drum fills wherein the player may play any notes they wish in a 'solo' to gain points. The vocal track requires the player to match the pitch of the notes {{in a manner similar to}} Karaoke Revolution to be successful. Special sections of each player's note track are marked with glowing notes, which, if completed successfully, builds up Star Power. Once enough Star Power is accumulated, it can be released via various means to double the band's current score multiplier. For guitar and bass, this is done by lifting the guitar controller vertically or (though not in bass) by pressing a button on the guitar face; for drums, by striking both cymbal pads on the controller at the same time; for vocals, by tapping the microphone or making a similarly quick sound. Star Power's use has been modified over previous Guitar Hero entries in that Star Power can now be accumulated even when Star Power is in use by successfully completing additional Star Power phrases, which extends the Star Power's duration.|$|E
2500|$|Microprinting is the {{production}} of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye.

2500|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system.

The 1920s-style [...] "Flatbush Avenue" [...] name tablets, containing red backgrounds with blue borders, were restored on both platforms. The top and bottom of the platform walls contain a blue <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> with a colorful border trim.

2500|$|Figure 6 shows a graph of the alpha-type Stirling engine data, where 'Q' denotes heat energy, and 'W' denotes work energy. [...] The blue {{dotted line}} shows the work {{output of the}} {{compression}} space. As the trace dips down, work is done on the gas as it is compressed. [...] During the expansion process of the cycle, some work is actually done on the compression piston, as reflected by the upward movement of the trace. At {{the end of the}} cycle, this value is negative, indicating that compression piston requires a net input of work. The blue <b>solid</b> <b>line</b> shows the heat flowing out of the cooler heat exchanger. The heat from the cooler and the work from the compression piston have the same cycle energy. This is consistent with the zero-net heat transfer of the regenerator (solid green line). As would be expected, the heater and the expansion space both have positive energy flow. The black dotted line shows the net work output of the cycle. On this trace, the cycle ends higher than it started, indicating that the heat engine converts energy from heat into work.|$|E
2500|$|The changes {{abolished}} group voting {{tickets and}} introduced optional preferential voting, along with party logos {{on the ballot}} paper. The ballot paper continues to have a box for each party above a heavy line, with each party's candidates in a column below that party's box below the <b>solid</b> <b>line.</b> Previously, a voter could either mark a single box above the line, which triggered the party's group voting ticket (a pre-assigned sequence of preferences), or place a number in every box below the line to assign their own preferences. As {{a result of the}} changes, voters may assign their preferences for parties above the line (numbering as many boxes as they wish), or individual candidates below the line, and are not required to fill all of the boxes. Both above and below the line voting are now optional preferential voting. For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences, however, a [...] "savings provision" [...] still counts the ballot if less than six are given. As a result, fewer votes are classed as informal, however, more ballots do [...] "exhaust" [...] as a result (i.e. some votes are not counted towards electing any candidate). For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are still free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified. Another savings provision allows ballot papers with at least 6 below the line preferences to be formal, catering for people who confuse the above and below the line instructions; an additional change to the savings provision will also accept below the line votes with a higher number of sequence errors than previously, treating the sequence as stopping at the first error (missed or repeated numbers).|$|E
