5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows <b>significant</b> <b>correlation</b> between hair length and age, which {{indicates}} that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A <b>significant</b> <b>correlation</b> was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 {{showed a}} <b>significant</b> <b>correlation</b> with clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs {{were reported to}} be associated with AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically <b>significant</b> <b>correlation</b> between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
30|$|As for the no-PTSD group (Table  3), EC has <b>significant</b> <b>correlations</b> with peritraumatic dissociation, {{posttraumatic}} cognitions, re-experience symptoms, anxiety, and depression. There were no <b>significant</b> <b>correlations</b> for EC and {{the overall}} SPTSS score, the avoidance/numbing score, and the hyperarousal score.|$|R
30|$|Regarding the PTSD group, Table  2 shows <b>significant</b> <b>correlations</b> between EC and {{posttraumatic}} cognitions, symptoms (overall, hyperarousal, and re-experience), anxiety, and depression.

30|$|The WBCs showed <b>significant</b> {{negative}} <b>correlation</b> with MDA, caspase- 3 and <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> {{with total}} antioxidant and Bcl- 2. The monocytes showed <b>significant</b> negative <b>correlation</b> with caspase- 3.|$|R
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other <b>significant</b> <b>correlation</b> patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A <b>significant</b> <b>correlation</b> between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E

40|$|Simple {{correlation}} was worked out {{based on the}} mean values obtained from tested 16 aromatic rice varieties {{to determine the extent}} and strength of the possible pairs of 13 quality characters. Correlation studies revealed that kernel length had highly <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with length/breadth ratio and kernel length after cooking and <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with gel consistency. Length/breadth ratio showed significant to highly <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with gel consistency, protein content, water uptake ratio and kernel length after cooking. Head rice showed <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with milled rice, kernel breadth and gel consistency. Gel consistency showed highly <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with gelatinization temperature while it showed highly <b>significant</b> negative <b>correlation</b> with amylose content. Expanded volume showed highly <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> with amylose content, elongation ratio and water uptake ratio. The strong and <b>significant</b> positive <b>correlation</b> of kernel length, length/breadth ratio, head rice, gel consistency and expanded volume with different quality characters indicated that these are prime grain quality characters for improvement of genotypes...|$|R

[Results]	 We	found	<b>significant</b>	<b>correlations</b>	of	forced	expiratory	volume	at	one	second (ρ=− 0. 49) 	 and	total	lung	capacity	(ρ= 0. 39) 	 with	mediolateral	displacement	with	feet	apart/eyes	open. <b>Significant</b> <b>correlations</b> were	observed	between	peak	expiratory	flow	and	a	number	of	stabilometric	parameters. There	were several <b>significant</b>	<b>correlations</b>	between	airway-specific	conductance	and	 the	 tasks	performed	on	 the	 force	plat-form,	 especially	one	with	the	feet	apart/eyes	open.
