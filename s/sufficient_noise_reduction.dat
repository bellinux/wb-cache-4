It is therefore desirable to protect the patient and dentist whilst allowing two-way communication, which will require a headphone- type system.

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes an {{improved}} multi-band spectral subtraction algorithm {{with the goal}} of improving the quality of speech signal in various noise environments. In the proposed enhancement algorithm, the whole speech spectrum is divided into different uniformly spaced continuous frequency bands and spectral over-subtraction is performed in each band, independently. The proposed algorithm uses a novel approach to estimate the noise from each band continuously, without using speech pause detection. The noise is estimated and updated by adaptively smoothing the noisy signal power in each uniformly spaced frequency band. The smoothing parameter is controlled by a linear function of a-posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The experiments are conducted for various types of noises and the results of proposed algorithm are compared with the reference multi-band spectral subtraction algorithm. To test the performance of the proposed speech enhancement algorithm, objective quality measurement tests (SNR, segmental SNR (Seg. SNR), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ)) and spectrogram with informal listening tests are conducted for various noise types at different SNRs. Experimental results and objective quality evaluation test results confirmed the performance of proposed enhancement algorithm. The proposed enhancement algorithm provides <b>sufficient</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> and good perceptual quality, without causing considerable signal distortion and remnant musical noise...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed to study the propulsion airframe aeroacoustic installation effects of a separate flow jet nozzle with a Hybrid Wing Body aircraft configuration where the engine is installed above the wing. Prior understanding of the jet noise shielding effectiveness was extended to a bypass ratio ten application {{as a function of}} nozzle configuration, chevron type, axial spacing, and installation effects from additional airframe components. Chevron types included fan chevrons that are uniform circumferentially around the fan nozzle and T-fan type chevrons that are asymmetrical circumferentially. In isolated testing without a pylon, uniform chevrons compared to T-fan chevrons showed slightly more low frequency reduction offset by more high frequency increase. Phased array localization shows that at this bypass ratio chevrons still move peak jet noise source locations upstream but not to nearly the extent, as a function of frequency, as for lower bypass ratio jets. For baseline nozzles without chevrons, the basic pylon effect has been greatly reduced compared to that seen for lower bypass ratio jets. Compared to Tfan chevrons without a pylon, the combination with a standard pylon results in more high frequency noise increase and an overall higher noise level. Shielded by an airframe surface 2. 17 fan diameters from nozzle to airframe trailing edge, the T-fan chevron nozzle can produce <b>reductions</b> in jet <b>noise</b> of as much as 8 dB at high frequencies and upstream angles. <b>Noise</b> <b>reduction</b> from shielding decreases with decreasing frequency and with increasing angle from the jet inlet. Beyond an angle of 130 degrees there is almost no <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> from shielding. Increasing chevron immersion more than what is already an aggressive design is not advantageous for <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> The addition of airframe control surfaces, including vertical stabilizers and elevon deflection, showed only a small overall impact. Based on the test results, the best overall nozzle configuration design was selected for application to the N 2 A Hybrid Wing Body concept that will be the subject of the NASA Langley 14 by 22 Foot Subsonic Tunnel high fidelity aeroacoustic characterization experiment. The best overall nozzle selected includes T-fan type chevrons, uniform chevrons on the core nozzle, and no additional pylon of the type that created a strong acoustic effect at lower bypass ratios. The T-fan chevrons are oriented azimuthally away from the ground observer locations. This best overall nozzle compared to the baseline nozzle was assessed, at equal thrust, to produce <b>sufficient</b> installed <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> of the jet noise component to enable the N 2 A HWB to meet NASA s noise goal of 42 dB cumulative below Stage 4...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} four novel liner concepts: soft vanes, over-the-rotor liners, external liners, and flap side-edge liners. A number of similarities {{in the design and}} evaluation of these concepts emerged during these investigations. Since these were the first attempts to study these particular liner concepts, there was limited information to guide the design process. In all cases, the target frequencies (or frequency range) were known, but the optimum acoustic impedance and optimum liner placement were typically not known. For these cases, the maximum available surface was used and a c-impedance was targeted based on the assumption the sound field impinges on the surface at normal incidence. This choice proved fruitful for every application. An impedance prediction model was used to design variable-depth liner configurations, and a graphical design code (ILIAD) was developed to aid in this process. The ability to build increasingly complex liner configurations via additive manufacturing was key, such that multiple designs could quickly be tested in a normal incidence impedance tube. The Two-Thickness Method was used to evaluate available bulk materials, such that bulk liners could also be considered for each application. These novel liner concepts provide <b>sufficient</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> to warrant further investigations...|$|E
40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals {{contain a}} great deal of {{essential}} information which can be utilized by physicians for the diagnosis of heart diseases. Unfortunately, ECG signals are inevitably corrupted by noise which will severely affect the accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Existing ECG signal denoising methods based on wavelet shrinkage, empirical mode decomposition and nonlocal means (NLM) cannot provide <b>sufficient</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> or well-detailed preservation, especially with high noise corruption. To address this problem, we have proposed a hybrid ECG signal denoising scheme by combining extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) with NLM. In the proposed method, the noisy ECG signals will first be decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and adaptive global mean using ESMD. Then, the first several IMFs will be filtered by the NLM method according to the frequency of IMFs while the QRS complex detected from these IMFs as the dominant feature of the ECG signal and the remaining IMFs will be left unprocessed. The denoised IMFs and unprocessed IMFs are combined to produce the final denoised ECG signals. Experiments on both simulated ECG signals and real ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database demonstrate that the proposed method can suppress noise in ECG signals effectively while preserving the details very well, and it outperforms several state-of-the-art ECG signal denoising methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), root mean squared error (RMSE), percent root mean square difference (PRD) and mean opinion score (MOS) error index...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{noise is}} one of the leading work-related health risk factors for teachers, many nursery schools lack <b>sufficient</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> measures. Methods: This {{intervention}} study evaluated the noise exposure of nursery school teachers when dropping DUPLO toy bricks into storage cases. Sound analyses of the impact included assessment of the maximum sound pressure level (LAFmax) as well as frequency analyses with 1 / 3 octave band filter. For the purpose of standardization, a customized gadget was developed. Recordings were performed in 11 cases of different materials and designs to assess the impact on sound level reduction. Thereby, the acoustic effects of three damping materials (foam rubber, carpet, and PU-foam) were investigated. Results: The lowest LAFmax was measured in cases consisting of “metal grid” (90. 71 dB) or of a woven willow “basket” (91. 61 dB), whereas a case of “aluminium” (103. 34 dB) generated the highest impact LAFmax. The frequency analyses determined especially low LAFmax in the frequency bands between 80 and 2500 Hz in cases designs “metal grid” and “basket”. The insertion of PU-foam achieved the most significant attenuation of LAFmax (− 13. 88 dB) and, in the frequency analyses, the best sound damping. Conclusion: The dropping of DUPLO bricks in cases contributes to the high noise level in nursery schools, but measured LAFmax show no evidence for the danger of acute hearing loss. However, continuous exposure may lead to functional impairment of the hair cells and trigger stress reactions. We recommend noise reduction by utilizing cases of woven “basket” with an insert of PU-foam...|$|E

The MVDR beamformer can be used for both speech dereverberation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> This paper provides new insights into the MVDR beamformer. Specifically, the local and global behavior of the MVDR beamformer is analyzed and novel forms of the MVDR filter are derived and discussed. In earlier works it was observed that there is a tradeoff between the amount of speech derever-beration and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> when the MVDR beamformer is used. Here, the tradeoff between speech dereverberation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> is analyzed thoroughly. The local and global behavior, as well as the tradeoff, is analyzed for different noise fields such as, for example, a mixture of coherent and non-coherent noise fields, entirely non-coherent noise fields and diffuse noise fields. It is shown that maximum <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> is achieved when the MVDR beamformer is used for <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> only. The amount of <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> that is sacrificed when complete dereverber-ation is required depends on the direct-to-reverberation ratio of the acoustic impulse response between the source and the reference microphone.
