We find that those firms that base their wages partly on seniority are less likely to offer explicit incentives. They are also less likely to invest in monitoring devices. We also discover that these companies are {{more likely to engage in}} other human resource management policies, which result in long employment relationships.

40|$|In {{the first}} essay, Distortions in the Neoclassical Growth Model: A Cross Country Analysis, I show that shocks that express {{themselves}} as {{total factor productivity}} and labor income taxes are comparably more synchronized than shocks that resemble distortions {{to the ability of}} allocating resources across time and states of the world. These two shocks are also the most important to model. Lastly, I document the importance of international channels of transmission for the shocks, given that these are spatially correlated and that international trade variables, such as trade openness correlate particularly well with them. The second essay is called Monetary Business Cycle Accounting for Sweden. Given that the analysis is focused in one country, I can extend the prototype economy to include a nominal interest rate <b>setting</b> <b>rule</b> and government bonds. As in the previous essay, distortions to the labor-leisure condition and total factor productivity are the most relevant margins to be modeled, now joined by deviations from the nominal interest rate <b>setting</b> <b>rule.</b> Also, distortions do not share a structural break during the Great Recession, but they do during the 1990 ’s.   Researchers aiming to model Swedish business cycles must take into account the structural changes the Swedish economy went through in the 1990 ’s, though not so during the last recession. The third essay, Consumer Confidence and Consumption Spending: Evidence for the United States and the Euro Area, we show that, the consumer confidence index can be in certain circumstances a good predictor of consumption. In particular, out-of-sample evidence shows that the contribution of confidence in explaining consumption expenditures increases when household survey indicators feature large changes, so that confidence indicators can have some increasing predictive power during such episodes. Moreover, there is some evidence of a confidence channel in the international transmission of shocks, as U. S. confidence indices help predicting consumer sentiment in the euro area...|$|E
40|$|This paper models {{a fiscal}} policy that pursues primary balance targets to {{stabilize}} the debt-to-GDP ratio in an open and heterogeneous economy where firms combine public and private capital to produce their goods. The model extends the European NAWM presented in Coenen et. al. (2008) and Christoffel et. al. (2008) by broadening the scope for fiscal policy implementation and allowing for heterogeneity in labor skills. The domestic economy is also assumed to follow a forward looking Taylor-rule consistent with an inflation targeting regime. We correct the NAWM specification of the final-goods price indices, the recursive representation of the wage <b>setting</b> <b>rule,</b> and the wage distortion index. We calibrate the model for Brazil to analyze some implications of monetary and fiscal policy interaction and explore some {{of the implications of}} fiscal policy in this class of DSGE models. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} extent of wage rigidities in Colombia over a period, 2002 - 2014, in which the fall in {{unemployment}} was relatively slow with respect to sustained economic growth. Following Holden and Wulfsberg (2009), we compute a measure of downward real wage rigidity (DRWR) of 12. 09 %, four times bigger than their aggregate estimate for the OECD economies. Moreover, {{in contrast to the}} evidence for the advanced economies, the determinants of such rigidities show no connection to the wage bargaining system. Amid the absence of effective labor market institutions to make rigidities less prevalent, economic growth appears as the most powerful mechanism to ward them off. Under this light, we provide a stylized description of the wage <b>setting</b> <b>rule</b> in Colombia, compare it with the common one in the advanced economies, and call for a far-reaching reform of the Colombian wage bargaining setup...|$|E

In this paper, we introduce a novel current controller which provides a very high closed-loop bandwidth, improves the robustness and disturbance rejection, and eliminates the noise and sampling errors in the feedback path. In order to achieve these goals, we suppress the transport delays by introducing an improved execution schedule of the control interrupt and by inserting a cascaded multiplier of differential character. With the novel gain <b>setting</b> <b>rule,</b> the closed loop bandwidth reaches 17 % of the sampling frequency, disturbance rejection capability is doubled, the step response has a negligible overshoot, and the robustness is characterized by the vector margin of 0. 65.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{counter-cyclical}} and counter-inflation monetary policy rules are crucial for monetary business cycle models {{to match the}} observed negative (or weak) correlation of {{the growth rate of}} money and output, inflation, and the interest rate at business cycle frequencies, which were reported as puzzling in Cooley and Hansen (1998) under the AR- 1 money growth rate rule. The results are robust for both flexible and sticky price models. Regarding the relative performance of the realistic and/or estimated monetary policy rules in matching the comovement properties of money growth, the feedback interest rate <b>setting</b> <b>rule</b> on output and inflation, which is consistent with a simple VAR model, outperforms the policy rule suggested by Taylor (1993), the forward-looking monetary policy rule as in Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000), the feedback money growth rate rules on output and inflation, and the feedback money growth rate rules on productivity shocks. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{lead time}} that is short, predictable, and {{reliable}} is an increasingly important criterion in supplier selection. Although many companies may achieve this through lean implementation, high-variety manufacturers, for example, small and medium-sized make-to-order companies, have found that lean's planning and control techniques do not apply. This article outlines a planning and control concept known as workload control (WLC) that integrates customer enquiry management, including a due-date <b>setting</b> <b>rule,</b> with order release control. Simulation is then used to assess its impact on shop performance. Results demonstrate that an integrated WLC concept can reduce the percentage of tardy jobs—so short lead times can be realistically quoted—while also reducing and stabilizing workloads. WLC can level demand and production over time when work is not standardized {{and it is not}} possible to synchronize flows on the shop floor. Results are shown to be robust to changes in routing characteristics, the mix of orders with due dates specified by the customer and proposed internally, and the strike rate (or order-winning probability). Hence, an integrated approach to WLC represents an important step toward achieving lean in make-to-order companies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies code {{synchronization}} in time hopping (TH) ultra wideband (UWB) systems. In TH UWB systems, narrow pulses {{based on}} Gaussian pulse are positioned in different locations in consecutive time frames. The location of each frame {{is defined by}} a spreading code. The receiver collects {{the energy of the}} pulses using the same spreading code. To be able to do that, it has to synchronize itself to the incoming signal. Due to the large bandwidth of the signal, several replicas of the signals arrive into the receiver. Thus, the energy of the signal is spread in time domain causing extra problems to the synchronization procedure. In this paper, earlierly proposed method for direct sequence spread spectrum system is applied for time hopping system. The method is simulated in a multipath environment. The performance measure used is the mean acquisition time. Constant false alarm rate criterion is used for the threshold <b>setting</b> <b>rule</b> for comparator. The energies of the multipath components are combined in the acquisition process. Therefore, diversity combining is obtained in the acquisition process, which also leads to performance improvement. 1...|$|E

40|$|Setting short yet {{reliable}} Due Dates (DDs) is {{an important}} early production planning and control task. The majority of job-shop research on DD setting assumes simple product structures without assembly operations. However, in practice, product structures are often complex, and multiple final assembly operations may be required. This paper evaluates the performance of DD setting rules {{in the context of}} complex product structures, considering two scenarios: two-level assembly job shops, where orders converge on one final assembly operation; and two-level multi-stage job shops, where a series of assembly operations are undertaken. New rules are proposed which are substantially simpler and more suitable for practical use than those in the literature. These rules are only outperformed by a more sophisticated rule from the wider literature, newly introduced into the context of assembly and multi-stage job shops. Which rule to apply in practice depends on whether a manager considers the improvement in performance more important than the loss of simplicity. Future research should investigate how jobs can be planned and controlled effectively when some or all DDs are set externally by customers rather than internally using a DD <b>setting</b> <b>rule.</b> © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
