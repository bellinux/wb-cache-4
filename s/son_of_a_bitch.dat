A typical Homicide: Life on the Street episode usually results in {{only three or four}} pages. Yoshimura made several modifications {{with the help of his}} writing assistant Joy Lusco, a future writer on Simon's HBO series The Wire. The changes included removing several instances of the words [...] "ass" [...] and [...] "bitch" [...] from the script. Lange's line, [...] "Why am I even saying the <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch's</b> name?"

5000|$|The word {{appears in}} {{graffiti}} {{on a wall}} in the 1969 film Bronco Bullfrog.

[...] In the same year, the word was used in the film Women in Revolt, in which Holly Woodlawn shouts [...] "I love cunt" [...] whilst avoiding a violent boyfriend. Nicholson later used it again, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Two early films by Martin Scorsese, Mean Streets (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), use the word {{in the context of the}} virgin-whore dichotomy, with characters using it after they were rejected (in Mean Streets) or after they have slept with the woman (in Taxi Driver).|$|R

500|$|Hemingway {{learned from}} Ezra Pound {{how to achieve}} a stripped-down style and how to {{incorporate}} the concepts of imagism in his prose. He said Pound [...] "had taught him more 'about how to write and how not to write' than any <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him [...] "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism. Instead of more conventional literary allusions, Hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as [...] "the blanket" [...] and [...] "the bunk" [...] {{in a series of}} objective correlatives, a technique Hemingway learned from T.S. Eliot. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.|$|E

500|$|In 1952, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} John Wayne {{again in}} Ford's romantic comedy-drama film, The Quiet Man. Shot {{on location in}} Cong, County Mayo, Ireland, O'Hara cited the film to be her [...] "personal favourite of all the pictures I have made. It is the one I am most proud of, and I {{tend to be very}} protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her." [...] Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O'Hara was disconcerted with Ford's harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing. Though Ford generally treated her very well, on one occasion when filming a cart scene in which the wind in her eyes made it difficult to see, Ford yelled [...] "Open your damn eyes" [...] and O'Hara flipped, responding with [...] "What would a bald-headed <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs".|$|E

The first bands of the newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits, often causing clubs to specialise, presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock. Differences in ideology, attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between the two audiences.

500|$|Hemingway was {{inspired}} by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence {{can be seen in}} the stripped-down, minimalist style [...] characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound [...] "taught [...] more about how to write and how not to write than any <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> alive". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to [...] "get the most from the least, [...] prune language, [...] multiply intensities, [...] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1779, Washington and Congress decided to strike the Iroquois warriors of the [...] "Six Nations" [...] in a {{campaign}} to force Britain's Indian allies out of New York, which they had used as a base to attack American settlements around New England. In June 1779, the Indian warriors joined with Tory rangers led by Colonel William Butler and slew over 200 frontiersmen, using barbarities normally shunned, and laid waste to the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. One British officer who witnessed the Tory brutality said that the redcoats on return to England would [...] "scalp every <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> of them." [...] In August 1779, General John Sullivan led a military operation that destroyed at least 40 Iroquois villages, burning all available crops. Few people were killed as the Indians fled to British protection in Canada. Sullivan later reported that [...] "the immediate objects of this expedition are accomplished, viz: total ruin of the Indian settlements {{and the destruction of}} their crops, which were designed for the support of those inhuman barbarians." ...|$|E

Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He {{tried and failed to}} grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. [...] Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead.

500|$|Sandi Mann concludes {{from her}} {{research}} that the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries. In the service industry, for example, {{she explains that}} products have become more uniform {{over the past few}} decades. Thus, the sole way for companies to distinguish themselves is to have better customer service. She notes that there are positive and negative effects. A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays. A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome. [...] In an interview for the Wall Street Journal, an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch.</b> Clenching his teeth, he responded [...] "Thank you very much, you have a nice day." [...] The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused people like the telemarketer to feel insincere and phony.

500|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{began its}} dealings with Canada badly, with Kennedy mispronouncing Diefenbaker's {{name in a}} press conference announcing the Prime Minister's visit to Washington in February 1961. A furious Diefenbaker brought up in Cabinet whether to send a note of protest at the gaffe to Washington; his colleagues were inclined to let the matter pass. When the two met in Washington on February 20, Diefenbaker was impressed by Kennedy, and invited him to visit Ottawa. President Kennedy, however, told his aides that he never wanted [...] "to see the boring <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> again". The Ottawa visit also began badly: at the welcome at the airport, Kennedy again mispronounced Diefenbaker's name and stated that after hearing the Prime Minister's (notoriously bad) French, he was uncertain if he should venture into the language (Kennedy's French was equally bad). After meeting with Diefenbaker, Kennedy accidentally left behind a briefing note suggesting he [...] "push" [...] Diefenbaker on several issues, including the decision to accept nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, which bitterly divided the Cabinet. Diefenbaker was also annoyed by Kennedy's speech to Parliament, in which he urged Canada to join the OAS (which Diefenbaker had already rejected), and by the President spending most of his time talking to Leader of the Opposition Pearson at the formal dinner. Both Kennedy and his wife Jackie were bored by Diefenbaker's Churchill anecdotes at lunch, stories that Jackie Kennedy later described as [...] "painful".|$|E
500|$|The 1927 New York Yankees team is {{considered}} one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderer's Row because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2–2 tie. [...] "Sixty! Let's see some <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted [...]356, drove in 164 runs and slugged [...]772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field. According to Appel, [...] "The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team." ...|$|E
