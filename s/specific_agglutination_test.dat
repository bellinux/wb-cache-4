40|$|The University of Reading has {{conducted}} some preliminary {{work on the}} prevalence of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and Arenavirus in Norway rats trapped from farms and semi-urban areas in central southern England. Campylobacter {{is the cause of}} a notificable disease in the UK, with 57, 772 cases reported for England and Wales in 2009. Transmission to humans is believed to be primarily through undercooked meat, from contaminated water, and through contact with pets; and symptoms include a high temperature, severe diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Ninety-seven per-cent of sporadic cases have been attributed to farm animals, and in particular the meat and poultry industry. There are eighteen species of Campylobacter, eleven of which can be pathogenic to humans; although the principal species that cause gastrointestinal disease in humans are C. jejuni and C. coli; although C. lari, C. helveticus and C. upsaliensis are also involved. Salmonella species also causes a gastrointestinal disease, and in the UK, is common in chicken and has been linked to egg production. Species are typed using antigen <b>specific</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests,</b> or by their susceptibility to specific bacteriophage. Some strains are known to be linked with human disease (eg.

40|$|We {{report a}} simple and rapid room {{temperature}} assay for point-of-care (POC) testing {{that is based on}} <b>specific</b> <b>agglutination.</b> <b>Agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> are based on aggregation of microbeads {{in the presence of a}} specific analyte thus enabling the macroscopic observation. Such tests are most often used to explore antibody-antigen reactions. Agglutination has been used for protein assays using a biotin/streptavidin system as well as a hybridization based assay. The agglutination systems are prone to selftermination of the linking analyte, prone to active site saturation and loss of agglomeration at high analyte concentrations. We investigated the molecular target/ligand interaction, explaining the common agglutination problems related to analyte self-termination, linkage of the analyte to the same bead instead of different microbeads. We classified the agglutination process into three kinds of assays: a two- component assay, a three-component assay and a stepped three- component assay. Although we compared these three kinds of assays for recognizing DNA and protein molecules, the assay can be used for virtually any molecule, including ions and metabolites. In total, the optimized assay permits detecting analytes with high sensitivity in a short time, 5 min, at room temperature. Such a system is appropriate for POC testing...|$|R

We report here {{a simple}} and {{economical}} slide <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> the co-agglutination (Co-A) test, {{for the detection of}} circulating amebic antigen in sera for the diagnosis of amebic liver abscess. Fifty serum specimens from cases of amebic liver abscess, 25 from other individuals with parasitic and miscellaneous infections, and 25 from healthy controls were tested for the presence of serum antigen by the Co-A test. Forty-five (90 %) amebic liver abscess sera were found to be amebic-antigen positive by the Co-A test. None of 25 sera from healthy controls were positive for the antigen. However, false-positive results were seen with two sera from those with other parasitic and miscellaneous infection controls.

40|$|We {{report a}} simple and rapid room {{temperature}} assay for point-of-care (POC) testing {{that is based on}} <b>specific</b> <b>agglutination.</b> <b>Agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> are based on aggregation of microparticles {{in the presence of a}} specific analyte thus enabling the macroscopic observation. Agglutination-based tests are most often used to explore the antibody-antigen reactions. Agglutination has been used for mode protein assays using a biotin/streptavidin two-component system, as well as a hybridization based two-component assay; however, as our work shows, two-component systems are prone to self-termination of the linking analyte and thus have a lower sensitivity. Three component systems have also been used with DNA hybridization, as in our work; however, their assay requires 48 hours for incubation, while our assay is performed in 5 minutes making it a real candidate for POC testing. We demonstrate three assays: a two-component biotin/streptavidin assay, a three-component hybridization assay using single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules and a stepped three-component hybridization assay. The comparison of these three assays shows our simple stepped three-component agglutination assay to be rapid at room temperature and more sensitive than the two-component version by an order of magnitude. An agglutination assay was also performed in a PDMS microfluidic chip where agglutinated beads were trapped by filter columns for easy observation. We developed a rapid (5 minute) room temperature assay, which is based on microbead agglutination. Our three-component assay solves the linker self-termination issue allowing an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over two–component assays. Our stepped version of the three-component assay solves the issue with probe site saturation thus enabling a wider range of detection. Detection of the agglutinated beads with the naked eye by trapping in microfluidic channels has been shown...|$|R

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{described}} for the preparation of Treponema pallidum suspensions that are suitable for <b>specific</b> <b>agglutination</b> studies and can be stored at 4 °C. for months without loss of agglutinability. Such suspensions {{have been shown to}} react with two distinct antibodies in the serum of syphilitic animals and man: Wassermann antibody and a specific treponeme agglutinin. It has been demonstrated that the agglutination of treponemes by specific treponeme agglutinin is enhanced by heat treatment or aging of the suspension, and inhibited by a divalent cation, probably Ca++, normally present in serum. This inhibition has been overcome by the use of a chelating agent, ethylene-diamine tetracetate. These findings have been utilized to devise a simple <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of treponeme infections that is very sensitive and highly specific.

Positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained in eight of 187 (4. 3 %) serum samples from four of these eight patients. The other four patients with invasive aspergillosis gave consistently negative latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests.</b> A positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was the first indication of invasive aspergillosis in two patients; these patients were already on amphotericin B. Positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were the only evidence of invasive aspergillosis in one patient who subsequently died of the infection. False positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained in five of 83 (6 %) patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis and misleading positive cultures seen in nine of 83 (10. 8 %). No antibodies were detected in three of four liver transplant patients with invasive aspergillosis. Conversely, antibodies were detected in 63 of 262 (24 %) serum samples from 43 liver transplant patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis; one of these patients had an antibody titre of 1 : 2 on four separate occasions. CONCLUSIONS [...] The Pastorex aspergillus antigen latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> when used alone, lacks sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. A diagnosis was made in all patients with invasive aspergillosis when both culture and antigen tests were performed although using these criteria a false positive diagnosis would {{have been made in}} 13 of 83 (15. 6 %) patients. Microbiological and serial serological investigations for antigen should both be performed and the results considered in conjunction with radiological and clinical evidence...|$|R
40|$|Trichomoniasis is a {{worldwide}} infection {{and due to}} its complications rapid and accurate diagnosis of infection especially in pregnant women is very important. In this study, development of a latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> using native antigens for rapid diagnosis of trichomoniasis is investigated. Trichomonas vaginalis was harvested from TYIS 33 culture medium and anti Trichomonas vaginalis antiserum was raised in rabbits. Salt precipitation method was used for antibody purification. Polyesteren latex particles coated with purified antibody and used for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis. Clinical samples of vaginal discharge were collected from 500 women and examined for Trichomonas vaginalis by using wet mount, culture and latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests.</b> Sensitivity and specificity of latex test was determined considering culture as golden standard. Sensitivity and specificity of latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was 100 % and 81 % and those of wet mount were 33. 3 % and 100 %, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> were 6 % and 100 %, respectively. Due to inconvenient sensitivity and specificity of the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> developed in this study, further work is recommended to improve the test...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 163 stool {{specimens}} were tested for detection of Clostridium difficile and its toxin by cytotoxicity assay with tissue culture, latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> and {{isolation of the}} organism. From 33 specimens which were positive for toxin by cytotoxicity, 30 were positive by the latex agglutination test; the organism was isolated from 21. The {{total number of samples}} which were positive with the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was 44. The predictive value of a positive latex agglutination result relative to the cytotoxicity test was 68 %, and the predictive value of a negative result was 97. 5 %. The specificity and sensitivity of the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> relative to the cytotoxicity assay and the low cost and simple facilities required indicate that the latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> is a useful procedure for screening for C. difficile toxins, provided that positive latex results are confirmed by cytotoxicity assay...|$|R
40|$|A new slide latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was {{compared}} with microscopy and culture for diagnosing vaginal candidosis in 367 women attending a genitourinary medicine clinic. Vaginal candidosis occurred in 10 % of the patients, and 7 % had commensal carriage of Candida spp. The slide latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> {{was superior to}} microscopy in immediate diagnosis and was rapid and simple to perform. Of the patients with vaginal candidosis, 72 % were detected by slide latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> compared with 38 % by microscopy. The test discriminated well between patients yielding cultures of Candida spp who had symptoms and signs and those who showed commensal carriage...|$|R
