40|$|Abstract: With rapid urbanization, {{the volume}} of traffic in urban area has been {{significantly}} increased. This in turn led to problem which {{can be described as}} Road Traffic Noise. Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation of <b>soundproofing</b> <b>walls</b> is rising. Among different shapes of <b>soundproof</b> <b>walls</b> being installed, the reflection-type acoustical insulation panel is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque acoustical insulation panel. On the other hand, improving the <b>soundproofing</b> <b>wall</b> of the reflection-type acoustical insulation barrier panel needs to be focused on since it has a possibility to cause a secondary damage by reflected sounds. Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape of the reflection-type soundproofing panel. A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type soundproofing panel and the improved soundproofing panel, with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type of soundproofing panel has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors. Thus, it turns out that the study shows a potential possibility to develop a reduction technology of the reflected sound...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{becomes a}} very {{important}} issue to reach a level of comfort in the room. The choice of material is less precise also be the cause of the noise. The sound reduction may occur {{depending on the type of}} material absorption. Several previous studies have examined the multiple alternative materials <b>soundproof</b> <b>walls</b> that have characteristics similar to the dried banana stems, as examples of which are: coconut husks, rice husks and waste wood saws.

30|$|SLEs are {{physical}} {{spaces that}} {{are able to}} combine digital and physical learning worlds into hybrid environments (see section “Theoretical conclusions on SLEs, IoT and physical learning nodes”). Design pattern (C) is the third phase of the design process; as such, it builds on the second phase’s didactical variety. The design process for hybrid learning spaces has to make use of ubiquitous but invisible IoT infrastructure. Co-working spaces serve as good examples for the physical design. The ambience affects the learning culture. It makes a difference if the learner happens to be in a grey office or is immersed in the sensual design of a Google Office. These extremes are meant to exemplify the point, but the designer does have to strike the right balance. According to the study, the most important success factor is to create a “learning-friendly atmosphere (C 15),” which can be fostered with plenty of daylight, fresh air and sufficient shade, heating and cooling. Also, IoT integration should enable automated, (individual) control over these “standard requirements (C 14).” Plenty of good-sized windows that admit a lot of daylight into the room are beneficial.

The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them.

5000|$|The Zentrale Hauptverwaltung (ZHvDR—central headquarters) of Deutsche Reichsbahn {{was given}} the task of {{carrying}} out preliminary planning work at the Erfurt node on 18 August 1992. Planning work was then started. The preliminary planning documents were provided to ZHvDR for confirmation in mid-1993. They proposed a new electronic signalling centre, the renewal of 44 km tracks and 143 sets of points. 11 bridges in the urban area of Erfurt would be replaced or rehabilitated. The estimated cost of these measures was DM 439 million. The station was comprehensively modernised from 2002—after the demolition of the historical island building, which gave the station its appearance until then—and was officially {{handed over to the}} traffic on 13 December 2008, although not all reconstruction work had yet been completed. The cost of the reconstruction would amount to about €260 million. The Free State of Thuringia and the City of Erfurt would contribute €44 million of this. The planning approval for the reconstruction was given in the mid-1990s. The official groundbreaking was celebrated on 22 September 2001. The newly constructed track layout comprise 21 platform tracks at 12 platforms as well as 67 sets of points. Six railway bridges were built during the construction work. Underneath the station a shopping arcade has been built on an area of around 3,000 m². Underneath this shopping arcade is an underground car park. Both facilities were reduced in size during the planning phase. An open competition was held for the design of the new station. In the autumn of 1995, an eleven-member jury selected the winning plan for the station from a total of 123 submissions. Civil protests against the demolition of the historic island building, which was supported by a building historian of the Bauhaus University, Weimar, were not considered. Planning approval was given for the reconstruction of the railway node in September 1995. The planned measures included five kilometres of track, 46 kilometres of overhead wires and the renewal of eight railway bridges. The financing agreement for the reconstruction was concluded on 26 March 1998. The planned total costs were around DM 207 million. Work would start in the autumn of 1999 and be completed in 2003. An electronic interlocking for controlling the Erfurt rail node was put into operations {{before the start of the}} large-scale construction work on 14 March 1999. This replaced the eight relay, electro-mechanical and mechanical signal boxes, which were up to 92 years old and controlled by up to three train dispatchers, 155 sets of points, 154 signals and 119 repeater signals. This early completion had become necessary, as there was a ban had been placed on refurbishing the old signalling technology. Conceptually, the plan provided for a safety-related longitudinal separation of the station, in order to be able to carry out the rebuilding in stages. The electronic interlocking is now remote-controlled from the Leipzig signalling centre. In October 2001, Vieselbach and Hopfgarten stations and three block posts were also connected to the Erfurt electronic interlocking. The renovated entrance building went into operation on 21 August 2002 after eight months of construction. The construction works, which were then estimated to cost around €250 million were expected to be completed by 2006. The extensive reconstruction of Erfurt Hauptbahnhof started in 2002. A comprehensive redesign of the track layout was carried out as well as the demolition of part of the existing entrance building and the underpass of Bahnhofstraße. As a result of the rebuilding, Erfurt Hauptbahnhof will be able to operate as a junction between the Nuremberg-Erfurt and Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed lines. A major goal of the planning was to link the ICE line between Munich and Berlin with the ICE line between Frankfurt am Main and Dresden and to reduce travel times by means of interchange. In the meantime, the construction work was suspended for two years, when it was unclear whether the two high-speed lines projects connecting with Erfurt would be realised. The new station was built in several stages, as train operations had to be fully maintained. A provisional platform for the additional track 7a was first built on the south side of the station. An island platform with nine through tracks and four bay platforms were built. The two outside located long-distance platforms 1/2 and 9/10 have a length of 420 metres. The two-aisled, 154 metre long hall roof consists of one side aisle that has a 20 metre wide span and another side aisle that has 65 metre wide span, with a maximum height of around 20 metres. The originally planned length was 190 metres. During the rebuilding of the around 2.5 kilometre-long rail junction area, <b>soundproof</b> <b>walls</b> with a total length of around 3.0 kilometres were also installed. The converted entrance hall was opened in 2005 as a first part of the new railway station. The north side of the main station was officially put into operation at the timetable change in December 2005. It consisted of a [...] "half" [...] glass hall on the upper floor, which spans the newly opened northern island platform with tracks 1 and 2 and partly the middle platform, as well as a shopping arcade on the ground floor and an underground car park. At this time, the planned total costs were €260 million. These funds were supplied by the state of Thuringia, the city of Erfurt and Deutsche Bahn. The next section was opened on 3 June 2007. Working to a 44-hour limit, the northern part of the platform with track 3 as well as the four new tracks 4 and 5 on the eastern platform and 6 and 7 on the western platform were put into operation. In the last phase of construction, the old southern part of the track area (old tracks 5, 6, 7 and 7a), including the old pedestrian overbridge, were demolished by March 2008. Then the rest of the glass roof construction and the platforms underneath were built with tracks 8, 9 and 10. Commissioning took place on 30 November 2008 after a 27-hour total blockade. In the process, the southern long-distance platform 9 was put into operation, first as a 320 metre-long bay platform without overhead wire, and platform 10 was opened with a provisional connection until two subsequent bridge structures were completed in the eastern exit. At the end of May 2012, in a 64-hour possession, additional tracks for the high-speed lines were integrated east and west of the station with a length of 12 kilometres. The platforms 9/10 were now connected in both directions and its full length of 420 metres was usable as an ICE platform. In addition, the new southern entrance to the Flutgraben was handed over and the waiting room was redesigned. A crossing structure was built east of the station in Daberstedt to allow trains on the high-speed to Leipzig to pass over the tracks of the lines from Sangerhausen and Wolkramshausen. At Pentecost 2013, the structure was put into operation during a further blockade of the node. The commissioning of five tracks in the western part of the station took place at that time. A total of nine full possessions are planned for the integration of the two new lines. A total of €336 million had been invested up to May 2012 of the total estimated cost of €480 million. Several dozen companies and more than 300 people were involved in the project (as of August 2014). The station was fully blockaded from 20 to 22 November 2015 for the commissioning of additional tracks. Two further construction stages, each requiring a full possession, are still outstanding. At the end of November 2017, a blockade is foreseen for the installation of a new software version of the ETCS. After the completion of the work, the running speed will be raised to 100 km/h. In a second stage of construction, the line from Eisenach is to be connected with the high-speed lines to Leipzig. Due to a lack of funds, this is only an option for which appropriate land has been reserved. Located in the area of the station are two of the three electronic interlocking subcentres (Erfurt and Erfurt NBS), Erfurt Knoten and Erfurt Neubaustrecke, as well as two of the five ETCS Radio Block Centres of the new high-speed lines, being built under German Unity Transport Project No. 8 (Verkehrsprojekt Deutsche Einheit Nr. 8). These facilities are housed in a modular building on the north side of the freight station.|$|R
