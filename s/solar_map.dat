50|$|According {{to policy}} makers in certain cities, a <b>Solar</b> <b>Map</b> serves {{multiple}} roles. According to government officials, solar maps help {{keep track of}} progress on sustainability goals for the city or town in which they live. If they prefer to establish a more eco-friendly environment, a <b>solar</b> <b>map,</b> in their minds, would be the right tool to use in measuring this goal. Another idea in why a local city government may want to provide a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> online is to promote self-awareness of citizens own electrical consumption {{as well as to}} educate citizens of the possible rewards of using solar power instead of other conventional sources of power. By reflecting on the potential savings that a homeowner can earn, the thought goes, the idea of a high cost of installing solar power could be diminished. Thus encouraging homeowners to install photovoltaic panels.|$|E
50|$|Making a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> is a {{complicated}} process. It requires sophisticated instruments to measure certain environmental conditions and a big background in computer science in constructing solar maps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>maps</b> come in {{a variety}} of {{different}} forms. The form in which they appear mostly depends on the background of the person studying the map.|$|R
30|$|In the {{solution}} {{there is a}} dual-axis solar tracking system, based on <b>solar</b> <b>maps,</b> which can predict the exact apparent position of the sun, by latitude location, thereby avoiding the need to use sensors or guidance systems (Abdallah and Nijmeh 2004).|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, these maps are {{generally}} studied by scholars or {{people that come}} from an academic background. <b>Solar</b> <b>maps</b> in this form, for the most part, illustrate {{the extent to which}} a certain area experiences sunlight through the use of multiple shades and colors such as blue, green, yellow, red, and brown. These maps include quantitative data that shows specifically which regions of the map is experiencing certain specified amounts of solar energy or radiation from the sun. The regions(i.e. countries, towns, continents, cities etc.) that are illustrated in these <b>solar</b> <b>maps</b> may depend on the topic that the scholar studying. Normally, they are simple, and focused to prove a point that a scholar is making.|$|R
50|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>map,</b> in general, is {{a map of}} a city, state, country, or {{any piece}} of land that {{illustrates}} information about how much a certain piece of land, building, or home experiences {{a certain amount of}} sunlight. Though solar maps are illustrated in many forms, a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> essentially records where and to what extent a certain location experiences a certain amount of sunlight or radiation. It normally combines topographic, meteorological, and sometimes financial data to help scholars or consumers and investors in promoting awareness of the potential of solar power.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> to be made, two main types of data must be collected. Those two types of data include Meteorological Data and Topographical Data. The Meteorological data is used in {{calculations}} pertaining to Solar Energy. Such measurements {{of this type of}} data include the measurements of the position of the sun, overall atmospheric conditions, latitude, and shading. Topographical data on the other hand, is used in illustrating the amount of area exposed to a certain degree of radiation from the sun or in calculations that present how much area of a physical object is experiencing direct contact with the sun's rays. In some cases, Financial Data may also be collected to be presented on a <b>solar</b> <b>map.</b> When this happens, that means that the <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> would appear online for a certain city. The reasons why financial data is collected and presented on these solar maps is to encourage a certain productive behavior among citizens.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) <b>solar</b> <b>maps</b> {{based on}} Radiance {{simulations}} are presented {{for a future}} city district in southern Norway. The surface mapping method provides the commercial developer with a practical tool to evaluate the potential for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The <b>solar</b> <b>maps</b> identify the optimum roof and facade areas available for solar energy utilization. The importance of BIPV and facade utilization in new city developments is discussed, along with key questions raised by the commercial developer regarding the practical implementation of BIPV solutions. Based on feedback from the building industry, a simplified model has been implemented to evaluate surface areas producing a profit or a loss over the PV system lifetime. As tilted photovoltaic (PV) modules installed on flat roofs are not building integrated, three simulation variants have been performed for flat roofs with a small inclination up to ten degrees. For some buildings this will give a small gain in annual PV production and payback time. The resulting 3 D <b>solar</b> <b>maps</b> give the developer a possibility to review early-stage plans in terms of building shapes and positions in the landscape, {{in order to maximize}} utilization of the available solar resource. This enables cost- and energy-efficient development of nearly zero-energy buildings in future city districts...|$|R

Using this map and an empirical model for energy consumption, we perform dynamic programming to find energy-minimal paths. We validate our map construction and path planning algorithms with outdoor experiments, and perform simulations on our solar maps to further determine the limits of our approach. Our results show that we can effectively construct a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> using only a simple cur-rent measurement circuit and basic GPS localization, and this <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> can be used for energy-efficient navigation.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} is {{on a permanent}} rise and {{it is becoming increasingly}} concentrated in cities. Hence, cities have to work on saving energy and being more efficient by finding sources with great potential to produce their own energy and implanting the correct policies. Photovoltaics is the renewable energy technology with the higher potential in the urban context and Sweden is highly committed on its investment since it is the less developed renewable source in the country. The aim of the thesis is to compare two methodologies and determine which one is better or gives more relevant information for this kind of studies in order to evaluate how good a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> is. For doing this, {{the first step is to}} create a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> to have a general idea about the solar potential and to know which roofs are more suitable to install PV systems. This is made with LiDAR data using ArcGIS and SEES software. After that, another study on the quantity of solar power that could be obtained from those roofs will be performed using PVsyst, where it is possible to develop an entire PV system installation and obtain more exhaust results on energy production and shadowing. Four buildings are going to be evaluated, two public ones located in Gävle city centre (Library and Concert House) and two residential ones located in Sätra. Factors such as the optimal tilt, the best azimuth angle and the distance between panel rows are dimensioned in order to reduce shading loss and improve the performance ratio of the system in PVsyst. The final system is defined with 10 ° tilt, south orientation (0 ° azimuth), 1. 5 meters distance between rows and modules in strings of 9 panels connected in series for the four buildings. The simulated production from the best alternative is compared with the <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> results. Since the <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> contains information about total yearly irradiation, the energy production is obtained by means of visual exploration of the results combined with simple calculations that include GCR and system efficiency. The results show that a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> is a reliable tool to obtain a general estimation of the solar potential in buildings but it is necessary to first identify its limitations and be able to filter the results. On the other hand, PVsyst software allows making several simulations and eases to obtain a PV system in a building or structure with detailed results of the system components. It can be concluded that since the PVsyst only allows to work with specific buildings or structures, a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> permits big amounts of data calculations. It can be said that a <b>solar</b> <b>map</b> takes part in the process of obtaining a pre-project and the PVsyst is used in the project when a real installation is sized. Nevertheless, both methods are found to be reliable and suitable for solar potential assessment works since the results obtained match...|$|E

40|$|International audienceConsidering {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} of satellite-based databases of surface solar irradiation such as HelioClim- 3, the geographic scale of <b>solar</b> <b>mapping</b> {{that can be}} derived is approx. 1 / 5 000 000. This geographic scale is suitable for continent or country <b>solar</b> <b>mapping.</b> Nevertheless, customers' feedback notably states {{that there is a}} need of spatial resolution improvement. In this context of spatial resolution improvement of solar resource estimation, the project solar atlas in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (PACA), finalized in December 2010, aims at increasing spatial resolution of HelioClim- 3 to derive 250 m resolution <b>solar</b> <b>maps.</b> The <b>solar</b> atlas accounts for the global, direct and diffuse on inclined plane or in normal incidence irradiations and their temporal variations intra and inter-annual, on a monthly basis, since February 2004. The Digital Elevation Model SRTM-V 4 is used to get topographic data with a spatial resolution of approximately 100 m and a localization accuracy of typically 10 m. This topographic data is used to estimate high resolution terrain effects on HelioClim- 3 derived solar radiation fields, taking into account orographic effects: * Effects of optical path length variations due to terrain elevation; * Shadow effects on direct and circumsolar diffuse radiation computed from local horizon estimation; * Horizon effects on isotropic diffuse radiation with the sky view factor estimation. These orographic phenomena are indeed the source of significant local spatial variations in solar radiation values and potentially discriminating in choosing the location, the calculation of profitability or the sizing of photovoltaic or thermodynamic solar power systems. <b>Solar</b> <b>mapping</b> with a geographic scale of 1 / 3 000 000 or more does not represent properly these local phenomena. In order to establish an accurate mapping at 250 m with associated uncertainty using HelioClim- 3 data, procedures of calibration has been established with meteorological ground stations. The global horizontal irradiation is calibrated thanks to the Météo France meteorological network comprising, in PACA, about 30 automatic ground stations delivering at least daily global irradiation on horizontal plane. A strict data quality control has been applied to these ground data to guarantee their quality as reference ground-based daily irradiation data. The diffuse and direct irradiations are calibrated thanks to three specific ground stations dedicated expressly to the project, delivering one year of simultaneous 10 -min global and diffuse irradiations on the horizontal plan and direct irradiation on normal incidence. Statistical analysis of direct and cross-validation estimation errors after calibration with the pyranometric ground stations has been made to establish the uncertainties associated with the solar atlas. The root mean square error of monthly irradiation estimation is about 5 % (c. 5 kWh / m 2) for global, direct and diffuse components on horizontal plane, without significant bias error. The accuracy of monthly direct normal irradiation is about 10 % (c. 15 kWh/m 2). Data from the solar atlas in PACA is available for free at www. atlas-solaire. fr.
