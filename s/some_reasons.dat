5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. <b>Some</b> <b>reasons</b> put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{satellite}} {{rights of}} the film were sold to Kalaignar TV. The film was initially scheduled for a late 2009 release, but was pushed to 14 January 2010 coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Thai Pongal. Karthi's second film Aayirathil Oruvan, which was in production for nearly three years, was also planned to release on the same day. According to the Tamil Film Producers Council, two films starring the same actor could not be released on the same day, so Aayirathil Oruvan was given priority, whilst Paiyaa was postponed for 30 days. The release was postponed again for <b>some</b> <b>reasons,</b> before finally hitting the screens on 2 April 2010. The film had its premiere at the Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai.|$|E

Some time the reasons are because of the child's behavior, and some times the causes are because of parents. A child not going to school or not doing home work and thus fearing beatings, is a very common cause. A child stealing money, fighting with siblings are reasons too.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, {{evolutionary}} biologist Daniel H. Janzen {{concluded that}} the avocado {{is an example of}} an 'evolutionary anachronism', a fruit adapted for ecological relationship with now-extinct large mammals (such as giant ground sloths or gomphotheres). Most large fleshy fruits serve the function of seed dispersal, accomplished by their consumption by large animals. There are <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> to think that the fruit, with its mildly toxic pit, may have coevolved with Pleistocene megafauna to be swallowed whole and excreted in their dung, ready to sprout. No extant native animal is large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruins of}} Pattan Minara are located at a {{distance}} of about 8 kilometers in east south of Rahim Yar Khan city. It has variously been described as the remains of Mauryan period, who built it in 250 BCE or a Buddhist monastery. Nearby the minar, remains of a fort, a mosque and some tunnels are also visible. About 110 years ago, Colonel Minchin a political agent of Ex-Bahawalpur state, started the excavation of these tunnels but discontinued digging for <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> or other. According to Colonel Toy, it was the capital of the Hindu state in 10 CE. In the mid of the 18th century, Fazal Elahi Khan Halani, a Daupauta chief, destroyed it and used its materials in the construction of Bhagla and Dingarh Fort.|$|E
25|$|Median power {{frequency}} {{is often used}} {{as a way to}} track fatigue using EMG. Using the median {{power frequency}}, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the first window may be the first second, the second window might be at second 15, and the third window could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. <b>Some</b> <b>reasons</b> why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> {{to believe that}} {{seasonal}} changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus {{is known to have}} a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the albedo patterns. In addition, the microwave data showed increases in pole–equator contrast after the 1986 solstice. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, having bolstered expectations that it would brighten soon. In particular, an analog of the bright polar collar present in its southern hemisphere at −45° was expected to appear in its northern part. This indeed happened in 2007 when Uranus passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, whereas the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained asymmetric, with northern winds being slightly slower than southern.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} reasons for fights during a hockey game. <b>Some</b> <b>reasons</b> are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, {{attempting}} to draw [...] "reaction penalties", and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers. Fights often start {{in response to an}} opponent's rough play.|$|E

The minister wrote that the people, especially the children, learned English with ease after they had learned to write Gaelic. The minister also gave <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> why the people were keen to learn English, telling us that [...] "English being the language universally spoken by the higher classes, {{the mass of the}} people attach a notion of superior refinement to the possession of it".

500|$|Alex Chan, 27 {{years old}} at the time of the civil unrest, was a French-born {{freelance}} industrial designer whose parents were Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong. Although Chan was successful professionally, he felt that there was racial and cultural discrimination in France, based on his own previous attempts to find housing and violence directed towards him. He lived in Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, near housing projects where rioting had caused the destruction of cars owned by acquaintances. In the aftermath of the unrest, Chan was dissatisfied, stating that [...] "the media, especially in the United States, ... linked what was happening, the riots, to terrorism and put the blame on the Muslim community". Chan wanted instead to depict [...] "more human" [...] rioters who turned to violence in response to racism. According to Chan, the title The French Democracy is meant to be ironic, in that the youths express themselves by rioting rather than through the political system. He elaborated: a shortcut made with The Movies technology about the recent events concerning riots in French suburbs. This movie is trying to help people have a better understanding of the origin of these events, as <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> that pushed all this youth to have such violent acts. As a matter of fact TFD offers a sincere inside view from a French citizen who lives in one of these neighborhoods where the riots took place. This fictional documentary is strongly inspired by real events and reactions and tries to make the spectator think more about how French society could and should potentially be.|$|E
500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that they always do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
