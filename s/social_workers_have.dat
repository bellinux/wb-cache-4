25|$|Scholars {{argue that}} hip hop {{can have an}} {{empowering}} effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. <b>Social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop {{has the potential to}} be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.|$|E

50|$|It wasn't {{until the}} 1950s that {{therapists}} began treating psychological {{problems in the}} context of the family. Relationship counseling as a discrete, professional service is thus a recent phenomenon. Until the late 20th century, the work of relationship counseling was informally fulfilled by close friends, family members, or local religious leaders. Psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> historically dealt primarily with individual psychological problems in a medical and psychoanalytic framework. In many less technologically advanced cultures around the world today, the institution of family, the village or group elders fulfil the work of relationship counseling.

Police, prosecutors, and <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> also complained that many incidents of sexual violence in schools are not reported to them because schools often prefer to deal with it internally, thus hindering justice against the perpetrators. The danger of sexual violence in schools has created a barrier for girls to seek education.
