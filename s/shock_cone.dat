25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the inlet's central <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> {{served as}} a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage.|$|E
25|$|As in sonic booms and bow shocks, {{the angle}} of the <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> is {{directly}} related to the velocity of the disruption. The Cherenkov angle is zero at the threshold velocity for the emission of Cherenkov radiation. The angle takes on a maximum as the particle speed approaches the speed of light. Hence, observed angles of incidence can be used to compute the direction and speed of a Cherenkov radiation-producing charge.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{aircraft}} {{was to use}} Frank Whittle's latest engine, the Power Jets W.2/700, which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive. To develop a fully supersonic version of {{the aircraft}}, an innovation incorporated was a reheat jetpipe – also known as an afterburner. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen in the exhaust. Finally, the design included another critical element, {{the use of a}} <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine.|$|E

We show how the disk and <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> change depending on the initial conditions, Mach number, adiabatic index and the disk radius. Different physical conditions create different disk structures and these structures cause the varying physical mechanisms around the black holes.

50|$|Inlet <b>cones</b> (sometimes called <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> or inlet centerbodies) are a {{component}} of some supersonic aircraft and missiles. They are primarily used on ramjets, such as the D-21 Tagboard and Lockheed X-7. Some turbojet aircraft including the Su-7, MiG-21, English Electric Lightning, and SR-71 also use an inlet cone.|$|R
50|$|The CL-1200-2 (sometimes {{referred}} to as the CL-1600) was a proposed development of the X-27 for entry into the Lightweight Fighter Competition in 1972. The CL-1200-2 was not proceeded with when General Dynamics and Northrop designs were given contracts for the YF-16 and YF-17. The design was similar to the X-27 but had round intakes with <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> and a different fin.|$|R
25|$|The MiG-21 was {{the first}} {{successful}} Soviet aircraft combining fighter and interceptor characteristics in a single aircraft. It was a lightweight fighter, achieving Mach 2 with a relatively low-powered afterburning turbojet, and is thus comparable to the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter and the French Dassault Mirage III. Its basic layout was used for numerous other Soviet designs; delta-winged aircraft included Su-9 interceptor and the fast E-150 prototype from MiG bureau while the mass-produced successful front fighter Su-7 and Mikoyan's I-75 experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings. However, the characteristic layout with the <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the USSR and finally proved to have limited development potential, {{mainly because of the}} very small space available for the radar.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the M.52 was cylindrical and, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was constructed of high tensile steel with light-alloy covering. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle-like arrangement placed over the upper area around it. The engine was positioned with its center of gravity coincident with that of the aircraft and the wings were attached to the main structure just aft of the engine. The use of a <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> in the nose was another key design choice; the inlet cone slowed incoming air to the subsonic speeds determined by the engine, but with lower losses than a subsonic aircraft pitot intake. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used. The nose wheel was positioned close to the pilot's feet and the main wheels were fitted onto the main fuselage, folding out under the wings when deployed.|$|E
25|$|The M.52's single pilot, who, for the {{intended}} first flight, {{would have been}} test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> at {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a curved windscreen that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped nose. In the event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based explosive bolts. Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.|$|E
50|$|The four engines were {{situated}} in an 80 foot long box under the wing, like the B-70. Douglas' design differed in using two <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> {{at the front}} of the intake, rather than the large splitter in the B-70. This led into a single large duct with three-part variable-profile walls that slowed the intake air to subsonic speeds. Behind this were separate ducts leading to the engines. The landing gear folded into the space beside the duct.|$|R
50|$|The air intakes {{originally}} designed by Ben Rich {{were of the}} same fixed geometry as the F-104A, but included extensions to the inlet <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> for optimum jet engine operation at higher Mach numbers.Internal fuselage differences included provision for rocket fuel oxidizer tanks, deletion of the M61 Vulcan cannon, radar equipment and unnecessary avionics. A nitrogen tank was installed for cabin pressurization purposes. This was required as {{there would be no}} bleed air available from the engine after its normal and expected cutoff in the climb phase.|$|R
5|$|Visible {{changes from}} the XF-104 to {{production}} {{versions of the}} Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem.|$|R
2500|$|Thermal and {{structural}} limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by {{the passage of}} an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> {{at the front of}} the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> also served as a radar radome; a metal <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> would interfere with the AI 23’s radar emissions.

2500|$|The small-fin {{variants}} could exceed Mach 1.7, but {{the stability}} limits and <b>shock</b> <b>cone</b> thermal/strength limits made such speeds risky. The large-fin variants, especially those equipped with Avon 300-series engines could safely reach Mach 2, {{and given the}} right atmospheric conditions, might even achieve a few more tenths of a Mach.

With the strengthened <b>shock</b> <b>cone,</b> the Lightning could safely approach its thrust limit, but fuel consumption at very high airspeeds was excessive and became a major limiting factor.|$|E
2500|$|During development, the Avro 730 {{underwent}} re-design work so that {{it could}} perform as a bomber as well as a reconnaissance platform. Although the new version looked much like the original, it was larger overall and featured a new wing planform. In order to increase wing area, extra [...] "winglettes" [...] were added outside of the engine pods and the entire planform was re-shaped {{to be more of a}} classic delta wing. The wing inside the engine pods, about ⅔ of the overall span, was swept at about 45°, the smaller area outboard of the engine was more highly swept at about 60°. The forward sweep on the trailing edge was removed. The engine pods were now specified to carry four Armstrong-Siddeley P.176 engines each, for a total of eight. The pods were circular at the front and mounted a single large <b>shock</b> <b>cone,</b> and grew progressively more [...] "square" [...] to the rear, where they ended flush with the rear of the wing. Much of the layout was generally the same as the earlier version, with the rectangular canards, [...] "hidden" [...] cockpit and large cropped-delta vertical fin at the rear.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Bull and Murphy started {{discussing}} {{the idea of}} firing scale aircraft models from their guns. Both started working on the idea, but Bull beat Murphy when he successfully fired {{a model of the}} Gloster Javelin from his gun and managed to take shadowgraph photos of it showing supersonic <b>shock</b> <b>cones.</b> Bull then used the same method to work on the Avro Arrow, discovering an instability that led to the use of a stability augmentation system. Work on the Avro Arrow was soon cancelled, which angered Bull.|$|R

50|$|The initial {{variant of}} the Lancer {{was to be the}} CL-1200-1, powered by a single J79-GE-19 {{turbojet}} which was an uprated version of the engine used in the F-104. The second, more advanced variant, the CL-1200-2, was to have redesigned center and rear fuselage sections that could accommodate a modern turbofan engine as an improvement on the J79 turbojet. This turbofan engine was to be the Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-100 as used in the F-111F. The TF-30-P-100 would have provided a 60 percent increase in thrust at maximum power. The air intakes were located in the same position as on the F-104, but they were to employ variable <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> with four-inch movement in place of the F-104's fixed cones to optimize engine performance over a wide speed range.|$|R

25|$|The Avro 730 was a {{very high}} speed aircraft, {{originally}} designed solely for aerial reconnaissance purposes. In order to achieve the desired high speed performance, the aircraft consisted of a long, slender fuselage with a high fineness ratio; a small tapered almost-rectangular wing was mounted centrally on the fuselage. The characteristics of the wing, being relatively short and straight, enabled the lengthy aerial for the primary reconnaissance sensor, the Red Drover X-band radar, to be contained within the fuselage, as the wing provided little obstruction and therefore interference with the radar. A total of four Armstrong-Siddeley P.156 engines, two each being mounted in an over-under arrangement in pods positioned at the extreme tips of the wings, provided propulsion. The engine nacelles included variable-geometry air intakes, while the engines themselves were equipped with convergent-divergent nozzles.

There he designed the inlet ducts for the U-2 spy plane, then next led the effort to design and build a large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plant for project Suntan, a proposed hydrogen-powered supersonic very high-altitude aircraft meant to replace the U-2. After Suntan was canceled, hydrogen proving to be impractical for a number of reasons, Rich became propulsion systems program manager for the U-2's successors, the A-12 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Rich was chief aerodynamicist for the projects, designer of the complex translating <b>shock</b> <b>cones</b> inlet design, air conditioning and heat management systems, and the specification of the aircraft's black skin coatings which optimized heat dissipation of their tremendous aerodynamic heating as well as incorporating materials to reduce radar signature - the aircraft incorporated a number of features of what would later be referred to as low observables or stealth technology.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{high-speed}} aircraft have a wing that spends {{at least}} some of its time in the supersonic airflow.

Shock waves with initial Mach numbers varying from 6. 0 to 10 · 2 are generated in argon a t a pressure of 1 · 5 Torr. During each run local shock velocities a t several positions along the cone axis are measured using a thin multi-crystal piezoelectric probe inserted from the vertex. This technique produces accurate velocity data for both the incident and reflected shock waves. In the corresponding analysis, a simplified characteristics method is used to obtain an approximate solution of the axisymmetric diffraction equations derived by Whitham (1959). Both the shock velocity measurements and the axisymmetric diffraction solution confirm that the incident shock behaviour is dominated by cyclic diffraction processes which originate at the entrance of the cone.
