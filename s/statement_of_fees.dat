50|$|The Conservative {{government}} under Margaret Thatcher from 1979 onwards looked for ways {{of changing the}} NHS, with a greater role of the private sector, and for limiting health spending {{and it was not}} afraid to take on the doctor's trade union, the British Medical Association (BMA). The 1990 contract which was imposed by Kenneth Clarke after it was rejected in a ballot, linked GP pay more strongly to performance. More money was attached to capitation and less to the basic practice allowance, in line with the Thatcher government's general enthusiasm for competition - an enthusiasm which was not shared by many GPs. The number of professional members on the Family Health Services Authority was considerably fewer than had been the case with the Family Practitioner Committee. The terms and conditions of primary medical service delivery were closely specified. The 'Red Book' (<b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fees</b> and Allowances) detailed the payment tariffs for each individual treatment. Targets were set for cervical smears and immunisations. GPs were required to give health checks to new patients, patients over 75 and those who had not seen a GP for 3 years.|$|E

The government, which favours deregulation, intends to remove customer protections in the sector; allow advisers to earn sales commission and other so-called [...] "conflicted remuneration" [...] from providing general financial advice; and remove the requirement for financial advisers to tell customers how much they are receiving in commissions every year {{and give them the}} chance to opt out of the arrangements every second year.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the {{provision}} of non-audit services by auditors is negatively correlated with firm value {{and the quality of}} eamings. Because of concerns regarding the effect of non-audit services on auditor independence, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued revised auditor independence rules requiring firms to disclose in their annual proxy <b>statement</b> the amount <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> paid to auditors for audit and non-audit services. Using data collected from over 4, 000 proxies filed between February 5, 2001 and June 15, 2001, we find a significant negative market reaction to proxy statements filed by firms reporting higher than expected non-audit fees. Our evidence also indicates an inverse relation between the magnitude <b>of</b> non-audit <b>fees</b> and eamings management. Firms purchasing more non-audit services from their auditor are more likely to just meet or beat three earnings benchmarks - analysts' expectations, prior year eamings, and zero eamings- and to report large discretionary accruals...|$|R

The Police Department nevertheless prohibited distribution of the new handbill on grounds that the front side retained commercial advertising content, even without <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> an admission <b>fee.</b> Chrestensen, alleging loss in the excess of $4,000 (...) , sued under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. A divided Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, and Valentine petitioned to the Supreme Court.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{association}} between the provision of non-audit services and earnings quality. Because of concerns regarding the effect of non-audit services on financial reporting credibility, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued revised auditor independence rules requiring firms to disclose in their annual proxy <b>statement</b> the amount <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> paid to auditors for audit and non-audit services. Using data collected from proxy statements filed between February 5, 2001 and June 15, 2001, we present evidence that firms purchasing more non-audit services from their auditor {{are more likely to}} just meet or beat analysts' forecasts and to report larger absolute discretionary accruals. However, the purchase of non-audit services is not associated with meeting other earnings benchmarks. We also find that the unexpected component of the non-audit to total fee ratio is negatively associated with stock returns on the filing date. These results are consistent with arguments that the provision of non-audit services strengthens an auditor's economic bond with the client and that investors price this effect. ...|$|R

40|$|Tuition <b>fees</b> <b>of</b> public {{universities}} are greatly increasing {{in recent years}} in China. Many researchers have made an attempt to examine the effects <b>of</b> rising <b>fee</b> on students'enrollment behavior.

This paper will focus on the following four points: (1) the history <b>of</b> university <b>fees,</b> (2) the present situation <b>of</b> tuition <b>fees,</b> (3) the mechanism responsible for the fee rising, (4) the relation between the rising <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> and the higher education expansion. The findings of this article are as follows: (1) The transformation <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> system is not from free-fee one to high-fee one directly, but through several transitive phases in which various fee policies were experimented by the central government. (2) The present standard <b>of</b> tuition <b>fee</b> is very high. Fee average is up to 5000 yuan every year. And the amount <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> collected by different institutions varies greatly according to university and department's prestige. (3) Each institution of higher education {{played an important role in}} the process <b>of</b> <b>fee</b> rising. The central government changed the fee policies, which gave each institution an arbitrary power to decide its fee level and how to spend it partly.
