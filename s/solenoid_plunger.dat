50|$|Proportional Solenoid -Included in this {{category}} of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the <b>solenoid</b> <b>plunger</b> or armature {{as a function of}} coil current. These solenoids, whether axial or rotary, employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force (torque), and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically. The resulting force (torque) profile as the solenoid progresses through its operational stroke is nearly flat or descends from a high to a lower value. The solenoid can be useful for positioning, stopping mid-stroke, or for low velocity actuation; especially in a closed loop control system. A uni-directional solenoid would actuate against an opposing force or a dual solenoid system would be self cycling. The proportional concept is more fully described in SAE publication 860759 (1986).|$|E
40|$|Öhlins CES Technologies in Jönköping have in {{the last}} 30 years been {{developing}} control valves for semi active suspension systems used in the car industry. The system, marketed by Öhlins under the brand name CES (Continuously controlled Electronic Suspension), enables a wide working range and ability {{to adapt to the}} current road conditions. By controlling  the valve in different ways there are also possibilities to decide on a specfic damper characteristic such as sport or comfort. The CES valve is working as a pilot controlled pressure regulator and is continuously controlled with help of an electro magnet. The CES valve is mounted in a uniflow damper which in turn guarantees the flow through the valve to go in only one direction independently ofdamper stroke direction. The rst part of the thesis investigates the damping characteristics in the latest model of the CES valve (i. e the CES 8700). A simulation model is made to approximate the damping in the <b>solenoid</b> <b>plunger.</b> Questions that are answered are: How is damping dened, what creates damping in the valve, how large is the damping, what parameters aect the damping. The second part of the thesis investigates new and already prototyped damping concepts with help of simulation. This has been done in order to optimize the valve damping and in turn the damper performance. The simulation results show that the valve dynamics can be improved but often at the expense of a slower valve...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} a one-dimensional, transient and compressible flow models {{of a commercial}} Common Rail Injector (CRI) and a prototype of a single-fuel Hydraulically actuated Electrically controlled Unit Injector (HEUI) developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in conjunction with local industry. The unique feature of the UNSW HEUI {{is the fact that}} it uses diesel fuel as the driver for pressure amplification within the unit injector. The work undertaken is part of a wider study aimed at optimization of the design of diesel injectors for dual-fuel systems to reduce green house gas emissions. The contribution of this thesis is the development of the model of the UNSW HEUI injector, which can be used to investigate possible modifications of the injector for its use in dual-fuel injection systems. The developed models include electrical, mechanical and hydraulic subsystems present in the injectors. They are based on Kirchhoff??s laws, on the mass and momentum conservation equations and on the equilibrium of forces. The models were implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK graphical software environment, which provides a high degree of flexibility and allows simulation of both linear and nonlinear elements. The models were used to perform sensitivity analysis of both injectors. The sensitivity analysis has revealed that the temperature of the solenoid coil is one of the critical parameters affecting the timing and the quantity of the fuel injection of both injectors. Additional critical parameters were found to be the dimensions of the piston of the CRI, the stiffness of the needle spring of the HEUI and the dimensions of the intensifier of the HEUI. The models also revealed that in the case of pilot injections the speed of the solenoid is the major limiting factor of the performance. The developed models provide better understanding of the issues and limitations of the injectors. They give detailed insight into their working principles. The investigations of the models permit making quantitative analysis of the timing of the HEUI solenoid and to evaluate the proposed change of the direction of the pressure acting on the HEUI <b>solenoid</b> <b>plunger...</b>|$|E
50|$|A common {{signaling}} {{device is}} a chime unit {{consisting of two}} flat metal bar resonators, which are struck by plungers operated by two solenoids. The flat bars are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first <b>solenoid's</b> <b>plunger</b> strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound ("ding-dong"). If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes {{only one of the}} bars, to create a single-tone ("ding") sound.|$|R
50|$|A common {{tractive}} electromagnet is a uniformly-wound <b>solenoid</b> and <b>plunger.</b> The <b>solenoid</b> is a coil of wire, and the plunger {{is made of}} {{a material}} such as soft iron. Applying a current to the solenoid applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the solenoid.|$|R
50|$|Z-axis {{drive and}} control are handled in several ways. The {{first and most}} common is a simple solenoid that pushes against a spring. When the solenoid is {{energized}} it pushes the milling head down against a spring stop that limits the downward travel. The rate of descent {{as well as the}} amount of force exerted on the spring stop must be manually set by mechanically adjusting the position of the <b>solenoid's</b> <b>plunger.</b> The second type of Z-axis control is {{through the use of a}} pneumatic cylinder and a software-driven gate valve. Due to the small cylinder size and the amount of air pressure used to drive it there is little range of control between the up and down stops. Both the solenoid and pneumatic system cannot position the head anywhere other than the endpoints, and are therefore useful for only simple 'up/down' milling tasks. The final type of Z-axis control uses a stepper motor that allows the milling head to be moved in small accurate steps up or down. Further, the speed of these steps can be adjusted to allow tool bits to be eased into the board material rather than hammered into it. The depth (number of steps required) as well as the downward/upward speed is under user control via the controlling software.|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{presented}} in which the diffuse interface between two gases is made Rayleigh-Taylor unstable by interaction with a rarefaction wave. The apparatus used consists of a test section where the counter-flow of light and heavy gases generates a diffuse, stably stratified interface. A tank attached {{to the bottom of}} the apparatus is evacuated, and when an appropriate pressure is reached, the interface is perturbed using either a horizontal or a vertical oscillation technique to produce 2 D, 3 D, and multi-mode perturbations. A <b>solenoid</b> <b>plunger</b> fires an arrowhead which ruptures a membrane, generating a rarefaction wave that travels upward toward the interface. When the rarefaction wave impacts the interface, the interface accelerates down toward the vacuum tank, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and mixing develop in the test section. The instability evolution and mixing are recorded using high-speed CMOS cameras and planar laser Mie scattering of smoke particles seeded in the heavy gas. Additional visualization is undertaken with a high-speed shadowgraph system using three CMOS cameras. Interface diffusion thicknesses are recorded using the Rayleigh scattered light of an unexpanded laser beam. Simulations are conducted using a 1 D numerical characteristics code based on the method of Hoskin (Meth. Comp. Physics, 3, 1964), and using the LLNL research hydrodynamics code Miranda (Cook, Phys. Fluids, 19, 2007). This 1 D code produces Lagrangian interface trajectories while the 2 D and 3 D simulations using Miranda calculate the growth of perturbations. The theory of Chandrasekhar (Chandrasekhar, Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., 51, 1955) is extended to capture the effects of diffuse interfaces while including viscosity, and dispersion curves are solved for numerically using a Riccati technique. These solutions show that the method of Duff et al. (Phys. Fluids, 5, 1962) may not accurately describe the growth of single modes for large wavenumbers. For large wavenumbers, when the interface has a large diffusion thickness, perturbations are found to grow with the linear growth rate n = 2 Ag/(√πv₀δk²), where A is the Atwood number, g is the acceleration, v₀ is the average kinematic viscosity, δ is the thickness of the interface, and k is the wavenumber of the perturbation. Flat interface experiments exhibit predictable acceleration profiles, but the tail of the rarefaction wave appears at late times reducing the duration of acceleration. Single-mode experiments are conducted for four Atwood numbers including CO₂/SF₆ with A = 0. 49, Air/SF₆ with A = 0. 63, He/CO₂ with A = 0. 82, and He/SF₆ with A = 0. 94. Early time results compare well with linear stability theory when non-constant acceleration and diffusion thickness are accounted for. Simulations show good agreement with experiments into the non-linear growth phase. The CO₂/SF₆ and Air/SF₆ experiments show terminal velocity behavior where buoyancy is balanced by drag, but produce Froude numbers larger than those predicted by the Goncharov model (Phys. Rev. Lett., 88, 2002). Using the Mikaelian model (Phys. Fluids, 21, 2009), improved asymptotic Froude numbers are found. The He/CO₂ and He/SF₆ experiments exhibit free-fall behavior, accelerating freely without external forces, with spike amplitudes proportional to the displacement of the unperturbed interface. Single-mode experiments conducted with 3 D perturbations using CO₂/SF₆ and Air/SF₆ show good agreement with linear stability theory when non-constant acceleration and diffusion thickness are accounted for. Simulations and the model of Mikaelian predict the growth of the spikes up until late time, while the 3 D bubbles reach a terminal velocity more quickly than in simulations. Multi-mode experiments were conducted using Air/SF₆. Multi-mode experiments exhibit nearly t² growth at early times which decays. Using extraction techniques that account for variable acceleration, alpha values are found between ɑ = 0. 02 and ɑ = 0. 04. These alpha values are lower than are seen for most experiments, but are similar to ɑ values seen in miscible experiments...|$|E
40|$|The work {{approaches}} {{the most important}} category of DC polarized and AC biased electromagnetic reciprocating machines, which are employed as electromagnetic percussion devices (electromagnetic hammers, EMH). Two new advantageous electromagnetic hammer technical solutions are proposed, namely a radial ferromagnetic shunt DC excitation polarized <b>plunger</b> <b>solenoid</b> type electromagnetic hammer and an axial ferromagnetic shunt DCEPPS one. The two constructive and functional solutions particularities are disclosed. A particular comparison procedure is proposed and effectuated, distinguishing the quasi-equality of overall sizes for the two equal power compared EMH.
