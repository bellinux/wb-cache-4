40|$|The {{study of}} {{marginal}} Caribbean islands and economies remains understated within the wider {{context of the}} discipline of Caribbean historical archaeology. Research has tended to focus mainly upon {{the study of the}} dominant site form of the colonial period in the region: the industrial sugar plantation, and mainly upon the larger islands. This contribution moves the scale of analysis to the smaller Caribbean island landscape as a whole entity, and attempts to frame an archaeological biography of Bequia in the <b>St</b> <b>Vincent</b> <b>Grenadines</b> over the last three hundred or so years. Further, we consider how more peripheral economic strategies that developed there over this period impacted upon this island landscape, how they are recognised archaeologically and what they can tell us about wider social and economic processes. Using landscape archaeology survey allied to GIS and historical cartographic analysis, the study presented here charts the emergence and development of a distinctive insular Caribbean socio-economic identity very much on the margins...|$|E

25|$|Among {{the many}} groups and organisations that Roberts helped to {{establish}} during his 34 years in Canada is the <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> and <b>Grenadines</b> Association of Montreal. In fact, despite his many international commitments, he remained committed {{to his native}} <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> and the <b>Grenadines</b> and it was he who, {{on the eve of}} the country's independence, submitted a detailed policy statement to the government of <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> outlining why the Grenadines should be included as an integral part of the country's name. The crux of his argument was that the Grenadines should not be seen as mere appendages of the island of <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent,</b> and that the integrity of all of the smaller islands should be respected. His submission was adopted by the government, hence the name <b>St.</b> <b>Vincent</b> and the <b>Grenadines.</b>|$|R
