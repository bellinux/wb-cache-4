Results indicate that the initial microstructure of slurry produced by SIM is a mixture of irregular grains, which becomes ideally globular when the <b>slurry</b> slowly <b>cools</b> to 620 ℃ and isothermally held for at least 30 s.

Coarsening of α-Mg grains in isothermal holding was analyzed using Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. Results suggest that coalescence is most likely the dominant coarsening mechanism in the early stage while Ostwald ripening tends to be the principal one later.

40|$|The {{removal of}} yeast biomass (cropping) {{at the end}} of {{fermentation}} to inoculate a subsequent fermentation (serial-repitching) is common practice in the brewing industry. Between successive fermentations cropped yeast is stored as a <b>slurry</b> in <b>cooled</b> storage vessels under anaerobic conditions until required for subsequent use. Maintenance of yeast quality during storage is critical for subsequent fermentation performance. An assumption is made in brewing that all strains benefit from storage at 3 - 4 °C. To test this assumption a model working system was initially established to assess cooling times of lager yeast in different suspension media. Preliminary investigations focussing on freshly propagated yeast slurry demonstrated that whilst the deleterious effects of extremely high storage temperatures on lager brewing yeast physiology was in line with expectation, utilization of traditionally recommended storage temperatures does not necessarily benefit yeast physiology when compared to slurry maintenance at slightly higher temperatures. Genome-scale transcriptional analysis in slurries cropped following an initial fermentation suggested that lager yeast might experience cold stress during slurry maintenance at typically recommended storage temperatures. In contrast, maintenance of lager yeast at a slightly higher storage temperature, in this case 10 °C, yielded no adverse impact on key indicators of brewing yeast physiological state or on subsequent fermentation profiles following repitching into fermentations. Whilst these observations were not made using full production scale, they do indicate that optimal storage may not be currently being deployed for brewing yeast at full scale...|$|R
40|$|A {{testing program}} {{evaluating}} actual tank waste {{was developed in}} response to Task 4 from the M- 12 External Flowsheet Review Team (EFRT) issue response plan (Barnes and Voke 2006). The test program was subdivided into logical increments. The bulk water-insoluble solid wastes that are anticipated to be delivered to the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) were identified according to type such that the actual waste testing could be targeted to the relevant categories. Under test plan TP RPP WTP 467 (Fiskum et al. 2007), eight broad waste groupings were defined. Samples available from the 222 S archive were identified and obtained for testing. Under this test plan, a waste testing program was implemented that included: • Homogenizing the archive samples by group as defined in the test plan. • Characterizing the homogenized sample groups. • Performing parametric leaching testing on each group for compounds of interest. • Performing bench-top filtration/leaching tests in the hot cell for each group to simulate filtration and leaching activities if they occurred in the UFP 2 vessel of the WTP Pretreatment Facility. This report focuses on a filtration/leaching test performed using two of the eight waste composite samples. The sample groups examined in this report were the plutonium-uranium extraction (PUREX) cladding waste sludge (Group 3, or CWP) and reduction-oxidation (REDOX) cladding waste sludge (Group 4, or CWR). Both the Group 3 and 4 waste composites were anticipated to be high in gibbsite, thus requiring caustic leaching. WTP RPT 167 (Snow et al. 2008) describes the homogenization, characterization, and parametric leaching activities before benchtop filtration/leaching testing of these two waste groups. Characterization and initial parametric data in that report were used to plan a single filtration/leaching test using a blend of both wastes. The test focused on filtration testing of the waste and caustic leaching for aluminum, {{in the form of}} gibbsite, and its impact on filtration. The initial sample was diluted with a liquid simulant to simulate the receiving concentration of retrieved tank waste into the UFP 2 vessel (< 10 wt% undissolved solids). Filtration testing was performed on the dilute waste sample and dewatered to a higher solids concentration. Filtration testing was then performed on the concentrated slurry. Afterwards, the slurry was caustic leached to remove aluminum present in the undissolved solid present in the waste. The leach was planned to simulate leaching conditions in the UFP 2 vessel. During the leach, slurry supernate samples were collected to measure the dissolution rate of aluminum in the waste. After the <b>slurry</b> <b>cooled</b> down from the elevated leach temperature, the leach liquor was dewatered from the solids. The remaining slurry was rinsed and dewatered with caustic solutions to remove a majority of the dissolved aluminum from the leached slurry. The concentration of sodium hydroxide in the rinse solutions was high enough to maintain the solubility of the aluminum in the dewatered rinse solutions after dilution of the slurry supernate. Filtration tests were performed on the final slurry to compare to filtration performance before and after caustic leaching...|$|R

The method involves pouring of the melt from top, down an oblique and channel shaped plate cooled from bottom by counter flowing water.

The melt, together with the equiaxed grains, forms semisolid slurry collected at the slope exit and cast into billets having non-dendritic microstructure. The final microstructure depends on several process parameters such as slope angle, slope length, pouring superheat, and cooling rate.

Solvent evaporation, <b>slurry</b> and <b>cooling</b> crystallization which representing the solution based method co-crystal screening were used. Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the melting point of CBZ-SA in different ratio was in the range between 188 oC- 189 oC. For CBZ-FA form A and CBZ-FA form B the melting point in different ratio were in the range of 174 oC- 175 oC and 185 oC- 186 oC respectively. The product crystal from the screening was also characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The XRPD pattern profile analysis has shown that the CBZ co-crystals with FA and SA were successfully formed for all ratios studied. The findings revealed that CBZ-FA co-crystal were formed in two different polymorphs. It was found that CBZ-FA form A and form B were formed from evaporation and slurry crystallization methods respectively. On the other hand, in cooling crystallization method, CBZ-FA form A was formed at lower mol ratio of CCF to CBZ and vice versa. This study disclosed that different methods and mol ratios during the co-crystal screening can affect the outcome of co-crystal produced such as polymorphic forms of co-crystal and thereof. Thus, it was suggested that careful attentions is needed during the screening since the co-crystal formation is currently one of the promising approach to be considered in research and development for pharmaceutical industry to improve the poorly soluble drugs...|$|R

In {{the first part of the}} thesis a computer application, named “BankaLeda” is presented. It enables simulation of an ice bank system performance. In order to verify developed simulation model an experimental evaluation has been performed. Field measurements have been conducted on a two module silo which was installed as a part of the refrigeration system in dairy and cheese factory “Antun Bohnec” in the city of Ludbreg in Croatia. Experimental findings were compared to the simulation model. The software „BankaLeda“ presents a strong optimization tool for designers and engineers in the field by providing a high degree of freedom in defining particular system design and operating parameters. It offers a basis for assessment and testing of a new energy efficient system arrangements and measures. Besides it will give decisionmakers the ability to test potential solutions in the process of CTES system design. In the second part of the thesis ice slurry pressure drop and heat transfer in horizontal straight tubes have been experimentally investigated. In particular a mixture of 10. 3 % of ethanol and water with an initial freezing point of - 4. 4 °C was considered. It was found that the behaviour of ice slurry flow is changing with time and that ice slurry pressure drop is generally higher than for single phase flow. However for ice concentrations of 15 % and higher, for certain velocities ice slurry pressure drop is found to be of a similar value as for single phase fluid. Moreover, if ice slurry is to be used as a energy transport media it is recommended to keep the ice mass fraction at a level of 20 %. With tube geometry and thermophysical properties of a carrier fluid the heat transfer of ice slurry is generally a function of ice mass fraction and velocity. The imposed heat flux has no or has just minor influence on the heat transfer coefficient. Up to ice mass fraction between 10 - 15 % the mean heat transfer coefficient shows only slight (laminar flow) or no increase (turbulent flow) in comparison to single phase flow. Beyond that ice mass fraction the heat transfer coefficient is increasing significantly. The test data for pressure drop and heat transfer in laminar and turbulent regime was compared to several correlations from the literature. A new correlations for ice slurry pressure drop and heat transfer in the laminar flow regime, for 10. 3 % ethanol and water mixture, were derived based on the present experimental data. The correlation for pressure drop predicts 82 % of the experimental data with ± 15 % accuracy, while the correlation for heat transfer predicts 75 % of the data with the same accuracy. In order to investigate advantages and disadvantages of a dynamic, ice slurry system over a static, indirect, external melt, ice-on-coil CTES system and to assess their differences from economical aspects, a theoretical simulation model of an ice slurry CTES have been developed. It was found that the ice slurry based CTES systems posses higher economic and energy saving potential than static type systems. In the best case scenario the total energy consumption of dynamic CTES system was found to be approximately 25 % lower than for a static CTES system. QC 2010071...|$|R
40|$|James et al. (2006) have {{reviewed}} {{previous studies}} {{related to the}} chilling of fresh products. The goal of chilling is always to limit the growth of pathogenic and food spoilage microorganisms. It has been proved that chilling reduces the number of both types of microorganisms {{on the surface of}} fresh products. In Europe dry air is the preferred chilling method. This method is believed to have clear microbiological advantages but James et al. (2006) show that the published data do not support this belief and direct contact chilling methods might even have larger microbiological advantages. However, in a continuous production line, chlorination or other additive is needed to prevent accumulation of micro-organisms. This is not acceptable in Europe. The rate of chilling has some influence on the taste, texture and appearance of the fresh product. Very rapid chilling will generally lead to robust structure while very slow chilling can produce soft texture. Pederson (1979) has compared the costs of different chilling methods in Denmark. When only energy costs were considered, the cost of a countercurrent water immersion chilling system was one fifth that of an air chilling method. Slush ice is often preferred in immersion systems since cooling takes place without freezing damage of the product while the heat removal takes place at a low temperature. For 70 % slush ice content of the <b>slurry,</b> the <b>cooling</b> time is lowest while with 35 % slush ice the highest weight gain is attained (around 5 %). When air is used, short chilling times require low air temperatures and high air velocities. James et al. (2006) report for a specific product a chilling time (38 to 4 oC) 150 minutes with 0. 75 m/s and 1 oC, 60 minutes with 4. 1 m/s and - 7 oC, and 17 minutes with - 40 oC. Short chilling times impose low air temperatures and so low evaporating temperatures and high energy consumption of the primary refrigeration cycle. In this paper the immersion of fresh products in melting carbon dioxide hydrate crystals, produced at + 8 oC and 30 bar, is proposed for rapid chilling of fresh products. First the chilling time of a specific fresh product from 30 to 4 oC making use of a â€œshock freezer (2 m/s air velocity, air at - 10 oC) and applying a slurry of CO 2 hydrate crystals is compared. Also the effect of these two methods on the weight loss of the product is compared. Then the chilling of chicken products making use of the proposed method is experimentally verified. Also the microbiologic contamination of samples chilled using high speed dry air, immersion in melting water and immersion in CO 2 hydrate slurry are compared. Finally the economic advantages and practical applicability of the proposed method are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|In most casting applications, {{dendritic}} microstructure morphology is not desired {{because it}} leads to poor mechanical properties. Forced convection causing sufficient shearing in the mushy zone of the partially solidified melt {{is one of the}} means to suppress this dendritic growth. The dendrites formed at the solid-liquid interface are detached and carried away due to strong fluid flow to form slurry. This slurry, consisting of rosette or globular particles, provides less resistance to flow even at a high solid fraction and can easily fill the die-cavity. The stated principle is the basis of a new manufacturing technology called “semi-solid forming” (SSF), in which metal alloys are cast in the semi-solid state. This technique has numerous advantages over other existing commercial casting processes, such as reduction of macrosegregation, reduction of porosity and low forming efforts. Among all currently available methods available for large scale production of semisolid <b>slurry,</b> the <b>cooling</b> slope {{is considered to be a}} simple but effective method because of its simple design and easy control of process parameters, low equipment and running costs, high production efficiency and reduced inhomogeneity. With this perspective, the primary objective of the present research is to investigate, both experimentally and numerically, convective heat transfer and solidification on a cooling slope, in addition to the study of final microstructure of the cast billets. Some key process parameters are identified, namely pouring temperature, slope angle, slope length, and slope cooling rate. A systematic scaling analysis is performed in order to understand the relative importance of the parameters in influencing the final properties of the slurry and microstructure after solidification. A major part of the present work deals with the development of an experimental set up with careful consideration of the range of process parameters involved by treating the cooling slope as a heat exchanger. Subsequently, a comprehensive numerical model is developed to predict the flow, heat transfer, species concentration solid fraction distribution of aluminum alloy melt while flowing down the cooling slope. The model uses a variable viscosity relation for slurry. The metal-air interface at the top during the melt flow is tracked using a volume of fluid (VOF) method. Solidification is modeled using an enthalpy based approach and a volume averaged technique. The mushy region is modeled as a multi-layered porous medium consisting of fixed columnar dendrites and mobile equiaxed or fragmented grains. In addition, the solidification model also incorporates a fragmentation criterion and solid phase movement. The effects of key process parameters on flow behavior involving velocity distribution, temperature distribution, solid fractions at the slope exit, and macrosegregation, are studied numerically and experimentally for aluminium alloy A 356. The resulting microstructures of the cast billets obtained from the experiments are studied and characterized. Finally the experimental results are linked to the model predictions for establishing the relations involving interdependence of the stated key process parameters in determining the quality of the final cast products. This study is aimed towards providing the necessary guidelines for designing a cooling slope and optimizing the process parameters for desirable quality of the solidified product...|$|R
40|$|Cool storage, {{as one of}} {{the main}} energy storage technologies, is applied for {{shifting}} on-peak electric load to off-peak and balancing the electric-load of the air-condition system. Thus, it is regarded as an important method towards electric-load management strategy. Using ice <b>slurry</b> as a <b>cool</b> storage medium can realize a high heat transfer efficient during the cold releasing &cold storage process. Moreover, the ice slurry can be transported by pipelines because of its good fluidity, so it can be used in different occasions, such as food freezing and cold storage, chemical technology, air conditioning, district cooling and so on. Therefore, it becomes a significant thing to study the dynamic ice slurry making system. In this paper a general experimental study on the scraped dynamic ice slurry making system was conducted. The main contents are as follows: In the paper a brief introduction to the background of the ice-storage air conditioning was given, and the recent years’ related literature upon the ice-storage air conditioning especially the scraped dynamic ice slurry making system were summarized. And the significance and the research content of this paper are stated. Based on the experimental scheme, heat transfer characteristics of the ice slurry generator scraped surface are introduced. By considering the ice slurry as single-phase fluid and two-phase fluid separately, eight groups of measured results were analyzed. The result show that the heat transfer coefficient of the ice slurry generator is up to 1050 W m- 2 K- 1. And a brief analysis on the power consumption was given. The temperature distribution characteristics of the ice storage tank under the different experimental conditions were introduced, and the experimental results show that the repeatability of experimental results is rather good during the latent heat storage process: in the ice-storage tank, the central temperature is lowest, the top temperature is highest, and the bottom temperature is closed to the top firstly and then felled to the central. The ice generating performance of the dynamic ice slurry making system under different experimental conditions was introduced. The cooling capacity appears a peak when the solution enters the latent heat exchange stage completely and then it remains stable after the decay. In the whole latent heat exchange stage, the cooling capacity is up to 65 % of the rated condition. And the ice making rate remains at 335 kg h- 1. Comparing to the direct evaporative internal-melt ice-storage system, the relative COP improves 16 %, ice making rate per unit refrigerating improves 45 %, the volume of ice output per unit energy consumption improves 72 %, and the energy saving remains 40 %. Through our experimental study, the ice generation and ice storage characteristics of the dynamic ice slurry making system were obtained, which could be provided instructions for the further product research and development. 蓄冷作为主要蓄能技术应用方式之一，应用于空调系统可移峰填谷，平衡电力负荷，是电力负荷管理策略的一项重要技术手段。使用冰浆作为蓄冷介质，载冷密度高达 334 kJ kg- 1 （ 0 ℃时发生液-固相变）；蓄冷释冷过程中热传递效率高，具有较好的流动性，可以使用管道输送；可适用于食品冷冻冷藏、化学工艺、空调、区域供冷等不同的场合。因此，对冰浆制造系统的研究就显的十分重要。 本文对自行研制的刮刀式动态冰浆制造系统进行较为全面的实验研究。主要研究内容如下： 介绍了冰蓄冷空调的研究背景，对近年来的相关文献特别是刮刀式冰蓄冷空调的相关文献进行了综述，指出了本课题的研究意义与研究内容。 依据实验方案，对刮刀式冰浆发生器的传热特性进行了说明。采用两种不同理论，即把冰浆看作单相流体和两相流体对 8 组实验结果进行分析，冰浆发生器传热系数的平均值达到 1050 W m- 2 K- 1 ，并对冰浆发生器的能耗进行了简要分析。 在不同的实验方案下蓄冰槽内的温度分布特性具有良好的重复性。实验表明：在潜热蓄冷阶段，蓄冰槽中间层温度最低，上层温度最高，底层温度开始与上层温度接近，之后不断下降与中间层温度接近 。 详细分析刮刀式动态冰浆制造系统在不同实验方案下的制冰特性。实验结果表明：制冷量在进入潜热换热阶段时出现一个峰值，之后衰减并保持稳定，整个潜热蓄冷阶段制冷量是额定空调工况的 65 %。系统制冰速度保持在 335 kg h- 1 。与直膨式冰蓄冷空调相比，系统相对COP最大提高 16 %，单位制冷量的制冰速度最大提高 45 %，单位能耗的产冰量最大提高 72 %，节能率都保持在 40 %左右。 通过本课题的实验研究，得到了刮刀式动态冰浆制造系统的制冰和蓄冰特性，为刮刀式冰蓄冷空调的进一步开发提供基础数据和设计指导...|$|R
