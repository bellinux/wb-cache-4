40|$|Many {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{appropriate for}} use in Developing countries are not of interest to major Western, international pharmaceutical companies. For this reason, in the mid-seventies the World Health Organisation, in response to great demand for improved long-acting injectable hormonal contraceptives, particularly in Africa and Asia, sponsored a chemical <b>synthesis</b> <b>programme</b> of long-acting progestational and androgenic steroids with Carl Djerassi {{as one of its}} main leaders. Almost 300 esters of norethisterone, levonorgestrel and testosterone were prepared by this programme in university-based research laboratories situated mainly in developing countries and then screened by the US National Institutes of Health in animal models. This paper describes the overall strategy of this research and development activity and the philosophy that served as an engine for a unique non-profit collaborative work. Among progestins three compounds, levonorgestrel-butanoate, cyclopropylcarboxylate and cyclobutyl-carboxylate, proved to be particularly long-acting when administered as microcrystalline suspensions, although  for financial reasons  only one, levonorgestrel-butanoate is being further developed...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} {{one of a series of}} best {{evidence}} synthesis iterations (BESs) commissioned by the Ministry of Education. The Iterative Best Evidence <b>Synthesis</b> <b>Programme</b> is seeking to support collaborative knowledge building and use across policy, research, and practice in education. This series of syntheses draws together bodies of research evidence to explain what works and why to improve valued education outcomes and to make a bigger difference for the education of all our children and young people. Each synthesis celebrates the work of educators and the inquiry processes that enable educators and researchers to bring about sustainable improvements in education. Each is part of an iterative process that anticipates future research and development informing educational practice. Earlier BESs have focused on effective teaching and professional learning in schools and on the impact of family and community influences on educational outcomes. This School Leadership and Student Outcomes BES will prove a crucial support for school leaders as they address our shared challenge of preparing all our children for the future. The International Academy of Education has commissioned summaries of the recent BESs developed by the Ministry of Education. While the full reports provide the explanations and vignettes that are needed to support educational change, these short summaries will also be a convenient help for leaders.

The colours of {{the galaxy}} class known as Extremely Red Objects (EROs; R − K> 5) are {{considered}} to be consistent with two distinct galaxy populations at high redshift: evolved ellipticals or young dusty starbursts. In this paper the properties of EROs, spanned by the five photometric bands RIJHK, are investigated as to the possibility to distinguish between these two galaxy populations using only broad band photometry. The broad band colours of elliptical and starburst galaxies at redshifts up to 5 are computed from synthetic spectra obtained using the spectral evolution <b>synthesis</b> <b>programme</b> PÉGASE. 2. Two initial mass functions and a range of metallicities and extinctions are used. In order to be extremely red in the redshift range considered, the evolution of the R−K colour sets the requirement that ellipticals have to be less than 7 − 8 Gyr old, and that the starbursts must have colour excesses of E(B−V) > 1, as derived from the nebular emission lines. In investigating the overlap in the different colour-colour planes as a function of redshift, it is found that the planes formed from permutations of the same three filters exhibit very similar overlap characteristics. In colour-colour planes formed within such triplets one of the filters will serve as a “pivot ” band against which the two other bands are compared. The configuration where this pivot band lies between the other two bands has the best performance as a discriminator among the three possible configurations.

40|$|Objective We {{conducted}} a systematic review {{to examine the}} impact of smoking cessation interventions, including smoking bans, on prisoners and prison staff. Data sources We systematically searched health and criminal justice databases for relevant studies. Search strings were used to combine terms related to smoking cessation interventions with terms related to incarceration. We used forward and backward snowballing to capture additional studies. Study selection Studies were included if: they were published between 1 January 1994 and 23 May 2016; the population was incarcerated adults and/or prison staff; they had a quantitative component; they were published in English; and they reported outcomes of a smoking cessation programme/ban with regard to reported change in smoking behaviour and/or behavioural outcomes. Data extraction Studies were reviewed for methodological rigour using the Effective Public Health Practice Project's Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Data were independently reviewed for methodological quality by 1 author and a research assistant. Data <b>synthesis</b> Cessation <b>programmes,</b> including free nicotine replacement therapy and/or behavioural counselling can significantly increase the likelihood of quitting in prison and increase abstinence postrelease. Indoor bans have little impact on prisoner smoking behaviour. Prisoners who experience a complete smoking ban typically resume smoking shortly after release from prison. Bans may result in adverse behavioural outcomes, but these are generally minimal and short-lived. Conclusions While there is limited evidence to inform tobacco control policies in custodial settings, outcomes of this review suggest that cessation programmes/bans can be an effective mechanism to interrupt prisoner smoking behaviour when properly enforced. © 2016 by the BMJ Publishing Group Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{secondary}} energy carriers {{both on the}} transport sector and {{in the production of}} heat for domestic and industrial purposes will even in future be indispensable for those areas where pipe-line energy supply is impossible or uneconomical. Synthetic liquid {{secondary energy}} carriers are gainingincreasing importance. That applies to their application in situ for improving both the security of supply and the quality of conventional liquid fuels {{as well as to the}} transportation of energy in a system which is as economical as possible. Energy alcohols are synthetic liquid secondary energy carriers. The examination of their potential with regard to profitable production and ecologically beneficial behaviour is the aim of the research programme outlined below. On the basis of the well-known process of methanol <b>synthesis,</b> the <b>programme</b> highlights research objects which aim at improving the profitability andefficiency factor of the alcohol production. As regards the synthesis of alcohol mixtures, two tendencies begin to show which differ as to the catalyst used and the respective process conditions. The optimization of the synthesis process concerns both the composition of the liquid product and the composition of the synthesis gas available. Crude synthesis gases of differing quality can be produced on the basis of any carbonaceous raw material. All gas compositions can be simulated by means of a modified natural gas reforming plant (EVA I). The examination of the environmental behaviour of energy alcohols includes engine bench tests as well as experiments with different domestic burners. In this context, our main interest is focused on reaching a combustion with a low degree of emission (particles, NO, hydrocarbons), on finding the optimum composition of energy alcohols, and on developing technical instructions as to transportation, storage, and application. The process calculations aim at determining the flow of energy and mass and at retaining and, if possible, utilizing the residues. The results of these calculations will provide the parameters for the systems analysis...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Transparent Polyurethanes based upon Polycaprolactone and H 12 MDIisocyanate (Desmodur W) have been synthesised and tested with regard to permeation by Mustard Gas (HD). Variations in soft segment molecular weight, reaction ratio, and chain extender, {{as well as the}} effect of crosslinking have been investigated. It was found that the principal factor governing permeation behaviour was soft segment molecular weight. However as hard segment content increased the determinant role of the soft segment diminished. Morphological Analysis of the synthesised polyurethanes was carried out using DSC, CMI'A, GPC, and WAXD techniques. The physical properties (Hardness, Tensile Strength, etc) of these materials were also determined. Results showed that the use of mixed diol chain extenders or trifunctional crosslinking elements produced increased phase mixing in the polyurethanes as a consequence of poorer hard segment domain organisation. This had the effect of reducing soft segment restrictions such that poorer permeation performance was obtained.. GPC and DSC Analysis of the various polycaprolactones used in the <b>synthesis</b> <b>programme</b> suggested that the lower molecular weight polyols (550 - 2000) were composed of at least two different molecular weight species. Work with mixed polyol formulations indicated this may affect the physical properties of the polyurethanes. GPC Analysis of the synthesised polyurethanes themselves showed a wide variety of molecular weights were obtained; these were seen to be very dependent upon polyol molecular weight. The CAPA 210 (1000 Mol. Wt.) based elastorners had the highest Mn values. It is believed these variations in molecular weight are related to the presence of different catalysts, activators, etc in the original polyols. Injection Moulding trials were carried out on the formulation considered to be the most promising candidate for the face mask material. Slight changes in physical properties were obtained as processing conditions were varied. Most significantly the polyurethane began to shown signs of yellowing at high injection temperatures (190 C and above) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Writing {{therapy to}} improve {{physical}} or mental health can take many forms. The most researched model of therapeutic writing (TW) is unfacilitated, individual expressive writing (written emotional disclosure). Facilitated writing activities are less widely researched. Data sources: Databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Linguistics and Language Behaviour Abstracts, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, were searched from inception to March 2013 (updated January 2015). Review methods: Four TW practitioners provided expert advice. Study procedures were conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised comparative studies were included. Quality was appraised using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Unfacilitated and facilitated TW studies were analysed separately under International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision chapter headings. Meta-analyses were performed where possible using RevMan version 5. 2. 6 (RevMan 2012, The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Costs were estimated from a UK NHS perspective and three cost–consequence case studies were prepared. Realist synthesis followed Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards guidelines. Objectives: To review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TW for people with long-term conditions (LTCs) compared with no writing, or other controls, reporting any relevant clinical outcomes. To conduct a realist synthesis to understand how TW might work, and for whom. Results: From 14, 658 unique citations, 284 full-text papers were reviewed and 64 studies (59 RCTs) {{were included in the}} final effectiveness reviews. Five studies examined facilitated TW; these were extremely heterogeneous with unclear or high risk of bias but suggested that facilitated TW interventions may be beneficial in individual LTCs. Unfacilitated expressive writing was examined in 59 studies of variable or unreported quality. Overall, there was very little or no evidence of any benefit reported in the following conditions (number of studies) : human immunodeficiency virus (six); breast cancer (eight); gynaecological and genitourinary cancers (five); mental health (five); asthma (four); psoriasis (three); and chronic pain (four). In inflammatory arthropathies (six) there was a reduction in disease severity [n = 191, standardised mean difference (SMD) – 0. 61, 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 0. 96 to – 0. 26] in the short term on meta-analysis of four studies. For all other LTCs there were either no data, or sparse data with no or inconsistent, evidence of benefit. Meta-analyses conducted across all of the LTCs provided no evidence that unfacilitated emotional writing had any effect on depression at short- (n = 1563, SMD – 0. 06, 95 % CI – 0. 29 to 0. 17, substantial heterogeneity) or long-term (n = 778, SMD – 0. 04 95 % CI – 0. 18 to 0. 10, little heterogeneity) follow-up, or on anxiety, physiological or biomarker-based outcomes. One study reported costs, no studies reported cost-effectiveness and 12 studies reported resource use; and meta-analysis suggested reduced medication use but no impact on health centre visits. Estimated costs of intervention were low, but there was insufficient evidence to judge cost-effectiveness. Realist synthesis findings suggested that facilitated TW is a complex intervention and group interaction contributes to the perception of benefit. It was unclear from the available data who might benefit most from facilitated TW. Limitation: Difficulties with developing realist <b>synthesis</b> <b>programme</b> theory meant that mechanisms operating during TW remain obscure. Conclusions: Overall, there is little evidence to support the therapeutic effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of unfacilitated expressive writing interventions in people with LTCs. Further research focused on facilitated TW in people with LTCs could be informative. Study registration: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD 42012003343.

40|$|Background Following {{publication}} of the first worked example of the “best fit” method of evidence synthesis for the systematic review of qualitative evidence in this journal, the originators of the method identified a need to specify more fully some aspects of this particular derivative of framework synthesis. Methods and Results We therefore present a second such worked example in which all techniques are defined and explained, and their appropriateness is assessed. Specified features of the method include {{the development of new}} techniques to identify theories in a systematic manner; the creation of an a priori framework for the synthesis; and the “testing” of the synthesis. An innovative combination of existing methods of quality assessment, analysis and synthesis is used to complete the process. This second worked example was a qualitative evidence synthesis of employees’ views of workplace smoking cessation interventions, in which the “best fit” method was found to be practical and fit for purpose. Conclusions The method is suited to producing context-specific conceptual models for describing or explaining the decision-making and health behaviours of patients and other groups. It offers a pragmatic means of conducting rapid qualitative evidence <b>synthesis</b> and generating <b>programme</b> theories relating to intervention effectiveness, which might be of relevance both to researchers and policy-makers...|$|R

It {{describes a}} method of identifying priorities nationally and within each of the Department's 14 conservancies, while accepting they must be subject to periodic revision and change. It also accepts the limitations of assessing the significance of an archaeological site without excavation. The plan establishes a cycle that starts with an outline documentation (synthesis) of a conservancy's cultural heritage, describing its prehistory, history, and the changing ways of life experienced by its peoples. The synthesis identifies obvious gaps in the explanation of that heritage and any substantially conflicting evidence. It is used to identify work programmes of research, management and public interpretation that respond to particular needs and opportunities in a conservancy. In combination, the <b>syntheses</b> and work <b>programmes</b> lead {{to a better understanding of}} the relative significance of archaeological sites in terms of their historical, ethnic, scientific, and educational and other public values.

40|$|Professor Michael Fasham {{played a}} {{pioneering}} {{role in the}} development of marine ecosystem models for the study of nutrient and carbon cycling in the ocean. He is articularly celebrated for his famous Fasham–Ducklow–McKelvie model, which was the first of its kind to separate new and regenerated forms of nutrient, as well as including microbial recycling pathways. Fasham’s models provided key understanding of the links between primary production, carbon cycling and export (of organic matter from the surface to deep ocean) based on both deep and insightful parameterization inspired by his many collaborations with leading experimental and field biologists of the day, and by his expert use of data for model calibration and validation. He had the ability to see the big picture, linking observation and models to achieve a unified understanding of system dynamics. As well as the direct contributions of his own science, Fasham played a pivotal role in steering the international scientific agenda, notably his leadership of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study which had the aim of understanding ocean carbon cycling and sinks via the coordination of extensive field <b>programmes,</b> <b>synthesis</b> and modelling.

40|$|Social {{accountability}} {{in the health}} sector has been promoted as a strategy {{to improve the quality}} and performance of health providers in low- and middle-income countries. Whether improvements occur, however, depends on the willingness and ability of health providers to respond to societal pressure for better care. This article uses a realist approach to review cases of collective citizen action and advocacy with the aim to identify key mechanisms of provider responsiveness. Purposeful searches for cases were combined with a systematic search in four databases. To be included in the review, the initiatives needed to describe at least one outcome at the level of frontline service provision. Some 37 social {{accountability in}}itiatives in 15 countries met these criteria. Using a realist approach, retroductive analysis and triangulation of methods and sources were performed to construct Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations that explain potential pathways to provider responsiveness. The findings suggest that health provider receptivity to citizens' demands for better health care is mediated by health providers' perceptions of the legitimacy of citizen groups and by the extent to which citizen groups provide personal and professional support to health providers. Some citizen groups activated political or formal bureaucratic accountability channels but the effect on provider responsiveness of such strategies was more mixed. Favourable contexts for health provider responsiveness comprise socio-political contexts in which providers self-identify as activists, health system contexts in which health providers depend on citizens' expertise and capacities, and health system contexts where providers have the self-perceived ability to change the system in which they operate. Rather than providing recipes for successful social accountability initiatives, the <b>synthesis</b> proposes a <b>programme</b> theory that can support reflections on the theories of change underpinning social accountability initiatives and interventions {{to improve the quality of}} primary health care in different settings...|$|R
