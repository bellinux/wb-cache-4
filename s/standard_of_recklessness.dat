40|$|Defining {{recklessness}} {{in criminal}} law {{has proved to}} be a great challenge for courts, legislatures and legal theorists. Currently, the mental element <b>of</b> <b>recklessness</b> encompasses several disparate states of mind and is defined differently in the offence of rape. However, it is desirable to have a single definition <b>of</b> <b>recklessness</b> which encapsulates all states of mind previously identified and is applicable to all offences. This article investigates whether reformulating the definition <b>of</b> <b>recklessness</b> in terms <b>of</b> the accused's attitude or belief satisfies these criteria. It concludes that the current formulation of the subjective element of the definition <b>of</b> <b>recklessness</b> must be maintained...|$|R
