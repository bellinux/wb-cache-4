25|$|Characiformes {{form part}} of a series called Otophysi within the {{superorder}} Ostariophysi. Otophysi contains three other orders, Cypriniformes, <b>Siluriformes,</b> and Gymnotiformes. Characiformes forms a group known as Characiphysi with <b>Siluriformes</b> and Gymnotiformes. Characiformes is the sister group to the orders <b>Siluriformes</b> and Gymnotiformes, though this has been debated in light of recent molecular evidence.|$|E
25|$|Akysis is {{the largest}} genus of {{catfishes}} (order <b>Siluriformes)</b> of the family Akysidae.|$|E
25|$|Acrochordonichthys is a genus of {{catfishes}} (order <b>Siluriformes)</b> of {{the family}} Akysidae. It includes ten species.|$|E
25|$|Their closest living {{relatives}} are the Characiformes (characins and allies), the Gymnotiformes (electric eel and American knifefishes) and the <b>Siluriformes</b> (catfishes).|$|E
25|$|The Aspredinidae {{are a small}} South American {{family of}} {{catfishes}} (order <b>Siluriformes)</b> {{also known as the}} banjo catfishes, with about 42 species.|$|E
25|$|The eel-tailed catfish, Tandanus tandanus, is {{a species}} of catfish (order <b>Siluriformes)</b> of the family Plotosidae. This fish {{is also known as}} dewfish, {{freshwater}} catfish, jewfish, and tandan.|$|E
25|$|Callichthyidae is {{a family}} of {{catfishes}} (order <b>Siluriformes),</b> called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running {{down the length of}} their bodies. This family contains {{some of the most popular}} freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of Corydoras.|$|E
25|$|Historically these {{included}} all the forms now {{placed in the}} superorder Ostariophysi except the catfish, which {{were placed in the}} order <b>Siluriformes.</b> By this definition, the Cypriniformes were paraphyletic, so recently the orders Gonorhynchiformes, Characiformes (characins and allies), and Gymnotiformes (knifefishes and electric eels) have been separated out to form their own monophyletic orders.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that about 350 fish species live in the entire Ganges drainage, including several endemics. In a major 2007–2009 study of fish in the Ganges basin (including the river itself and its tributaries, but excluding the Brahmaputra and Meghna basins), a total of 143 fish species were recorded, including 10 non-native introduced species. The most diverse orders are Cypriniformes (barbs and allies), <b>Siluriformes</b> (catfish) and Perciformes (perciform fish), each comprising about 50%, 23% and 14% of the total fish species in the drainage.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the brown}} pelican (P. occidentalis), the American white pelican does not dive for its food. Instead it catches its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than 4 pounds of food a day, mostly fish such as Cypriniformes like Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Lahontan Tui chub (Gila bicolor obesa) and shiners, Perciformes like Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) or Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), Salmoniformes like Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), <b>Siluriformes</b> (catfish), and jackfish. Other animals eaten by these birds are {{crayfish}} and amphibians, and sometimes larval salamanders. Birds nesting on saline lakes, where food is scarce, will travel great distances to better feeding grounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{anatomical}} {{organization of}} the testis in catfish is variable among the families of catfish, {{but the majority of}} them present fringed testis: Ictaluridae, Claridae, Auchenipteridae, Doradidae, Pimelodidae, and Pseudopimelodidae. In the testes of some species of <b>Siluriformes,</b> organs and structures such as a spermatogenic cranial region and a secretory caudal region are observed, in addition to the presence of seminal vesicles in the caudal region. The total number of fringes and their length are different in the caudal and cranial portions between species. Fringes of the caudal region may present tubules, in which the lumen is filled by secretion and spermatozoa. Spermatocysts are formed from cytoplasmic extensions of Sertoli cells; the release of spermatozoa is allowed by breaking of the cyst walls.|$|E
500|$|Many species prey on {{the cane}} toad and its tadpoles in its native habitat, {{including}} the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), the banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), [...] eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the rock flagtail (Kuhlia rupestris), some species of catfish (order <b>Siluriformes),</b> some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), and Paraponera clavata (bullet ants). Predators outside the cane toad's native range include the whistling kite (Haliastur sphenurus), the rakali (Hydromys chrysogaster), the black rat (Rattus rattus) {{and the water}} monitor (Varanus salvator). The tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) and the Papuan frogmouth (Podargus papuensis) have been reported as feeding on cane toads; some Australian crows (Corvus spp.) have also learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the Didelphis genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let their toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad.|$|E
2500|$|Catfish {{belong to}} a {{superorder}} called the Ostariophysi, which also includes the Cypriniformes, Characiformes, Gonorynchiformes and Gymnotiformes, a superorder characterized by the Weberian apparatus. Some place Gymnotiformes as a sub-order of <b>Siluriformes,</b> however this is not as widely accepted. Currently, the <b>Siluriformes</b> {{are said to be}} the sister group to the Gymnotiformes, though this has been debated due to more recent molecular evidence. [...] there are about 36 extant catfish families, and about 3,093 extant species have been described. This makes the catfish order the second or third most diverse vertebrate order; in fact, 1 out of every 20 vertebrate species is a catfish.|$|E
2500|$|Hoplosternum littorale is {{a species}} of catfish (order <b>Siluriformes)</b> {{belonging}} to the Callichthyinae subfamily of the family Callichthyidae. It is known as tamuatá in Brazil, atipa in French Guiana, hassar in Guyana, kwi kwi (or kwie kwie [...] ) in Suriname, cascadu(ra) in Trinidad and Tobago, and busco or currito in Venezuela.|$|E
2500|$|Catfish (or catfishes; order <b>Siluriformes</b> or Nematognathi) are {{a diverse}} group of ray-finned fish. Named for their {{prominent}} barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the <b>Siluriformes</b> order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby. [...] Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many Auchenipteridae) are crepuscular or diurnal (most Loricariidae or Callichthyidae for example).|$|E
2500|$|Ancistrus is a genus of {{freshwater}} fish in the family Loricariidae of order <b>Siluriformes,</b> native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. Sometimes, they are called bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as [...] "pleco" [...] usually is used for Hypostomus plecostomus {{and a few of}} its close relatives.|$|E
2500|$|The Chiapas catfish, Lacantunia enigmatica, is {{an unusual}} species of catfish (order <b>Siluriformes)</b> newly {{described}} in 2005 from the Lacantún River in the Mexican state of Chiapas. While discovery of an undescribed species of catfish is not uncommon, discovery of a new family-level taxon of any vertebrate group is a rare event. The Chiapas catfish mainly feeds on crabs, prawns, small fish, and large, tough plant seeds. This catfish is commonly fished in its natural habitat, where it is known as madre de juil, which means [...] "mother of Rhamdia" [...] (a common fish in the area).|$|E
2500|$|... 416 {{fish species}} are {{known from the}} Yangtze basin, {{including}} 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes {{it one of the}} most species rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 150). 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin. Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above , are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river. The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), <b>Siluriformes</b> (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.|$|E
