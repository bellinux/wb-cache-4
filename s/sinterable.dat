50|$|The AUC {{process is}} {{followed}} in South Korea and Argentina. In the AUC route, calcination, reduction and stabilization are simultaneously {{carried out in}} a vertical fluidized bed reactor. In most countries, <b>sinterable</b> grade UO2 powder for nuclear fuel is obtained by the ammonium diuranate (ADU) process, which requires several more steps.|$|E
5000|$|A {{much wider}} range of {{products}} {{can be obtained from}} powder processes than from direct alloying of fused materials. In melting operations the [...] "phase rule" [...] applies to all pure and combined elements and strictly dictates the distribution of liquid and solid phases which can exist for specific compositions. In addition, whole body melting of starting materials is required for alloying, thus imposing unwelcome chemical, thermal, and containment constraints on manufacturing. Unfortunately, the handling of aluminium/iron powders poses major problems. Other substances that are especially reactive with atmospheric oxygen, such as titanium, are <b>sinterable</b> in special atmospheres or with temporary coatings.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{class of}} {{partially}} crystalline aromatic polyesters based on p-hydroxybenzoic acid and related monomers, liquid-crystal polymers {{are capable of}} forming regions of highly ordered structure while in the liquid phase. However, the degree of order is somewhat {{less than that of}} a regular solid crystal. Typically, LCPs have a high mechanical strength at high temperatures, extreme chemical resistance, inherent flame retardancy, and good weatherability. Liquid-crystal polymers {{come in a variety of}} forms from <b>sinterable</b> high temperature to injection moldable compounds. LCPs can be welded, though the lines created by welding are a weak point in the resulting product. LCPs have a high Z-axis coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium uranyl {{carbonate}} (UO2CO3·2(NH4)2CO3) {{is known}} in the uranium processing industry as AUC and is also called uranyl ammonium carbonate. This compound is important as a component in the conversion process of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) to uranium dioxide (UO2). The ammonium uranyl carbonate is combined with steam and hydrogen at 500-600 °C to yield UO2. In another process aqueous uranyl nitrate, known as uranyl nitrate liquor (UNL) is treated with ammonium bicarbonate to form ammonium uranyl carbonate as a solid precipitate. This is separated from the solution, dried with methanol and then calcinated with hydrogen directly to UO2 to obtain a <b>sinterable</b> grade powder. The ex-AUC uranium dioxide powder is free-flowing, relatively coarse (10 µ) and porous with specific surface area {{in the range of}} 5 m2/g and suitable for direct pelletisation, avoiding the granulation step. Conversion to UO2 is often performed as the first stage of nuclear fuel fabrication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Materials in the Ti-Al-C-N system due {{to their}} {{specific}} heterodesmic structure show pseudo-plastic properties. Direct synthesis of these compounds from respective elements requires high-temperature and long-lasting reaction.

Of common impurities in less pure powders, silicon, aluminium, calcium, magnesium andiron {{are considered to}} have the major effects on sinterability. Of these, Si and Al have detrimental effects, and Ca, Mg and Fe beneficial effects. It is suggested that for an impure powder to be <b>sinterable,</b> the combined (Si + Al) content should be no higher than the combined (Ca + Mg + Fe) content, both expressed in p. p. m...|$|E

40|$|Most {{types of}} nuclear power {{reactors}} use fuel {{in the form of}} high density-uranium dioxide pellets clad in Zircaloy. <b>Sinterable</b> uranium dioxide powder is usually produced via the ammonium diuranate (ADU) route. This involves dissolution of uranium ore concentrates (yellow cake) in nitric acid, purification by solvent extraction using tributyl phosphate in kerosene, precipitation of ADU, filtration, drying, calcination and reduction with hydrogen to give uranium dioxide powder. The AAEC has carried out pilot plant development of these processes to demonstrate the production of nuclear grade uranium dioxide from Australian yellow cake and to improve the processes and technology wherever possible...|$|E
40|$|Freeform {{fabrication}} methods {{allow the}} direct formation of parts built layer by layer, {{under the control}} of a CAD drawing. Most of these methods form parts in thermoplastic or thermoset polymers, but there would be many applications for freeform fabrication of fully functional metal or ceramic parts. We describe here the freeforming of <b>sinterable</b> aluminium alloys. In addition, the building approach allows different materials to be positioned within a monolithic part for an optimal combination of properties. This is illustrated here with the formation of an aluminium gear with a metal-matrix composite wear surface. (C) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} metal-matrix {{composites}} were formed by extrusion freeform, fabrication of a <b>sinterable</b> aluminum alloy {{in combination with}} silicon carbide particles and whiskers, carbon fibers, alumina particles, and hollow flyash cenospheres. Silicon carbide particles were most successful in that the composites retained high density with up to 20 vol% of reinforcement and the strength approximately doubles over {{the strength of the}} metal matrix alone. Comparison with simple models suggests that this unexpectedly high degree of reinforcement {{can be attributed to the}} concentration of small silicon carbide particles around the larger metal powder. This fabrication method also allows composites to be formed with hollow spheres that cannot be formed by other powder or melt methods...|$|E

The perovskite phase is formed in the temperature range of 165 – 340 °C. Sequence of the hydrothermal reactions is studied by identifying the intermediate phases. The initial formation of PbO: TiO 2 solid solution {{is followed by the}} reaction of the same with the remaining mixed gels giving rise to X-ray amorphous PZT phase. Further, through crystallite growth, the X-ray crystalline PZT is formed. This method can be extended for the preparation of PLZT powder as well.

40|$|The actual {{tendency}} {{all over}} the world is to manufacture fuel bundles capable to resist high burn-up. The factors affecting the burn-up increase are: the pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI), the oxidation and hydriding of the Zircaloy- 4 sheath, the increase of internal pressure, stress corrosion cracking, Zircaloy- 4 irradiation growth, fuel swelling. A way to increase fuel burn-up is to diminish the elements internal pressure by adequate UO 2 fuel pellet structure (large grain or controlled closed porosity), hi the large grain size UO 2 pellets, fission gas release rate decreases and the elements internal pressure increase slowly. Similarly, in the UO 2 sintered pellet with controlled closed porosity the fission gas accommodation is better and the elements internal pressure increases slowly. The paper presents a literature review related to the technologies and the methods for manufacturing UO 2 sintered pellets to fuel burn-up extension. The flowsheets for large grains and controlled closed porosity UO 2 sintered pellets obtained by Nb 2 O 5 dopant respectively pores former addition in UO 2 <b>sinterable</b> powder, pressing and sintering in H 2 atmosphere are exposed. In the diagrams are presented the dependency of the main sintered pellet characteristics (pore radius distribution, pores volume, density, grains size) as function of the Nb 2 O 5 dopant concentration, UO 2 <b>sinterable</b> powder nature and sintering temperature. Other sintered pellets characteristics (electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, high temperature molar heat capacity and thermomechanical properties) are presented. The technologies for sintered pellets manufacturing for RU, DUPIC, MOX fuel cycles are presented. A proposal related to fuel manufacturing from Uranium compound resulted in LWR spent fuel reprocessing is also given. 1...|$|E
30|$|A {{reliable}} Cu–Cu bonding joint {{was achieved}} by using the highly <b>sinterable</b> Cu nanoparticle paste. Pure copper nanoparticles used {{in the preparation of}} nanoparticle paste were synthesized through simple routes, with an average size of 60.5  nm. Under an Ar-H 2 gas mixture atmosphere, the Cu nanoparticle paste exhibited large areas of fusion after sintering at 300  °C and reached a low electrical resistivity of 11.2  μΩ cm. With the same temperature as sintering, a compact Cu–Cu bonding joint was achieved under the pressure of 1.08  MPa and the shear strength of the joint could achieve 31.88  MPa. The shear strength and the elemental composition of the bonded joint were almost unchanged after aging test, which proves that the Cu–Cu bonding with this process has excellent thermal stability.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the sintering behaviour of three vanadium enriched variants of T 42 high-speed steel. Powders were prepared by water atomization with vanadium and carbon contents of 6 - 8 wt% and 2. 2 - 2. 7 wt%, respectively. These were annealed, die pressed and sintered in vacuum. All three alloys were sintered to full density giving "as-sintered" microstructures comprising globular MC carbides dispersed in a martensitic matrix. Optimum sintering temperatures were in the range 1240 - 1250 degrees C with lower optimum temperatures associated with higher carbon levels. Sintering characteristics are correlated with phase diagrams calculated using ThermoCalc (TM) software and TCFe 2000 database. The implications for the design of <b>sinterable</b> vanadium containing high-speed steels are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Impact energy {{absorbing}} layers (EALs) comprised of partially densified silicon carbide were formed in situ on fully <b>sinterable</b> silicon carbide substrates. After final sintering, duplex silicon carbide structures resulted which were comprised of a fully sintered, high density silicon carbide substrate or core, overlayed with an EAL of partially sintered silicon carbide integrally bonded to its core member. Thermal cycling tests proved such structures to be moderately resistant to oxidation and highly resistant to thermal shock stresses. The {{strength of the}} developed structures in some cases exceeded but essentially it remained {{the same as the}} fully sintered silicon carbide without the EAL. Ballistic impact tests indicated that substantial improvements in the toughness of sintered silicon carbide were achieved by the use of the partially densified silicon carbide EALs...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the preparation of}} homogeneously doped barium titanate, which can be applied in non-linear dielectric elements. Ba and Ti salts are dissolved, mixed with hydrogen peroxide and added to a solution of ammonium oxalate, resulting {{in the formation of}} an insoluble peroxo-oxalate complex. The presence of oxalate ions and a high pH are necessary for the formation after calcination of a stoichiometric and <b>sinterable</b> powder. To characterise the structure of the precipitating complex, the thermal decomposition of the complex is studied by means of XRD, d-TGA and FTIR. It is found that the precipitating complex is a Ti 0. 91 Zr 0. 09 O 2 (C 2 O 4) 2 H 2 O. The calcined powder prepared with the peroxo-oxalate method contains no second phase, in contrast to powders prepared with the oxalate method and the peroxide method...|$|E
40|$|Activities in {{a program}} to obtain UC pellets of maximum density for {{irradiation}} testing are described. A study {{was made of the}} effects of the UC powder thermal history, sintering time, sintering temperature, and additives on the UC sinterability. Preliminary results indicate that the UC powder synthesized under the most severe conditions of temperature and time (1740 deg C, 107 min) was less <b>sinterable</b> than powders prepared at lower temperatures, or at the same temperature for shorter time. It was also concluded that although both temperature and time of sintering pellets affect density, temperature is more important. Additions of Fe (0. 1 to 1. 0 %) improve sinterability and promote grain growth. The final density obtained on sintering in a vacuum was about the same as that resulting from sintering in He at atmospheric pressure. (J. R. D. ...|$|E

Preferably, the material has a grey colour or an ivory to white colour respectively when it contains less than 0. 15 wt. % or less than 0. 05 wt. % silicide-forming transition, other colours being obtained by addition of 2 - 50 wt. % colouring additives. Also claimed is production of the above silicon nitride material, in which silicon nitride powder, {{having one of the}} above d-transition metal contents, is subjected to sintering at normal pressure, pressure sintering or hot pressing.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is made of}} pressureless sintering of commercially available alpha-SiC powders at temperatures between 1900 and 2150 C for periods of 10 to 240 min under one atmosphere of argon pressure. It is found that alpha-SiC powder containing boron and carbon sintering aids is <b>sinterable</b> at 2150 C {{for a period of}} 30 min to a high final density (greater than 96 percent of theoretical). In alpha-SiC powder containing aluminum and carbon sintering aids, the final density achieved is only about 80 percent of theoretical. Determinations are made of room temperature and high temperature (1370 C) flexure strength and oxidation resistance on sintered high density (more than 96 percent of theoretical) alpha-SiC (boron, carbon) material.

40|$|Glass-ceramics were {{produced}} using an Italian municipal incinerator bottom ash and glass culler {{coming from a}} community glass recycling program. The capability of three different mixtures to be vitrified and subsequently devitrified by both bulk and sintering process was investigated by means of differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, hot stage microscopy, firing shrinkage, water absorption and bulk density measurements, as well as scanning electron microscopy observations. High ash contents favour the growth of crystallised fraction volume {{and the formation of}} crystals of the pyroxene group, and anorthite in addition to wollastonite. Since the nucleation mechanism starts from the surface and sintering occurs before crystallisation, all the compositions humidified with a water solution are easily <b>sinterable</b> in dense materials at the relatively low temperature of about 850 degrees C, in such way as to render the process economically advantageous (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|In summary, a {{reliable}} Cu–Cu bonding interface {{was achieved by}} using the pure Cu nanoparticle paste, which was mixed by the synthesized Cu nanoparticles and organic solutions. The sintered Cu nanoparticle paste film achieves a high sintering performance at 300  °C and reaches a low resistivity of 11.2  μΩ cm. The bonding interface shows a stable and compact microstructure after bonding at a low temperature of 300  °C for 60  min under a low pressure of 1.08  MPa and the atmosphere of Ar-H 2 gas mixture. The shear strength of the bonded joint reaches a high value of 31.88  MPa and shows little change after isothermal thermal aging test at 150  °C for 200  h. Besides, the microstructure and element composition of the bonding interface are almost unchanged before and after aging. Therefore, these testing results and the simple bonding environment requirements confirm that the Cu–Cu bonding by using the highly <b>sinterable</b> Cu nanoparticle paste is a promising technology {{in the application of}} 3 D-IC packaging.|$|E
40|$|Presented {{is a model}} which {{suggests}} {{that it should be}} possible to pressureless sinter a SiC(sub w) / Si 3 N 4 composite to theoretical density. Prior failure to achieve complete densification by sintering is attributed to the use of compositions which result in a glass deficit. There is one basic premise for this model. The ratio of glass amount to surface area of nonglass constituents must be the same for both composite and <b>sinterable</b> monolithic Si 3 N 4. This model suggests that whisker and grain sizes and whisker loading influence the glass amount necessary for successful sintering of composites. According to the model, a large glass amount will be necessary for successful sintering of these composites. However, grain boundary thicknesses in the composite will be less than those in the analogous monolithic materials. This suggests that good high temperature strength may still be attained. A recent report supports the predictions of the model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Highly <b>sinterable</b> lithium {{titanate}} (Li 2 TiO 3) powder was fabricated by an organic-inorganic solution route. Liquid-type {{ethylene glycol}} (EG) {{was used as}} an organic carrier for the metal cations. Titanium isopropoxide and lithium nitrate were dissolved in the liquid-type ethylene glycol without any precipitation. The dried precursor gel showed crystalline form at 300 °C and carbon-free Li 2 TiO 3 was observed above 400 °C. The primary particle size of the carbon-free Li 2 TiO 3 was about 100 nm, and the structure of the crystallized powder was porous and agglomerated. The porous powder was ball-milled and easily ground to fine particles. The powder compact was densified to 93 % theoretical density (TD) at relatively low sintering temperature of 1100 °C for 2 h. The densifed Li 2 TiO 3 showed a small grain size of 1. 2 µm. As well, the grain size was notably increased at 1200 °C and above.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{tries to}} prepare dense piezoceramics {{by way of}} {{reactive}} liquid phase sintering. Technique concerning a low-temperature <b>sinterable</b> process is developed by incorporating 4 PbO⋅B 2 O 3. The host system is a perovskite type piezoceramic, Pb(Ti,Zr) O 3. If small amounts of 4 PbO. B 2 O 3 glass powder {{are added to the}} calcined Pb(Ti,Zr) O 3 ceramics, the liquid phase is formed during sintering. Hence, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties are enhanced and the sintering temperature can be reduced. The value of the kp, KT 33 and Qm is increased and dielectric loss tangent is decreased when a small amounts of 4 PbO. B 2 O 3 dopant (i. e. 0. 2 wt%) are added to the PZT system. With more 4 PbO.

40|$|Easy <b>sinterable</b> Ti 3 SiC 2 powder was {{synthesized}} from {{a powder}} mixture with a molar ratio of 1. 0 Ti, 0. 3 Al, 1. 2 Si, and 2. 0 TiC by heating at 1200 degrees C in the flowing Ar. Here, the Al powder {{acts as a}} deoxidation agent and provides a liquid phase for the reaction. The powder compacts subjected to pressureless sintering at 1300 degrees C in Ar had a relative density up to 99 %. The results of chemical analysis and the measured lattice constant suggest that the Al-Si liquid phase was formed at approximately 1200 degrees C and that liquid-phase sintering was promoted by the 0. 1 molar ratio of Al and the 0. 2 molar ratio of Si remaining in excess.

40|$|This note {{reports the}} effects on {{densification}} of independent additions of coarse equiaxed SiC grains and fibrous SiC that were mixed with fine beta-SiC to develop a duplex microstructure with improved toughness. The fine-matrix SiC did not contain excess boron and carbon. The equiaxed CVD beta-SiC {{was introduced in the}} fine beta-SiC matrix material in amounts of 5 and 10 wt%. Results indicate that the CVD beta-SiC, which is quite coarse, exhibits little indication of sinterability. The effect of these coarse-grained and fibrous additions on the sinterability of fine beta-SiC may result from a geometric type of interaction. This interpretation is reinforced by X-ray diffraction of the powders and sintered pellets via monochromatic CuK-alpha radiation; the diffraction patterns of the sintered composite structures are virtually a combination of those of the components. The addition of nonsinterable SiC to the <b>sinterable</b> material slightly reduces sinterability, the larger particles interacting geometrically with the fine matrix material to prevent complete densification...|$|E
