50|$|Although not {{apparent}} today, Beeley Wood {{was once an}} area of industry with mining and quarrying taking place. Ganister was the material that was mined, this {{is a type of}} hard sandstone used in the manufacture of <b>silica</b> <b>bricks</b> used to line industrial furnaces. The Drift mining method was used because of the slope of the land in Beeley Wood and the mines went into the hillside for a long way and to a great depth. The fact that the wood is on a slope enabled gravity trackways to be used to transport the Ganister down to the valley bottom. The Ganister was also quarried in at least one location in the woods and the overgrown remnants of a large quarry can still be seen today. The largest of the mines was the Beeley Wood Mine, owned by the <b>Silica</b> Fire <b>Brick</b> Company and managed by J.T.

50|$|A {{range of}} other {{materials}} find use as firebricks for lower temperature applications. Magnesium oxide is often used as a lining for furnaces. <b>Silica</b> <b>bricks</b> {{are the most common}} type of bricks used for the inner lining of furnaces and incinerators.

They revealed more expansion joints should have been put in the first place, but these now become expansion joints themselves and are of no concern as long as structural integrity is not affected.

A new kind of beaded SiC also {{had been found in}} the specimen. The result showed that well-crystallized β-SiC fibers began to appear at 1550 °C with excessive of 100 wt % content of carbon. While at 1600 °C for 6 h with excessive of 100 wt% content of carbon, the as-synthesized SiC fibers were grown with some beads in the fiber strings. The beaded SiC consisted of strings with diameters of less than 0. 5 µm (or even 0. 1 µm) and periodic beads with diameters of 0. 5 - 1. 0 µm. Vapor-solid (VS) mechanism and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism were also discussed in the synthesizing process of fiber-like SiC. This kind of fiber-like SiC may used as reinforce materials in ceramic composites, the fracture toughness of brittle ceramics can be effectively improved via the incorporation of strong SiC fibers into the matrix due to crack deflection, bridging and fiber pull-out. Moreover, these toughening mechanisms do not diminish as temperature increases...|$|R
40|$|Frost damage occurs {{especially}} if damp building elements {{are subjected to}} frequent freeze-thaw cycles.

40|$|The {{refractory}} linings of Coke oven walls at Coke Plant 2 of TATA Steel IJmuiden are in {{the process}} of replacement. The campaign life of the new ovens is expected to exceed 30 years. During the service the linings are exposed to cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. Over time the loads cause cracking and degradation of the linings. This study investigates the resistance of two types of silica based refractories to cyclic fatigue failure for material selection purposes. The typical methods approached in previous studies to address fatigue failure in materials are reviewed and their applicability to fulfill the aims of this study is discussed. A strain-controlled test procedure is developed for the existing testing equipment in three point bending and compression setups. Both of the materials are found susceptible to cyclic fatigue failure in the strain-controlled mode. Moreover, the stress-strain envelopes in monotonic and cyclic loading tests are found to be different. Fractographic analysis and other complementary techniques revealed the difference is due to the gradual development of micro-damage during the loading cycles. The formation of micro-damage is found responsible for the less brittle failure occurred in cyclic tests. The fused silica material is found to be less vulnerable to fatigue failure than the crystalline <b>silica</b> <b>brick.</b> The microstructural features of the fused silica material account for its reduced brittleness behavior...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion of {{refractory}} <b>silica</b> <b>brick</b> used to {{line the}} roof or crown of many-glass-melting furnaces {{is a serious}} problem in furnaces using oxygen-fuel rather than air-fuel. In this work, the authors report equilibrium calculations for the Na{sub 2 }O-SiO{sub 2 } system that predict the formation of a variable-composition liquid-solution phase as a function of key furnace variables. Since thermodynamic data for the relevant liquid phases are unavailable in standard compilations, new data generated using the associate species model are included in the calculations. The calculations indicate that gas-phase NaOH concentrations less than {approximately} 15 ppm will not react with the silica refractory under either air-fired or oxy-fired conditions, since this is the smallest equilibrium NaOH partial pressure in a system containing crystalline SiO{sub 2 } (either cristobalite or tridymite) in equilibrium with a variable-composition sodium-silicate liquid phase at refractory temperatures in the range 1, 400 [...] 1, 700 C. The high water content ({approximately} 65 %) of oxygen-fired furnaces results in measured NaOH(g) concentrations as high as 300 ppm, which greatly exceeds the 1, 600 C maximum of 68 ppm NaOH(g) for oxy-fired equilibrium with a liquid-SiO{sub 2 } (crystalline) system. This indicates that there is a thermodynamic driving force for NaOH(g) to react with silica refractories in oxy-fired furnaces. The results of the calculations are used to define a critical temperature, above which corrosion is not expected to occur for a given NaOH(g) partial pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} parameters of silica refractories, such as compressive strength, bulk, density, quantity of silica, microstructure and porosity were evaluated of unused and used bricks to line the crowns of glass furnaces, when {{the rate of}} corrosion of crowns were about 2 times greater. The change of these parameters, the chemical composition and formation of the microcracks in the used silica refractories material were studied.

The main reason of corrosion high quality <b>silica</b> <b>bricks</b> used to line the crown of electrovacuum glass furnace is the multiple cyclic change of crown temperature at 1405 - 1430 °C range in the initial zone of crown and at 1575 - 1605 °C range in the zone of highest temperatures...|$|R

As they follow the line, the pyramids slowly become larger and newer. By the time the pyramids are ten feet high, the travelers reach the end of the line and find a pyramid that is not open at the top. As they watch, a creature with gray scales, one arm, a mouth and a pointed tail pushes its way out of the top of the pyramid, pulls itself several yards along the ground, then plants itself in the ground by the tail. It starts exhaling bricks from its mouth at ten-minute intervals and using them to build another pyramid around itself. Jarvis realizes that the creature is silicon-based rather than carbon-based; neither animal, vegetable nor mineral, but a little of each.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{investigating}} the acid resistance of ceramic materials to identify construction materials for emerging technology in chemical and metallurgical processes. Eight commercial ceramic materials, including two red shale, two fireclay, a silica, a silicon carbide, a carbon, and a high-alumina brick, were evaluated. Samples were exposed to 40 wt pct ho 3 at 70 deg and 90 deg c and 60 wt pct hno 3 at 50 deg, 70 deg, and 90 deg c for time periods of 110 days. Statistically significant changes in cold crushing strength were generally small or not detected, except for a strength drop in the high-alumina brick, which decreased in strength when exposed to the chosen acid concentrations at 90 deg c. Volume and weight changes were also measured. The leach rates of al, ca, fe, k, mg, na, si, and ti were monitored. Increasing temperature or {{a decrease in the}} acid concentration resulted in an increased ion leach rate. Of the conditions tested, the most severe corrosion occurred at 90 deg c for a 40 -wt-pct hno 3 solution.

40|$|The {{structural}} phase transitions of monoclinic tridymite {{that occur}} at elevated temperatures, {{as well as}} the structure of the high-temperature modifications, have been studied by Si- 29 MAS NMR. The sample, originating from the surface of a refractory <b>silica</b> <b>brick,</b> displays sharp discontinuities in the first moment (M(1)), second moment (M(2)), or both, of the Si- 29 MAS NMR spectrum at the following phase transitions: 108 +/- 1 degrees C for the monoclinic (MC) to orthorhombic (OF) transition, 165 +/- 5 degrees C for the transition from OP to a second orthorhombic phase (OS), and 206 +/- 4 degrees C for the transition from OS to a third orthorhombic phase (OC). M(1) 7 for the OC phase becomes more negative with increasing temperature up to similar to 323 degrees C, at which there is also a small discontinuity in M(2), indicating a transition from OC to a hexagonal phase (LHP). The spectrum of the MC phase consists of 12 narrow lines of equal area, consistent with the known crystal structure. The spectrum of the OP phase is broad and asymmetric, indicating a distribution of local environments at the Si sites. It can be simulated assuming an incommensurate structural modulation with a maximum amplitude of similar to 5 x 10 (- 2) Angstrom, but it is also consistent with a recent domain-formation model, provided that most disorder occurs at the Si 6 site. The spectrum of the OS phase is asymmetric, indicating a nonlinear incommensurate modulation with a maximum amplitude of similar to 2 x 10 (- 2) Angstrom. The spectra of higher temperature phases are consistent with the single Si site of the known crystal structures, but M, values imply significantly smaller mean Si-O-Si angles [alpha], e. g., [alpha] = 152. 6 degrees at 220 degrees C from NMR, compared with 168. 0 degrees from X-ray diffraction data.

40|$|The main {{impetus for}} this {{research}} was the desire to verify models for determining transient moisture profiles in the capillary range. For the evaluations, transient moisture profiles were both simulated and measured, after which {{the results of the}} two methods were compared. The study was performed for on specimens exposed to continuous water absorption, using specimens of both single and combined materials. The materials used for the study were two mortars and a lime <b>silica</b> <b>brick.</b> For testing, we chose materials with moisture properties corresponding to those of common inorganic façade materials. As input for the simulations, data such as sorption isotherms and moisture diffusivities were determined for the studied materials. Sorption isotherms were experimentally determined over the complete moisture range, two separate methods having to be used for the hygroscopic and the capillary parts of the moisture range. In the hygroscopic moisture range, both absorption and desorption isotherms could be determined, but in the capillary moisture range only desorption isotherms could be determined. To allow measurement of absorption isotherms in the capillary moisture range, the measuring equipment had to be modified; however, despite the modifications, reliable absorption measurements were still not possible. The desorption isotherms determined by the two different methods generally agreed well for all tested materials. Moisture diffusivities were determined by evaluating a series of water absorption tests using a Boltzmann transformation principle. To determine moisture diffusivities over the complete moisture range, the water absorption tests were performed on specimens conditioned to different initial moisture contents, ranging from completely dry to the vacuum saturation point. The variation in the results was significantly reduced when the water content was expressed as the degree of vacuum saturation; thus, moisture diffusivity was determined as a function of moisture content, expressed as a degree of vacuum saturation. Different methods for measuring the transient moisture profiles were considered. The moisture profile measurements were supposed to be performed on specimens of both single and combined materials. Two of the most interesting methods were the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique and the slice and dry method. The NMR technique displayed excellent precision in terms of both moisture content measurement and the spatial resolution. However, the method was severely limited, in that even an insignificant amount of iron in the specimen disturbed the measurements. Another limitation was restricted access to the measuring equipment. For the larger-scale measurements of the moisture profiles, the slice and dry technique was chosen. This method offered high and conclusive precision in terms of moisture content measurement, and only relatively simple laboratory equipment was needed. One drawback of the method was that the specimens had to be sliced for testing, meaning that a particular specimen could not be tested repeatedly. Other drawbacks were limited spatial resolution and the destruction of the specimen. Moisture profiles were measured after a continuous wetting phase, for both the specimens of three single materials and the two material combinations. The combinations were intended to simulate a façade consisting of a layer of mortar on masonry: the outer layer of mortar was exposed to continuous wetting, and the moisture profiles were then measured for the material combination. Both the thickness of the outer mortar layer and the properties of the mortar were varied. The measurements showed that the moisture properties of the outer layer of mortar depended more significantly on both the moisture penetration depth and moisture levels in the underlying material than on mortar thickness. Moisture profile simulations were performed using off-the-shelf software, using as inputs the absorption isotherms and moisture diffusivities determined in this work. The simulations were intended to reflect the larger-scale experimental portions of this research. To this end, the boundary conditions and wetting durations used as inputs corresponded to the conditions of the larger-scale moisture profile measurements. The simulated and measured results for the combined materials largely agreed with each other, in terms of both moisture levels and depth of moisture front. However, the simulated moisture profiles of the two mortars as single materials significantly diverged from the measured values. The simulated profiles lacked a clear front in the moisture levels and moreover were overestimated after the front. Alternative simulations were carried out in which the deviation between the simulations and the measurements was clarified, and was shown to depend on errors in the technique for evaluating diffusivities at low moisture levels. Comparison between the simulated and measured moisture profiles indicated that moisture profiles can be predicted with considerable precision in the high moisture range. However, by determining additional material data pertaining to moisture diffusivity in the low moisture range, the precision of the predictions can be improved. A primary conclusion of the research is that moisture profiles can be predicted for combined materials using off-the-shelf software...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} analyzes recommendations {{existing in}} different {{sources of information}} for the choice of methods of strengthening and reconditioning of worn machine parts. These methods include: the method of electric arc deposition, chemical-thermal treatment, gas-powder deposition, gas-powder and plasma spraying, electric arc metallization. As a result of studies of wear of the working surfaces of the plates of silicate brick press boxes, we define that the plates wear out unevenly and {{the thickness of the}} worn layer varies between 0. 3 [...] . 2 mm. Technological method is chosen as the method of the plate reliability enhancement and maintaining. One of the main technological stages of reliability formation is machine parts strengthening using the methods of strengthening technologies, namely electric arc metallization. Wire models Нп- 65 Г, ФМИ- 2, Нп- 40 Х 13 are used to develop wear-resistant coatings with desired properties. Technological process of the plates repair consists of the following basic operations: plate preparation, wire preparation, plate coating, plate grinding, final checking. Single and complex reliability indicators are determined by testing a set of the plates and registering all the indicators (operating time, failures, faults). The value of the economic reliability index of the plate Kе equals to 0, 10.
