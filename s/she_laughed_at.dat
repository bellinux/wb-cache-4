2500|$|In Stuart Lake's best-selling biography, [...] (1931), Earp {{added to}} the story. He {{is quoted as saying}} that Holliday's girlfriend, [...] "Big Nose Kate" [...] Horony, devised a diversion. She {{procured}} a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol. However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed [...] "a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room." [...] <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> the idea of [...] "a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Reuters writer Daniel Carlson {{said the}} show was [...] "exactly {{as bad as you}} would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; although he praised Matt Lucas, he said Maguire and Lucas were inappropriately over-the-top. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants to remind us of Monty Python and the Holy Grail". However, Gilbert said the show might work better in half-hour increments, rather than in the one-hour premiere with [...] "Wench Trouble" [...] and [...] "Golden Powers". Kate Ward of Entertainment Weekly said although the show's premise had promise, she did not particularly like the execution. Ward said Matt Lucas's character [...] "came off as Dr. Evil light", but said Sean Maguire was charming and that <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> some of the [...] "juvenile jokes", including Horst Draper, the name of a prisoner accused of raping horses. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard complimented the show's high production values, but said, [...] "What was spent on sets didn't go into the script." [...] He also said the concept of a comedy swords-and-fantasy show is redundant because even serious shows, like [...] and , are comedies to an extent.|$|E
