5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers. They immediately telephoned a warning to Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his <b>situation</b> <b>map.</b> They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and was unsure of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until {{he picked up the}} Brighton–London rail line. He then turned north-west.|$|E

The 51st (Highland) Division was held up at Flesquieres village, which fell the following day. Haig's intelligence chief Brigadier-General Charteris, told him that the Germans {{would not be able to}} reinforce for 48 hours and James Marshall-Cornwall, then a junior intelligence officer, later an admiring biographer of Haig, alleged that Charteris refused to have reported fresh German divisions shown on the <b>situation</b> <b>map</b> as he did not want to weaken Haig's resolution.|$|E

From there, it advanced to Okhvat where it was encircled and completely destroyed on 14 January. 1,100 dead were later found in a forest near Okhvat, including the regimental commander who was posthumously promoted to Major General.

What was expensive and required the user to get a paper copy in a shop is now available on any Smartphone. Not only maps but location-related information visible on the maps is an obvious feature. This work is an application of opportunistic networking for the spreading of maps and location-related data in an ad-hoc, distributed fashion. The system can also add user-created information to the map in form of points of interest. The result is a best effort service for spreading of maps and points of interest.

CHAC has been tested with two different state transition rules: an aggregative function that combines the heuristic and pheromone information of both objectives and a second one that is based on the dominance concept of multiobjective optimization problems. These rules have been evaluated in several different <b>situations</b> (<b>maps</b> with different degree of difficulty), and we have found that they yield better results than a greedy algorithm (taken as baseline) in addition to a military behaviour that is also better in the tactical sense. The aggregative function, in general, yields better results than the one based on dominance...|$|R
