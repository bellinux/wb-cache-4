2500|$|The trail chest {{contained}} 18 {{round shot}} while the caisson carried an additional 100-round shot and 50 canister shot rounds. One caisson {{was assigned to}} each 4-pounder.

2500|$|Early's {{division}} began a counterattack, led initially by Col. Edmund N. Atkinson's Georgia brigade, which {{inspired the}} men from the brigades of Col. Robert Hoke, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, and Col. John M. Brockenbrough to charge forward out of the railroad ditches, driving Meade's men from the woods in a disorderly retreat, followed closely by Gibbon's. Early's orders to his brigades were to pursue as far as the railroad, but in the chaos many kept up the pressure over the open fields as far as the old Richmond Road. Union artillery crews proceeded to unleash a blast of close-range canister <b>shot,</b> <b>firing</b> {{as fast as they could}} load their guns. The Confederates were also struck by the leading brigade of Birney's belated advance, commanded by Brig. Gen. J. H. Hobart Ward. Birney followed up with the brigades of Brig. Gens. Hiram G. Berry and John C. Robinson, which broke the Rebel advance that had threatened to drive the Union into the river. Col. Atkinson was struck in the shoulder by canister shot and abandoned by his own brigade; Union soldiers later found and took him prisoner. Any further Confederate advance was deterred by the arrival of the III Corps division of Brig. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles on the right. General Burnside, who by this time was focused on his attacks on Marye's Heights, was dismayed that his left flank attack had not achieved the success he assumed earlier in the day. He ordered Franklin to [...] "advance his right and front," [...] but despite repeated entreaties, Franklin refused, claiming that all of his forces had been engaged. This was not true, however, as the entire VI Corps and Brig. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps had been mostly idle, suffering only a few casualties from artillery fire while they waited in reserve.|$|E

50|$|A {{trial was}} devised {{to test the}} rate of fire of Hall's breech-loading rifles in {{comparison}} to muzzle-loading rifles and Army-issue muzzle-loading muskets. A company of 38 men were given 10 minutes to load and fire at targets 100 yards distant. The company scored 164 hits (33% of the 464 <b>shots</b> <b>fired)</b> with conventional muzzle-loading rifles, and 208 hits (25% of the 845 <b>shots</b> <b>fired)</b> with the faster loading, but less accurate, army-issue smooth-bore muskets, in comparison to 430 hits (36% of the 1198 <b>shots</b> <b>fired)</b> with Hall's rifles.|$|R

60|$|Godfrey's {{expedition}} {{was not a}} {{very successful}} one. He brought back four grouse and a dozen small birds, which he had killed with a single <b>shot,</b> <b>firing</b> into the thick of a flock that flew by overhead. The grouse were roasted for dinner, and Godfrey found to his satisfaction that Luka had baked a pile of cakes, this being the first time they had tasted bread for a fortnight, as it demanded more time and attention than they could spare to it in the boat. Luka told him that several flights of black duck had passed up the river while he had been at work at the boat, and volunteered to grease the boat next day if Godfrey would try to get a shot at them.|$|E

50|$|The inquiry then {{considered}} how {{the coal}} dust {{might have been}} ignited. Four possibilities were considered: Open lights (lamps or matches), <b>shot</b> <b>firing,</b> sparking from friction and electricity. No evidence of faulty lights or contraband was found (though there remains {{the question of the}} Howart's Patent Deflector reported at the 1933 inquiry). All shots were accounted for and every shot hole inspected; none was fired at the time or shortly before the explosion. Friction from tubs (coal wagons) against the rails or following a derailment was considered and dismissed.|$|E
50|$|The trail chest {{contained}} 18 {{round shot}} while the caisson carried an additional 100 round shot and 50 canister shot rounds. One caisson {{was assigned to}} each 4-pounder. Of the 50 canister rounds, 26 were heavy canister containing 41 larger projectiles while 24 were light canister with 63 smaller projectiles. The canister round was propelled by 1.75 lb of gunpowder. The amount of gunpowder in the round <b>shot</b> <b>firing</b> charge was 1.5 lb. The maximum range of the 4-pounder was 1200 m. The effective range was 700 m for round shot and 400 m for canister.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{the safety}} lamps were found, however one {{was found that}} was unlocked.

Several men had unofficial (and therefore illegal) lamp-keys on them. In the immediate vicinity of the seat of the explosion little burning was seen, the supposition was that a firedamp explosion had raised dust in the passageways and the coal dust had exploded. The official investigation tentatively suggested that <b>shot</b> <b>firing</b> had displaced the gas towards the area where men were smoking and that a naked flame there triggered off the explosion.|$|E

50|$|Born in South Brooklyn, Casso was the {{youngest}} of the three children of Michael and Margaret Casso (née Cucceullo). Each of Casso's grandparents had emigrated from Campania, Italy, during the 1890s. His godfather was Salvatore Callinbrano, a made man and captain in the Genovese crime family, who maintained a powerful influence on the Brooklyn docks. Casso dropped out of school at 16 and got a job with his father as a longshoreman. As a young boy, Casso became a crack <b>shot,</b> <b>firing</b> pistols at targets on a rooftop which he and his friends used as a shooting range. Casso also made money shooting predatory hawks for pigeon tenders. Casso stood at 5'6 and weighed 185 pounds.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{deals with}} analysis of activities, technical equipment, placement and activation of special groups of FRS CR {{in case of}} extraordinary event in the Czech Republic. There are these specialized units of FRS CR: Divers, Climbers, Dog Handlers, Experts for <b>Shot</b> <b>Firing</b> and Experts for Searching and Extrication from Collapsed Structures. According to Director General of FRS CR Decision issued the 5 of March 2013 that dedicated the bases of FRS CR and set predestination of Fire Units for rescue operations, the specialized units are placed in Support Points, where the machinery and equipment for specialized rescue operation including necessary staff is stationed. In the frame of this bachelor work a questionnaire research was performed to gain data necessary for qualitative analysis of special teams of FRS in regions. The aim of this work is {{to determine whether the}} activities of special groups of FRS are meeting the requirements for dealing with emergencies in the state territory of the Czech Republic. The distribution of special teams in the Czech Republic is analyzed and a procedure for Operations and Information Centre FRC describing the preparedness and the way of activation of special teams is suggested. Such a procedure does not exist in the present. There is a close cooperation between Experts for Searching and Extrication from Collapsed Structures and Dog Handlers. The using of dogs in rescue operations is specific; in this way are usually used dogs and handlers from the other parts of Integrated Rescue System. Operation procedures, periodical professional training and necessary minimum equipment for specialized teams are set by Director General of FRS CR Decisions. Regional OIC or OIC of MI ? GD activate specialized teams on the demand of commanding officer in the field. Available results of questionnaire research show that the action readiness of specialized teams of FRS meets the demands of extraordinary events in the territory of the Czech Republic. It was confirmed that the equipment of specialized teams is in the accordance of minimum technical equipment according Director General of FRS CR Decisions. In the closing part of this work the draft of regional Operation and Information Centre procedures is prepared in the aim to provide OIC staff a tool for activation of specialized teams including their equipment and machinery in the case of extraordinary event in the territory of the Czech Republic. When the introductory information is obtained, created procedures activate specialized teams immediately, in this way the fire localization or life rescuing can be realized significantly quicker...|$|E
