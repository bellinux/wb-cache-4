5|$|Infamous was {{developed}} by <b>Sucker</b> Punch Productions, {{with a team of}} 60 people working for about three years. Though they could have opted to request the necessary funds from Sony to increase the team size and finish the game in two years, producer Brian Fleming noted that <b>Sucker</b> Punch's iteration-based development approach worked better with a smaller team size.|$|E
5|$|Development on Infamous 2 began {{immediately}} after <b>Sucker</b> Punch finished the first Infamous, led by returning game director Nate Fox. The game's music was composed by James Dooley, Bryan Mantia, the band Galactic, and Jonathan Mayer. Both the game's music and fictional city {{were inspired by}} New Orleans. The original voice actor for Cole was replaced by Eric Ladin as <b>Sucker</b> Punch wanted somebody who could perform Cole's physical reactions with motion capture, a new addition to the series.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Punch (also {{referred}} to as Donkey Punch: A Cal Innes book and <b>Sucker</b> Punch) is a crime novel by Scottish author Ray Banks. It {{was first published in}} the United Kingdom by Edinburgh-based company Birlinn Ltd in 2007, and again by the same publisher in 2008. In the United States it was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2009, titled <b>Sucker</b> Punch, and was reprinted in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Hybridization with nonnative fishes is a {{major factor}} {{influencing}} the status of native catostomids in the Colorado River basin. In Wyoming, hybridization with nonnative white <b>suckers</b> Catostomus commersonii is a particular concern in the conservation of native bluehead <b>suckers</b> C. discobolus and flannelmouth <b>suckers</b> C. latipinnis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the meristic and morphometric characteristics of bluehead <b>suckers,</b> flannel-mouth <b>suckers,</b> white <b>suckers,</b> and their hybrids from Muddy Creek, Wyoming, for which genotypic data were available to verify the classification of individual fish as pure species or hybrids. We also sought to develop discriminant function models that can be used in the field. Bluehead <b>suckers</b> and flannelmouth <b>suckers</b> had more lateral line scales, shorter and narrower heads, and narrower caudal peduncles than whit...|$|R

5|$|<b>Sucker</b> Punch began {{planning}} {{the game as}} early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto {{a new generation of}} hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions {{they would like to see}} on the PlayStation 4 system. <b>Sucker</b> Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sucker</b> Punch sold 16,000 {{copies in}} its first week of release in the United States, debuting at number thirty-six on the Billboard 200 on the issue dated April 9, 2011. In its second week, the album rose nine {{positions}} to number twenty-two, with sales of 20,000 copies. The same week, it reached {{the summit of the}} Top Soundtracks chart, having debuted at number two one week earlier. In Australia, the album debuted at number eighteen and spent two weeks on the chart. With over 117,000 units sold in the United States, <b>Sucker</b> Punch finished the year as the best-selling 2011 film soundtrack. In France, it debuted at number eighty-nine and reached its peak of seventy-nine the following week. In New Zealand, the album entered the chart at number thirty-six and managed to reach thirty-three the next week. <b>Sucker</b> Punch also reached number thirty-seven in Austria, forty-two in Germany and fifty-seven in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each <b>sucker</b> is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a <b>sucker</b> attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} has increasingly {{been used to}} determine trophic relationships in aquatic food webs, but variation in isotopic enrichment between predator and prey has added uncertainty into its application. I am conducting a feeding study to determine how stable isotopes are enriched in June <b>suckers</b> compared to their prey. <b>Suckers</b> are fed one of five diets ad libitum everyday. Samples of the diet and the <b>suckers</b> are collected through time, and analyzed for their δ 13 C and δ 15 N signatures. As fish grow new muscle, the signature of the June <b>suckers</b> should become enriched compared to their diet. Knowing how stable isotopes are enriched in June <b>suckers</b> compared to their prey provides a means to determine the diet of June <b>suckers</b> in native and refuge habitats where the <b>suckers</b> are consuming unknown prey types...|$|R

5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog <b>sucker,</b> and white <b>sucker.</b> However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E

5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, longfin dace, Sonora <b>sucker,</b> {{and desert}} <b>sucker.</b> Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except speckled dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of three propagation practices and three corm types of enset {{on the production}} of <b>suckers</b> was investigated. After removal of apical buds, mother corms were uprooted and immediately replanted, not uprooted from original positions and uprooted and transferred to new planting holes three months later. Three corm types: whole, halved and quartered corms were used. <b>Suckers</b> were harvested one year after removal of apical buds. After harvest, the <b>suckers</b> were sorted into three size groups: undersized, small and medium to large. The number of <b>suckers</b> produced per plot, from four planting holes, ranged from 40 to 141 depending on the treatments. Halved and quartered mother corms, when transferred to new planting holes three months after removal of apical buds, produced fewer <b>suckers.</b> On the other hand, the halved corms, when uprooted and replanted immediately after removal of apical buds or not uprooted from their original growing sites, gave earlier differentiation of buds and produced more <b>suckers.</b> The halved corms also gave more medium to large <b>suckers</b> than whole and quartered corms when evaluated across all the propagation methods. An {{increase in the number}} of vigorous <b>suckers</b> from halved corms is possible because of elimination of the strong apical dominance while leaving reasonable portions of the mother corm to sustain initiation, growth and development of <b>suckers.</b> Therefore, halved corms uprooted and immediately replanted or left in situ can be used to produce more <b>suckers</b> with better growth...|$|R

50|$|Basal shoots, root sprouts, {{adventitious}} shoots, water sprouts and <b>suckers</b> {{are various}} types of shoots which grow from a bud {{at the base of}} a tree or shrub or from adventitious buds in its roots. A plant that produces <b>suckers</b> (root sprouts) is referred to as surculose. Root <b>suckers</b> may emerge some distance from the originating plant, are considered a form of vegetative dispersal, and may originate a habitat patch where that tree is the dominant species. <b>Suckers</b> also may arise from the roots of trees that have been cut down.|$|R
5|$|Members of {{this small}} group have either a single divided <b>sucker</b> or a row of suckers that cover the underside.

40|$|Plantain (Musa paradisiaca) {{serves as}} a major staple food. However, its {{production}} is seasonal and this situation led to a shortage of more than five months (June to October). The extension of cultivable areas {{and the use of}} high yielding improved varieties are severely limited by the low availability of planting materials free of diseases and parasites. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish optimal conditions for the mass production of clean planting materials. Freshly harvested <b>suckers</b> from plantain namely ‘‘Corne 1 ’’, ‘‘Orishele’’, ‘‘French 2 ’’ and ‘‘Red Ebanga’’ and <b>suckers</b> dried and stored for one month were trimmed and peeled so as to have four weight ranges. The prepared <b>suckers</b> were planted in propagator filled with different substrates. The results revealed that whatever the culture substrate used, the shortest time to induce shoots and the higher number of shoots were observed with dehydrated and nondehydrated <b>suckers</b> larger than 750 g. Non-dehydrated <b>Suckers</b> with this weight expressed the longer lifetime (124 - 140 days).

5|$|The Colorado River had {{experienced}} natural flooding before {{the construction of}} the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals. The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam. Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the Bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback <b>sucker,</b> are listed as endangered.|$|E
5|$|The {{confluence}} of Twomile Run with Kettle Creek was completely devoid {{of fish in}} 1967, but by 1997, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed two species of fish, white <b>sucker</b> and smallmouth bass in this location.

Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger <b>sucker</b> midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{species of}} bats such as Madagascar sucker-footed bat and Western sucker-footed bat, are {{generally}} called [...] "sucker-footed bats" [...] because of <b>suckers</b> on their limbs.

They roost inside the rolled leaves of palm trees, using their <b>suckers</b> to attach themselves to the smooth surface.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, some cultivars {{have been}} multiplied by micropropagation. Micropropagated plants produce <b>suckers,</b> like the wild species, {{so that even}} if the main stem dies, the <b>suckers</b> ensure that the plant will {{continue}} to flourish.|$|R
50|$|Root <b>suckers</b> are an {{important}} method of local reproduction of this tree. The roots may grow <b>suckers</b> after damage (by being hit with a lawn mower or otherwise damaged) or after no damage at all. The <b>suckers</b> are stems which grow from the roots, directly {{into the air and}} may grow into full trees. The main trunk also has the capability to grow sprouts and will do so after being cut down. This makes removal of black locust difficult as the <b>suckers</b> need to be continually removed from both the trunk and roots or the tree will regrow. This is considered an asexual form or reproduction.|$|R
