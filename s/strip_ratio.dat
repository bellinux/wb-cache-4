5000|$|In mining, {{stripping}} ratio or <b>strip</b> <b>ratio</b> {{refers to the}} ratio of the volume of overburden (or waste material) required to be handled in order to extract some tonnage of ore.

50|$|All {{other factors}} being equal, mining {{at a higher}} <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> is less {{profitable}} than mining at a lower <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> because more waste must be moved (at a cost per unit volume) for an equivalent volume of revenue generating ore.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{summarize}} geology, coal resources, and coal reserves in the Montana Powder River Basin (MTPRB) assessment area in southeastern Montana. This report represents the fourth assessment area within the Powder River Basin to be evaluated in the continuing U. S. Geological Survey regional coal assessment program. There are four active coal mines in the MTPRB assessment area: the Spring Creek and Decker Mines, both near Decker; the Rosebud Mine, near Colstrip; and the Absaloka Mine, west of Colstrip. During 2011, coal production from these four mines totaled approximately 36 million short tons (MST). A fifth mine, the Big Sky, had significant production from 1969 – 2003; however, {{it is no longer}} in production and has since been reclaimed. Total coal production from all five mines in the MTPRB assessment area from 1968 to 2011 was approximately 1. 4 billion short tons (BST). The Rosebud/Knobloch coal bed near Colstrip and the Anderson, Dietz 2, and Dietz 3 coal beds near Decker contain the largest deposits of surface minable, low-sulfur, subbituminous coal currently being mined in the assessment area. A total of 26 coal beds were identified during this assessment, 18 of which were modeled and evaluated to determine in-place coal resources. The total original coal resource in the MTPRB assessment area for the 18 coal beds assessed was calculated to be 215 BST. Available coal resources, which are part of the original coal resource remaining after subtracting restrictions and areas of burned coal, are about 162 BST. Restrictions included railroads, Federal interstate highways, urban areas, alluvial valley floors, state parks, national forests, and mined-out areas. It was determined that 10 of the 18 coal beds had sufficient areal extent and thickness to be evaluated for recoverable surface resources ([Roland (Baker), Smith, Anderson, Dietz 2, Dietz 3, Canyon, Werner/Cook, Pawnee, Rosebud/Knobloch, and Flowers-Goodale]). These 10 coal beds total about 151 BST of the 162 BST of available resource; however, after applying a <b>strip</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10 : 1 or less, only 39 BST remains of the 151 BST. After mining and processing losses are subtracted from the 39 BST, 35 BST of coal were considered as a recoverable resource. Coal reserves (economically recoverable coal) are the portion of the recoverable coal resource that can be mined, processed, and marketed at a profit {{at the time of the}} economic evaluation. The surface coal reserve estimate for the 10 coal beds evaluated for the Montana Powder River assessment area is 13 BST. It was also determined that about 42 BST of underground coal resource exists in the MTPRB assessment area; about 34 BST (80 percent) are within 500 – 1, 000 ft of the land surface and another 8 BST are 1, 000 – 2, 000 ft beneath the land surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{open pit}} to {{underground}} transition problem involves {{the decision of}} when, how and at what depth to transition from open pit (OP) to underground (UG). However, the current criteria guiding {{the process of the}} OP – UG transition are not well defined and documented as most mines rely on their project feasibility teams’ experiences. In addition, the methodologies used to address this problem have been based on deterministic approaches. The deterministic approaches cannot address the practicalities that mining companies face during decision-making, such as uncertainties in the geological models and optimisation parameters, thus rendering deterministic solutions inadequate. In order to address these shortcomings, this research reviewed the OP – UG transition problem from a stochastic or probabilistic perspective. To address the uncertainties in the geological models, simulated models were generated and used. In this study, transition indicators used for the OP - UG transition were Net Present Value (NPV), ratio of price to cost per ounce of gold, <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio,</b> processed ounces and average grade at the run of mine pad. These indicators were used to compare four individual case study mines; with AngloGold Ashanti’s Sunrise Dam Gold Mine in Australia, which made the OP – UG transition in 2004 and hence develop an OP – UG transition model. Sunrise Dam Gold Mine is a suitable mine for providing baseline values because it recently made the OP-UG transition. Only four case study mines were used because it took nine months to generate transition indicators for each case study mine. A generic model was developed from the results of the four case studies to help mining companies make the OP - UG transition decision. The model uses a set of transition indicators that trigger the decision while recognising the uncertainties in the geological models, future mineral price as well as cost and processing parameters. From the generic model, mines can transition when the margin (gold price to cost per ounce ratio) is greater than 2. 0; grade is between 4 g/t and 9 g/t, <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> between 3 and 15 m 3 /t and positive NPV {{depending on the type of}} deposit. With this model mines can now transition when the critical conditions of the transition indicators (gold price to cost per ounce, grade and <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio)</b> are achieved. The model also uses the set of transition indicators to model the probabilistic nature of the OP-UG interface. The derived generic model will help mining companies in their annual reviews to assess the OP - UG interface and make decisions early enough with regard to transition timing...|$|R

Model output is intended to provide only an approximation of capital and operating costs associated with both underground and surface mining, and should be viewed accordingly. “Ore” is considered to be restricted to sub-members Lower Cherty 4 and Lower Cherty 3 (LC- 4 and LC- 3).

40|$|An {{algorithm}} which {{adopts a}} moving cone approach but {{is guided by}} maximal network flow principles is developed. This study argues that from a network flow point of view, the re-allocation problem is a major obstacle to prevent a simulation oriented pit design algorithm from reaching the optimum solution. A simulation oriented pit design algorithm can not resolve the re-allocation problem entirely without explicit definition of predecessors and successors. In order to preserve the advantages of moving cone algorithm and to improve the moving cone algorithm, the new algorithm trys to avoid the re-allocation situations. Theoretical proof indicates that the new algorithm can consistently generate higher profit than the popular moving cone algorithm. A case study indicates that the new algorithm improved over the moving cone algorithm (1 % more profit). Also, {{the difference between the}} new algorithm and the rigorous Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm in terms of generated profit is very insignificant (0. 015 % less). The new algorithm is only 2. 08 times slower than the extremely fast moving cone algorithm. This study also presents a multi-period 0 - 1 programming mine sequencing model. Once pushbacks are generated and the materials between a series of cutoffs are available for each bench of every pushback, the model can quickly answer, period by period, what is the best (maximum or minimum) that can be expected on any one of these four items: mineral contents, ore tonnages, waste tonnages and <b>stripping</b> <b>ratios.</b> This answer is based on a selected cutoff and considers the production capacity defined by the ore tonnage, the desired <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> and the precedence constraints among benches and pushbacks.
