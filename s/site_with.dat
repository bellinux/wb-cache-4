40|$|Black mudfish (Neochanna diversus) {{were found}} at 39 of 80 sites in the Waikato region, New Zealand, ranging from large {{wetlands}} to small swampy streams. Of the <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish, 87 % were dry at some time during summer. <b>Sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish also generally had emergent and overhanging vegetation and tree roots, and showed low to moderate human impact. Black mudfish coexisted at some <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> juvenile eels or mosquitofish, but were absent from all <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) or inanga (Galaxias maculatus). <b>Sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish had almost exclusively semi-mineralised substrates or peat; only one site had mineralised substrate. Geometric mean catch rate for the 39 <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish was 0. 70 fish per trap per night. Mean summer water depth was only 2. 1 cm at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish, compared to 22. 6 cm at 41 sites without. Winter and maximum water depths were also less at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish than at sites without mudfish. Mean turbidity was 11. 5 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish, but 21. 3 NTU at sites without mudfish. Mudfish catch rates were negatively correlated with summer water depth, winter water depth, disturbance scale rating, and turbidity. A discriminant function model based on these variables successfully predicted 95 % of the <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> mudfish. Habitat preference curves are also presented...|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact <b>site</b> <b>with</b> respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of prescribed fire to reduce fuel loadings and other management objectives in ecosystems of the Madrean Province. Fuel loadings were measured on the same pine-oak ecosystem occurring on five different <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> a range of different fire frequencies.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades benthic Cyanobacteria have become more {{prevalent}} on coral reefs sites around the world, covering sand, silt, rocks and algae. The abundance of these mats has been associated with widespread signs of reef degradation. On particular sites the cyanobac-terial abundance is remarkably higher than on others. There are no present studies comparing the differences and similarities of cyanobacterial mats between those particular sites. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize and compare the diversity of benthic Cyanobacteria from <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> low cyanobacterial abundance and <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> a high abundance of cyanobacterial mats. To ensure the reliability of the identification results a polyphasic approach was used that combines phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses. For the genetic characterization partial 16 S rRNA gene sequences were compared with an existing online databank. Morphological iden-tification was performed using light microscopy. The genetic and morphological characteriza-tion corresponded to 60 percent. That is an acceptable result considering that no axenic cul-tures were used. All benthic cyanobacterial mats consisted of species from the filamentous genera Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Phormidium, Symploca, Dichothrix or Trichocoleus. Crucial differences of benthic cyanobacterial mat composition could be detected between <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> low cyanobacterial coverage and <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> a high abundance of cyanobacterial mats. The diversity of benthic cyanobacterial species at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> low benthic cyanobacterial coverage was respectively higher than on <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> high abundance of cyanobacterial mats. Further-more the species Hydrocoleum glutinosum and Lyngbya majuscula were characterized to be mainly responsible for the extensive mats at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> high coverage rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of smoking on response to nonsurgical periodontal therapy using the primary outcome measure of bleeding on probing (BoP). An periodontist performed periodontal therapy on 11 smokers and 14 never smokers with periodontitis. Two examiners assessed visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing pocket depth (PPD), BoP, suppuration on probing and clinical attachment level (CAL), at baseline and three months after therapy. BoP was categorized as 0 (absent), 1 (small bleeding point) and 2 (blood flow from the sulcus). Total BoP value was obtained by summing values of 1 and 2. All subjects had significant reductions in mean PPD and percentages of <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> BoP, with no difference between the groups. Only never smokers presented statistically significant CAL gain. BoP was significantly and consistently reduced at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> initial PPDs of 1 – 3 mm and 4 – 6 mm in both groups. At <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> deep PPD (≥ 7 mm), never smokers showed a greater mean reduction in the number of <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> BoP than did smokers (p < 0. 05). Never smokers had significantly greater reduction in BoP 2 than smokers, at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> moderate and deep baseline PPDs. The first group had a significant increase of BoP 1, at <b>sites</b> <b>with</b> initial PPDs of 4 - 6 mm. Thus, periodontal therapy reduced BoP in both groups. However, smoking could negatively affect the BoP reduction at deeper sites after nonsurgical periodontal therapy...|$|R
