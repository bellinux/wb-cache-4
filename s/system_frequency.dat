25|$|Examples of {{non-linear}} loads on a {{power system}} are rectifiers (such {{as used in}} a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as fluorescent lamps, electric welding machines, or arc furnaces. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power <b>system</b> <b>frequency.</b> Distortion power factor {{is a measure of}} how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.|$|E
25|$|There is {{therefore}} a physical requirement for a controlling agency, the transmission system operator, to coordinate the dispatch of generating units to meet the expected demand of the system across the transmission grid. If there is a mismatch between supply and demand the generators speed up or slow down causing the <b>system</b> <b>frequency</b> (either 50 or 60 hertz) to increase or decrease. If the frequency falls outside a predetermined range the system operator will act to add or remove either generation or load.|$|E

The relationships between a <b>system’s</b> <b>frequency</b> and the frequency regulation capacity of the generating units and the interruptible loads are different. In this paper, an index for the frequency recovery effect is proposed based on the static frequency adjustment coefficient of the interruptible load and the adjustment coefficients of the generating units, and an optimization model of an interruptible load participating in primary frequency regulation is built with the objective of minimizing the cost of the primary frequency regulation reserve that uses the <b>system’s</b> <b>frequency</b> recovery effect as a constraint.

Using output response ensembles only, the generalized eigenvalue problem is formed to estimate eigen frequencies and modal vectors for an eight-degree-of-freedom lightly damped vibratory <b>system.</b> The estimated <b>frequencies</b> are compared against <b>system</b> <b>frequencies</b> obtained from structural eigenvalue problem and estimated modal vectors are checked using the modal assurance criterion.

50|$|Smaller power systems, not {{extensively}} interconnected {{with many}} generators and loads, will not maintain frequency {{with the same}} degree of accuracy.

50|$|Frequency of {{the system}} will vary as load and {{generation}} change. Increasing the mechanical input power to a synchronous generator will not greatly affect the <b>system</b> <b>frequency,</b> but will produce more electric power from that unit. During a severe overload caused by tripping or failure of generators or transmission lines the power <b>system</b> <b>frequency</b> will decline, due to an imbalance of load versus generation. Loss of an interconnection, while exporting power (relative to system total generation) will cause <b>system</b> <b>frequency</b> to rise. Automatic generation control (AGC) is used to maintain scheduled frequency and interchange power flows. Control systems in power stations detect changes in the network-wide frequency and adjust mechanical power input to generators back to their target frequency. This counteracting usually takes a few tens of seconds due to the large rotating masses involved. Temporary frequency changes are an unavoidable consequence of changing demand. Exceptional or rapidly changing mains frequency is often a sign that an electricity distribution network is operating near its capacity limits, dramatic examples of which can sometimes be observed shortly before major outages. Large solar farms can reduce their average output and use the extra capacity to assist in providing grid regulation; response of solar inverters is faster than generators, {{because they have no}} rotating mass.|$|E
