At a greater depth than 90 fathoms off this coral island, the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of Halimeda and small fragments of other Nulliporae, but all dead. Captain B. Allen, R.N., informs me that in the survey of the West Indies it was noticed that between the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms, the <b>sounding</b> <b>lead</b> very generally came up coated with the dead joints of a Halimeda, of which he showed me specimens. Off Pernambuco, in Brazil, in about twelve fathoms, the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of a dull red Nullipora, and I infer from Roussin's chart, that a bottom of this kind extends over a wide area. On the beach, within the coral-reefs of Mauritius, vast quantities of fragments of Nulliporae were piled up. From these facts it appears, that these simply organized bodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea.) ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} widely adopted {{sounding}} machines was developed in 1802 by Edward Massey, a clockmaker from Staffordshire. The machine was designed to be fixed to a <b>sounding</b> <b>lead</b> and line. It featured a rotor which turned a dial as the lead sank to the sea floor. On striking the sea floor, the rotor would lock. Massey’s sounding machine could then be hauled in and the depth could be read off the dials in fathoms. By 1811, the Royal Navy had purchased 1,750 of these devices: one for every ship in commission during the Napoleonic Wars. The Board of Longitude was instrumental in convincing the Royal Navy to adopt Massey's machine.|$|E

50|$|The wreck site of Vicente and Bras Sodré′s ships {{was first}} {{discovered}} {{just off the}} north-eastern coast of Al Hallaniyah island, Oman in May 1998 by a small two-person team from Blue Water Recoveries Ltd (BWR) based on the company's own analysis of historical documents. Later that year a larger team from BWR, which included a contracted nautical archaeologist from Portugal, conducted a reconnaissance survey of the bay and wreck site. The team recovered a number of artefacts consistent with an early 16th-century shipwreck, including lead covered iron shot, stone cannonballs of varying sizes and a <b>sounding</b> <b>lead.</b> These expeditions were conducted under a permit from the Oman Government. No further investigation of the site was conducted {{primarily because of the}} considerable complexity and cost of supporting a full archaeological excavation in this remote location. These challenges were addressed in 2013 by David L. Mearns, owner and director of BWR, and an agreement was made with Oman's Ministry of Heritage and Culture (MHC) to jointly conduct and co-manage the project on a collaborative basis. The MHC is the official government body responsible for the protection of Oman's underwater cultural heritage and their management of this project represents the first government-led archaeological excavation of an historic wreck-site in Omani waters. Supplemental funding and support was provided by National Geographic's Expeditions Council and the Waitt Institute. Comprehensive geophysical surveys of Ghubatt ar Rahib bay and archaeological excavations of the near-shore wreck site took place in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The underwater archaeology was directed by Dave Parham, Associate Professor in Maritime Archaeology at Bournemouth University, while the investigation of possible burial sites on land was directed by Dr. Bruno Frohlich, Emeritus Scientist from the Smithsonian Institution. Over the 3 field seasons the expeditions teams of 12 to 18 persons spent a total of 50 days diving and working on site and accumulated 1,079 hours underwater. More than 2,800 artefacts have been recovered from the site including a ship's bell indicating a date of 1498, an important copper-alloy disc marked with the royal coat of arms of Portugal and the esfera armilar (armillary sphere) - a personal emblem of Dom Manuel I, and an ultra rare silver coin known as the INDIO first minted in 1499 by the Portuguese specifically for trade with India. The artefacts also included a large quantity of ordinance (stone, iron and lead shot, and 19 copper-alloy breech chambers), which underscores the military mission of the Sodré squadron. On 15 March 2016 the MHC formally announced the discovery of the wreck site at a press conference in Muscat in conjunction with publication of an interim report that same day in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology by Mearns, Parham and Frohlich. A project specific website was also launched. The IJNA article, which relies on extensive scientific testing of the artefacts and contributions from numerous other experts, also concludes that the probable source of the remaining, un-salvaged wreckage is from Vicente Sodré's nau Esmeralda.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Wyville Thomson and the Royal Society of London {{obtained}} the corvette [...] from the Royal Navy for a 3-year expedition of scientific discovery. Although {{much of the}} world was well charted, this extended only to the coastlines and to very shallow depths - largely depths significant to the safe navigation of ships. There was a widely held consensus that the oceans were in parts very deep, but almost nothing was known of the make up of the deep oceans, the submarine landscape, nor the life contained within the deep ocean. Challenger was equipped to measure much of this, being loaded with specimen jars, chemical apparatus, trawls and dredges, thermometers and water sampling bottles, <b>sounding</b> <b>leads</b> and devices to collect sediment from the sea bed. Great lengths of rope were provided to allow the sounding of deep oceans, and of Italian hemp alone she carried a total length of 181 mi.|$|R
40|$|The {{underwater}} {{acoustic communication}} channel {{is regarded as}} a difficult channel, owing to its bandlimited character, long delay spread, and time variability. In order to characterize the delay-Doppler spread, in situ measurements of the time-varying impulse response are required. This can be realized by transmitting and recording dedicated probe signals such as a pseudorandom binary sequence or a chirp ping train. Unfortunately, when the channel is overspread, i. e., the product of delay spread and Doppler spread is greater than one, channel soundings are compromised. This paper investigates which parameters can still be extracted from an overspread channel, and what type of probe signal is preferred. To this end, at-sea channel soundings are used as well as synthetic data generated with a channel simulator. It appears that the Doppler spectrum can be measured properly in many environments, but not the power delay profile. As the extent of the delay-Doppler spread increases, binary-sequence and chirp <b>soundings</b> <b>lead</b> to markedly different channel estimates. ...|$|R

40|$|Early {{bathymetric}} measurements, or "soundings " {{were made}} by lowering a weighted line {{over the side of}} a boat and measuring the length of line output when the weight hit bottom. The lead weight was usually conical in shape, sometimes with a touch of wax or lard on the base to collect a small sample of the surficial sediment. Similarly, sounding poles were used in shallow water environments. The importance of these sounding measurements was noted in the logs of the H. M. S. Challenger expedition: "The ordinary deep-sea <b>sounding</b> <b>lead,</b> from 12 - 14 lbs. in weight, armed with lard, often gives valuable and reliable information concerning the deposits in all depths under 100 fathoms.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of liquefaction is usually caused by dynamic factors {{where there is}} a mass of saturated soil sand. In order to prevent probable destruction of structures in such areas, prediction of liquefaction potential seems to be necessary.

Therefore, prediction of liquefaction by using the existing data in <b>sounding</b> <b>leads</b> us to decreasing costs and efficiency programming and choosing sufficient area for our construction. Neural networks are intelligent systems that use specific processing characteristics of the brain such as: learning examples, ignoring errors in the data, and their parallel processing –these are not possible through current programming methods.

It is an area with 30 km 2 and a high level of underground water. The neural network in question, having one hidden layer, is trained and tested by some new data, based on standard penetration test, in order to ensure the efficiency operation of the network.

Studies on ancient navigation have traditionally derived their information from ancient geographers and the authors of various periploi ("sailings around"), a type of coast-pilot written in and after the fifth century B. C. The resultant paradigm portrays a scene in which ships voyage from headland to headland, never traversing the open sea, and rarely, if ever, sail intentionally past sunset. The investigation presented here, however, offers a different scenario, one which characterizes ancient seafarers as both naturalists and pragmatists, devoted to accurate wayfinding not only on coasting voyages, but also on the open sea. To this end they became students of their maritime environment, making a science of winds (dividing and subdividing them into a wind "compass") and wind prediction, and compiling a body of weather lore that still rings true today. At times, contrary to ancient conventions and modern interpretation of the sailing season, their confidence emboldened them to extend their activity into the winter months. They acquired wayfinding clues by observing the behavior of shore-sighting birds and birds in their natural environment. They also invented aids to navigation: the crow's nest, a Late Bronze Age innovation, extended the viewer's horizon by several miles and helped ships avoid dangerous reefs on approaches to land; the <b>sounding</b> <b>lead</b> indicated depth and type of bottom; man-made seamarks and landmarks (temples, shrines, funeral mounds, towers, and lighthouses) offered invaluable position-finding information. Sailing past sunset, a very-well documented practice in antiquity, presented a host of additional challenges and hazards. Their response, quite logically, was {{to make sense of the}} night sky. Systems of celestial navigation eventually evolved, facilitated by the Mediterranean's clear summer skies: the circumpolar constellations offered a convenient orientation; their height above the horizon provided rough positions north or south of predetermined reference points; and evidence suggests that ancient seafarers utilized guide-stars and "star paths" (a Polynesian practice) to point them in the direction of their destination. In addition to presenting the subject, there is also a case to be made that ancient seafarers invented wayfinding instruments and practices that allowed them to sail safely upon the open sea, day or night...|$|E

O objetivo deste trabalho Ã elaborar um modelo {{experimental}} que possa demonstrar tecnicamente, em laboratÃrio, a viabilidade da pesquisa do LS no antro gÃstrico da cadela. Foram estudadas 25 cadelas com peso aproximado de 11 Kg e idade de 01 a 02 anos, sem raÃa definida (SRD), clinicamente saudÃveis, proveniente do Centro de Controle de Zoonoses do MunicÃpio de Fortaleza (CCZ) que tinham programaÃÃo para eutanÃsia. Com escolha aleatÃria, estes animais foram estudados individualmente e semanalmente. Utilizou-se, separadamente, TecnÃcio (99 mTc) com traÃador/colÃide Fitato e corante vital azul patente V Guerbert 2, 5 % (AP) injetados a 01 cm do piloro, na pequena curvatura no antro gÃstrico da cadela e analisados nos tempos zero, 05, 10, 15 e 20 minutos. ApÃs este perÃodo realizou-se pesquisa âin vivoâ do local de injeÃÃo do marcador e linfonodos encontrados e âex-vivoâ destes linfonodos. Para o estudo com o 99 mTc utilizou-se o aparelho Gamma Probe modelo Nuclearlab DGC-II - detector para cirurgia radioguiada e sonda captadora de irradiaÃÃo acoplada com unidade de contagem e rastreamento sonoro e para o AP, visÃo direta. Para a anÃlise estatÃstica utilizou-se o teste de McNemar e o Coeficiente de ConcordÃncia de Kappa. Foi estabelecido em 5 % o nÃvel de significÃncia (p&# 8804; 0, 05).

The gastrectomy {{with extensive}} lymphadenectomy {{still is the}} gold standard for the dressing treatment of the gastric cancer (GC), even so these procedures can take high index of morbidity or mortality, mainly in the patients who do not present lymphatic dissemination of the illness. The research of sentinel lymph node (SLN), already consecrated in the initial tumors of breast and the melanomas, presents each time more frequent for upper gastrointestinal cancers, specially in GC with encouraging results. Studies initiated in the middles of 2000 portray increasing and sufficiently prosperous search for clarification of this question. The objective of this work is to elaborate an experimental model that can demonstrate technically, in laboratory, the research viability of SLN in gastric antrum of the dog. 25 female dogs had been studied with approach weight of 11 kg and age of 01 / 02 years, without definite race (WDR), healthful clinically, proceeding from the Control Center of Zoonosis of Fortaleza City with programming for euthanasia. With random choice, these animals had been studied individually and weekly. It was used, separately, radioisotopic 99 mtechnetium labeled phytate and patent blue dye (V Guerbert 2. 5 %) injected at 01 cm above the piloro, on the small bending in the antrum gastric of the dog and analyzed in the times zero, 05, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. After this period, the injection place of the markers and gastric lymph nodes were appraised âin vivoâ (in the animal) and the gastric lymph nodes âex vivoâ (out of the animal). For the study with the 99 mtechnetium it was used the device Gamma Probe model Nuclearlab DGC-II (radioguiada surgery with <b>sounding</b> <b>lead</b> of irradiation connected to unit of counting and sonorous tracking) and for the patent blue dye, direct vision. For the analysis statistics were used the test of McNemar and the Quantify agreement with Kappa. The level of significance was established in 5 % (p&# 8804; 0, 05). When the radioisotopic 99 mtechnetium labeled phytate was used single, the LS was identified in 20 animals (80 %). With the patent blue dye single, in 24 animals (96 %). There is no statistic significance with the use of those markers for the LS research in the gastric antrum of the dog. The conclusions are (1) The stomach of the dog is adjusted for experimental model in alive research of the sentinel lymph node (2) The radioisotopic 99 mtechnetium labeled phytate and patent blue dye (V Guerbert 2. 5 %) are efficients as markers of sentinel lymph node of the dogâs gastric antrum...|$|E

It features a choral keyboard pad in the background, which was later sampled by British rock band New Order on their highly acclaimed 1983 song [...] "Blue Monday". The penultimate song, [...] "Transistor", opens with the sound of someone tuning a radio before cutting to a classical <b>sounding</b> synth <b>lead</b> (reminiscent to that of [...] "Franz Schubert" [...] on their next album, Trans-Europe Express). Radio-Activity closes with [...] "Ohm Sweet Ohm", which begins with a Votrax voice singing the titular phrase. The song continues with a synth melody as the other instruments enter. It slowly accelerates over time before fading out. The British big beat duo The Chemical Brothers sampled the intro in [...] "Ohm Sweet Ohm" [...] to their song [...] "Leave Home".|$|R
40|$|Evidence for {{hydrothermal}} {{activity on the}} eastern SWIR has been reported previously {{in the form of}} optical-backscatter anomalies interpreted to indicate the presence of hydrothermal plumes. Here, I report on a brief reconnaissance analysis of the geochemical composition of core-top samples collected from sites both beneath and away from those previously-reported plume signals to determine whether evidence for fall-out of hydrothermal plume material is discernible. Samples used for this study were collected using the deep-diving submersible SHINKAI 6500 in 1998 and from the tallow-coatings applied to <b>lead</b> <b>sounding</b> lines, 111 years earlier, aboard HMS Egeria. The data indicate hydrothermal input to all but one of eight SHINKAI 6500 cores {{along the length of the}} eastern SWIR rift-valley, including the site of strongest previously reported plume anomalies. Comparison with a recent MAR study suggests that the cores analyzed here, however, may predominantly lie distant from any current or recently-active source of venting...|$|R
60|$|All {{truth is}} worth knowing and labouring after. No {{one can tell}} to what useful results the {{discovery}} of even the smallest portion of truth may lead. Some of the most serviceable and remarkable inventions of modern times {{have been the result}} of discoveries of truths which at first seemed to have no bearing whatever on those inventions. When James Watt sat with busy reflective mind staring at a boiling kettle, and discovered the expansive power of steam, no one could have for a moment imagined that in the course of years the inventions founded on the truth then discovered would result in the systematic driving of a fleet of floating palaces all round the world at the rate of from twelve to fifteen or twenty miles an hour! Instances of a similar kind might be multiplied without end. In like manner, deep-sea <b>sounding</b> may <b>lead</b> to great, as yet unimagined, results. Although yet in its infancy, it has already resulted in the discovery of a comparatively shallow plateau or ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean, rising between Ireland and Newfoundland; a discovery which has been turned to practical account, inasmuch as the plateau has been chosen to be the bed of our electric telegraph between Europe and America. The first Atlantic cable was laid on it; and although that cable suffered many vicissitudes at first, as most contrivances do in their beginnings, communication between the two continents was successfully established. Soundings taken elsewhere showed that somewhat similar plateaus existed {{in other parts of the}} Atlantic, and now the whole of Western Europe is being bound more firmly, by additional cables, to the eastern seaboard of America.|$|R
5000|$|Together {{with the}} Greek Education Ministry and the Royal Hellenic Navy, the sponge divers {{salvaged}} numerous {{artifacts from the}} waters. By the middle of 1901, divers had recovered bronze statues named [...] "The Philosopher", the Youth of Antikythera (Ephebe) of c. 340 BC, and thirty-six marble sculptures including [...] "Hercules", Ulysses, Diomedes, Hermes, Apollo, three marble statues of horses (a fourth was dropped during recovery, and is lost on the sea floor), a bronze lyre, and several pieces of glasswork. Ship's equipment included lead scupper pipes and hull sheeting, {{and a set of}} four massive <b>lead</b> <b>sounding</b> weights (up to 14 kg). These are the only sounding weights ever discovered on an ancient shipwreck in the Aegean, though comparable examples have been recovered along the Levantine coast. Many other small and common artifacts were also found, and the entire assemblage was taken to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The death of diver Giorgos Kritikos and the paralysis of two others due to decompression sickness put an end to work at the site during the summer of 1901.|$|R
