Knox left the cabinet in 1794, and was replaced by Timothy Pickering. Hamilton left the cabinet in 1795, as did Randolph. With their departure, Oliver Wolcott became Secretary of the Treasury, and Pickering succeeded Randolph as Secretary of <b>State.</b> <b>James</b> McHenry replaced Pickering as Secretary of War, while Charles Lee became Attorney General after the departure of Bradford.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} did {{not specify}} whether a plurality or a majority vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard {{in order to achieve}} a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.|$|E

5|$|The {{council was}} short-lived: {{there was just}} one {{legislative}} session. Less than a year after its formation, the smallpox crisis in the District of Keewatin subsided. The Department of the Interior determined that a territorial government for the district was no longer needed. The entire council resigned and was effectively dissolved after being requested to do so on April 16, 1877, by Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Aikins. Aikins had the council resign as a cost-saving measure; also he did not want members of the council to abuse the powers of their appointments.|$|E
5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed {{that he was willing to}} continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of <b>State,</b> <b>James</b> Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E

5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{framed the}} McKinley Tariff that {{would raise the}} tariff even higher, {{including}} making some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Toulmin's resignation, James Garrard, a Baptist {{minister}} who had supported Toulmin as {{a trustee of}} Transylvania, was elected governor of Kentucky. At first, Garrard elected to re-appoint sitting Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Brown, but when Brown retired in October 1796, Garrard appointed Toulmin as his replacement. He served in this capacity from 1796 to 1804, spanning both of Garrard's consecutive terms as governor. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of Socinianism. By 1802, Garrard and his associate Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them as well. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned Garrard and Eastin's beliefs as heretical and tried to persuade the two men to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church.|$|E
5|$|Smith briefly {{returned}} to the United States in June 1945. In August, Eisenhower nominated Smith as his successor as commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater, as ETOUSA was redesignated on 1 July 1945. Smith was passed over in favor of General Joseph McNarney. When Eisenhower took over as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, he summoned Smith to become his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Planning. However, soon after his arrival back in Washington he was asked by President Harry S. Truman and U.S Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> F. Byrnes to become the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In putting Smith's nomination for the post before the United States Senate, Truman asked for and received special legislation permitting Smith to retain his permanent military rank of major general.|$|E

5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E
5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 <b>State,</b> <b>James</b> and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Ha√ßienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the graphic design industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from this club holds a high value among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary graphic design everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav {{government}} of the newly formed FR Yugoslavia (successor to SFR Yugoslavia) ended up having three ideologically-opposed leaders occupying executive positions. From 1992, while Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá {{was the president of}} the Federal Republic of Serbia, national theorist Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá was named President of FR Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Milan Paniƒá, a business magnate based in Newport Beach, California, accepted Milo≈°eviƒá's invitation to be Prime Minister. Paniƒá was subsequently elected as Prime Minister in the 1992 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. The United States did not revoke Paniƒá's citizenship even though his occupation of an executive position in the Yugoslav government clearly contradicted the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, Paniƒá would become a person of interest in US diplomatic circles, given his business and residence backgrounds. At a CSCE meeting in Helsinki in July 1992, US Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Baker abruptly dismissed Paniƒá's appeal to reduce the sanctions to Yugoslavia, even after an agreement (between Paniƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá, and Du≈°an Miteviƒá) was reached by which Milo≈°eviƒá would resign in return for sanction-relief. This ended up severely damaging Paniƒá's unique diplomatic position internationally, as well as his standing in Yugoslavia. The Los Angeles Times published an article which described Paniƒá as a doubtful upholder of potential American-Yugoslavian peacemaking, when in fact, many years later made to be known, Paniƒá was actually invited by Baker in the first place rather than voluntarily coming to Helsinki.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18thcentury, many of {{the silver}} dollars {{produced}} by the Mint were shipped to and circulated or melted in China in order to satisfy the great demand for silver bullion in that nation. In 1800, silver deposits once again began to decline, and the total silver dollar output for that year was 220,920. In 1801, following complaints from the public and members of Congress regarding the lack of small change in circulation, Boudinot began requesting that silver depositors receive smaller denominations rather than the routinely requested silver dollars, in an effort to supply the nation with more small change. Production dropped to 54,454 silver dollars in 1801 and 41,650 in 1802, after Boudinot was able to convince many depositors to accept their silver in the form of small denominations. Although silver bullion deposits at the Mint had increased, Boudinot attempted to end silver dollar production in 1803, favoring half dollars instead. Mintage of the 1803 dollar continued until March 1804, when production of silver dollars ceased entirely. In total, 85,634 dollars dated 1803 were struck. Following a formal request from the Bank of the United States, Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> Madison officially suspended silver dollar and gold eagle production in 1806, although minting of both had ended two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|While the King was in California on January 31, the Straits Times of Singapore {{published}} {{a story that}} KalƒÅkaua already had a representative in Germany finalizing {{the sale of the}} Kingdom of Hawaii. In April, Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>James</b> G. Blaine was made aware of various rumors that KalƒÅkaua wanted to sell the kingdom to a nation other than the United States, and repeated them to Garfield, who in turn shared them in a letter to one of his friends. In an attempt to protect the interests of the United States, Blaine made it clear to British diplomat Edward Thornton that priority on annexation belonged to the United States. Thornton filed a report with his government, sending a copy to Honolulu's British consul Wodehouse who shared it with Queen Dowager Emma, Princess Likelike, her husband Archibald Scott Cleghorn, Liliuokalani, and her husband John Owen Dominis. Although troubled by the rumors and by Blaine's stance on annexation, none of them had any knowledge of the situation and so forwarded the report to KalƒÅkaua.|$|E
