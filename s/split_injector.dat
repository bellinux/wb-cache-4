40|$|This work {{provides}} a short and easy protocol {{that allows the}} analysis of both methanol and ethanol in the static headspace of olive oil. The procedure avoids any kind of sample pre-treatment beyond that of heating the oil to allow a maximum volatile concentration in the headspace of the vials. The method's LOD is 0. 55  mg kg− 1 and its LOQ is 0. 59  mg kg− 1. Advantages of this method are: • Simultaneous determination of methanol and ethanol (the pre-existing Spanish specification UNE-EN 14110 only analyses methanol). • No need of equipment modifications (standard <b>split</b> <b>injectors</b> work perfectly). Use of a highly polar capillary GC column, leading in most cases to chromatograms in which only three dominant peaks are present – methanol, ethanol, and propanol (that is extremely positive for easy interpretation of results). • Use of an internal standard (1 -propanol) to determine the concentration of the analytes, reducing the presence of error sources...|$|R
40|$|The lipid {{content of}} the poultry meat reveals both in {{domestic}} and wild birds a greater quantities of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), [oleic acids (C 18 : 1) are dominating in all tissues] comparing to the saturated fatty acids (SFA). Previous {{studies have shown that}} during the development of fat deposits there is observed an increasing of SFA and MUFA comparing to PUFA, with an impact on the decline of PUFA content and consequently of the PUFA/SFA; similar results were highlighted also in our study. The extraction of meat lipid fraction was performed according to the protocol described by Folch. The working method used in this case was speciϐic for the lipid separation in meat samples with a weight of ~ 2. 5 g.

Analytical predictions are compared to numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement. We also show how a further improvement of the beam quality can be obtained by matching the beam out of the booster into a Brillouin flow with proper control of the envelope oscillations. If these are actually coherent plasma oscillations in the laminar regime, then the normalized rms transverse emittance can be even further reduced...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} low-intensity beams will be {{required}} for LHC commissioning. In contrast to the nominal LHC physics beam, these single-bunch beams are produced without longitudinal bunch <b>splitting</b> in the <b>injector</b> chain. Consequently, not only the transverse but also the longitudinal beam characteristics have already to be established in the CERN PS-Booster. The required intensities extend down to four orders of magnitude below the typical PS-Booster working range and the transverse emittances must be adjustable to vary the beam brightness over a large range. The different beam variants are briefly summarized and the specific techniques developed for their production, like low-voltage rf capture, and transverse and longitudinal shaving, are described. In particular, the choice of harmonic number and its consequences for operation and beam reproducibility are discussed. Finally, the performance achieved for the different beams is summarized...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To investigate, for {{the first}} time, the {{chemical}} composition of essential oil of the tubers and leaves of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), a species of sunflower native to eastern North America, growing in Ukraine. Methods: A hydrodistillation apparatus {{was used for the}} extraction of volatile components and then it was analysed by gas chromatography equipped with a split-splitless <b>injector</b> (<b>split</b> ratio, 1 : 50) and flame ionization detector (FID). The oil was analyzed under linear temperature programming applied at 4 °C/min from 50 °C - 340 °C. Temperatures of the injector and FID detector were maintained at 280 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The chemical analysis of the oil was carried out using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to determine the chemical composition of the volatile fraction. Results: The essential oils content ranged from 0. 00019 to 0. 03486 and 0. 00011 to 0. 00205 (g/ 100 g), in leaves and tubers, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative analysis led to the identification of 17 components in both species samples. The major component found in leaves and tubers was (-) -β-bisabolene with 70. 7 % and 63. 1 %, respectively.

For the analysis, it was used an HP- 5 capillary column (30 m x 0. 32 mm x 0. 25 µm), hydrogen at a flow rate of 1. 8 mL/min and the increasing temperature gradient was: 100 ºC to 250 ºC, 15 ºC/min. The temperature of <b>injector</b> (<b>split</b> 1 : 20) and detector were kept at 250 ºC and 270 ºC, respectively.

30|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of algal fatty acid methyl esters {{were determined by}} modification of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Official Method 948.15 Fat (Crude) in Seafood, Acid Hydrolysis method, 1995 (Hungerford 1995). Fatty acid methyl esters of the oil were prepared by refluxing the dried sample at 70 °C for 3 h in 2 % sulphuric acid in methanol. The esters were extracted into ethyl acetate, washed free of acid and passed over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The ethyl acetate extracts were further concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The fatty acid composition was analyzed using an Agilent 6890 N series gas chromatography equipped with FID detector on a <b>split</b> <b>injector.</b> A fused silica capillary column (DB- 225, 30 × 0.32 m i.d., J & W Scientifics, USA) was used with the injector and detector temperature maintained at 220 °C and 255 °C respectively. The oven temperature was programmed at 160 °C for 2 min and finally increased to 230 °C at 4 °C/min. The carrier gas was nitrogen at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The area percentages were recorded with a standard HP Chemstation Data System. Relative PUFA content is expressed as the ratio between the percentages of the different fatty acids: saturated (SATs), monounsaturated (MUFAs) and UFAs, using the formula (PUFA/SAT+MUFA). The unsaturation index was also determined by multiplying the percentage of each fatty acid {{by the number of}} double bonds present in the molecule.|$|E
40|$|Deuterium (2 H) {{in water}} and urine can be {{measured}} by off-line and, more recently, on-line techniques using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). We describe a new simple on-line pyrolysis method {{for the analysis of}} 2 H/ 1 H {{in water and}} urine samples by continuous flow IRMS, normally used for 2 H/ 1 H measurements in organic compounds. A deactivated column connected the <b>split</b> <b>injector</b> to a high-temperature conversion reactor (TC HD), and 0. 5 mL of sample was injected. Accuracy and precision were determined with Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation (SLAP), and Greenland Ice Sheet Precipitation (GISP). The range of linearity was measured with a calibration curve of enriched water from 0 up to 0. 1 atom percent excess (APE) (i. e. S 72 up to 6323 delta per mil (dD %)) with a precision of < 5 % and accuracy ranging between 1 and 55 %. Blinded reanalysis of urine samples by an equilibration device (Gas Bench) and by a dedicated pyrolysis system (TC/EA) was performed and results compared by the Bland-Altman test. Enrichments ranged between 600 and 2400 % dDVSMOW with a precision of W 5 %. Urine enrichments described by our method were strongly correlated with values obtained by Gas Bench and TC/EA (p < 0. 0001). There was a significant memory effect that was reduced by injecting the sample 15 times and discarding the first 10 injections, together with accurate furnace conditioning and appropriate cleaning of the syringe. Data indicate that the method is accurate, and that it can be used for water and urine deuterium determination when a Gas Bench or TC/EA instrument is not available and the amount of sample is limited...|$|E
40|$|A high {{resolution}} gas chromatographic (HRGC) method {{was developed for}} the analysis of oligosaccharides in pea flours which circumvented some of the shortcomings of existing packed-column GC and HPLC methods. Aqueous methanol (80 %) extracts of pea flour were dried and derivatized with either trimethylsilylimidazole (TMSI) or N-methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide) (MBTFA). Separation of the oligosaccharide derivatives was achieved on a 10 -metre DB 5 - 60 W capillary column. The effects of carrier gas (He) flow rate and split ratio on analysis time, resolution and reproducibility were studied. TMS derivatives of sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose gave satisfactory results over a wide range of carrier flow rates, with the fastest analysis and the least peak broadening at 6. 7 ml/min. Reproducibility was best at a flow rate of 3. 7 ml/min and a split ratio of 1 : 50. Even shorter analysis times were achieved with the more volatile MBTFA derivatives, but discrimination in the <b>split</b> <b>injector</b> of the gas chromatograph caused serious reproducibility problems. HRGC analysis proved to be a rapid, sensitive method for quantitation of oligosaccharides in pea flours. In the course of establishing conditions for the assay of Î±-galactosidase activity in pea flours, it was determined that the use of extraction temperatures in the range of 0 - 5 Â°C yielded extracts substantially higher in Î±-galactosidase activity than those obtained at ambient temperature. Enzyme activity remained stable for 10 minutes in cold-extracted preparations held on ice prior to assay. A 20 minute incubation of crude Î±-galactosidase extracts with p-nitrophenyl Î±-D-galactopyranoside as substrate was shown to be satisfactory for determination of a-galactosidase activity in pea flour, air-classified pea protein and flour from germinated peas. Steeping of peas in deionized water for 12 hours at 25 Â°C, with the intent of increasing the rate and uniformity of germination, resulted in the disappearance of a portion of their sucrose and oligosaccharide content, only part of which was recovered in the steepwater. Raffinose showed the largest percentage decrease (29. 4 %) whereas, in absolute terms, stachyose showed the largest decline (from 1. 73 % of seed dry weight to 1. 35 %). Following steeping (12 hr, 25 Â°C), a substantial reduction in the oligosaccharide concentrations of peas occurred during germination for 96 hours, which was accompanied by a large increase in the sucrose concentration. Alpha-galactosidase activity showed two activity maxima (at 12 and 48 hours, respectively) during the 96 hour germination period. This was attributed to the formation/activation of two enzyme types. Osmotic priming (restricted hydration) of peas in either polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) or potassium nitrate (KNO 3) solutions was less effective than germination in inducing Î±-galactosidase activity and in reducing oligosaccharide concentrations. Autolysis of whole peas (5 : 1 water to seed ratio) for 12 hours at 45 or 65 Â°C, and of 10 and 20 % (w/v) air-classified pea protein slurries for 6 and 12 hours, respectively, at 25, 45 or 65 Â°C, resulted in substantial reductions in oligosaccharide concentrations. Microbial loads in the autolysed samples were monitored since the extent of microbial growth, if significant, would influence the practicality of a particular treatment. Standard plate counts increased exponentially in samples autolyzed at 25 or 45 Â°C, whereas at 65 Â°C microbial loads decreased for the first 6 hours of autolysis followed by slow increases between 6 and 24 hours. Addition of a microbial &#x 3 B 1;-galactosidase preparation to 10 and 20 % (w/v) airclassified pea protein slurries resulted in essentially complete hydrolysis of oligosaccharides after 60 and 90 minutes, respectively, at 25, 45 or 65 Â°C. Little effect of enzyme concentration on the rate or degree of hydrolysis was seen at the levels of &#x 3 B 1;-galactosidase added (3. 3 - 13. 9 units/g of slurry) ...|$|E
