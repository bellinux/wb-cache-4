5|$|Upon {{the death}} of U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> Massachusetts state law {{triggered}} a special election {{to be held in}} January 2010. On September 4, 2009, a representative for Lynch took out nomination papers to run in the special election. After speaking with his family and citing the short time frame in which to conduct a campaign, Lynch decided against seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.|$|E
5|$|Dodd had {{received}} endorsements {{from members of}} the Kennedy family including Rhode Island Representative Patrick J. Kennedy and his brother Edward M. Kennedy, Jr. Eunice Kennedy Shriver had also campaigned for him. On November 1, the campaign announced he had been endorsed by Bobby Shriver, co-founder of Debt AIDS Trade in Africa. Dodd had asked <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> repeatedly for an endorsement. On November 20, 2007, Timothy Shriver, the Chairman of Special Olympics announced his endorsement for Dodd.|$|E
5|$|During the luncheon, <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{collapsed}} {{after suffering}} a seizure, and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon. These reports were later denied, and Byrd, {{a longtime friend of}} Kennedy, eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave.|$|E

25|$|The Chappaquiddick {{incident}} was a single-vehicle car accident on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, on Friday, July 18, 1969, {{that was the}} result of U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> negligence and resulted in the death of his 28-year-old companion, Mary Jo Kopechne, who was trapped inside the vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{prominent}} {{local and national}} politicians and judges are Providence College alumni. Former United States Senator from Connecticut Chris Dodd graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature, while his father, Thomas J. Dodd, also a long-serving U.S. Senator from Connecticut, graduated in 1930 {{with a degree in}} philosophy. Former United States Representative from Rhode Island Patrick J. Kennedy, the son of former United States <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1991.|$|E
5|$|After {{training}} as a teacher at Bede College, Durham University, he was not called up for military service during World War II, because teaching was a reserved occupation. After the war he improved his qualifications by taking a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at Loughborough College in 1947. In the 1950s he studied at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a diploma in public and social administration with distinction and won a Fulbright Scholarship to Harvard {{in his second year}} (1954), becoming a friend of the future <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1973, the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee named Jenner as the Committee's Chief Minority Counsel. During this time, Jenner fought (successfully) against <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> {{attempt to}} appoint a Boston Municipal Court judge whom Jenner thought was unqualified, as a federal judge.|$|R
2500|$|Dees {{started off}} in {{politics}} by working for Southern politician George Wallace in 1958. He served as Senator George McGovern's national finance director in 1972, President Jimmy Carter's national finance director in 1976, and as national finance chairman for <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> 1980 Democratic primary presidential campaign against Carter.|$|R
50|$|In May 2009, <b>Senators</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and John Kerry {{recommended}} Ortiz to President Obama for {{the vacant}} United States Attorney {{position in the}} District of Massachusetts. On September 18, Obama nominated Ortiz for the position. On November 5, the United States Senate confirmed her appointment by unanimous consent.|$|R
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the Republican Party, and faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that yearâ€“ {{in part because of}} the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, and in part because this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E
50|$|In April 1972, {{they opened}} {{an office in}} Washington, D.C. The group {{sponsored}} legislative seminars that attracted many notable participants and presenters who included prominent Members of Congress (e.g., <b>Senators</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> Adlai Stevenson, Barbara Mikulski, Walter Mondale and Joseph Biden) and Catholic notables such as Fr. Bryan Hehir.|$|R
50|$|From 1995 to 1998, Perez {{worked as}} Democratic Massachusetts <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> {{principal}} adviser on civil rights, criminal justice, and constitutional issues. During {{the final two}} years of the second Clinton administration, he worked as the Director of the Office for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services.|$|R
50|$|On October 27, 1993, on the {{recommendations}} of <b>Senators</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and John Kerry, Gertner was nominated to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by President Bill Clinton to a seat vacated by A. David Mazzone. Gertner was confirmed by the Senate on February 10, 1994, and received her commission on February 14, 1994.|$|R
5|$|Democratic U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed {{longtime friend of}} Kennedy and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor {{was thus}} {{nominated}} on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush {{to a seat}} on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker, Jr. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and her getting unanimous approval from the committee. Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee. D'Amato objected strongly; some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
5000|$|He {{participated in}} U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> {{birthday}} celebration at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on 8 March 2009.

Kennedy Memorial Library at the Memorial Service for Senator Kennedy on 28 August 2009, the evening before the Senator's funeral.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the hours}} {{immediately}} following <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> death, Breitbart called Kennedy a [...] "villain", a [...] "duplicitous bastard", a [...] "prick" [...] and [...] "a special pile of human excrement," [...] adding, [...] "Sorry, he destroyed lives. And he knew it," [...] referring to Kennedy's actions during the Chappaquiddick incident, the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination, and the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination.|$|R

5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58â€“42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
5|$|In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson {{when he was}} {{employed}} as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin. Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), on June 10, 2001. The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School. The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, {{was a gift from}} <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.|$|E

Following {{the dissolution of the}} U.S.S.R., Ephraimson-Abt persuaded U.S. <b>Senators</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> Sam Nunn, Carl Levin, and Bill Bradley to write to the Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev requesting information about the flight.|$|R
25|$|Thereafter, {{a number}} of {{high-profile}} Democrats, including <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> Senator Walter Mondale, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Senator Edmund Muskie, Senator Abe Ribicoff and Senator Birch Bayh turned down offers to run on the ticket.|$|E
25|$|NCSC became {{embroiled in}} presidential {{politics}} again in 1980. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> strongly wooed NCSC in his ultimately unsuccessful bid {{to win the}} Democratic nomination, {{going so far as}} to invite NCSC to hold its next national convention in the White House.|$|E
25|$|<b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy</b> from Massachusetts {{had been}} {{considered}} a potential candidate, but he ruled {{himself out of the}} 1988 campaign in the fall of 1985.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s the Nixon {{administration}} began dismantling the OEO; funding for legal {{services for the}} poor began to wither, and supporters looked for an alternative arrangement. In 1971 a bipartisan congressional group, including <b>Senators</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> William A. Steiger, and Walter Mondale, proposed a national, independent Legal Services Corporation; at the same time, administration officials such as Attorney General John N. Mitchell and chief domestic advisor John Ehrlichman were proposing their own somewhat similar solution.|$|R
