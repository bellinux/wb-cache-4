40|$|Introduction: Endotracheal tube <b>suctioning</b> is {{essential}} for improve oxygenation in the patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. There {{are two types of}} shallow and deep endotracheal tube <b>suctioning.</b> This study aimed to evaluate the effect of shallow and deep <b>suctioning</b> methods on respiratory rate (RR), arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and number of <b>suctioning</b> in patients hospitalized in the intensive care units of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 74 patients who hospitalized in the intensive care units of Isfahan Al-Zahra Hospital were randomly allocated to the shallow and deep <b>suctioning</b> groups. RR and SpO 2 were measured immediately before, immediately after, 1 and 3 minute after each <b>suctioning.</b> Number of <b>suctioning</b> was also noted in each groups. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA), chi-square and independent t-tests. Results: RR was significantly increased and SpO 2 was significantly decreased after each <b>suctioning</b> in the both groups. However, these changes were not significant between the two groups. The numbers of <b>suctioning</b> was significantly higher in the shallow <b>suctioning</b> group than in the deep <b>suctioning</b> group. Conclusion: Shallow and deep <b>suctioning</b> had a similar effect on RR and SpO 2. However, shallow <b>suctioning</b> caused further manipulation of patient’s trachea than deep <b>suctioning</b> method. Therefore, it seems that deep endotracheal tube <b>suctioning</b> method can be used to clean the airway with lesser manipulation of the trachea...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} around <b>suctioning</b> premature infants {{has focused}} on endotracheal <b>suctioning.</b> Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) {{has become a major}} mode of respiratory support. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} research that is relevant to this mode of respiratory support. Aim: To determine the effect <b>suctioning</b> and <b>suctioning</b> frequency has on oxygen saturation levels and bradycardias in infants = 30 weeks gestation on “bubble” CPAP. Method: The research comprised of two parts: •	An observational study to determine the effect of <b>suctioning</b> on oxygen saturation, desaturations, and bradycardias. •	A randomised crossover study to determine the effect of frequency of <b>suctioning</b> on oxygen saturation, desaturations, and bradycardias. Results: Part One: Analysis demonstrated that increased <b>suctioning</b> frequency significantly decreased oxygen saturation levels and resulted in more desaturations. However, one more desaturation per hour required 5. 3 and 7 more <b>suctioning</b> episodes each day for desaturations of = 10 seconds and = 60 seconds respectively. Of note was the increased likelihood of desaturations when the <b>suctioning</b> interval was longer. An increase interval of 1 hour 40 minutes between <b>suctioning</b> times led to one more desaturation = 10 seconds per hour, with one more desaturation = 60 seconds with 3 ½ hours increase in interval. Bradycardias were also significantly increased by one per hour, when <b>suctioning</b> frequency increased by 15 intervals per day. Conversely, the odds of a bradycardia occurring if the <b>suctioning</b> interval increased one hour was 1. 9. Part Two: Analysis demonstrated that overall there were less desaturations and bradycardias with 2 hourly <b>suctioning</b> compared to 4 hourly. However, numbers were too small to determine statistical significance. Data from the effect of <b>suctioning,</b> for both parts, demonstrated prolonged periods of recovery for infants, with minimal or no change in supplemental oxygen, which may have affected results. Conclusion: Significance was demonstrated in relation to more desaturations and bradycardias with increased frequency of <b>suctioning</b> in Part One, though the prolonged recovery time may have influenced these outcomes. Of more significance were the findings that demonstrated increased desaturations and bradycardias with longer intervals between <b>suctioning.</b> Results from Part Two were inconclusive due to small numbers of participants. This study provides a baseline for evidence on <b>suctioning</b> premature infants on CPAP, guideline development and a foundation for future research...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Intratracheal <b>suctioning</b> is a {{standard}} method of nursing care for intubated patients {{with the aim of}} cleaning airway for good oxygenation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of intratracheal <b>suctioning</b> on blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial oxygen saturation. Materials and Methods: This was a semi-experimental research in which the patients admitted to intensive care unit of Kashani teaching center of Shahr-e-kord University in 2005. The data were collected by a questionnaire form 35 patient by observation and measurement of blood pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. Results: The findings showed that during <b>suctioning,</b> systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and heart rate increased and arterial oxygen saturation decreased significantly, when compared with pre-suctioning period. The same occurred when these parameters were compared between pre-suctioning period and 1 minute post-suction, except for arterial oxygen saturation that had not statistically significant decline, 1 minute after <b>suctioning.</b> The parameters under study remained increased (including arterial oxygen saturation that decreased during <b>suctioning)</b> 3 minutes after <b>suctioning,</b> but this increase was not statistically significant when compared with pre-suctioning period. The study showed that parameters in 1 and 3 minutes after <b>suctioning</b> were also significantly different from those of <b>suctioning</b> period. Conclusion: The finding of this research showed that the maximum changes of blood pressure and heart rate (increase) and arterial oxygen saturation (decrease) occurs during <b>suctioning</b> and maximum changes of blood pressure and heart rate (decrease) and arterial oxygen saturation (increase) occurs 3 minutes after <b>suctioning.</b> Therefore, hyper oxygenation, hemodynamic and SpO 2 monitoring before, during and after <b>suctioning</b> are recommended...|$|R

This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales.

Each patient randomly underwent both open and closed <b>suctioning.</b> ABGs, PaO 2, SaO 2, PaCO 2, were analyzed before and one, five, and fifteen minutes after each <b>suctioning</b> episode. Results. At first the pressure of oxygen in arterial blood increased; however, this increase in the open technique was greater than that of the closed system (P< 0. 001). The pressure of oxygen decreased five and fifteen minutes after both <b>suctioning</b> techniques (P< 0. 05). The trends of carbon dioxide variations after the open and closed techniques were upward and downward, respectively. Moreover, the decrease in the level of oxygen saturation five and fifteen minutes after the open <b>suctioning</b> was greater than that of the closed <b>suctioning</b> technique (P< 0. 05).

The effect of <b>suctioning</b> on respiratory mechanics is not known. This study aimed to determine the immediate effect of endotracheal <b>suctioning</b> on dynamic lung compliance, tidal volume, and airway resistance in mechanically-ventilated paediatric patients {{by means of a}} prospective observational clinical study. Lung mechanics were recorded for five minutes before and five minutes after a standardised <b>suctioning</b> procedure in 78 patients intubated with endotracheal tubes ≤ 4. 0 mm internal diameter.

Although the majority of patients (68. 5 %) experienced a drop in dynamic compliance following <b>suctioning,</b> dynamic compliance increased in 31. 5 % of patients after the procedure. This study demonstrates that endotracheal <b>suctioning</b> frequently causes an immediate drop in dynamic compliance and expired tidal volume in ventilated children with variable lung pathology, intubated with small endotracheal tubes, probably indicating loss of lung volume caused by the <b>suctioning</b> procedure.

Significantly less desaturation. Smaller increase in mean blood pressure. Significantly faster recovery to baseline heart rate, transcutaneous oximeter saturation and respiration and a markedly faster recovery to baseline mean blood pressure.
