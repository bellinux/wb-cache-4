40|$|The Internet {{has acted}} as an {{effective}} catalyst for remote demonstration and experimentation in recent years {{through the medium of}} virtual laboratories. These laboratories can be especially useful in science and technology education, allowing topics to be presented to a geographically dispersed audience. There has also been a rapid proliferation in recent times of transactional systems for e-commerce applications. Similar to virtual laboratories, these online applications extend their content to a wide audience but normally achieve this using a different set of technologies. Commercial application servers are often used in the development of ecommerce solutions and provide features such as transaction management, extensibility and security. This thesis presents a new virtual laboratory which combines conventional virtual laboratory technologies with these useful application server features, producing a system which is known as Web-based Remote Technology Demonstrator® 1 (WebRTD®). The new system is potentially capable of managing a number of technology demonstrations using the one user interface. A Stirling Engine demonstration was selected as the first application for the new system. This demonstration will provide the user with a basic understanding of the operation of the engine as well as communicating the thermodynamic principals associated with type of engine.

Due to the unique spherical shell, the robot in the dynamic state transition process, Friction cannot offset the robot motion state change due to internal driving motion error of small units.

Tidal volume, respiratory frequency, minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation, dead space, oxygen transfer, carbon dioxide transfer, respiratory exchange ratio, end-tidal oxygen, end-tidal carbon dioxide, {{and heart rate}} are determined on a breath-to-breath basis. The computer is programmed to control the duration and intensity of the work involved. This program instructs the subject when to <b>start</b> and <b>stop</b> exercising, <b>controls</b> switching of the ergometer from an idle speed, and selects the work load. The computer system analyzes the data, averages multiple experiments and plots averages of multiple experiments along with standard error bars. Plotting time scales can be expanded to inspect selected portions of an experiment. The system is especially adapted to careful observation of the responses within the first few seconds {{of a change in}} work load. Appropriate computer programs and mathematical equations are presented. The results of several experiments are compared with data from other sources and found to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Excesses {{enthalpy}} consistent {{only with}} a nuclear process (deuterium fusion) has been claimed since 1989, even though these results are considered inconsistent with modern nuclear science and have been discarded by the most of nuclear scientists. We started an experimental programme aimed at probing these issues:! Thermal anomalies can be observed only when the concentration x = [D]/[Pd] overcomes a threshold (x= 1) [1];! This threshold can be easily obtained in a suitably Pd geometry;! The thermal anomalies can be <b>started</b> and <b>stopped</b> <b>controlling</b> the experimental procedure;! 4 He is simultaneously generated, commensurate {{with the level of}} the excess enthalpy [2], [3], [4]. Understanding a triple coincidence – the reaching of the threshold of the D concentration in Pd, the appearance of the excess of enthalpy, and the appearance of 4 He – is the primary objective of this investigation. In such a frame the fusion among deuterons occurs within a medium (namely, inside a coherent ensemble of deuteron) and not in vacuo. Thus energy and momentum can be shared among many components of the coherent condensed system (see Mössbauer effect for comparison), allowing in principle a fast cooling of the “hot ” D-D compound nucleus and then preventing its splitting. Consequently 4 He should be expected as the final product of this newly discovered nuclear fusion. 1.

40|$|The paper mostly {{focuses on}} the methodological and {{programming}} aspects of developing a versatile desktop framework to provide the available basis for the high-performance simulation of dynamical models of different kinds and for diverse applications. So the paper gives some basic structure for creating a dynamical simulation model in C++ which is built on the Win 32 platform with an interactive multiwindow interface and uses the lightweight Visual C++ Express as a free integrated development environment. The resultant simulation framework could be a more acceptable alternative to other solutions developed {{on the basis of}} commercial tools like Borland C++ or Visual C++ Professional, not to mention the domain specific languages and more specialized ready-made software such as Matlab, Simulink, and Modelica. This approach seems to be justified in the case of complex research object-oriented dynamical models having nonstandard structure, relationships, algorithms, and solvers, as it allows developing solutions of high flexibility. The essence of the model framework is shown using a case study of simulation of moving charged particles in the electrostatic field. The simulation model possesses the necessary visualization and control features such as an interactive input, real time graphical and text output, <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> and rate <b>control...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{normally have}} the throttle (North American English) or regulator (British English) in a characteristic steam dome {{at the top}} of the boiler (although not all boilers feature these). The additional height afforded by the dome helps to avoid any liquid (e.g. from bubbles on the surface of the boiler water) being drawn into the throttle valve, which could damage it, or lead to priming. The throttle is basically a poppet valve, or series of poppet valves which open in sequence to regulate the amount of stream admitted to the steam chests over the pistons. It is used in conjunction with the reversing lever to <b>start,</b> <b>stop</b> and to <b>control</b> the locomotive's power although, during steady-state running of most locomotives, it is preferable to leave the throttle wide open and to control the power by varying the steam cut-off point (which is done with the reversing lever), as this is more efficient. A steam locomotive throttle valve poses a difficult design challenge as it must be opened and closed using hand effort against the considerable pressure (typically 250psi) of boiler steam (one of the primary reasons for later multiple-sequential valves...it is far easier to open a small poppet valve against the pressure differential, and open the others once pressure begins to equalize than to open a single large valve, especially as steam pressures eventually exceeded 200 or even 300 psi.
