40|$|International audienceInformation Retrieval is {{a process}} made by a user to obtain {{relevant}} information which meets his needs using an Information Retrieval System (IRS). However the IRS shows some differences between user <b>relevance</b> and <b>system</b> <b>relevance.</b> These variations are primarily related to the imperfection of the indexing process (approach {{directly related to the}} IR) and specially the non consideration of the user profile.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{information}} retrieval system parameters {{on the basis}} of user's relevance feedback for improving the retrieval effectiveness has become an important and also an active research area. One such adjustment is to modify the query which reflects the user's information request via the judgment of the previously retrieved results. In this paper we present our idea, based on an adaptive technique of "genetic algorithms," for modifying a user's query to improve the retrieval results. The effectiveness of query modification has been tested on the Cranfield Collection, a classical set of documents, queries and known <b>relevance</b> <b>responses</b> to each query. Results of this study show that the method is highly effective, achieving substantially higher precision levels at each fixed recall level than those have been reported by other research groups...|$|R

Over 35 -year research suggests that serotonin (5 -HT) {{plays an important role in}} satiety. Thus, serotonergic system has been a viable target in weight control. 5 -HT shows control over hunger and satiety through different receptors with discrete functions. 5 -HT 2 C receptor seems to be the most important one in the relationship between food intake and energy balance. In this review, serotonergic system mechanisms involved in food intake control and satiety will be discussed...|$|R

Sixteen students progressed through learning events during the first ha(f of their Master of Arts in Teaching program utilizing four central categories of professional identity, reaction (emotional <b>responses),</b> <b>relevance</b> (cognitive <b>responses),</b> and responsibility (psychomotor responses). Students utilized the tools of drama, collage, and personal narrative. Written reflections followed each learning event. Respondents were encouraged to tie learning events to theory and to deconstruct their experiences. Reflections were structured usingprofessionalzdentz(y, reaction, relevance, and responsibiliry.

In the strong coupling limit ($t= 0 $), the ground state is classical and disordered due to geometrical frustration.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{relative}} relevance feedback method for image retrieval <b>systems.</b> <b>Relevance</b> feedback {{is an effective}} method to modify a user’s query by selecting relevant and irrelevant items in the search result. However, users cannot always find exactly relevant items {{in the first few}} search result pages, especially when the initial query is not specified {{due to the lack of}} user’s knowledge. Thus, we propose relative relevance feedback in the present paper, which allows users to select relatively relevant and irrelevant items, and modifies a query by taking into account the relativity of user’s feedback. Our experimental result shows that the relative relevance feedback outperforms a conventional relevance feedback for image retrieval tasks.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{attending}} {{to one or}} another of an object's attributes on neuronal representations of that object were investigated using extracellular recordings. A female rhesus monkey performed a delayed match to object attribute (DMSA) task, in which she alternately matched object orientations and object colors. In half of the task conditions, only one attribute matched the sample, forcing the animal to apply the current matching rule and ignore the irrelevant-attribute. Multiple simultaneous single-unit extracellular recordings were made in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while the monkey performed the task. Neuronal selectivity for matching rule, object attributes, attribute <b>relevance,</b> <b>response</b> choice, and congruency were assessed using multi-factor ANOVAs. Attribute-selective responses were common in both cortical areas during the sample and delay periods, but were not significantly modulated by attribute relevance. There were few interactions between color-selective and orientation-selective responses according to the ANOVAs, suggesting that these attributes were represented independently. (cont.) Significant effects of attribute <b>relevance,</b> <b>response</b> choice, and congruency appeared in both areas after the delay period, when the probe appeared onscreen. VLPFC cells were more active during incongruent and non-match conditions, when responses had to be suppressed. ACC cells were more active during congruent and match conditions, when active response suppression was not required. The results indicate that although prefrontal cortex often shows a bias for relevant information (Rainer et al, 1998), it may not do so if the task requires frequent alternation of attentional sets or active suppression of conflicting responses. The data also indicate that the VLPFC's role in managing attentional 'set' (Banich et al, 2000; Milham et al, 2001) is performed in conjunction with active stimulus comparison and response selection (e. g., Rushworth et al, 1997), not during working memory maintenance. The ACC may facilitate the reactivation of response tendencies that had been actively suppressed, possibly {{as part of a larger}} role in managing response conflict (Botvinick et al, 2004). by Cynthia E.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of electron-electron {{interactions}} on the charge and spin structures of a Quantum Hall strip in a triangularly confined potential.

For sharp confinements the spin-polarization transition is spontaneous and first develops at the softer side of the triangular potential which shows up as an "eye-structure" in the electron dispersion. For sufficiently weak confinements this spin-polarization transition is preceded by a charge reconstruction of a single spin species, which creates a spin-polarized strip of electrons with a width of the order of the magnetic length detached {{from the rest of the}} <b>system.</b> <b>Relevance</b> of our findings to the recent momentum resolved tunneling experiments is also discussed.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{relevance}} has been heatedly debated in last decade. Not {{satisfied with the}} narrow and technical definition of <b>system</b> <b>relevance,</b> researchers turn to the subjective and situational aspect of this concept. How does a user perceive a document as relevant? The literature on relevance has identified numerous factors affecting such judgment. Taking a cognitive approach, this study focuses on the criteria users employ in making relevance judgment. Based on Grice’s theory of communication, this paper proposes a five-factor model of relevance: topicality, novelty, reliability, understandability, and scope. Data are collected from a semi-controlled survey study and analyzed following a psychometric procedure. The result supports topicality and novelty as the key relevance criteria.

That is, in addition to reducing the dimensionality of feature spaces, a proper subspace for each type of features is obtained in the feedback process to further improve the retrieval accuracy.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} large archives of digital images has pushed {{the need for}} effective image retrieval <b>systems.</b> <b>Relevance</b> Feedback (RF) techniques, where the user is involved in an iterative process to refine the search, have been recently formulated in terms of classification paradigms in low-level feature spaces. Two main issues arises in this formulation, namely {{the small size of}} the training set, and the unbalance between the class of relevant images and all other non-relevant images. To address these issues, in this paper we propose to formulate the RF paradigm in terms of Passive-Aggressive on-line learning approaches. These approaches are particularly suited to be implemented in RF because of their iterative nature, which allows further improvements in the image search process. The reported results show that the performances attained by the proposed algorithm are comparable, and in many cases higher, than those attained by other RF approaches...|$|R
