5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|They then venerate {{the holy}} table {{and put on}} their vestments. Before putting on each vestment the priest says a prayer, usually drawn from the Psalms, bless the vestment, and kiss the cross that is sewn onto it. The deacon brings his vestments to the priest to bless and then kisses the priest's hand and withdraws to vest, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> prayers for the sticharia as the priest and kissing the cross on each vestment. Each subdeacon and server vesting bring his sticharion to the priest for him to bless, and then kisses the cross on it before vesting. If a bishop is present, the clergy bring their vestments for him to bless before putting them on.|$|E
500|$|Following the episode's broadcast, the Fox network {{received}} several angry letters and emails from concerned Catholics, who were uneasy with the commercial scene. According to Scully, {{the letters were}} worded the same, and all started with [...] "My family and I have always enjoyed The Simpsons, until last night..." [...] Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from The Simpsons staff, and in an interview, Scully said, [...] "We {{got a couple of}} hundred letters, and it was very obvious from reading a majority of them that [...] had not seen the show. Some of them were from third-graders, all <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing: 'Please don't make fun of my religion.' Which we all know third-graders are very adamant about." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based their judgment on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E
500|$|The Vidiians' {{debut in}} [...] "Phage" [...] {{received}} primarily positive responses from Voyagers cast and crew. Kate Mulgrew praised {{the moment in}} which Janeway {{had to choose between}} [...] "sacrificing Neelix's lungs or allowing another species to continue to survive". She viewed Janeway's initial difficulty with approaching the Vidiians about the subject of ethics as showcasing a level of [...] "poignancy". While discussing the alien species introduced in the early seasons of Voyager, Westmore said that he found the Vidiians to have the most compelling design. He described them as [...] "the most interesting ones that we've run into as far as a new concept and look, and something totally different", highlighting their use of horror conventions. Taylor praised Westmore's work representing the Vidiians as [...] "truly grisly-looking people" [...] without turning them into flat or static characters. Skye Dent had a more critical opinion of the episode, saying that alterations made to her first draft of the script weakened the effectiveness of the alien species as antagonists. She felt that they [...] "just seemed very wimpy to me, even though they were <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dialogue I had written".|$|E
500|$|The show premiered on January 21, 2010 as a 2009–2010 midseason {{replacement}} for FlashForward, attracting 7 million viewers and receiving a low 1.7 rating {{in the category}} of Adults 18-49. The series received a negative critical response, averaging 40/100 on Metacritic, based on 23 reviews with one positive, 14 mixed, and eight negatives. Critics said that the show lacked originality and appeared similar to shows like L.A. Law, The Practice, Boston Legal, Damages, Eli Stone and The Good Wife. The show premiered in the time slot before Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice, leading the Washington Post to say that The Deep End resembled the two other shows [...] "closely enough to warrant a paternity test". Toni Fitzgerald of Media Life Magazine said that even though The Deep End received a great deal of publicity, the show [...] "sank in its first outing". Tom Maurstad of the Dallas Morning News observed that it was noticeable that the show was shot in Las Colinas, not in its setting of Los Angeles. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the show consisted of a [...] "bunch of attractive people in suits <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lines". Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald described the show as [...] "a dreadful attempt to duplicate Grey's Anatomy in a law office". Mark Peikert of the New York Press said that the show was [...] "sailing in shallow waters".|$|E

Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was really on the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing a black T-shirt depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're not cool anymore. The funny thing is, last year we were <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things and we were hip, fresh, and cute. Now they're telling us we're pushing 30, we're failures, and we're sellouts." ...|$|E

The earliest of the references to the art of memory, the Dialexis, mentioned above, makes this clear: [...] "repeat again what you hear; for by often hearing and <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> things, what you have learned comes complete into your memory." [...] Similar advice is a commonplace in later works on the art of memory.|$|E

[...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing with a little different twist on it.

2500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Michael Nobori {{who served as a}} {{production}} assistant for seasons 20 and 21 and directed by Mark Kirkland and guest stars Eddie Izzard performing impressions of Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and the character Nigel Bakerbutcher. In an effort to attract more viewers for May sweeps, Fox made a week full of musical segments in all the shows called Fox Rocks. For The Simpsons, they had a couch gag with the characters lip dubbing Kesha's song [...] "Tik Tok" [...] (P. Diddy vocals were replaced by Nancy Cartwright vocals as Bart Simpson <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> Diddy lines).

2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
2500|$|The paschal or Easter-month is {{the first}} one in the year to have its fourteenth day (its formal full moon) on or after 21 March. Easter is the Sunday after its 14th day (or, <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, the Sunday within its third week). The paschal lunar month always begins on a date in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive. Its fourteenth day, therefore, always falls on a date between 21 March and 18 April inclusive, and the {{following}} Sunday then necessarily falls on a date in the range 22 March to 25 April inclusive. In the solar calendar Easter is called a moveable feast since its date varies within a 35-day range. But in the lunar calendar, Easter is always the third Sunday in the paschal lunar month, and is no more [...] "moveable" [...] than any holiday that is fixed to a particular day of the week and week within a month.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have accused}} Slaughterhouse-Five {{of being a}} quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim {{believes}} {{that the notion of}} free will is a quaint Earthling illusion. The problem, according to Robert Merrill and Peter A.

M. Barrie's Peter Pan—in which we’re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy..." [...] For Charles Harris, [...] "The main idea emerging from Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance." [...] For Alfred Kazin, [...] "Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden... He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, 'So it goes.'" [...] For Tanner, [...] "Vonnegut has... total sympathy with such quietistic impulses." [...] The same notion is found throughout The Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut’s most loyal academic fans.|$|E

[...] Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, [...] "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly...

2500|$|Mike Peterson's {{theme is}} most {{commonly}} performed on a solo electric guitar—McCreary felt that [...] "the {{image of a}} single guitar player trying to hold his own against a 90-piece orchestra is a nice metaphor for how Mike must feel"—which is [...] "consumed by distorted synthesizers and low brass" [...] whenever the darker or more unstable sides of the character's superpowers are shown. McCreary also introduced a theme for the mysterious Centipede group in the pilot. [...] "To imply the centipede-nature of the theme," [...] McCreary [...] "used ten notes, {{divided into two groups}} of 5. Played on delicate bells and de-tuned piano, the percussive nature of the notes evokes two rows of tiny insect feet crawling across a string." [...] This theme also comes to represent the group's leader, the Clairvoyant. The emotional bond between the central characters is represented by [...] "The Agents" [...] theme, a much more intimate and accessible idea than the main theme. McCreary described the theme as unfolding [...] "essentially like a pop-song, with a simple A-B-A-A structure". The Skye theme is most clearly heard in emotional moments dealing with that character's backstory, but also appears in many other variations, including brief, romantic statements to highlight her early relationship with Grant Ward. Fitz and Simmons' theme is [...] " [...] less melodic than the other themes, and more motivic. It’s essentially an ostinato that rolls over itself again and again, evolving into subtly different variations with each turn through the pattern. This musically emulates their speaking pattern, where they are constantly stumbling over one another and <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing in slightly different ways." [...] "The Hub" [...] introduces the audience (and Skye) to [...] "Big S.H.I.E.L.D.", as opposed to Coulson's small team, which McCreary gave its own, more militaristic theme. The theme for John Garrett has two parts, an ostinato and a melody, and [...] "represents his adventurous personality, designed to be fun, bouncy and as far away from ominous as possible".|$|E
