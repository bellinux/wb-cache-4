25|$|Bam Teli {{is about}} the {{psychological}} games involved in human relationships, when people often hurt each other, sometimes leaving incurable wounds behind. In this song Tarkan advises not {{to get involved in}} such games, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> should just keep silent, show understanding and acceptance of the other and leave things to time.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{population}} of interest often consists of physical objects, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> need to sample over time, space, {{or some combination of}} these dimensions. For instance, an investigation of supermarket staffing could examine checkout line length at various times, or a study on endangered penguins might aim to understand their usage of various hunting grounds over time. For the time dimension, the focus may be on periods or discrete occasions.|$|E

500|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the first time I had been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment. We were mobbed, especially at the swimming pool. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> [...] were not sure people really wanted our signature or were just being polite and wanted us to feel good".|$|E

[...] "A lot of times we had to motivate each other to say 'listen, up your game. Go hard,'" [...] said Robinson.

500|$|... "Damien" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a satire on religion, faith and the nature of good and evil, as well as a commentary on commercialism and the cult of celebrity in American culture. Parker said the writers sought to satirize the speed and ease at which the followers of Jesus lose faith in him and bet against him. Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the abandonment of Jesus demonstrates, [...] "Like many people in the real world, the faith of the town's people cannot withstand the hard times." [...] Parker said, [...] "Everybody puts their trust in Satan and ends up getting screwed. There is a bigger message – all in all, a pretty wholesome message. That's why South Park works. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> have a message." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 2002, Linkin Park {{released}} an album entitled Reanimation. It included {{the songs of}} Hybrid Theory remixed and reinterpreted by nu metal and underground hip hop artists. Contributors to the album included Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Jonathan Davis, Stephen Carpenter, and Aaron Lewis. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as strings and piano, both of which, along with the same elements of electronica from Hybrid Theory, are prominently included in the band's second studio album Meteora. As Shinoda explains {{the difference in the}} sound between Hybrid Theory and Meteora: [...] "That electronic element has always been there in the band – it's just that <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> bring it closer to the front." ...|$|E
500|$|Guitarist and bassist Carol Kaye has disputed Blaine's {{account of}} the name and stated, [...] "We were never known as that. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> were called 'the Clique', but [...] a Hal Blaine invented name for his own self-promotion in 1990..." [...] Regarding the matter, Songfacts stated: [...] "We couldn't find any {{references}} to 'The Wrecking Crew' in any publications from the era." [...] In response to Kaye's contention that Blaine invented the moniker to sell his book, Blaine denied that anyone had ever heard the name [...] "The Clique". [...] Earlier, in the late 1950s, an embryonic version of the group was headed by Ray Pohlman that was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the First Call Gang", since they were the musicians many record producers would call first.|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{looked to}} herself for {{inspiration}} when writing [...] "Little Miss Obsessive", which chronicles the [...] "ostensibly aural dance" [...] {{of a couple}} [...] "who break up to make up – and like it". Of the song's concept, Simpson commented: [...] "It's what we can all become in a relationship <b>sometimes.</b> <b>We</b> put our foot in our mouths and we wish we didn't — 'No, I didn't mean to say it. I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation. You put your foot in your mouth and you go, 'Wait, why did I do that?' We're on our phones writing and texting too much!" ...|$|E
500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>we</b> think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he {{did a very good job}} of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E

In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for what ails us {{is going to come}} from the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say {{with all due respect to}} a lot of folks who might say otherwise, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E
500|$|... "East to West" [...] is a {{contemporary}} Christian song lasting four minutes and 26 seconds. It {{was written in}} common time in the key of F minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute. The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, [...] "East to West" [...] deals {{with the concept of}} forgiveness, and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin. Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that: [...] "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. We cut ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that he handles forgiveness like we would. We know he forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'". In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: [...] "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life. He loved me so much that He’s choosing to remember that against me no more, all because of Jesus".|$|E
500|$|Heffron, humiliated {{and tired}} after several decades in ministerial office, {{resigned}} as Premier {{six months later}} on 30 April 1964 {{at the age of}} 73. His announcement came as a surprise to many members of his own party, although there had been existing hints in the previous months that the Labor caucus had been discussing a departure plan for Heffron, to be replaced by the Deputy Premier Renshaw. Heffron insisted that he had made the decision to himself a year prior, declaring: [...] "It was purely my own decision, so I cannot complain about anyone throwing me out or advising me to get out. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> are advised to get out – there are hints, but we don't take any notice when they come from outside, {{but it is not the}} same, of course, as coming from your own party." [...] Renshaw succeeded him as Premier. On 24 June 1964, Heffron was granted by Queen Elizabeth II retention of the title [...] "The Honourable" [...] for having served for more than three years as a Member of the Executive Council of New South Wales.|$|E

500|$|Edwards {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it <b>sometimes.</b> <b>We</b> all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to get beat today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you knew what that felt like. I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E
500|$|Since its release, Memento {{has been}} a widely noted topic of film discussion, both for its unique {{narrative}} structure and themes. Those searching for explanations of the film's plot have either resorted to online forums, message boards or scholarly material, or have ignored the film's official website and forums {{in order to maintain}} their own personal hypotheses. In an article for The Dissolve analyzing Nolan's work, Mike D'Angelo cites Memento as [...] "a masterful study in deliberate self-delusion," [...] alluding to Leonard's own actions {{towards the end of the}} film and his role as an unreliable narrator. On the same topic of self-deception, James Mooney of filmandphilosophy.com notes that the film suggests how [...] "our memories deceive us, or rather, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> deceive ourselves by ‘choosing’ to forget or by manipulating our memories of past events." [...] This is much in line with a psychological analysis of the film, specifically the act of confabulation. Leonard's use of confabulation poses the dilemma, as explained by SUNY Downstate Medical Center Professor John Kubie for BrainFacts.org: [...] "In Memento we are faced with the question of how much of Leonard's memory of the past is real and how much constructed from beliefs and wishes." ...|$|E
500|$|Modern writers {{often think}} of Black's role in more dynamic terms than merely trying to equalize. Rowson writes that [...] "the idea of Black trying to 'equalize' is questionable. I {{think it has}} limited {{application}} to a few openings, rather than being an opening prescription for Black in general." [...] Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer, [...] "Fischer confided his 'secret' to me: unlike other masters, he sought to win with the Black pieces from the start. The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career, he said." [...] Likewise, Watson surmised that Kasparov, when playing Black, bypasses {{the question of whether}} White has an opening advantage [...] "by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible". Watson observes that [...] "energetic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> say 'dynamically balanced' instead of 'equal' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners." ...|$|E
