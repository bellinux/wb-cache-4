50|$|Mendinueta also conscripted {{the people}} of Spanish origin and the Christianized Amerindians as troops through a law that {{required}} the Spanish should exercise military service for eighteen days, regardless of where they lived. Each resident was required to join the army, taking a horse and carrying any weapon they had (either a <b>spear,</b> <b>pike,</b> or any other).|$|E
50|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Dárda, in German as Lanzenau, and in Serbian Cyrillic as Дарда. In Hungarian, Dárda means a dagger rammed in a long handle, a {{military}} weapon used by the cavaliers and the infantry in the old times (near equal as <b>spear,</b> <b>pike</b> or lance), while other's suggest that it probably comes from Illyrian language, today's Albanian, which can be translated directly from Albanian dardhë = pear.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main source}} of Samudragupta's history is an {{inscription}} engraved on the Allahabad pillar. In this inscription is detailed Samudragupta's conquests. Written on this inscription is, [...] "whose most charming body was covered over with all {{the beauty of the}} marks of a hundred confuse wounds caused by the blows of battle axes, arrows, <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> swords, lances, javelines".|$|R
50|$|The Scots army, again made up chiefly of spearmen as at Stirling, was {{arranged}} in four great armoured 'hedgehogs' known as schiltrons. The long <b>spears</b> (<b>pikes)</b> pointed outwards at various heights gave these formations a formidable and impenetrable appearance. The {{gaps between the}} schiltrons were filled with archers and to the rear {{there was a small}} troop of men-at-arms, provided by the Comyns and other magnates.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a heavy}} wagon given {{protective}} {{sides with}} firing slits and heavy firepower from either a cannon or a force of hand-gunners, archers and crossbowmen, supported by infantry using <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes</b> and flails. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the Holy Roman Empire larger forces of mounted knights.|$|R
50|$|Plate armour was {{virtually}} invulnerable to sword slashes. It also protected the wearer well against <b>spear</b> or <b>pike</b> thrusts and provided decent defense against blunt trauma.|$|R

50|$|Trans-Atlantic armies {{appear to}} have possessed <b>spears</b> of <b>pike</b> dimensions, but in the absence {{for most of their}} {{existence}} of any cavalry threat did not develop the same traditions of massed close-order pike formations.|$|R
25|$|The Bulgarian {{army was}} armed with {{various types of}} weapons, {{the most widely used}} being sabres, swords, battle axes, <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> daggers, arkans, bows and arrows. The {{soldiers}} were often trained to use both spears and bows. The Bulgarians wore helms, mails and shields for defence. The helms were usually cone-shaped, the shields were round and light. The mails were two typeswedge riveted mails consisting of small metal rings linked together, and scale armour consisting of small armour plates attached to each other. Belts were very important for the early Bulgarians and were often decorated with golden, silver, bronze or copper buckles that manifested the illustrious origin of the holder.|$|R
50|$|The phalanx (φάλαγξ; plural phalanxes or phalanges, , phalanges) was a {{rectangular}} mass military formation, usually composed entirely of heavy infantry armed with <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> sarissas, or similar weapons. The term is particularly (and originally) {{used to describe}} the use of this formation in Ancient Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment, as does Arrian in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. In Greek texts, the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, even camped, thus describing the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. They marched forward as one entity. The word phalanx is derived from the Greek word phalangos, meaning finger.|$|R
50|$|The Flemish were {{primarily}} town militia who were well equipped and trained. The militia fought primarily as infantry, were organized by guild, and were equipped with steel helmets, chainmail haubergeons, <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> bows, crossbows and the goedendag. The goedendag was a specifically Flemish weapon, {{made from a}} thick 5 ft-long wooden shaft and topped with a steel spike. They were a well-organized force of nine thousand, including four hundred noblemen, and the urban militias of the time prided themselves on their regular training and preparation. The Flemish militia formed a line formation against cavalry with goedendags and pikes pointed outward. Because of {{the high rate of}} defections among the Flemish nobility, there were few mounted knights on the Flemish side. The Annals of Ghent claimed that there were just ten cavalrymen in the Flemish force.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the band}} played a march and a company of rabbit {{soldiers}} came in. They wore green and gold uniforms and marched very stiffly but in perfect time. Their <b>spears,</b> or <b>pikes,</b> had slender shafts of polished silver with golden heads, and during the drill they handled these weapons with wonderful dexterity.|$|R
50|$|As states grew in size, {{speed of}} {{movement}} became crucial because central power {{could not hold}} if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly. The first solution to this was the chariot which became used in the Middle East from around 1800 BC. First pulled by oxen and donkeys, they allowed rapid traversing of the relatively flat lands of the Middle East. The chariots were light enough that they could easily be floated across rivers. Improvements {{in the ability to}} train horses soon allowed them to be used to pull chariots, possibly as early as 2100 BC, and their greater speed and power made chariots even more efficient. The major drawback of the use of chariots is similar to one of its advantages, {{the fact that it is}} light. The lack of armor causes it to be extremely vulnerable to <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The most {{dramatic}} impact of Spanish military power, however, {{lay in the}} defeat of the American empires of the Aztecs and Incas. From 1519-21, a coalition army of Spanish soldiers and Tlaxcalan warriors led by Hernán Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger defeated the Aztec Empire; in 1532, Francisco Pizarro and his brothers Gonzalo and Hernando invaded and occupied the Inca Empire from their base in Panama. Both wars in which very small numbers of Spanish soldiers - the conquistadors - who were mostly veterans of Spain's European or North African campaigns, were backed by local allies and defeated well established empires, shared many similarities. The highly proficient conquistadors benefited from their access to cavalry, steel swords, axes, <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> halberds, bows, crossbows, helmets and armour, not to mention small cannon, none of which were familiar to local forces. The Spanish also benefited from their immunity to many common European diseases which were to decimate their local enemies.|$|R
60|$|The pearl fishers {{who lived}} {{at the lower end}} of the island tried to escape in their boats, but they were soon {{overtaken}} and made prisoners, like the others. Nor was there any attempt to resist the foe, for the sharp <b>spears</b> and <b>pikes</b> and swords of the invaders terrified the hearts of the defenseless people of Pingaree, whose sole weapons were their oyster rakes.|$|R
40|$|Around 700 BCE, a new {{military}} formation called the phalanx {{was established in}} ancient Greece: a tight column of heavy infantry carrying long <b>spears,</b> or <b>pikes,</b> used in a single prong of attack. Later, {{in the battle of}} Marathon described by Herodotus, the Greeks learned the advantages of multipronged attacks, a strategy still used in modern warfare. Is the immune system similar in its approach to combating pathogens or tumors...|$|R

50|$|The first bridge became infamous as {{the setting}} for a {{massacre}} of nearly 100 local Loyalists by pikemen of the Society of United Irishmen during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The victims were taken from custody to the bridge, <b>speared</b> by <b>pikes</b> and thrown into the river. As part of the recriminations after the rebellion had been put down, a number of rebel ringleaders were hanged on the bridge, beheaded and their corpses thrown into the river.|$|R
50|$|The long <b>spears</b> (<b>pikes)</b> of Scots and Swiss were an {{excellent}} defensive weapon against cavalry. The warriors stood in tight formations like an ancient phalanx, {{the end of}} their pikes embedded in the ground, presenting a massive spiked wall. In battle against the Scots, the English knights proved to be as narrow-minded as their French counterparts, employing the classic cavalry charge despite the new challenge of the Scottish pike. In the battles of Stirling Bridge (1297) and Bannockburn (1314) they were defeated by the Scots. While the English imitated this tactic successfully against the French, the Swiss perfected it. Despite longer lances for the knights, this formation was now almost impenetrable. Pikemen with polearms remained an important part of armies throughout the Thirty Years' War. Later tactics used against this formation included caracole maneuvers with ranged weapons. However, a well-trained cavalry force could outflank a force of enemy pikemen and triumph. The most elite knights, with the best armour, immense prowess and extremely-well trained horses, could charge pike formations and still hold their own, sometimes even triumphing; however, the cost to raise and maintain such troops was enormous and impractical when considering alternative options to the head-on charge.|$|R
50|$|The sarissa or sarisa (σάρισα) {{was a long}} <b>spear</b> or <b>pike</b> about 4-6 m in length. It was {{introduced}} by Philip II of Macedon and was used in his Macedonian phalanxes {{as a replacement for}} the earlier dory, which was considerably shorter. These longer spears improved the traditional strength of the phalanx by extending the rows of overlapping weapons projecting towards the enemy, and the word remained in use throughout the Byzantine years to sometimes describe the long spears of their own infantry.|$|R
5000|$|Monument 2, at {{the west}} end of the series, shows four humans. Three of them are {{standing}} while the fourth, on the right, is seated upon the ground, inertly slumped backwards, perhaps bound. All are masked, although the fourth has his mask {{on the back of his}} head. The three standing figures are brandishing <b>spears</b> or <b>pikes.</b> The headdress worn by one of the standing figures echoes the motifs adorning the head of one of Monument 4’s felines, suggesting that this scene is related to the events depicted in the others in the sequence.|$|R
60|$|About {{the time}} that these occurrences took place, the Egyptian army {{advanced}} into {{those parts of the}} city from which Caesar had withdrawn, producing those terrible scenes of panic and confusion which always attend a sudden and violent change of military possession within the precincts of a city. Ganymede brought up his troops on every side to the walls of Caesar's citadels and intrenchments, and hemmed him closely in. He cut off all avenues of approach to Caesar's lines by land, and commenced vigorous preparations for an assault. He constructed engines for battering down the walls. He opened shops and established forges in every part of the city for the manufacture of darts, <b>spears,</b> <b>pikes,</b> and all kinds of military machinery. He built towers supported upon huge wheels, with the design of filling them with armed men when finally ready to make his assault upon Caesar's lines, and moving them up to the walls of the citadels and palaces, so as to give to his soldiers the advantage of a lofty elevation in making their attacks. He levied contributions on the rich citizens for the necessary funds, and provided himself with men by pressing all the artisans, laborers, and men capable of bearing arms into his service. He sent messengers back into the interior of the country, in every direction, summoning the people to arms, and calling for contributions of money and military stores.|$|R
50|$|The halberd was {{inexpensive}} {{to produce}} and very versatile in battle. As the halberd was eventually refined, its point was more fully developed {{to allow it to}} better deal with <b>spears</b> and <b>pikes</b> (also able to push back approaching horsemen), as was the hook opposite the axe head, which could be used to pull horsemen to the ground. A Swiss peasant used a halberd to kill Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy—decisively ending the Burgundian Wars, literally in a single stroke. Researchers suspect that a halberd or a bill sliced through the back of King Richard III's skull at the Battle of Bosworth.|$|R

'Johne Belloun,' Frenchmen or 'Master Johne Carvour' worked on new windows and doors for the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and repaired {{a number of}} <b>spears</b> and <b>pikes.</b> An Italian called 'Auld Julian' made 6000 bricks at Tranent {{to be used for}} building a furnace at the armoury in Edinburgh Castle, where the master gun-founder Robert Borthwick was joined by the Frenchmen, 'Johne Bukkat' and his apprentice 'Perys.' Two of the cannons they made, marked with the Duke's arms and listed as [...] "quarter-falcons," [...] were still in use at Edinburgh Castle in 1579.|$|R
5000|$|In 1034, Sancho wrested {{the city}} of León itself from his son-in-law, Bermudo, who retreated into Galicia. By the time Sancho died in 1035, the meseta north of the Duero was {{dominated}} by the Pyrenean pocket kingdom of Navarre. After Sancho's death, Bermudo III was immediately received back into León and soon began a campaign to recover from Castile and his brother-in-law Ferdinand, the disputed territory between the Cea and Pisuerga. Bermudo III was killed at the Battle of Tamarón on September 4, 1037. [...] Autopsy of his remains shows {{that he may have}} suffered death from infantry <b>spears</b> or <b>pikes,</b> after falling from his horse.|$|R
25|$|Although Roman iron-working was {{enhanced}} {{by a process}} known as carburization, the Romans are not thought to have developed true steel production. From the earliest history of the Roman state to its downfall, Roman arms were therefore uniformly produced from either bronze or, later, iron. As a result, the 1300 years of Roman military technology saw little radical change in technological level. Within the bounds of classical military technology, however, Roman arms and armor was developed, discarded, and adopted from other peoples based on changing methods of engagement. It included at various times stabbing daggers and swords, stabbing or thrusting swords, long thrusting <b>spears</b> or <b>pikes,</b> lances, light throwing javelins and darts, slings, and bow and arrows.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the wealthiest}} classes were {{recruited}} the heavy-armed infantry, equipped like the Greek hoplite warrior with helmet, round shield (clipeus), greaves and breastplate, all of bronze, {{and carrying a}} spear (hasta) and sword (not the gladius). In battle they followed the principle of [...] "two forward, one back." [...] The first and second acies, or lines of battle, composed of principes and hastati, were forward; the triarii or [...] "third rank", containing the veterani, or [...] "old ones", was held in reserve. From the name, hastati, we can deduce that the hasta, a thrusting spear, was the weapon of choice. Triarii were equipped with a long <b>spear,</b> or <b>pike,</b> a shield and heavy armor.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{stopping}} power of a thrusting spear, it quickly became a popular weapon of infantry in the Late Middle Ages. These {{eventually led to the}} rise of the longest type of <b>spears,</b> the <b>pike.</b> This adaptation of the cavalry lance to infantry use was largely tasked with stopping lance-armed cavalry charges. During the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, these weapons, both mounted and unmounted, were so effective that lancers and pikemen not only became a staple of every Western army, but also became highly sought-after mercenaries. (However, the pike had already been used by Philip II of Macedon in antiquity to great effect, {{in the form of the}} sarissa.) ...|$|R
50|$|As a full-contact sport; {{moves are}} not planned or {{signaled}} and fighters strike {{each other with}} considerable force and speed. Weapons are primarily made of rattan to resemble swords, <b>pikes,</b> <b>spears,</b> axes and other medieval weapon types. Maces and axes have heads made of rubber or stiff foam, and pole weapons (resembling medieval pole-axes, glaives, halberds or bills, etc.) {{may or may not}} be required to be similarly padded, depending upon the regulations in a given SCA kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of infantry tactics during the Warring States period, the Qin army developed an infantry force that would help it conquer the other states. Soldiers fulfilling the role of heavy infantry usually wore lacquered leather (and sometimes bronze) coat of plates or lamellar, and were equipped with spears and wooden shields, dagger-axes and large bronze shields, or swords and smaller bronze shields. Some soldiers were also equipped with very long <b>spears</b> or <b>pikes,</b> and fought in a formation akin to Swiss pikemen. The Han Dynasty that succeeded the Qin era would equip their soldiers with iron armor, which {{they were able to}} mass-produce due to state standardized metallurgical improvements. Unlike their contemporaries such as the post-Marian Romans, the Han military did not rely primarily on their heavy infantry, but emphasized a more balanced force of infantry, missile troops, and cavalry.|$|R
50|$|Pikemen often {{became a}} {{substitute}} for communities and villages who could not afford large forces of heavy cavalry. The pike could be up to 18 ft long, whereas the spear was only 6 to 8 ft in length. Archers would be integrated into these forces of spearmen or pikemen to rain down arrows upon an enemy while the <b>spears</b> or <b>pikes</b> held the enemy at bay. Polearms were improved again with creation of the halberd. The halberd could be {{the length of a}} spear, but with an axe head which enabled the user to stab or chop the enemy cavalry with either the front of the axe or a thin point on the opposite side. The Japanese also created polearms. The naginata consisted of an approximately 6 ft long shaft and a 2.5 ft blade. The naginata was often used by women to guard a castle in the absence of men.|$|R
50|$|Particular {{parallels}} {{can be seen}} in the Middle Ages and Renaissance city-states of the Low Countries (modern Holland and Belgium), the cantons of Switzerland and the city-states of Northern Italy. Armies of the Low Countries {{were first}} armed with <b>spears,</b> then <b>pikes,</b> and were defeating French and Burgundian forces by the 14th century. The Swiss first used the halberd in the 14th century but—outreached by Austrian cavalry armed with lances—the Swiss gradually adopted pikes in the later 15th century. Swiss pike phalanxes of the Burgundian Wars were dynamic and aggressive resulting in the destruction of the 'modern' Burgundian army and the death of Charles the Bold. It is tempting to suggest that Swiss military authorities had read Classical sources and were consciously copying Hellenistic practices. Some Italian states raised their own pike units as well as employing Swiss mercenary pikemen in the 15th and 16th century. The Swiss were also copied by German Landsknechts leading to bitterness and rivalry between competing mercenary units.|$|R
50|$|A pike is a pole weapon, a {{very long}} {{thrusting}} spear formerly used extensively by infantry. Unlike many similar weapons, the pike {{is not intended to}} be thrown. Pikes were used regularly in European warfare from the early Middle Ages until around 1700, and were wielded by foot soldiers deployed in close quarters. The pike found extensive use with Landsknecht armies and Swiss mercenaries, who employed it as their main weapon and used it in pike square formations. A similar weapon, the sarissa, was also used by Alexander the Great's Macedonian phalanx infantry to great effect. Generally, a <b>spear</b> becomes a <b>pike</b> when it is too long to be wielded with one hand in combat.|$|R
