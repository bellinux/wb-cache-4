[...] Another opponent, Megan Leslie, the environment critic for the Official Opposition's New Democratic Party, said the debate surrounding the ethics of Canadian oil sands [...] "misses the point" [...] and maintained that [...] "Canada <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> to move beyond fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy".|$|E

2500|$|After the incident, Li {{was dubbed}} pejoratively by some Chinese-language media as the [...] "Red Carpet Secretary" [...] and the [...] "most niu Secretary" [...] in China (roughly {{translates}} to [...] "most kick-ass Secretary"). In {{the face of}} national criticism, Li returned {{to work with a}} lower profile, generally avoided the media, and was given less 'face time' in local television stations. Li reputedly held his subordinates to very high standards. According to one local official, Li told them, [...] "I work ten hours a day, you all <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> 16 hours a day. If you don't like it, then leave." [...] The local official also said that Li called meetings on demand, and subordinates were expected to simply show up regardless of which hour of the day it was. The turnover of local government staff was high; Li routinely shuffled his rank and file. Li reportedly had say in the transfer and promotion of even ordinary office staff.|$|E
2500|$|Fremantle {{entered the}} Confederacy through the Mexican town of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on 2 April {{on board the}} Royal Navy frigate HMS Immortalité to avoid being in {{violation}} of the Union blockade, and crossed the Rio Grande into Brownsville, Texas. [...] Within three hours of his arrival in the Confederacy, Fremantle encountered 'frontier justice' for the first time, finding the body of a renegade, known as Montgomery, half-buried and stripped of flesh at the roadside. Spending almost two weeks in Brownsville, with occasional visits across the border to Matamoros and the village of Bagdad, Fremantle became acquainted with General Hamilton P. Bee and several merchants and diplomats who were facilitating the trade of cotton across the border with Mexico. Part of the reasoning for Fremantle's tenure in Brownsville may have been that he wished to meet General John B. Magruder, for whom he had a letter of introduction. [...] However, Magruder was delayed, and Fremantle left Brownsville on 13 April in a carriage in the company of some of his merchant friends. Their driver and his assistant, Mr Sargeant and Judge Hyde, are particularly memorable figures from Fremantle's diary, in no small part due to Fremantle's astonishment that a member of the justiciary <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> on a stagecoach. Later, General Longstreet would recall meeting the same two men during his own service in Texas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has received praise and criticism from several media publications with Alex Lucard from Die Hard Game Fan considering himself one of Terry's biggest fans. GameSpot reviewer Frank Provo commented {{that one of}} Fatal Furys biggest accomplishments {{is the creation of}} Terry Bogard and for making him appear in later sequels. Damien McFerran praised Terry's design, saying that he is [...] "emanating so much coolness it’s little wonder that SNK otaku can always be seen wearing his trademark red cap". Dale Nardozzi from Reviews Teambox also praised Terry's distinct appearance. He further commented that his clothes {{is one of the most}} common cosplays at every convention with video game importance. Andrew Sztein from GamingExcellence commented that Terry was one of his favourite characters from the series. He mentioned that he liked his design because as [...] "he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> at Petro Canada part time" [...] and added that his mispronunciation of English quotes are quite funny. IGN reviewer Ryan Clements also found preference over Terry from all the other characters in the Fatal Fury series, commenting he liked how the character played in each game. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer praised each part of Terry's appearance that makes him look cool. He also commented that Terry is one of the most popular characters from Fatal Fury although he is [...] "rather bland". UGO.com listed Terry's baseball cap thirteenth on their list of [...] "The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games", calling it [...] "completely badass" [...] despite its reading of [...] "Fatal Fury." [...] Den of Geek listed Terry 3rd in their [...] "best fighting game characters" [...] list with editor Harry Slater commenting [...] "Bogard is a stark reminder of the glory days of the two dimensional fighter".|$|E

It seemed to him that there were no crazy fortuities that had not tended to its existence, and as time went on, and the day drew near for the issue of the first number, the sense of this intensified till the whole lost at moments the quality of a waking fact, and came to be rather a fantastic fiction of sleep.|$|E

60|$|One summer {{afternoon}} in Oxford--'that sweet city with her dreaming spires,' lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its learning as Rome, {{down the long}} High Street that winds from tower to tower, past silent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches that long, grey seven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used to, I say, because they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light cast- iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest city in England)--well, we were coming down the street--a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or cricket-field--when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us. He seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which {{a few of us}} did, and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life, saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique and strength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly on cricket- ground or river, without any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat. He thought, he said, that we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> at something that would do good to other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble. Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything he wished. So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass {{from one to the other}} without many miles of a round. And when we came back in winter he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people to use. So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank--a very difficult thing to do. And Ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank. We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it afterwards at all, but worked away for two months at our road. And what became of the road? Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly--in the middle of the swamp. Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for the next term there was no leader, and the 'diggers,' as they called us, fell asunder. And I felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the young men to go out to such work as road-making for the sake of a noble ideal of life, I could from them create an artistic movement that might change, as it has changed, the face of England. So I sought them out--leader they would call me--but there was no leader: we were all searchers only and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by noble art. There was none of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious were we: painters some of us, or workers in metal or modellers, determined that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for the handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and pictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn.|$|E
