5|$|Bowie <b>Seamount</b> {{lies on the}} Pacific Plate, a {{large segment}} of the Earth's surface which moves in a northwestern {{direction}} under the Pacific Ocean. It is adjacent to two other submarine volcanoes; Hodgkins <b>Seamount</b> on its northern flank and Graham <b>Seamount</b> on its eastern flank.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied <b>seamount</b> {{in the world}} is Davidson <b>Seamount,</b> with six major expeditions {{recording}} over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the <b>seamount</b> and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the <b>seamount</b> is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the <b>seamount</b> there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such <b>seamount</b> is Bowie <b>Seamount,</b> which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie <b>Seamount</b> chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson <b>Seamount,</b> are older than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie <b>Seamount</b> chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism.|$|E
50|$|The Tasmanian <b>Seamounts</b> (also Tasman <b>Seamounts</b> and Tasmania <b>Seamounts)</b> are a {{group of}} <b>seamounts</b> (underwater volcanoes) located off the {{southern}} tip of Tasmania. The <b>seamounts</b> were created more than 55 million years ago by the Tasman hotspot. The <b>seamounts</b> are ecologically important, and harbor a lush marine ecosystem, but are threatened by overfishing. For this reason, part of the Tasmanian <b>Seamounts</b> were incorporated into a marine reserve in 1999.|$|R
40|$|<b>Seamounts</b> {{represent}} crust-mantle {{activities and}} are areas of petrological deviations, biodiversity, seismicity and hydrothermal events. An estimated ~ 50 million tons/year of basalts {{are required to}} produce <b>seamounts</b> suggesting intense oceanic volcanism. <b>Seamounts</b> either occur as chains perpendicular to the ridge or as isolated entities or in clusters. <b>Seamounts</b> may host basalts, hyaloclastites, gabbros and serpentinites and these variants perhaps evolve from multiple melting domains {{as a consequence of}} large-scale thermal structure and mantle lithology. Nonhotspot <b>seamounts</b> on a young, thin and hot lithosphere host tholeiites whereas the plume related ones on thick, older lithosphere may be either tholeiitic or alkaline. <b>Seamounts</b> may bear hydrothermal deposits (Fe, Mn, Co) rare metals and phosphorites. The resistance of <b>seamounts</b> to subduction could trigger slides; while shearing of <b>seamounts</b> buried in subduction zones leads to seismicity, both of which could cause tsunamis. <b>Seamounts</b> greatly affect the circulation patterns and currents, which in turn influence the surrounding biota. We review here the <b>seamounts</b> in terms of discovery, characteristics, distribution and their influence on the marine environment...|$|R
50|$|The Newfoundland <b>Seamounts</b> are a {{group of}} <b>seamounts</b> {{offshore}} of Eastern Canada in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Named for the island of Newfoundland, this group of <b>seamounts</b> formed during the Cretaceous period and are poorly studied.|$|R
5|$|Discovered {{during the}} mapping of California's coast in 1933, Davidson <b>Seamount</b> {{is named after}} {{geographer}} George Davidson of the U.S. National Geodetic Survey. Studied only sparsely for decades, NOAA expeditions to the <b>seamount</b> in 2002 and 2006 cast light upon its unique deep-sea coral ecosystem. Davidson <b>Seamount</b> is populated by a dense population of large, ancient corals, {{some of which are}} over 100 years of age. The data gathered during the studies fueled the making of Davidson <b>Seamount</b> into a part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Isolated seamounts {{and those}} without clear {{volcanic}} origins are less common; examples include Bollons <b>Seamount,</b> Eratosthenes <b>Seamount,</b> Axial <b>Seamount</b> and Gorringe Ridge. If all known seamounts were collected into one area, {{they would make}} a landform the size of Europe. Their overall abundance makes them {{one of the most}} common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth, a sort of exploratory frontier.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the <b>seamount</b> was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the <b>seamount</b> was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the <b>seamount</b> as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor <b>seamount</b> chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the <b>seamount,</b> Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E

50|$|The President Jackson <b>Seamounts</b> are {{a series}} of <b>seamounts</b> (underwater volcanoes) located on the Pacific Plate, off of California. It {{consists}} of 8 <b>seamounts,</b> 4 independent and 4 morpohologically fused, just west of the northern Gorda Ridge. They are generally very small, and arranged linearly.|$|R
30|$|Close {{relationships}} between subducted <b>seamounts</b> and the hypocenters of large earthquakes {{have been identified}} in many other subduction zones (e.g., Scholz and Small 1997), although the roles of <b>seamounts</b> in seismic rupture propagation were not the same for all the cases (Mochizuki et al. 2008; Wang and Bilek 2011). At a shallow part of the accretionary wedge, overriding soft sediments easily deform and <b>seamounts</b> would behave as rigid objects (Dominguez et al. 1998) or barriers (Kodaira et al. 2000; Hirata et al. 2003). However, beneath the island-arc lower crust and mantle, there are no significant differences in yield strength between <b>seamounts</b> and overriding crystalline rocks (Figure 3 b). Wang and Bilek (2011) stated that faulting or ‘decapitation’ of <b>seamounts</b> is unlikely, but the common occurrence of fossil fragmented <b>seamounts</b> in outcrops of high-pressure metamorphic belts (e.g., Agata 1994; Terabayashi et al. 2005) indicates that breaking of <b>seamounts</b> did occur in ancient subduction zones.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underwater}} flow is pillow lava, a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are glassy, marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to die down, and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the <b>seamount</b> in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are Loihi <b>Seamount,</b> Bowie <b>Seamount,</b> Davidson <b>Seamount,</b> and Axial <b>Seamount.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji <b>Seamount,</b> {{perched on}} the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago. At its current velocity, the <b>seamount</b> will be {{destroyed}} within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the <b>seamount</b> chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji <b>Seamount,</b> as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E
5|$|Bowie <b>Seamount</b> {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, halibut and sablefish. Eight species of marine mammal {{have been found in}} the Bowie <b>Seamount</b> area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie <b>Seamount</b> a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Seamounts</b> subducted {{under the}} Manila Trench have shown to produce some notable {{deformation}} features. Well-developed back-thrust faults, microfractures and gravitational collapse {{are found in}} the accretionary wedge of the Manila Trench. These features are only present proximal to subducted <b>seamounts,</b> and absent where there are no subducted <b>seamounts.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on <b>seamounts,</b> which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many <b>seamounts</b> also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi <b>seamounts.</b> This is helped by geochemical exchange between the <b>seamounts</b> and the ocean water.|$|R
500|$|Many <b>seamounts</b> {{show signs}} of {{intrusive}} activity, {{which is likely to}} lead to inflation, steepening of volcanic slopes, and ultimately, flank collapse. There are also several sub-classes of <b>seamounts.</b> The first are guyots, <b>seamounts</b> with a flat top. These tops must be [...] or more {{below the surface of the}} sea; the diameters of these flat summits can be over [...] [...] Knolls are isolated elevation spikes measuring less than [...] Lastly, pinnacles are small pillar-like <b>seamounts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following the {{information}} {{learned from the}} 2002 and 2006 expeditions, there was {{public support for the}} making of Davidson <b>Seamount</b> into a marine sanctuary. A key group of research scientists, fishermen, officials, educators, and marine biologists was formed in 2006 to discuss whether or not to make Davidson <b>Seamount</b> a National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and if so whether to make it its own sanctuary, or incorporate it into the nearby Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The group decided that the <b>seamount</b> was eligible for sanctuary designation, and the majority of the group recommended its incorporation into the nearby Monterey Bay sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on <b>seamount</b> communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate <b>seamount</b> research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of <b>seamount</b> ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to <b>seamount</b> {{ecological}} welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages <b>seamount</b> surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to <b>seamount</b> ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on <b>seamounts,</b> which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs).

50|$|Dry {{prominence}} is {{also useful}} for measuring submerged <b>seamounts.</b> <b>Seamounts</b> have a dry topographic prominence, a topographic isolation, and a negative topographic elevation.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>seamounts</b> {{show signs}} of {{intrusive}} activity, {{which is likely to}} lead to inflation, steepening of volcanic slopes, and ultimately, flank collapse. There are also several sub-classes of <b>seamounts.</b> The first are guyots, <b>seamounts</b> with a flat top. These tops must be 200 m or more {{below the surface of the}} sea; the diameters of these flat summits can be over 10 km. [...] Knolls are isolated elevation spikes measuring less than 1000 m. Lastly, pinnacles are small pillar-like <b>seamounts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Seamounts {{can form}} {{in a wide}} variety of tectonic settings, {{resulting}} in a very diverse structural bank. Seamounts come {{in a wide variety}} of structural shapes, from conical to flat-topped to complexly shaped. Some are built very large and very low, such as Koko Guyot and Detroit Seamount; others are built more steeply, such as Loihi <b>Seamount</b> and Bowie <b>Seamount.</b> Some seamounts also have a carbonate or sediment cap.|$|E
5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield <b>Seamount</b> is named after the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted <b>seamount</b> in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial <b>Seamount,</b> were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry. Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes {{it one of the most}} interesting, rivaling Davidson <b>Seamount</b> to the south in scientific interest.|$|E
40|$|<b>Seamounts</b> are {{expected}} to attract pelagic top predators due to the higher abundance of possible prey aggregating around these structures. The importance of <b>seamounts</b> on benthic fauna and bottom fish is vastly documented, while {{little is known about}} their role as possible hotspots of pelagic biodiversity. This aspect is poorly investigated in the Mediterranean Sea, a basin considered a hotspot of endemism and biodiversity where, in addition, <b>seamounts</b> are widely present, with 227 structures. Our study focuses on the determination of the attraction effect of <b>seamounts</b> on some pelagic species in a Mediterranean sub-basin: the Tyrrhenian Sea. Here, <b>seamounts</b> are thought to be attraction structures for pelagic top predators. Cetaceans and sea turtles were found to be the most attracted taxa among the top predators taken into consideration with peak of presence around 5 – 10 miles from the <b>seamounts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} intraplate <b>seamounts</b> {{are obvious}} {{features in the}} northern South China Sea (SCS). However, the distribution, volume, and origin of these <b>seamounts</b> are not well understood, which greatly hinders our understanding of magmatism in the SCS. Based on high-resolution bathymetric data and 147 seismic profiles, and combining gravity and magnetic data, we first identify 45 <b>seamounts</b> in the northern margin of the SCS and simulate their shape with elliptical cones. Results show that the total volume of these 45 <b>seamounts</b> above seafloor is estimated at about 1885 - 3078 km(3) and the total volume of intrusive magma above Moho is about 0. 15 Mkm(3), which {{is close to the}} estimates for classic large igneous provinces across the world. These <b>seamounts</b> are mostly located on the continental slope with thin crust (approximately 12 - 18 km), which reduces the overlying pressure and shortens the magmatic conduits. The dominant azimuth of elliptical major axis in <b>seamounts</b> is consistent with the synrift and synspreading fault strikes (NE-NEE), indicating that these preexisting faults provide magmatic conduits for the subsequent postrift intraplate <b>seamounts.</b> Based on three existing clues, i. e., (1) the intraplate <b>seamounts,</b> high velocity layer and Hainan mantle plume are contiguous in 3 -D space, (2) the high-velocity layer is thicker beneath the continental shelf but thinner beneath the slope, and (3) the basalts dredged from certain <b>seamounts</b> show OIB-type geochemical features, we propose a magmatic upwelling pattern which contains Hainan mantle plume to explain the spatial and morphological characteristics of these intraplate <b>seamounts...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Balleny <b>Seamounts</b> (...) are <b>seamounts</b> {{named in}} {{association}} with the Balleny Islands. The name was approved by the Advisory Committee for Undersea Features in June 1988.|$|R
5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks {{which make}} {{up some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie <b>Seamount</b> chain are unusual in that they have an acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie <b>Seamount</b> also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie <b>Seamount</b> seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} of the flows on Axial <b>Seamount</b> are aligned along the two rift zones, followed by flows inside the summit caldera; the oldest appear to originate from directly around the caldera, {{where most of the}} basalt is completely covered in accumulated sediment. This suggests a bilateral growth pattern, a trend also found in Hawaiian volcanics and other well-known seamounts, for instance Jasper <b>Seamount.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} depth, {{for a long}} time Davidson <b>Seamount</b> had been preceded only by a sparse few investigations. Davidson is {{interesting}} to volcanologists because of its unique geology, and to biologists for its unique ecology. In 2002 the NOAA sponsored the first modern in-depth study of the <b>seamount.</b> The team included scientists, educators, and resource managers, with the goal of documenting species, taking geologic samples, and describing the ocean environment. The expedition documented many rare, previously undiscovered species that exist nowhere else, not even on nearby seamounts, including ancient coral gardens that are vulnerable to human activity.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of biodiversity hotspots and their management for conservation have been hypothesized as {{effective ways to}} protect many species. There {{has been a significant}} effort to identify and map these areas at a global scale, but the coarse resolution of most datasets masks the small-scale patterns associated with coastal habitats or <b>seamounts.</b> Here we used tuna longline observer data to investigate the role of <b>seamounts</b> in aggregating large pelagic biodiversity and to identify which pelagic species are associated with <b>seamounts.</b> Our analysis indicates that <b>seamounts</b> are hotspots of pelagic biodiversity. Higher species richness was detected in association with <b>seamounts</b> than with coastal or oceanic areas. <b>Seamounts</b> were found to have higher species diversity within 30 – 40 km of the summit, whereas for sets close to coastal habitat the diversity was lower and fairly constant with distance. Higher probability of capture and higher number of fish caught were detected for some shark, billfish, tuna, and other by-catch species. The study supports hypotheses that <b>seamounts</b> may be areas of special interest for management for marine pelagic predators...|$|R
5|$|<b>Seamounts</b> {{are often}} found in groupings or {{submerged}} archipelagos, a classic example being the Emperor <b>Seamounts,</b> {{an extension of the}} Hawaiian Islands. Formed millions of years ago by volcanism, they have since subsided far below sea level. This long chain of islands and <b>seamounts</b> extends thousands of kilometers northwest from the island of Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|The Northeast Canyons and <b>Seamounts</b> Marine National Monument {{is located}} within the New England and mid-Atlantic regions, 130 miles {{southeast}} of Cape Cod. It comprises a total area of 4,913 square miles, and protects several underwater <b>seamounts</b> (Bear, Mytilus, Physalia, and Retriever <b>Seamounts)</b> and three submarine canyons in {{the edge of the}} continental shelf (Oceanographer, Lydonia, and Gilbert).|$|R
