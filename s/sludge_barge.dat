[...] For {{the last four months}} of 2014, of the 90 times the bridge was opened, 75 were to provide service to the <b>sludge</b> <b>barge.</b> The bridge has caused numerous delays in train service in order to allow for river service, though Amtrak does not keep specific records of delays.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Apparent sewage <b>sludge</b> disposal by <b>barge</b> has been detected approximately 12 miles offshore {{in an area}} with an approximate radius of 2. 5 nautical miles. Verification is underway to determine whether this dumping is within one of the approved dump sites in the Bight. Analysis of all available historical and routine meteorological data in correlation with the observed phenomenon is necessary before final conclusions can be reached {{with respect to the}} effects of currents on the disposal of dumped wastes. Four effluent plumes emanating from the shoreline just south of Sandy Hook were observed and are moving in a southerly direction. Another plume is evident north of Barnegat Inlet and is moving almost directly offshore. This suggests that the more northerly plumes are {{under the influence of the}} tidal regime around New York Harbor much more than are the plumes further south along the New Jersey coast. Of further interest are what appear to be an internal wave phenomena approximately 75 miles east of the New Jersey coast. This same sort of phenomena has been observed repetitively off the coast of Oregon...|$|R
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{describes the}} water quality of New York Bight as measured by temperature, light, salinity, dissolved oxygen, various nitrogen and phosphorus forms, pH, heavy metals, coliform bacteria, and phytoplankton chlorophyll. Major water quality monitoring in the Bight, initiated in 1948, has been sporadic in the past with gaps from 3 to 10 years when no major sampling was conducted. These data indicate that bottom dissolved oxygen percent saturation levels in the disposal areas of the apex have decreased from 67 % in 1949 to 30 % in 1974. Surface total iron concentrations in the apex have increased from 20 u/l in 1949 to about 90 u/l in 1969, and are higher than background open ocean levels. Coliform bacterial influence appears to be confined to an area of 3. 2 to 4. 8 km (2 to 3 mi) radius from the discharge point of a sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>barge</b> dump. Nitrogen is generally the more important nutrient relative to phosphorus with respect to limiting phytoplankton growth in the Bight. Manâ€™s impact on {{the water quality}} of the region appears to be significant with more than 50 % of the total input of iron, copper, cadmium, chromium, suspended solids, and total phosphorus attributed to barge discharges alone. An overall analysis of New York Bight to quantitatively assess the relative impact of the major discharges is recommended...|$|E
