50|$|In the United States, the 2-10-2 type was {{produced}} between 1903 and 1930. The first were the Atchison, Topeka and <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Railway (AT&SF) <b>engines</b> of the 900 and 1600 series, which were an early type with few advantages over the 2-10-0 Decapod, save {{their ability to}} operate in reverse without derailing. By 1919, the AT&SF was building the definitive type, with the trailing truck supporting a large firebox. These were of the AT&SF 3800 class. One of them, AT&SF engine no. 3829, was equipped with an experimental two-axle trailing truck {{to become the first}} 2-10-4 Texas type.|$|R
50|$|The first Decapods {{built for}} the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1867 proved too rough on the track because of their long coupled wheelbase, so one pair of drivers were removed. No more {{followed}} for 19 years, until the Northern Pacific Railway bought two for use on the switchbacks over Stampede Pass, while the 2 mi tunnel was being built. In low-speed service where high tractive effort was critical, these Decapods were successful. Small numbers of other Decapods were built over the next twenty years, mostly for service in steeply graded mountainous areas where power at low speeds was the requirement. The type did not prove as popular as the successful Consolidation (2-8-0) type. Among Decapod users was the Atchison, Topeka and <b>Santa</b> <b>Fe</b> Railway. The <b>engines</b> were tandem compounds but their ongoing reversing limitations became {{the genesis of the}} 2-10-2 wheel arrangement.|$|R
