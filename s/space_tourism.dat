40|$|Abstract: Understanding {{the spatial}} {{dimensions}} of tourism {{is one of}} the core challenges for geographers involved in tourism studies. The aim in this paper is to pursue a geographical analysis of uneven patterns of tourism in South Africa and specifically to unpack the key trends observed in the country‟s <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> economy. The analysis is conducted between three groupings of municipalities as destinations or <b>tourism</b> <b>spaces.</b> These three groups are demarcated as the metropolitan areas, the rural spaces of the priority district municipalities, and what is called the intermediate space of the remaining non-priority district municipalities. The findings show the dominance of South Africa‟s <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> economy by the metropolitan areas. In addition, the analysis shows these three different <b>tourism</b> <b>spaces</b> exhibit different trajectories in terms of growth performance (numbers of trips, bednights and visitor spend), origin of visitors (domestic versus international) and purpose of travel (leisure, business, VFR and other). Interpreting the characteristics of these <b>tourism</b> <b>spaces</b> is an essential first step for improved local tourism planning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Within {{the vibrant}} and {{expanding}} body of tourism scholarship around peripheral regions, there are limited geographical studies on locational issues. Notwithstanding a substantive contribution by geographers to understanding {{a cross-section of}} tourism issues the need exists to ‘re-spatialize’ our understanding of tourism patterns in peripheral areas. It is against this backdrop {{that the purpose of}} this paper is to build upon recent analyses of South Africa’s <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> economy and investigate the location of ‘less visited tourism spaces’ in the country. Situated within an international literature on peripheral tourism this analysis reviews a range of indicators concerning less visited <b>tourism</b> <b>spaces</b> in South Africa. The focus is explicitly upon identifying the most marginal and in many respects most ‘off the tourism map’ local municipalities in South Africa as a counterpoint to previous works that identify across a range of similar indicators the most significant and leading <b>spaces</b> for <b>tourism</b> development. Overall, the paper represents a contribution both to an evolving South African scholarship on tourism geography, as well as to an expanding international literature around peripheral <b>tourism</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Published in: Origin Spatial Development of Contemporary Poland in Łódź University Geographical Research, {{edited by}} T. MarszałThe study of <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> {{as a whole}} has become the domain of tourism geographers. As a matter of fact, it can be put forward that <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> as a {{functionally}} distinctive part of geographical space (Liszewski 1995) is the basic object of study in this discipline. Due to their comprehensive approach to the problem, geographers are best prepared for studying spatial phenomena such as tourism. The original features of <b>tourism</b> <b>space,</b> distinguishing it from other functional spaces, should be reflected on. In this case, the first things that come to mind include hospitality, organisation, safety etc. (Kaczmarek J. et al. 2008, 2010, Kaczmarek S. and Kaczmarek J. 2011). Due {{to the fact that they}} are difficult to define and study, these features have not been thoroughly discussed in academic publications. <b>Tourism</b> <b>space</b> as a particular “complex construction” should undergo a dual analysis. One aspect is a structural study of (with the use of the “planes” described above) its constituents. There has been a lot of research into tourism assets and attractions, tourism management (infrastructure) and tourism, which allow researchers to delimit and define some of its characteristic features. However, only studying the relations among space constituents will let us fully define the nature of <b>tourism</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{presented}} thesis {{is to identify}} <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> of the students of Geography of Tourism and Tourism and Recreation at Polish universities and to determine the relation between this space and the demographic characteristics of respondents, their place of study (city, university), program of studies, {{as well as their}} place of origin and permanent residence. In order to achieve that objective three hypotheses were formulated: 1. 	<b>Tourism</b> <b>space</b> of surveyed students is diverse and highly dependent on the university, at which they study. This is influenced by geographic location of university and by programme of studies conducted there. 2. 	Places and regions known from obligatory field trips included in study programmes are more often visited by students during their tourist trips and better rated than other regions. 3. 	The perception of the city, in which respondents study depends on their place of origin and permanent residence. People who study in their hometown have lesser knowledge of its <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> than incomers. The subject of this research were students of the last year of second degree studies (both full-time and part-time) of Geography of Tourism or Tourism and Recreation, conducted in 16 selected Polish universities: 9 classical universities, 3 universities of physical education (AWFs), 3 pedagogical universities and 1 university of economics. Those universities were located in 11 cities – Bydgoszcz, Kraków, Kielce, Lublin, Łódź, Poznań, Słupsk, Szczecin, Warszawa, Wrocław. Above-mentioned universities were deliberately chosen in order to determine whether there is a differentiation between various types of schools in terms of students’ <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> and profiles of education. The main research methods were based on questionnaires and analysis of source materials (e. g. programmes of studies offered in surveyed universities). As a result it was found that, as for the models of tourism, among surveyed students of Geography of Tourism and Tourism and Recreation from various types of universities there were significant differences. Furthermore, study programmes were different, which resulted from, inter alia, the location of the studies in the organizational structure of universities, as well as from historical factors. Hence it can be stated that – despite conducting similar courses of study – various types of universities offer diverse approach to the field of tourism. The respondents were generally actively involved in tourism (both domestic and foreign). They organized their trips on their own, but in terms of reception places and form of tourism activities, their journeys did not go beyond the standard offers of travel agencies. The most active in terms of tourism were students from classical universities and university of economics, to a lesser extent – those from universities of physical education; the least active were respondents from pedagogical universities. Regarding the perception of <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> of Poland, in students’ opinion the most attractive regions were: Baltic coast (especially Gdańsk Bay), lake districts (especially Masurian Lake Dirtrict) and in southern parts of the country: the Sudetes, the Cracow-Silesian Upland, the Tatras, Pieniny and Bieszczady Mountains. It was also found that certain regions of Poland can be defined as non-touristic in terms of students’s trips and their perception of <b>tourism</b> <b>space,</b> as they represent terra incognita of respondents’ <b>tourism</b> <b>space.</b> This problem affected in particular three provinces: Łódź, Masovian and Opole voivodeships. The results of empirical studies allowed to confirm hypotheses 1 st and 2 nd, regarding the differentiation of respondents’ <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> and the factors of such differentiation. Hence it can be stated that the universities that conduct studies in the field of geography of tourism/tourism and recreation are the creators of their students’ <b>tourism</b> <b>space,</b> both direct (places of obligatory field trips) and non-direct – as they influence students’ perception of <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> as well as their choices of tourist destinations. The third hypothesis can be confirmed only partially. Studies have shown that the perception of urban <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> indeed depends on the place of origin. However, the relationship is opposite than assumed – people who study in their hometown have a better knowledge of its <b>tourism</b> <b>space</b> and have a better opinion about it than incomers...|$|R
