In addition to figures showing the comparison between reinvested and repatriated profits, as well as the way in which such indicators vary e. g. in case of abnormal business conditions (global economy collapse), we try to show that lack/misuse of transfer pricing regulations may generate even more disequilibrium, the MNEs using <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> as an additional way of repatriating non-taxable/low tax profits...|$|R

However, if for services or tangible assets, the comparison of the transfer price to the market one is relatively easy to achieve, for the intangible ones, quantifying future benefits waived by the affiliated person compared to the situation in which it would be independent is harder to be established. ...|$|R

40|$|Investments and {{business}} profits are internationally mobile. Countries respond by tackling international profit shifting. As a result, the international allocation of taxable profits becomes an increasingly complex and costly issue.

This paper investigates cash flow as a tax base. A business cash flow tax abolishes current accrual accounting and {{has the potential to}} block international profit shifting. Financing vanishes to become a tax-planning tool because the investments’ market return is tax free under a cash flow tax.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss how the {{corporate}} groups of manufacturers in Japan shifted their strategy through the Japanese Accounting Big Bang. The paper preliminarily explains the pattern of business ties in Japan and overviews their history. There existed a kind of conglomerate called zaibatsu and there exist three types of business ties in Japanese economic society: corporate group, business complex and keiretsu. This paper concentrates on the corporate group. A corporate group is a pattern of business ties in which a core (parent) company and its subsidiaries form a business group. Japanese established manufacturers actually extended their businesses as corporate groups. This paper first explains how they succeeded internationally as a corporate group. They produced and sold the goods efficiently and effectively with the advantage of <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions,</b> and they accumulated profits on the core companies' accounts. Afterwards it discusses the effect of globalization and the Japanese Accounting Big Bang on the management of corporate groups.

These effects put pressure on the Japanese manufacturers to change their strategies...|$|R

Whilst these transitional issues are less of a concern to Japanese companies, in the absence of existing rules permitting the transfer of tax attributes, a Japanese surtax of 2 per cent over {{the first two years of}} consolidation has to be weighed against the apparent benefits of the regime. A comparison of the two regimes also reveals a very different approach to the treatment on consolidation of inherent gains and losses...|$|R

The required changes to the Belgian Corporate Law that follow from this law can mainly be subdivided into three main topics: the structure and working of the administrative bodies, the role and position of the controllers of the accounts and the refinement of the rules concerning the working of the general assembly. As to the management, many are arguing that the one-tier-board obliged in Belgium is no longer realistic and that, as such, the way should be cleared for a two-tier-board management structure. Moreover, the responsibility of the managers should be sharpened, by obliging them to pinpoint a representative in case the manager would be an artificial person. Further, the rules with respect to <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> should be refined and cleared up. These rules build on the prescriptions concerning interest conflicts. Finally, the working rules concerning the general assembly of the shareholders have been adapted in order to indulge the needs of the international shareholders.

40|$|Under IAS 24 {{a related}} party {{transaction}} (RPT) is a ‘transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties, {{regardless of whether}} a price is charged’ (IASB 2009). In particular, it refers to those transactions that the firm engages with its subsidiaries, parent company, associates, managers, directors and majority shareholders, {{as well as their}} close relatives. The academic literature suggests at least three perspectives to interpret these transactions: (1) the conflict of interest perspective, considering the RPTs as potentially harmful for corporate outsiders (minority shareholders and creditors), (2) the efficient transactions perspective, for which RPTs may benefit the firm and its outsiders, (3) the contingencies perspective, arguing {{that it can not be}} said a priori that RPTs are harmful or efficient, as this would depend on the organizational context and institutional environment where such transactions are concluded. Following the contingency perspective and supported by the literature review, the article proposes to consider the interest of the business group and the directing activity of parent company for the interpretation of RPTs. Considering the interest of the group means interpreting <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> not as isolated transactions, as usually done by empirical studies, but in a wider perspective: that of the group. A multiple case study analyses on three Italian pyramidal groups will be presented in order to show how and why the interest of the group and the directing activity of parent company are important in the interpretation of RPTs...|$|R
40|$|Groups of {{companies}} {{have become the}} prevailing form of European large-sized firms. Differently from the German law regarding this subject, that developed a global and autonomous set of rules, according to the principles drafted at the European level, the Italian company law has chosen to develop only specific rules about groups {{of companies}}, especially oriented (i) to prevent {{the risk that the}} parent company could carry out the activity of management and co-ordination of the group in its own interest, or in the interest of another business and in violation of the one of the subsidiaries and, in any case, (ii) to restore the damages suffered by the minority shareholders of the latter depending on an unfair exercise of this power of control and management. In this work the Author underlines that the Italian rules, introduced in 2003, have to be considered a good starting point in the perspective of the protection of minority shareholders against <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> that could harm the value of their investment, although they are not completely satisfactory. The aim of the Italian law is, indeed, oriented only to protect the mi- nority shareholders of the subsidiary companies, forgetting that the same need of protection exists with regards to the minority shareholders of the parent company, who could be harmed in the same way through this type of transaction. The paper shows how the ordinary rules and remedies provided by company law are not sufficient to achieve this goal and identifies the measures that would be advisable to adopt...|$|R
40|$|In a group structure, {{individual}} companies comprising a {{group are}} effectively managed {{as a single}} 'economic unit'. The economic unit concept refers {{to a group of}} companies that are collectively integrated on a financial, an organisational or an economic basis by virtue of common control, so that they are working towards a common purpose or goal. The South African income tax dispensation currently makes no provision for group taxation. Each legal entity within a group is taxed as a separate taxpayer. This study aims to evaluate whether {{there is a need for}} a system of group taxation in South Africa. In order to do so, the definition of a group was considered, the different tax treatment of divisions as opposed to a group structure were investigated, the current income tax dispensation for inter-group transactions was analysed, and anomalies arising from that were highlighted. The recommendations of the Katz Commission in its Third Interim Report, which addressed the issue of group taxation, were also examined to determine whether the report supports the implementation of a system of group taxation in South Africa. The impact of a system of group taxation for meeting the requirements of the canons of taxation, as well as the implications for the fiscus and the taxpayer, were also examined. The analyses and the conclusions clearly show that the status quo with regard to the inherent tax anomalies arising from the taxation of <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions</b> is unsustainable, and that a system of group taxation should be implemented in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{transfer}} pricing arises where companies are divisionalised and have responsibility centres operating as strategic business units. This {{kind of situation}} {{is associated with the}} challenge of determining suitable prices for <b>intra-group</b> <b>transactions.</b> The transfer pricing problem becomes even more critical where a company has subsidiaries spread around the world especially in countries that have varying tax rates. Under this situation, it is common for multinational companies to attempt to minimise their tax liabilities by shifting profits from higher tax countries to lower tax regimes. Of course tax authorities {{all over the world are}} not comfortable with this kind of arrangement. Thus efforts are being made like what the FIRS is doing in Nigeria to stop it. The issue of transfer pricing as it relates to financial reporting is usually associated with uncertain tax positions in terms of the extent to which tax reserves may need to be recorded due to uncertainty with respect to tax return position. Transfer pricing has income tax consequences which of course, is more pronounced when the parties to a transaction are taxed in different jurisdictions. So it is really a problem for multinational companies and governments all over the world. Therefore, this study was carried out to examine the impact of transfer pricing on financial reporting. And it was gathered that governments and multinational companies in Nigerian and those of other developing countries world over are constrained by the required resources to be able to effectively implement transfer pricing. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended that appropriate transfer prices be established for intra-group and/or intra-firm transfer of goods, intangibles and services...|$|R

Whereas affiliates of those groups that attract foreign institutional investment are no more difficult to monitor than are unaffiliated firms, we find that group affiliation reduces the likelihood of foreign institutional investment. More transparent groups (where greater transparency is proxied for by a lower incidence of <b>intra-group</b> financial <b>transactions)</b> {{are more likely to}} attract such investment.

Generally, the operational business restructuring process follows one of the business model globally developed, namely manufacturer or sales business models. Thus, according to the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed, the entities within the group are labeled into limited risk units (such as toll manufacturer or commission agent), medium risk (contract manufacturer, commissionaire, stripped distributor) or high risk units (fully fledged manufacturer, fully fledged distributor). Notwithstanding the above, there should be emphasized that the operational business restructuring has to be undertaken with maximal care, as it might have important fiscal impact.

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{is highly}} common, and is most frequently observed in individuals with hypertension and structural cardiac disease. Sympathetic hyperactivity plays a fundamental {{role in the}} progression, maintenance and aggravation of arrhythmia. Endurance exercise training clearly lowers sympathetic activity in sympathoexcitatory disease states, and is well-tolerated by patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: We assessed 50 CKD patients with hypertension. Each patient provided a complete medical history and underwent a physical examination. We used an implantable cardiac monitor over a 3 -year follow-up period to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate exercise (ModEx) physical activity protocols on AF occurrence, and determined the effectiveness of these protocols in improving renal function. Subjects were followed up every 6 months after the beginning of the intervention. Results: During the 3 -year follow-up, AF onset was higher in CKD patients who engaged in HIIT (72 %) than in those who engaged in ModEx (24 %) (hazard ratio, 3. 847; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 694 – 8. 740, P = 0. 0013 by log-rank test).
