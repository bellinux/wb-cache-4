5|$|Andrea Martin {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Apu's mother, recording her part in New York City. She {{wanted to get the}} voice perfect, so in between takes <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the flashback to Apu's childhood, the animators made sure not to show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

A deluxe version of Joyas Prestadas: Pop was released on August 28, 2012 which contains a DVD of her performing the album live at the Teatro de la Ciudad in Mexico City, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. She {{felt that it was}} more about ecstasy, especially a sexual one, and how it related to religious ecstasy. <b>She</b> <b>listened</b> to the song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
5|$|<b>She</b> <b>listened</b> to {{recordings}} of Balkan folk {{music as a}} child and became interested in the tradition. Later, she sang in and directed a Slavic chorus while an undergraduate at Yale University.

5|$|While at high school, Levi {{decided that}} she would become a scientist. Her final year was devoted to a physics project on spectra and photography, which became her Oberreal Abiturium. She was the only girl in her class to major in physics that year. After her {{graduation}} in April 1928, her father sent her to England for six months to learn English and good manners. She entered the University of Munich in 1929, where <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. For her doctorate, her father managed to get her accepted into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, where she wrote her thesis on the spectra of alkali metal halides, {{under the supervision of}} Peter Pringsheim and Fritz Haber.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

At age ten, she moved with her parents and younger sister, Laura, to the suburb of Levittown, New York.|$|E
25|$|Songs {{and music}} were a natural {{extension}} of this interest in words and {{her love of}} music began early in life as <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to her father, Walter Pendleton Stringfellow, sing. She had access to a scrapbook of folk songs collected by her grandmother, Rosalie Cope Stringfellow. She began her music career collecting folksongs and performing them, first with her husband Jim in the late 1950s, then later on her own. It was during this time that the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded Rosalie and Jim performing her collection of traditional songs. Many of these have been released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in various compilation albums throughout the last fifty years.|$|E
25|$|On the April 29 show, {{the five}} {{remaining}} contestants each sang two songs. Diverting from their usual format, due to time constraints, the judges' critiques after each performance were instead to be bundled until after both songs were performed. However, {{after the first}} round had finished, host Ryan Seacrest asked for comments, and judge Paula Abdul, in discussing Jason Castro, delivered feedback on his second song before he had performed it. This has led to speculation that the show is scripted or rigged. The next day, Abdul claimed on Seacrest's radio show that <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to the performance in rehearsal and in the rushed atmosphere of the show was confused and thought she was supposed to critique both.|$|E

25|$|Joan Sutherland {{was born}} to Scottish parents in Sydney, Australia, and {{attended}} St Catherine's School in the suburb of Waverley, New South Wales. As a child, <b>she</b> <b>listened</b> to and imitated her mother's singing exercises.
