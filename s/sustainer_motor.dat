50|$|The AA.20 was command guided, using {{a similar}} system {{to that used}} by Nord's {{anti-tank}} missiles, with the missile being steered visually from the launching aircraft. Angled, fixed wings imparted a steady roll rate, while a gyroscope provided information on {{the orientation of the}} missile to the control mechanism. At launch, a twin solid rocket booster fired to bring the missile up to speed, after which a single solid-fueled sustainer rocket maintained speed following burnout of the booster. Four interrupter blades, placed around the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor's</b> nozzle, provided steering, while a flare mounted on the rear of the missile aided in visual tracking for guidance.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} sized {{to match the}} {{diameter}} of the Apollo spacecraft service module and to suit the length of the Algol rocket motors. Aerodynamic fins were sized to assure that the vehicle was inherently stable. The structural design was based on a gross weight of 220,000 pounds (100,000 kg), of which 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg) was payload. The structure was also designed for sequential firing with a possible 10-second overlap of four first-stage and three second-stage <b>sustainer</b> <b>motors.</b> <b>Sustainer</b> thrust was provided by Algol solid-propellant motors. Versatility of performance was achieved by varying the number and firing sequence of the primary motors (capability of up to seven) required to perform the mission. Recruit rocket motors were used for booster motors as required to supplement lift-off thrust.|$|R

50|$|In {{an unusual}} move, in 1986 Euromissile offered a single-round ground-launched system for HOT missile called ATLAS (Affut de Tir Leger Au Sol - which {{approximately}} translates as light ground-firing mount) for installation on smaller unarmored vehicles, like the Jeep or Land Rover. The object was to field an antitank weapon that long-range patrols {{could use to}} engage heavy armor beyond {{the range of the}} tank's main cannon. The ATLAS is similar to the TOW mounted on various four-wheel-drive light vehicles. But unlike the TOW light vehicle mount, there is a shield to protect the gunner against the HOT's booster and <b>sustainer</b> <b>motors,</b> which are both burning as they exit the container. The vehicle mounting the ATLAS is expected to carry a mix of both HOT missiles with antitank warheads and the HOT with the multi-purpose warhead.|$|R
50|$|Norfolk {{was first}} {{commissioned}} on 7 March 1970 and {{was present at}} Portsmouth Navy Days. In 1972 Norfolk began a refit to replace 'B' turret with four Exocet launchers. She was thus the first Royal Navy warship to be armed with the Exocet missile system. She also became the first warship to carry three independent missile systems: Exocet, Sea Cat and Sea Slug. Norfolk recommissioned in 1974. She had a displacement of 5,450 tons and was quite a large ship, considering she was classified as a destroyer. She undertook numerous deployments to the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and South Pacific Ocean. By the mid-1970s {{it was clear that}} the Mk 2 Sea Slug did not represent a significant improvement over the earlier version, because it was even less reliable and attempts to develop successful <b>sustainer</b> <b>motors</b> had failed. There was only money to fit new computer command and control to the three other second group County class, so Norfolk was reduced to increasingly marginal and third line roles.|$|R
50|$|Even as Nike Ajax {{was being}} tested, work started on Nike-B, later renamed Nike Hercules (MIM-14). It {{improved}} speed, range and accuracy, and could intercept ballistic missiles. The Hercules had {{a range of}} about 100 miles (160 km), a top speed in excess of 3,000 mph (4,800 km/h) and a maximum altitude of around 150,000 ft (30 km). It had solid fuel boost and <b>sustainer</b> rocket <b>motors.</b> The boost phase was four of the Nike Ajax boosters strapped together. In the electronics, some vacuum tubes were replaced with more reliable solid-state components.|$|R

50|$|The missile steers using four metal vanes {{around the}} exhaust nozzle in a thrust {{vectoring}} system that directs {{the thrust of}} the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> exhaust nozzle. Steering signals are sent to the missile by means of two wires which pay out from two spools on the rear of the missile. A gas-operated arming mechanism is fed from the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor,</b> arming the warhead 7.7 seconds after launch.|$|E
5000|$|When {{launched}} the missile is propelled from the launch tube at around 72 {{meters per second}} by a gas generator {{at the rear of}} the launch tube. Once the missile is clear of the launch tube the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> engages and accelerates the missile to a speed of 250 meters per second. Once the missile is about 400 meters from the launcher, the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> cuts out and the missile continues in free flight.|$|E
50|$|The Faustpatrone {{was much}} smaller in {{physical}} appearance than the better known Panzerfaust. Development of the Faustpatrone {{started in the}} summer of 1942 at the German company HASAG with the development of a smaller prototype called Gretchen ("little Greta") by a team headed by Dr. Heinrich Langweiler in Leipzig. The basic concept was that of a recoilless gun; neither the Faustpatrone, nor its successor the Panzerfaust were rockets, because the round design, like those fired by grenade launchers, didn't feature a <b>sustainer</b> rocket <b>motor</b> that ignited after it left the launcher.|$|R
50|$|Contraves Italiana, an Italian {{subsidiary}} of the Swiss armaments company Oerlikon Contraves began development of a short-ranged (10 km) ship-based anti-ship missile system, named Nettuno in 1963. Guidance of Nettuno was by beam riding for course control, with altitude controlled automatically by an onboard radar altimeter, allowing the missile to carry out sea-skimming attacks. Command guidance was an alternative guidance method if jamming made the beam-riding method unusable. Contraves Italiana began work on an improved missile, Vulcano in 1965, this having the same guidance system, but with a two-stage (booster + <b>sustainer)</b> rocket <b>motor</b> to give a longer (25 km) range. Both missiles could be fired from a five-round trainable launcher.|$|R
50|$|The first {{launch of}} the missile was {{conducted}} in November 1962, revealing problems with the liquid-fueled <b>sustainer</b> rocket <b>motor.</b> Concurrently with R-25 testing in 1962, the SFRY acquired S-75 Dvina (Russian: С-75; NATO reporting name SA-2 Guideline), missile systems from the Soviet Union. Because of this, {{at the end of}} 1964 the decision was made that, after twelve missiles had been produced, work on the project was to be abandoned. However, the knowledge and experience gained on this project and its material basis were incorporated into other projects that have been implemented and introduced into the production of armament for the Yugoslav People's Army (YPA).|$|R
50|$|Once {{the missile}} is {{five and a}} half meters away from the gunner, c. 0.3 seconds after leaving the launch tube, it {{activates}} the rocket <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor.</b> The <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> takes it to a velocity of 430 meters per second, and sustains it at this speed. Once it reaches peak speed, at a distance of around 120 meters from the gunner, the final safety mechanism is disabled and the missile is fully armed. All told, the booster burns for 0.5 second and the driving engine for another 2.0 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most antitank missiles, {{in which}} the booster burns {{completely}} before leaving the container and then the missile coasts a safe distance before the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> ignites, the HOT's booster burns both inside the container and outside the container for approximately one second giving the missile a high speed. The <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> burns for 17 seconds, a flight time whose path exceeds {{the length of the}} trailing wires which dictate the maximum range of the missile. Because of the more powerful booster and <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> that burns during its complete flight, the HOT missile had a much shorter flight time than any other wire guided antitank missiles when it was introduced. The booster's four nozzles are located at the roots of the four spring out fins. The sustainer motor's single exhaust is located {{in the rear of the}} missile body, where a vane controls the missile through thrust vector control as it rotates in flight.|$|E
50|$|Launched {{from any}} 120 mm mortar, Strix has a normal range {{of up to}} 4.5 km. With the {{addition}} of a special <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor,</b> however, range can be increased to 7.5 km.|$|E
5000|$|The Panzerfaust (lit. [...] "armor fist" [...] or [...] "tank fist", plural: Panzerfäuste) is an inexpensive, single shot, {{recoilless}} German {{anti-tank weapon}} of World War II. It {{consists of a}} small, disposable pre-loaded launch tube firing a high-explosive anti-tank warhead, and {{was intended to be}} operated by a single soldier. The Panzerfaust's direct ancestor was the similar, smaller-warhead Faustpatrone ordnance device. The Panzerfaust was in use from 1943 {{until the end of the}} war.The weapon's concepts played an important part in the development of the later Russian RPG weapon systems such as the RPG-2. Most notably, the RPG-7 added a <b>sustainer</b> rocket <b>motor</b> to the grenade.|$|R
5000|$|Fife was {{the first}} and only British warship to bear the name, for county Fife. She was a Mk2 Guided Missile Destroyer (GMD, also {{referred}} to pre-1975 by its then US Navy/NATO designator DLG (Large Destroyer (USN 'Frigate') carrying long range surface to air missiles for area defence; post-1975 DDG, 'destroyer' with similar characteristics). The Mk2 designator refers to her primary armament, the Seaslug Mk2 missile. The weapon had begun development in the early fifties and entered service in the Mk1 GMDs like [...] By modern standards the Seaslug is a huge missile with one <b>sustainer</b> rocket <b>motor</b> and 4 disposable boosters. The missile was a so-called 'beam rider'. It was launched from a huge rail launcher in the stern and boosted into the guidance beam from the fire direction radar which pointed at the target, a high altitude supersonic attack aircraft. Once in the beam the missile would fly at supersonic speed to the target where a proximity fuze would detect the target and detonate the continuous rod warhead.|$|R
50|$|The HOT missile is tube-launched and {{optically}} tracked {{using the}} SACLOS guidance system with command link through trailing wires which steers the missile using thrust vector {{controls on the}} <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> during the missile's flight. When the gunner fires the HOT missile, the missile activates a thermal battery, flares and a small gas generator spins up the gyro. The same gases for the gyro pop the covers off {{both ends of the}} cylindrical container the HOT missile comes packed in. Moments later, both the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> and the booster are fired, ejecting the missile from the container.|$|E
50|$|A beyond-visual-range missile (BVR) is an {{air-to-air missile}} (BVRAAM) that {{is capable of}} {{engaging}} at ranges of 20 nmi km or beyond. This range has been achieved using dual pulse rocket motors or booster rocket motor and ramjet <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since 1949 National Electric was {{involved}} in classified research and development contracts for the government, resulted {{in the production of}} rockets and guided missiles jato and <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> bodies for the U.S. missiles and rockets, particularly for the Nike family of guided missiles.|$|E
50|$|Little Joe II was a single-stage, {{solid-propellant rocket}} which used a booster motor {{developed}} for the Recruit rocket, and a <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> {{developed for the}} Algol stage of the Scout rocket family. It could fly with a variable number of booster and sustainer motors, but all were contained within a single airframe.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail unit}} is loaded {{first with the}} {{necessary}} propelling charges (up to eight increments), then the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> (if required) and finally, the programmed projectile. A hand-held programming unit {{is connected to the}} projectile by cable prior to loading to feed in flight time before seeker activation, and with allowances for terminal phase ballistic conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The missile has a {{distinctive}} bulging nose and four clipped triangular wings. The missile has two {{solid fuel rocket}} motors. One is a powerful booster rocket that burns for 2.2 seconds and the second, is a <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> that burns for 28 seconds. The booster motor exhausts through two nozzles on the sides near {{the trailing edge of}} the wings [...] and the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> exhaust is located in the missile rear at the center. The wings are positioned at an angle of one degree to the direction of flight so that the missile spins, giving it stability. Two rearward-facing flares which ignite on launch make the missile more visible to the operator during flight. Two flares are mounted {{on the opposite side of}} the booster nozzles between the wings so as not to interfere with the two guidance wires spooling out of the rear section of the missile.|$|E
50|$|Its rocket motor, {{which is}} fuelled by solid propellant, gives the Exocet a maximum range of 70 km. It was {{replaced}} on the Block 3 MM40 ship-launched {{version of the}} missile with a solid-propellant booster and a turbojet <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> which extends {{the range of the}} missile to more than 180 km. The submarine-launched version places the missile inside a launch capsule.|$|E
50|$|The gunner {{tracks the}} target visually, until the missile locks onto the target, {{indicating}} this {{with both a}} flashing light and an audio tone. The gunner then provides target lead and depresses the trigger all the way. This triggers the booster section of the missile, which projects the missile a safe distance away from the operator before the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> ignites.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{is fired}} from the M171 missile launcher. First the seeker is cooled to {{operating}} temperature and then the operator begins to visually track the target using the sight unit on the launcher. Once the target is locked onto by the missile a buzzer in the launcher hand grip begins vibrating, alerting the operator. The operator then presses the trigger, which fires the initial booster stage and launches the missile out of the tube at a speed of around 80 feet per second (25 m/s). As the missile leaves the tube spring-loaded fins pop out, four stabilizing tail fins {{at the back of}} the missile, and two control surfaces at the front of the missile. Once the missile has travelled six meters, the <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> ignites. The <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> takes the missile to its peak velocity of Mach 1.7 in 5.8 seconds. 1.25 seconds after the sustainer is ignited, the warhead is armed.|$|E
50|$|The Seaslug Mark 1 was {{powered by}} the solid-fuel Foxhound <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> and Gosling booster motors. It had a radio {{proximity}} fuze and 200 lb blast warhead.The Mark 1 was a beam rider missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, a glider pilot license {{allows the}} pilot to fly {{unpowered}} gliders, self-launching motor gliders (including motor gliders and gliders with retractable engines or propellers), and <b>sustainer</b> <b>motor</b> gliders. An instructor must provide instruction and sign the logbook {{of the pilot}} to authorize the pilot to carry passengers. In Canada, motor gliders are classified as gliders, and may be operated by a glider pilot without the medical certificate required to operate an airplane.|$|E
50|$|The missile was a {{multi-stage}} solid fuelled rocket. It {{had four}} small control surfaces, resembling paddles, in the nose, six fins at the after {{end of the}} top stage, and four {{at the end of}} the main stage. It stood 6.3 m tall, with a diameter of 54 cm.
