Meteorologists created the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on weather maps.

A computer draws a <b>station</b> <b>model</b> for each observation location. The <b>station</b> <b>model</b> is primarily used on surface-weather maps, but {{can also be used to}} show the weather aloft.

5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a <b>station</b> <b>model.</b> The circle in the middle of the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> to fit a number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|<b>Station</b> <b>model</b> plots use {{a mixture}} of metric and Imperial units {{depending}} on the map's location and what is being shown. Surface maps in the United States primarily use Imperial units, such as inches, degrees Fahrenheit, and knots. Most of the world, however, uses metric measurements for everything but wind speed, which is shown in knots.|$|E

5|$|To left {{of center}} in the <b>station</b> <b>model,</b> the {{temperature}} and dew point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts.|$|E
25|$|The first layout in {{the space}} was started in July 1962, with the framing and scenery built before the track was laid, and the first spike driven on August 30, 1962. This layout was 27 by 55 feet in size, and was of a {{double-track}} folded dogbone design, built with traditional square tabletop framing, plaster scenery, and relay control. Eventually it grew to have over 4000 linear feet of track, in both standard and 3-foot gauges, with some dual gauge mixed in. It existed through to January 1999, when it was torn down due to growing problems with accessibility and electrical characteristics. Many of the original structures and switches have been saved, for eventual inclusion on the new layout. Most notable of these is a 1940s train <b>station</b> <b>model</b> which had previously been salvaged from the layout at the PMRC location on Chestnut Street.|$|E

The visibility itself is shown as a number, in statute miles in the United States and meters elsewhere, describing how far the observer can see at that time. This number is located to {{the left of}} the present weather symbol. For pilots, knowledge of the horizontal visibility helps determine if they are flying through instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as foggy or smoky conditions, as well as areas of intense precipitation.

500|$|When {{analyzing}} {{a weather}} map, a <b>station</b> <b>model</b> is plotted at each point of observation. Within the <b>station</b> <b>model,</b> the temperature, dewpoint, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The {{circle in the}} middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of overcast. Outside the United States, temperature and dewpoint are plotted in degrees Celsius. The wind barb points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents [...] of wind, each half flag represents [...] When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each [...] of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted {{in the corner of}} the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> are in [...] inches. The international standard rainfall measurement unit is the millimeter. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing isobars (lines of equal pressure), isallobars (lines of equal pressure change), isotherms (lines of equal temperature), and isotachs (lines of equal wind speed) are drawn. The abstract weather symbols were devised to take up the least room possible on weather maps.|$|E

500|$|Above {{or below}} the circle for manned {{stations}} (automatic stations do not report cloud types) that indicates sky cover can lie one or more symbols indicating cloud types {{in any of the}} low, middle, and high-étages for tropospheric clouds. One predominant cloud type may be depicted for each of three étages, if known. The middle and high-étage types are depicted above the sky cover circle of the <b>station</b> <b>model,</b> while the main low-étage cloud type is indicated below the circle. Since the <b>station</b> <b>model</b> has limited room, it makes no special provision for vertical or multi-level clouds that can occupy more than one étage at a particular time. [...] Consequently, cloud genera with significant vertical development may be coded and plotted as low or middle depending on the altitude at which they normally form. Cumulus and cumulonimbus usually form in the low étage of the troposphere and achieve vertical extent by growing upward into the middle or high étage. Conversely, nimbostratus usually forms in the middle étage of the troposphere and becomes vertically developed by growing downward into the low étage. [...] Although the SYNOP code has no separate formal group classification for vertical or multi-level clouds, the observer procedure for selecting numerical codes is designed to give high reporting priority to those genera or species that show significant vertical development.|$|E

Winds have a standard notation when plotted on weather maps. More than a century ago, winds were plotted as arrows, with feathers on just one side depicting five knots of wind, while feathers on both sides depicted [...] of wind. The notation changed to that of half of an arrow, with half of a wind barb indicating five knots, a full barb ten knots, and a pennant flag fifty knots.|$|E
