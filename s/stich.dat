25|$|Muster {{won three}} clay-court titles in 1994. In March 1994, he {{defeated}} Michael <b>Stich</b> of Germany {{in a first}} round Davis Cup tie in Graz, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–3, 12–10, after saving a match point when trailing at 7–8 in the fifth set. Despite Muster's win over <b>Stich</b> bringing Austria level at 2–2 in the tie, it was Germany who eventually won the decisive fifth rubber.|$|E

25|$|Even this fiasco was {{not enough}} to persuade McGruder to cancel the Mechanismo Project. She simply paid {{compensation}} to the victims' families and ordered <b>Stich</b> to rectify the fault in the robots' design and programming. Her ambitions suffered a further setback however when the damaged Number Five reactivated itself and embarked on a second killing spree, escaping from Justice Department premises and shooting judges and civilians alike. This time the robot escaped into the sewer system and was not recaptured.|$|E

25|$|The Mark I robots were field-tested under strict supervision. Although {{they made}} a {{promising}} start, Judge Dredd was not impressed with the idea and was aggressively resistant to the whole concept: however <b>Stich</b> and the Chief Judge ignored his concerns. Dredd was soon vindicated when two of the robots ran amok and began slaughtering innocent civilians indiscriminately. When the robots were ordered to shut down, the two rogue units ignored the order {{and had to be}} destroyed. Dredd personally gunned down unit number 8.|$|E
25|$|With {{new coach}} Brad Gilbert on board, Agassi began to employ {{more of a}} tactical, {{consistent}} approach, which fueled his resurgence. He started slowly in 1994, losing {{in the first week}} at the French Open and Wimbledon. Nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the Canadian Open. His comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open with a five-set fourth-round victory against compatriot Michael Chang. He then became the first man to capture the US Open as an unseeded player, beating Michael <b>Stich</b> in the final. Along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.|$|E
25|$|Following the cataclysmic {{disasters}} {{known as}} Necropolis and Judgement Day {{in which many}} street judges lost their lives, Justice Department was severely under strength. To supplement the numbers of human judges and bring the escalating crime rate under control, Chief Judge McGruder authorised Tek Division (Justice Department scientists) to build robot judges, which once ready would be vested with full judicial powers: authority to arrest, convict, sentence and if necessary execute criminals. The whole project was developed in strict secrecy {{under the auspices of}} Tek-Judge <b>Stich,</b> and was not revealed to the public or to rank-and-file judges until the first batch of robots were ready for duty in late 2114.|$|E

As the prose books of the Bible were hardly ever written in <b>stichs,</b> the copyists, in order to estimate the amount of work, had to count the letters.

25|$|In 1992, McEnroe {{defeated}} third-ranked {{and defending}} champion Boris Becker {{in the third}} round of the Australian Open 6–4, 6–3, 7–5 before a sell-out crowd. In the fourth round, McEnroe needed 4 hours 42 minutes to defeat ninth ranked Emilio Sánchez 8–6 in the fifth set. He lost to Wayne Ferreira in the quarterfinals. At Wimbledon, McEnroe reached the semifinals where he lost in straight sets to the eventual champion Andre Agassi. McEnroe teamed with Michael <b>Stich</b> to win his fifth Wimbledon men's doubles title in a record-length 5-hour-1-minute final, which the pair won 5–7, 7–6, 3–6, 7–6, 19–17. At the end of the year, he teamed with Sampras to win the doubles rubber in the Davis Cup final, where the U.S. defeated Switzerland 3–1.|$|E
25|$|Muster {{continued}} to rack up clay-court victories in 1996. He won seven tournaments, {{six of them}} titles he successfully defended after winning them the year before. These 1996 tournament victories included his third Monte Carlo title, where he defeated clay court specialist Albert Costa in the final, and his third Italian Open title, defeating Richard Krajicek in the final. Muster's win-loss record on clay in 1996 was an impressive 46–3. This made his 1995–96 record on the surface 111–5, which was, at the time, the best two-year clay-court record since the open era began in 1968. Despite Muster's continued dominance on clay-courts in 1996, he was upset in the Round of 16 at the 1996 French Open, losing to eventual finalist Michael <b>Stich.</b> In July 1996, in {{the final of the}} 1996 Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Muster defeated the French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in three straight sets.|$|E
25|$|This {{procedure}} can {{be carried}} out under local anaesthetic. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a <b>stich</b> under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse. Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891. Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and Dacron. This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum. This goal is achieved in 54-100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures. This procedure is generally reserved for debilitated or other individuals at high anesthetic risk, who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.|$|E

25|$|Chang met Edberg in {{the semifinals}} of the US Open in 1992, this time Edberg winning in a five-set encounter, 6–7, 7–5, 7–6, 5–7, 6–4. The 5-hour, 26-minute match is the longest in US Open history. Chang reached three further Grand Slam finals after his 1989 French Open triumph, losing the 1995 French Open final to Thomas Muster, the 1996 Australian Open final to Boris Becker, and the 1996 US Open final to Pete Sampras. In the 1995 French Open, he {{defeated}} Michael <b>Stich</b> and then two-time defending champion Sergi Bruguera {{in the semifinals}} in straight sets, eventually losing to Muster. In both the 1996 Australian and U.S. Opens, he defeated Andre Agassi in the semifinals in straight sets; a win over Sampras at the U.S. Open would have made Chang the no. 1 player in the world. In the 1997 U.S. Open, he was the odds-on favorite to win after Sampras was upset by Petr Korda; however, Chang lost to eventual champion Patrick Rafter in the semifinals in straight sets.|$|E
25|$|After {{the massacres}} perpetrated by the Mark I robots, Judge <b>Stich</b> {{was unable to}} bear {{his share of the}} {{responsibility}} for the disaster and he went insane. He was committed to a psychiatric ward, from where he would persistently escape and search the sewers for the rogue Number Five. It was therefore generally assumed that McGruder had learned her lesson and that the project had been discontinued. It suited McGruder to allow people to think so. However, she still authorised the development of Mark IIs, this time under the purview of Tek-Judge Quiggley. After another year of work, Quiggley almost had the improved robots ready for a second field test when Number Five re-emerged from the sewer and began a third campaign of murder. This time Number Five had learned to go to ground after each attack, and all efforts to locate it failed. Taking personal charge of the search, McGruder brought forward the new robots' field test and deployed them on the streets, reasoning (wrongly as it transpired) {{that the best way to}} anticipate the next move of a robot was to use other robots to hunt it.|$|E
25|$|If {{heart failure}} ensues after a {{myocardial}} infarction due to scarring and aneurysm formation, reconstructive surgery {{may be an}} option. These aneurysms bulge with every contraction, making it inefficient. Cooley and coworkers reported the first surgical treatment of a left ventricular aneurysm in 1958. They used a linear closure after their excision. In the 1980s, Vincent Dor developed a method using a circular patch stitched {{to the inside of}} the ventricle (the endoventricular circular patch plasty or Dor procedure) to close the defect after excision. Dor's approach has been modified by others and is today the preferred method for surgical treatment of incorrectly contracting (dyskinetic) left ventricle tissue, although a linear closure technique combined with septoplasty might be equally effective. The multicenter RESTORE trial of 1198 participants demonstrated an increase in ejection fraction from about 30% to 40% with a concomitant shift in NYHA classes, with an early mortality of 5% and a 5-year survival of 70%. It remains unknown if surgery is superior to optimal medical therapy. The <b>STICH</b> trial (Surgical Treatment for IschemiC Heart Failure) will examine the role of medical treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery and left ventricle remodeling surgery in heart failure patients. Results are expected to be published in 2009 and 2011.|$|E
