40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} virus of the New Jersey serotype (VSV-NJ) causes <b>vesicular</b> <b>disease</b> in cattle, pigs, {{and horses}} throughout the Americas. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>disease</b> is clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Therefore, outbreaks of <b>vesicular</b> <b>disease</b> in FMD-free areas must be rapidly diagnosed by laboratory methods and affected farms must be quarantined until laboratory results confirm {{the absence of}} FMD. Diagnosis is currently performed in high-containment (biosafety level 3) laboratories by using complement fixation and virus isolation in tissue culture. We describe here an alternative method {{for the detection of}} VSV-NJ RNA in clinical samples. This method includes a rapid acid guanidine-phenol RNA extraction procedure coupled with a one-tube polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using reverse transcriptase. By using this test, we were able to detect the largest number of positive samples (53 of 58), followed by complement (48 of 58) and isolation in tissue culture (43 of 58). The primers chosen for this assay amplify a 642 -nucleotide region of the phosphoprotein gene of VSV-NJ but not of VSV-IN. Sequencing of the PCR product enables genetic typing of virus isolates and epidemiological studies. Since no infectious materials are necessary to perform this test and any infectious virus in clinical samples is destroyed by acid guanidine-phenol treatment, diagnosis can be safely performed in regular diagnostic laboratories.

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify values associated with the duration of the stages of FMD infection (latent period, subclinical period, incubation period, and duration of infection), probability of transmission (within-herd and between-herd via spatial spread), and diagnosis of a <b>vesicular</b> <b>disease</b> within a herd using a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed literature and expert opinion. The latent period ranged from 1 to 7 days and incubation period ranged from 1 to 9 day; both were influenced by strain.
