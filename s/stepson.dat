5000|$|The <b>Stepsons</b> are principally a cavalry (hippeis) squadron, not heavy {{infantry}} (hoplites) as the Theban Sacred Banders primarily were. While the three-hundred-strong Theban Sacred Band was {{constituted by}} Theban law-givers and {{maintained by the}} Theban state (according to Plutarch's [...] "Life" [...] of Pelopidas), the Sacred Band of <b>Stepsons</b> is loyal only to its members and its commander, Tempus. Among the <b>Stepsons,</b> fathers and sons and Platonic couples, as well as single male and female fighters, can serve. In this mixed company, couples and individual cavalry and infantry fighters are recruited as circumstances required. To this end, the <b>Stepsons</b> rescued twenty-three pairs from the doomed Theban Sacred Band at the Battle of Chaeronea and integrated the survivors into their force. At full strength, the <b>Stepsons</b> number {{as many as three}} hundred and sixty fighters and have fought in three major campaigns.|$|R
50|$|In Tempus's Band, {{heterosexual}} <b>Stepsons</b> and Sacred Band pairs fight side by side. There is no {{requirement to}} be part of a couple to serve among the <b>Stepsons,</b> and single mercenaries initially outnumbered the Sacred Band pairs.|$|R

5|$|Augustus died in AD 14 {{at the age}} of 75. He {{probably}} {{died from}} natural causes, although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son (also <b>stepson</b> and former son-in-law) Tiberius.|$|E
5|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1461, Catherine's role receded {{to that of}} queen dowager at the court of her <b>stepson,</b> King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia {{and put an end}} to the {{independent}} kingdom. Catherine's <b>stepson</b> was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received a pension from the papacy. From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children. Her efforts to negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Hogg {{had also}} hoped that his friend Thomas Love Peacock, {{who worked for}} the East India Company, would {{recommend}} him for a position there. To Hogg's dismay Peacock would not help him, although several years later Peacock did help Hogg's <b>stepson</b> gain employment with the company.|$|E

5000|$|The Sacred Band of <b>Stepsons</b> was {{developed}} by their fictional commander, Tempus, from an original ten pairs of lovers and friends, plus thirty single mercenaries.

50|$|The Sacred Band of <b>Stepsons</b> is a {{multinational}} force, and eventually includes twenty-three couples from the Sacred Band of Thebes who fought at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. Like the historic Sacred Band of Thebes (378-338 BC), the <b>Stepsons</b> {{serve as an}} elite strike force. Unlike today's prevailing vision of the Theban Sacred Band, the <b>Stepsons</b> mix pairs and individual war-fighters in a single unit. Both Sacred Bands adhere to the ancient military model of the Sacred Bands, special units who prize honor above all and die in battle rather than desert their partners, lovers or beloveds.|$|R

5|$|Baldwin IV, who {{had become}} seriously ill, made Guy of Lusignan bailli (or regent) in October 1183. Within a month, Baldwin {{dismissed}} Guy, and had Guy's five-year-old <b>stepson,</b> Baldwin V, crowned king. Raynald was not present at the child's coronation, because he attended the wedding of his <b>stepson,</b> Humphrey, and BaldwinIV's sister, Isabella, in Kerak. Saladin unexpectedly invaded Oultrejordain, forcing the local inhabitants to seek refuge in Kerak. After Saladin broke into the town, Raynald only managed to escape to the fortress because one of his retainers had hindered the attackers from seizing the bridge between {{the town and the}} castle. Saladin laid siege to Kerak. According to Ernoul, Raynald's wife sent dishes from the wedding to Saladin, persuading him to stop bombarding the tower where her son and his wife stayed. After envoys from Kerak informed BaldwinIV of the siege, the royal army left Jerusalem for Kerak under the command of the king and RaymondIII of Tripoli. Saladin abandoned the siege before their arrival on 4December. On Saladin's order, Izz al-Din Usama had a fortress built at Ajloun, near the northern border of Raynald's domains.|$|E
5|$|By May, fortresses were rapidly {{falling to}} the Ottomans. The royal family appears to have decided to {{disperse}} from Jajce and flee towards Croatia and the coast in several directions to confuse and mislead the invaders. Catherine found herself besieged in Kozograd Castle, while her children were captured {{in the town of}} Zvečaj and taken to Mehmed's capital of Constantinople. Her <b>stepson</b> was deceived into surrendering in Ključ, from where he ordered all his castellans to surrender the fortresses, but Kozograd defied the King's order. Its defenders appear to have stalled the Ottomans while Catherine escaped. Vladislav was informed by the Ragusans on 23 May that they would send vessels for his sister if she succeeded in reaching the coast. Two days later, her <b>stepson</b> was executed on Mehmed's orders. The Queen rode to Konjic and from there probably towards Drijeva, before finally embarking on the promised vessels in Ston and sailing to Lopud, an island held by the Republic of Ragusa. The two queens, Catherine and Maria, were the only {{members of the royal family}} to escape the Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, in Rome, Emperor Claudius died and was succeeded by his <b>stepson</b> Nero. The Parthian {{encroachment}} {{in an area}} regarded as lying within the Roman sphere of influence worried the Roman leadership, and was widely seen as a major test of the new emperor's ability. Nero reacted vigorously, appointing Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, a general who had distinguished himself in Germania and now served as governor of Asia, to supreme command in the East.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth was {{initially}} succeeded by his <b>stepson</b> Lulach, but Lulach ruled {{for only a}} few months before also being killed by Malcolm III, whose descendants would rule Scotland until the late 13th century. Macbeth is today best known as the main character of William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth and the many works it has inspired. However, Shakespeare's Macbeth is based on the Holinshed's Chronicles (published in 1577) and is not historically accurate.|$|E
