5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (<b>synodic</b> months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 <b>synodic</b> months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 <b>synodic</b> months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 <b>synodic</b> months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} <b>synodic</b> period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a looping motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The <b>synodic</b> rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, {{one of which is}} the predominant calendar in use today.|$|E
5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After {{this period}} of time Venus and Earth have {{returned}} to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 <b>synodic</b> periods of Venus.|$|E
5|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{approximately}} 27.3 days, {{relative to a}} fixed frame of reference. This {{is known as the}} sidereal month. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the <b>synodic</b> month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.|$|E
5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 <b>synodic</b> periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} <b>synodic</b> month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars about once every 27.3days (its sidereal period). However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its <b>synodic</b> period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which Mars's geocentric {{longitude}} is 180° different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and about 103millionkm due to the planets' elliptical orbits, which causes comparable variation in angular size. The last Mars opposition occurred on May 22, 2016 {{at a distance of}} about 76millionkm. The next Mars opposition occurs on July 27, 2018 at a distance of about 58millionkm. The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its <b>synodic</b> period, is 780 days; but the number of days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking {{the limits of the}} Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the <b>Synodic</b> month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E
25|$|Pentalunex: 5 <b>synodic</b> months. Successive solar or lunar eclipses {{may occur}} 1, 5 or 6 <b>synodic</b> months apart.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{discrepancy}} between the molad interval and the mean <b>synodic</b> month is accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean <b>synodic</b> month is progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects. Measured on a strictly uniform time scale, such as that provided by an atomic clock, the mean <b>synodic</b> month is becoming gradually longer, but since the tides slow Earth's rotation rate even more, the mean <b>synodic</b> month is becoming gradually shorter in terms of mean solar time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Synodic</b> Month: Similarly, {{two events}} one <b>synodic</b> month apart have the Sun and Moon at two {{positions}} {{on either side}} of the node, 29° apart: both may cause a partial eclipse.|$|E
25|$|In {{calculating the}} number of months that will have passed since the known molad that one uses as the {{starting}} point, one must remember to include any leap month(s) that falls within the elapsed interval, according to the cycle of leap years. A 19-year cycle of 235 <b>synodic</b> months has 991 weeks 2 days 16 hours 595 parts, a common year of 12 <b>synodic</b> months has 50 weeks 4 days 8 hours 876 parts, while a leap year of 13 <b>synodic</b> months has 54 weeks 5 days 21 hours 589 parts.|$|E
25|$|Lunar year: Twelve (<b>synodic)</b> months, {{a little}} longer than an eclipse year: the Sun has {{returned}} to the node, so eclipses may again occur.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion {{cannot be}} solved by the lunar-four {{arguments}} that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact 5458/5923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (Almagest 6.9) his 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 B. C. E. to find the less accurate ratio 7160 <b>synodic</b> months = 7770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 <b>synodic</b> months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 <b>synodic</b> months = 269 anomalistic months.) If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a moonrise 1245 B. C. E. eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13645 <b>synodic</b> months = 148807 1/2 draconitic months ≈ 14623 1/2 anomalistic months. Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 <b>synodic</b> months = 5923 precisely. The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself {{and there is no}} consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 B. C. E., 600 years before his era, the tables were actually good back to before the eclipse in question because as only recently noted their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.|$|E
25|$|In each {{sequence}} below, each eclipse {{is separated}} by a fortnight. The first and last eclipse in each sequence is separated by one <b>synodic</b> month. See also Eclipse cycles.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonians {{expressed}} {{all periods}} in <b>synodic</b> months, probably because {{they used a}} lunisolar calendar. Various relations with yearly phenomena led to different values {{for the length of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|The Mercury-Mars <b>synodic</b> {{period is}} 100.888 days. It can be {{calculated}} using the formula 1/(1/P-1/Q), where P is the orbital period of Mercury (87.969 days) and Q is the orbital period of Mars (686.98 days).|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{proximity of}} the Moon at this time meant that tides were stronger and more rapid than they are now. The day was 21.9±0.4 hours, and there were 13.1±0.1 <b>synodic</b> months/year and 400±7 solar days/year.|$|E
25|$|The Metonic Dial is {{the main}} upper dial on {{the rear of the}} mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several {{physical}} units, is 235 <b>synodic</b> months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the <b>synodic</b> month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.|$|E
25|$|For example, if the moon's {{penumbra}} partially {{covers the}} southern limb {{of the earth}} during a solar eclipse, 9 years and 5.5 days later a lunar eclipse will occur in which the moon is partially covered by the southern limb of the earth's penumbra. Likewise, 9 years and 5.5 days after a total solar eclipse occurs, a total lunar eclipse will also occur. This 9-year period {{is referred to as}} a sar. It includes 111.5 <b>synodic</b> months, or 111 <b>synodic</b> months plus one fortnight. The fortnight accounts for the alternation between solar and lunar eclipse. For a visual example see this chart (each row is one sar apart).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit. The sidereal month is {{the time it takes}} to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The <b>synodic</b> month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The <b>synodic</b> period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many stories to {{interpret}} the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always ¾ <b>synodic</b> month. Obviously, the month beginning shifts forward (from the new moon, to the third quarter, to the full moon, to the first quarter, back the new moon) after intercalation.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchic cycle: Not a {{noteworthy}} eclipse cycle, but Hipparchus constructed it to closely match {{an integer}} number of <b>synodic</b> and anomalistic months, years (345), and days. By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, he could verify {{the accuracy of}} the various periods that the Chaldeans used.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} gear ratios for each planet {{that result in}} close matches to the correct values for <b>synodic</b> periods of the planets and the sun. The ones chosen above seem to provide good {{accuracy}} with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears {{that may have been}} used are, and probably will remain, unknown.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the 12 lunar months of the Hebrew {{calendar}} are the normal months from new moon to new: the year normally contains twelve months averaging 29.52 days each. The discrepancy compared to the mean <b>synodic</b> month of 29.53 days is due to Adar I in a leap year always having thirty days. This means that the calendar year normally contains 354 days.|$|E
25|$|The minimum-energy launch {{windows for}} a Martian {{expedition}} occur at intervals of approximately {{two years and}} two months (specifically 780 days, the planet's <b>synodic</b> period with respect to Earth). In addition, the lowest available transfer energy varies on a roughly 16-year cycle. For example, a minimum occurred in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows, rising to a peak in the late 1970s, and hitting another low in 1986 and 1988.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Meton, axial {{precession}} {{had not yet been}} discovered, and he could not distinguish between sidereal years (currently: 365.256363 days) and tropical years (currently: 365.242190 days). Most calendars, like the commonly used Gregorian calendar, are based on the tropical year and maintain the seasons at the same calendar times each year. Nineteen tropical years are about two hours shorter than 235 <b>synodic</b> months. The Metonic cycle's error is, therefore, one full day every 219 years, or 12.4 parts per million.|$|E
25|$|Fortnight: Half a <b>synodic</b> month (29.53 days). When {{there is}} an eclipse, there is a fair chance that at the next syzygy {{there will be another}} eclipse: the Sun and Moon will have moved about 15° with respect to the nodes (the Moon being {{opposite}} to where it was the previous time), but the luminaries may still be within bounds to make an eclipse.For example, partial solar eclipse of June 1, 2011 is followed by the total lunar eclipse of June 16, 2011 and partial solar eclipse of July 1, 2011.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of {{calendars}} the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360-day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle, and a Venus cycle, which tracked the <b>synodic</b> period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa). The 260-day cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies and memorialize public officials. The 260-day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns.|$|E
25|$|Records {{of solar}} eclipses {{have been kept}} since ancient times. Eclipse dates {{can be used for}} chronological dating of {{historical}} records. A Syrian clay tablet, in the Ugaritic language, records a solar eclipse which occurred on March 5, 1223 B.C., while Paul Griffin argues that a stone in Ireland records an eclipse on November 30, 3340 B.C. Positing classical-era astronomers' use of Babylonian eclipse records mostly from the 13th century BC provides a feasible and mathematically consistent explanation for the Greek finding all three lunar mean motions (<b>synodic,</b> anomalistic, draconitic) to a precision of about one part in a million or better. Chinese historical records of solar eclipses date back over 4,000 years and have been used to measure changes in the Earth's rate of spin.|$|E
25|$|In other words, {{because the}} eclipse season (34 days long on average) {{is longer than}} the <b>synodic</b> month (one lunation, or {{the time for the}} Moon to return to a {{particular}} phase and about 29.5 days), the Moon will be new or full at least two, and up to three, times during the season. Eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart (successively occurring every 173.31 days - half of an eclipse year), the time it takes the Sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic. If the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs {{at the very beginning of}} a calendar year, it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time before the end of the calendar year for two full eclipse seasons, each having up to three eclipses.|$|E
25|$|At the {{simplest}} level, most well-known lunar calendars {{are based on}} the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month — but this is only roughly accurate, and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of leap days. Additionally, the <b>synodic</b> month does not fit easily into the year, which makes accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the Metonic cycle, which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years (which add up to not quite 6940 days). However, a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the Antikythera Mechanism about 2000 years ago, and the Hebrew calendar.|$|E
25|$|Transits of Earth from Mars usually {{occur in}} pairs, with one {{following}} the other after 79 years; rarely, {{there are three}} in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its ascending node are in May, those at descending node happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 <b>synodic</b> periods, and {{is analogous to the}} cycle of transits of Venus from Earth, which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.|$|E
25|$|The present era lunar <b>synodic</b> {{period is}} about 29.5305877 mean solar days or about 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes and 2+7/9 seconds. As a whole number, {{the number of}} days per {{lunation}} will be either 29 or 30 days, with the 30-day intervals necessarily occurring slightly more frequently than the 29-day intervals. The Maya wrote whether the lunar month was 29 or 30 days as two glyphs: a glyph for lunation length followed by either a glyph made up of a moon glyph over a bundle with a suffix of 9 for a 29-day lunation or a moon glyph with a suffix of 10 for a 30-day lunation. Since the Maya didn't use fractions, lunations were approximated by using the formula that there were 149 lunations completed in 4400 days, which yielded a rather short mean month of exactly 4400/149 = 29+79/149 days = 29 days 12 hours 43 minutes and 29+59/149 seconds, or about 29.5302 days.|$|E
