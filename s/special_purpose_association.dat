40|$|In the {{empirical}} study in question, {{the current situation}} concerning the public water supply, waste water disposal, and water pollution prevention in Saxony {{with regard to the}} decision makers' knowledge of and approach towards "sustainable development" and its implementation is dealt with. Important results of the study are: · A comprehensive and uniform familiarity with the term and the contents of "sustainable development" is not present on all relevant decision-making levels. · The main area of activity of an institution influences its familiarity with the term "sustainable development. " If the main area of activity of an institution lies in the field of water supply or water pollution prevention, familiarity with the term is greater. · Familiarity with the term "sustainable development" depends {{on the size of the}} respective institution with regard to the number of residents that it is responsible for supplying and the number of employees working for it. In larger institutions, familiarity with the term is more widespread. · The fact that many institutions are more committed ecologically and socially shows the fundamental possibility of incorporating these goals. Nevertheless, economic goals are given the highest practical importance, because of their limiting effects with regard to implementation of goals and decisions. · The significance of economic goals depends on the type of institution. In private-sector and public businesses they tend to have the greatest significance. For ecological and social goals, such dependence cannot be proved. · The greatest problems perceived in making "sustainable development" materialize depend on the type of institution. Whereas communities see such problems equally for all goals, economic and social goals are what cause problems for <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>associations.</b> In all other types of institutions such problems exist primarily for economic goals. · The organizational form influences the effects with regard to sustainable development. Possible privatization in various forms therefore should always be judged by the resulting effects on "sustainable development. ...|$|R

The analysis supports the findings that the formal differences between public authorities, government corporations, and special authorities include the ability to control the amount of information reported to the state government, the financial aspects that each entity possesses, and the ability to issue debt in the market place. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to the ordinary corporate income tax, <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> taxes are sometimes levied to extract abnormal profits arising {{from the use of}} natural resources. Such dual tax regimes exist in Norway for oil and hydropower, where the corresponding <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax bases are unaffected by any derivatives payments. Dual tax firms with hedging programs therefore face the risk of potentially large discrepancies between the tax bases for corporate income tax and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax. I investigate how this tax base asymmetry influences the extent of hedging of value-maximizing firms facing hedgeable as well as unhedgeable risk. Dual tax firms facing deadweight costs in low-profit events generally demand less hedging than ordinary firms, but otherwise respond similarly to characteristics of the underlying risk exposures.
