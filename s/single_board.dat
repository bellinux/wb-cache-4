Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system. In 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the Wisconsin State Universities System, creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a <b>single</b> <b>board</b> of regents.|$|E

40|$|Azobé (Lophira alata) {{is widely}} used in timber sheet pile walls in the Netherlands. The boards in these walls are coupled and {{therefore}} load-sharing can be expected. A simulation model based on the finite element method DIANA (DIANA, 1992) was developed and load-sharing could be calculated. To check these simulations full size tests on <b>single</b> <b>boards</b> and on sheet pile walls containing five boards were performed. The test programme so far has shown that load-sharing exists and that the characteristic strength of the sheet pile walls tested is about 23 % higher then the characteristic strength of the <b>single</b> <b>boards.</b> The simulation model predicted a load-sharing factor of 1. 15 based on brittle material behaviour. Tests on <b>single</b> <b>boards</b> showed a more plastic behaviour. After completion of the tests and an adaption of the model other geometries will be calculated {{to see whether the}} load-sharing factor obtained from the tests is allo applicable for other gcometries and species...|$|R

25|$|During South Africa's {{absence from}} {{international}} cricket, {{a number of}} different organisations ran domestic cricket: initially the South Africa Cricket Association (SACA), South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) and the South African Cricket Board (SAACB).

However, the new board – the South African Cricket Union (SACU) – was not recognised by a small dissenting group in the SACBOC, who set up the South African Cricket Board (SACB).|$|E

This responsibility has been executed as recently as the late 90's when the World Service Conference voted to re-structure the NA Service structure including the removal of the Board of Trustees, Board of Directors and several other World Service level committees (Public Information, Hospitals & Institutions, Literature and Translations) replacing them with a <b>single</b> <b>board</b> elected by the conference.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the medical}} {{specialty}} of psychiatry uses {{research in the}} field of neuroscience, psychology, medicine, biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, it has generally been considered a middle ground between neurology and psychology. Because psychiatry and neurology are deeply intertwined medical specialties, all certification for both specialties and for their subspecialties are offered by a <b>single</b> <b>board,</b> the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, one of the member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Unlike other physicians and neurologists, psychiatrists specialize in the doctor–patient relationship and are trained to varying extents in the use of psychotherapy and other therapeutic communication techniques. Psychiatrists also differ from psychologists in that they are physicians and have post-graduate training called residency (usually 4 to 5 years) in psychiatry; the quality and thoroughness of their graduate medical training is identical to that of all other physicians. Psychiatrists can therefore counsel patients, prescribe medication, order laboratory tests, order neuroimaging, and conduct physical examinations.|$|E

40|$|About 60 % of the 4000 km {{engineered}} {{sheet pile}} {{walls in the}} Netherlands are made of timber. The species most applied for this application are azobé (Lophira Alata) and treated pine (Pinus sylvestris). In order to optimise material use {{as much as possible}} the fifth percentile strength value of the system of coupled boards has been determined using a combination of experimental tests and numerical Monte Carlo simulations. The experiments consist of four point bending tests on <b>single</b> <b>boards</b> as well as on parallel boards coupled by tongue and groove. The actual fifth percentile strength value of the individual boards has been determined. The increase in strength {{as a result of the}} system effect is written as a load sharing factor on the fifth percentile strength value of the <b>single</b> <b>boards.</b> Load-sharing factors have been derived for the two species and were found to be 1. 17 for azobé and 1. 33 for treated pine. 1...|$|R

This design has led to OS developers releasing rolling updates to their versions of the OS, while third parties are able to write OS replacement modules to add new features. OS modules are accessed via software interrupts (SWIs), similar to system calls in other operating systems.|$|E
