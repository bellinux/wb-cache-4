60|$|Ruth started. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> {{never heard}} him speak like this before. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not {{imagined}} him capable of speaking in that way. Even {{in the days when}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> loved him most <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never looked up to him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> considered his nature weak, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> loved his weakness. Except in the case of her father, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> always dominated the persons with whom she mixed; and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken it for granted that her will was stronger than Kirk's. Something in his voice now told her that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> under-estimated him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> been a girl, not {{accountable}} for loss of mother, for choice {{of home and}} education. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> belonged to a class. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> grown to womanhood in it. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> loved, and in loving had escaped the evil of her day, if not its taint. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> lived only for herself. Conscience had awakened--but, alas! too late. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> overthrown the sordid, self-seeking habit of life; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> awakened to real womanhood; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fought the insidious spell of modernity and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> defeated it; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> learned the thrill of taking root in new soil, the pain and joy of labor, the bliss of solitude, the promise of home and love and motherhood.

As they talk through Liz's past problems with sex, they {{realize that they are}} all connected to the incident with the Tom Jones poster and that each time <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had a problem, it is because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been reminded of the singer. Liz is relieved that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> found the root of her problem and Jack convinces her to stay with Carol.

60|$|She {{was sorry}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> spoken so plainly {{when she saw}} that Gordon winced. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> guessed more or less {{correctly}} what the man felt for her, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no wish to pain him. Except for that, however, the admission <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made did not greatly matter, since she fancied that he was quite aware why <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sent Nasmyth away.

60|$|He sat in silence.

But it stuck in his throat that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> despised him whilst he thought she worshipped him. <b>She</b> should <b>have</b> told him when she found fault with him. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not played fair. He hated her. All these years <b>she</b> <b>had</b> treated {{him as if he}} were a hero, and thought of him {{secretly}} as an infant, a foolish child. Then why <b>had</b> <b>she</b> left the foolish child to his folly? His heart was hard against her.|$|R
