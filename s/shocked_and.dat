5|$|Despite The Big Room being {{critically}} acclaimed, {{it was not}} as commercially {{successful as}} their first album, which Verdens Gang attributed to a lacklustre promotion campaign by Atlantic Records. Half way through their tour with Jewel in mid July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic who cited disappointing sales of The Big Room, which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. <b>Shocked</b> <b>and</b> disappointed by the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.|$|E
30|$|According to this view, {{there are}} several layers of {{interactions}} between <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> policies. In particular, Argentina’s trade policies are intimately connected to the external <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> the relative strength of the different political coalitions that emerge, given the country’s institutions. These interplay between <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> policy, depend in turn on how <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> economic events are interpreted, and on people’s beliefs concerning the relevant policy elasticities. If professional economists seldom agree on the magnitude (and sign) of these forces, {{it is no wonder}} that policy reactions depend heavily on the narratives that political entrepreneurs provide.|$|R

5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

40|$|Hemorrhagic shock is {{a leading}} cause of trauma-related {{mortality}} in both civilian and military settings. Resuscitation often results in reperfusion injury and survivors are susceptible to developing multiple organ failure (MOF). The impact of fed state on the overall response to <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> resuscitation has been explored in some murine models but few clinically relevant large animal models. We have previously used metabolomics to establish that the fed state results in a different metabolic response in the porcine liver following hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> resuscitation. In this study, we used our clinically relevant model of hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> polytrauma and the Illumina HiSeq platform to determine if the liver transcriptomic response is also altered with respect to fed state. Functional analysis of the response to <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> resuscitation confirmed several typical responses including carbohydrate metabolism, cytokine inflammation, decreased cholesterol synthesis, and apoptosis. Our findings also suggest that the fasting state, relative to a carbohydrate prefed state, displays decreased carbohydrate metabolism, increased cytoskeleton reorganization and decreased inflammation in response to hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> <b>and</b> reperfusion. Evidence suggests that this is a consequence of a shrunken, catabolic state of the liver cells which provides an anti-inflammatory condition that partially mitigates hepatocellar damage...|$|R

Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley).
