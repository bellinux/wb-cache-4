25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but {{the ratio of the}} heat of combustion (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kJ/g) than other complex hydrocarbons. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Actual {{cubic foot}} per minute (ACFM) is {{the volume of}} gas flowing {{anywhere}} in a system, independent of its temperature and pressure. If the system were moving a gas at exactly the [...] "standard" [...] condition, then ACFM would equal SCFM. Unfortunately, this usually is not the case as the most important change between these two definitions is the pressure. To move a gas, a positive pressure or a vacuum must be created. When positive pressure is applied to a <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> of gas, it is compressed. When a vacuum is applied to a <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> of gas, it expands.

Common units of gas volumes include ccf (hundred <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet),</b> Mcf (thousand <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet),</b> MMcf (million <b>standard</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>feet),.</b> The M refers to the Roman numeral for thousand,two M's would be one thousand thousand, or one million.
