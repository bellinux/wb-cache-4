5|$|Even though Maryland did not <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Union, Steuart's loyalty {{lay with}} the South, as did {{that of his}} father. He {{commanded}} one of the Baltimore city militias during the riot of April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied Baltimore, an incident which was arguably the first armed confrontation of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The city of St. Louis is an {{independent}} city, and is not {{within the limits of}} a county. Its residents voted to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> St. Louis County in 1876.

5|$|Beriah Magoffin (April 18, 1815 – February 28, 1885) was the 21st Governor of Kentucky, serving {{during the}} early part of the Civil War. Personally, Magoffin adhered to a states' rights position, {{including}} the right of a state to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Union, and he sympathized with the Confederate cause. Nevertheless, when the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a position of neutrality in the war, Magoffin ardently held to it, refusing calls for aid from both the Union and Confederate governments.|$|E
5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> that territory. It {{is a matter of}} debate to what extent this move was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In early 1861, Norfolk voters {{instructed}} their {{delegate to}} vote for secession. Virginia voted to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Union. In the spring of 1862, the Battle of Hampton Roads took place off the northwest shore of the city's Sewell's Point Peninsula, marking the first fight between two ironclads, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia. The battle ended in a stalemate, but {{changed the course of}} naval warfare; from then on, warships were fortified with metal.|$|E

5|$|Lorković was a keen {{advocate}} for the amalgamation of all Croatian parties into a 'super-party' to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and on 4 October 1934 swore his Ustaše oath. He became commander of all Ustaše units in Germany and later, after the assassination of King Alexander, commander of all Ustaše outside Italy. The assassination of King Alexander led to him being briefly detained in Germany, but was released in mid-1935 after a German court rejected a Yugoslav request for his extradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, {{has been seen}} as crucial to an increase in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created friction between the Catalan nationalist supporters, who wish to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E
5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> {{the region of}} Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Union.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, in February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee {{announced}} that the British government would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest. On 3 June 1947, the British government {{announced that}} the principle of division of British India into two independent states was accepted. The successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the British Commonwealth. Viceroy Mountbatten chose 15 August, {{the second anniversary of}} Japan's surrender in the World War II, as the date of power transfer. He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Missouri {{called a}} {{convention}} {{to determine whether}} it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Union. Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E

5|$|In early 1861 after Texas {{voted to}} <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the United States {{and join the}} Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began {{recruiting}} men for a new military company. Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross {{set out for the}} Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. To bolster its defence, Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was 3,000-strong special police deployed in twelve battalions adopting military organisation. There were also 9,00010,000 regionally organised reserve police, which was organized in 16 battalions and 10 companies but lacked weapons. According to the Croatian 1991 census, Serbs were the largest ethnic group in the municipality of Pakrac (46.4%), followed by Croats (35.8%). Serb Democratic Party politician Veljko Džakula became the political leader of Croatian Serbs in western Slavonia. He held a view that Serbs should <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Kentucky {{by a vote}} of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859. He supported states' rights and the institution of slavery. Although he believed in the right of states to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and northern states. To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.|$|E

5|$|The call to open {{a college}} in West Texas began shortly after {{settlers}} arrived {{in the area in}} the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A to be in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas {{went so far as to}} recommend West Texas <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} is {{less than}} an acre in size and is located to the immediate east of the church, surrounded by a wrought iron fence manufactured by Stewart Iron Works.

Captain David Pugh was an elected representative Hampshire County, who voted to <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the Union in 1861.|$|E
5|$|The {{impetus for}} {{federation}} {{did not extend}} to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria <b>secede</b> <b>from</b> the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E
