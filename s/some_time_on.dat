She placed third in her first competition, and she later won the Miss Galaxy competition in 1998. She then spent <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the Extreme Fitness Team.

5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It {{is also possible that}} the adults started to spend <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked backup on Gemini 3, {{taking charge}} of the newly {{established}} Mission Control Center in Houston, {{at a time when}} flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida. On Gemini 4, he again was working backup, this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston. After spending <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> unmanned testing for the Apollo program, he returned to work as a flight director on Gemini 9, 10, 11 and 12.|$|E

50|$|Distinguishing Patches are {{types of}} {{military}} insignia {{developed during the}} 20th Century. Originally intended as battlefield identification of military units and formations. The NZAOC utilised several types of Distinguishing Patches between 1917 and 1947 and they were usually worn on either a single or both shoulders and <b>some</b> <b>times</b> <b>on</b> various forms of headdress.|$|R

5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> <b>On</b> January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how Ljótólfr was a {{friendly}} acquaintance of the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson, {{who is one}} of the major characters of the entire saga. The saga states that Ljótólfr housed Sveinn for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> Lewis, and took in Sveinn's brother, who was banished from Orkney. Ljótólfr's son, Fugl, appears in the saga, although he is depicted at being at odds with Sveinn, until a relative of Fugl's negotiates peace between the two. Several historians have considered Ljótólfr to be an ancestor of Clan MacLeod; one of these considered Ljótólfr to be the eponymous ancestor of the clanalthough the current understanding of the clan's ancestry regards another man as the eponym.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the new popes, Gelasius II and Calixtus II, championed Thurstan's case, and on 19 October 1119 he was consecrated by Calixtus at Reims. Calixtus had earlier promised Henry {{that he would not}} consecrate Thurstan without the king's permission, which had still not been granted. Enraged at this, the king refused to allow the newly consecrated {{archbishop}} to enter England, and Thurstan remained for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the continent in the company of the pope. While he was traveling with the pope, he also visited Adela of Blois, King Henry's sister, who was also Thurstan's spiritual daughter. At about this same time, Calixtus issued two bulls in Thurstan's favor: one released York from Canterbury's supremacy forever, and the other demanded the king allow Thurstan to return to York. The pope threatened an interdict on England as a punishment if the papal bull was not obeyed. At length, Thurstan's friends, including Adela, succeeded in reconciling him with Henry, and he rejoined the king in Normandy. At Easter 1120, he escorted Adela to the monastery of Marcigny, where she retired from active secular affairs. He was recalled to England in early 1121.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

25|$|Home-Hay's pilot's log {{was lost}} during his {{confinement}} by the Germans, but he later estimated that by war's end he had over 1,500 hours flight time in two-seater aircraft.

25|$|The {{series was}} {{released}} on home video in VHS and DVD formats. Lucas {{had been working for}} <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> drastically reediting and restructuring the show for a home video release; major structural changes were made, including the complete removal of the 93-year-old Jones 'bookend' sections. The DVD boxset was released to tie in with the theatrical debut of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Among other extras, the discs include approximately 100 new historical featurettes.|$|E
25|$|Training {{missions}} {{were typically}} in two parts; first, a 40-hour flight—followed by <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground for}} refueling and maintenance—then a 24-hour second flight. With a sufficiently light load, the B-36 could fly at least 10,000mi (16,000km) nonstop, and the highest cruising speed of any version, the B-36J-III, was at 230mph (380km/h). Engaging the jet engines could raise the cruising speed to over 400mph (650km/h). Hence a 40-hour mission, with the jets used only for takeoff and climbing, flew about 9,200mi (15,000km).|$|E

25|$|Coates spent <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the European continent, toured Australia and South Africa in 1912–13 and {{performed}} in North America in the 1890s {{and again in}} 1925. He performed most often, however, in his native country and became a beloved figure at England's regional music festivals. Elgar's Dream of Gerontius {{was one of his}} specialties. After 1921, he limited his performances to the concert stage and recitals, still performing a wide-ranging repertoire, but championing English composers. A dispute with music publishers about royalties clouded his later years.|$|E
25|$|Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs {{carefully}} in paper {{and put them}} into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E

After spending <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back {{to find a better}} return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of Cebu on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as 38 degrees North latitude to obtain favourable winds.|$|E

25|$|While he {{understood}} the jurisdictional issue was most important to them and planned to discuss it first, Gottesman told the justices, he hoped to spend <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> {{the facts of the}} case. He conceded that the implied cause of action he saw was not necessary to establish jurisdiction. Rather, it had been a response to the school district's late argument {{that it was not a}} person under Section 1983, and that he should have cross-appealed Hogan's ruling, in which he dismissed the case against the individual members as defendants, but did not because he did not expect that issue to arise again.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s a {{group of}} American astronomers became {{interested}} in the higher peaks of the Gammons as possible sites for an observatory, and several parties camped for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the summits of Mount McKinlay and Benbonyathe Hill (vehicle tracks were also graded to the summits), but nothing further was done (a large observatory is located at Arkaroola, about a hundred kilometres to the northeast).
