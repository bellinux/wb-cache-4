5000|$|Water is {{not present}} in the piping until the system operates. Because the {{sprinkler}} orifices are open, the piping is at atmospheric pressure. To prevent the water supply pressure from forcing water into the piping, a [...] "deluge valve" [...] {{is used in the}} water <b>supply</b> <b>connection,</b> which is a mechanically latched valve. It is a non-resetting valve, and stays open once tripped.|$|E

5000|$|In some gas <b>supply</b> <b>connections</b> {{to prevent}} {{dangerous}} misconnections. For example in gas welding the flammable gas supply line is attached with left-handed threads, {{so it will}} not be accidentally switched with the oxygen supply, which uses right-handed threads.|$|R
5000|$|Logic {{circuits}} {{tend to do}} sudden switching (an ideal {{logic circuit}} would switch from low voltage to high voltage instantaneously, with no middle voltage ever observable). So logic circuit boards often have a decoupling capacitor close to each logic IC connected from each power <b>supply</b> <b>connection</b> to a nearby ground. These capacitors decouple every IC from every other IC in terms of supply voltage dips.|$|E
50|$|In these applications, the {{decoupling}} capacitors {{are often}} called bypass capacitors {{to indicate that}} they provide an alternate path for high-frequency signals that would otherwise cause the normally steady supplies to move. Those components that require quick injections of current can bypass the power supply by receiving the current from the nearby capacitor. Hence, the slower power <b>supply</b> <b>connection</b> is used to charge these capacitors, and the capacitors actually provide the large quantities of high-availability current.|$|E
50|$|The {{metal tab}} is often {{connected}} electrically {{to the internal}} circuitry, ground and <b>supply</b> <b>connection</b> are common. This does not normally pose a problem when using isolated heatsinks, but an electrically-insulating pad or sheet {{may be required to}} electrically isolate the component from the heatsink if the heatsink is grounded or otherwise non-isolated. Many materials may be used to electrically isolate the multi-leaded power package, like mica plastic, some of which have the added benefit of high thermal conductivity.|$|E
50|$|The above {{equations}} {{are only}} valid when no current {{is drawn from}} the AC supply or in the theoretical case when the AC <b>supply</b> <b>connections</b> have no inductance. In practice, the supply inductance causes a reduction of DC output voltage with increasing load, typically in the range 10-20% at full load.|$|R
5000|$|The ATX {{connector}} provides multiple {{wires and}} power connections for the 3.3 V supply, {{because it is}} most sensitive to voltage drop in the <b>supply</b> <b>connections.</b> Another ATX addition was the +5 V SB (standby) rail for providing {{a small amount of}} standby power, even when the computer was nominally [...] "off".|$|R

50|$|Iddq {{testing is}} {{somewhat}} {{more complex than}} just measuring the supply current. If a line is shorted to Vdd, for example, it will still draw no extra current if the gate driving the signal is attempting to set it to '1'. However, a different input that attempts to set the signal to 0 will show a large increase in quiescent current, signalling a bad part. Typical Iddq tests may use 20 or so inputs. Note that Iddq test inputs require only controllability, and not observability. This is because the observability is through the shared power <b>supply</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{the fault}} path between accidentally {{energized}} objects and the <b>supply</b> <b>connection</b> has low impedance, the fault current {{will be so}} large that the circuit overcurrent protection device (fuse or circuit breaker) will open to clear the ground fault. Where the earthing system {{does not provide a}} low-impedance metallic conductor between equipment enclosures and supply return (such as in a TT separately earthed system), fault currents are smaller, and will not necessarily operate the overcurrent protection device. In such case a residual current detector is installed to detect the current leaking to ground and interrupt the circuit.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} the water supply infrastructure in Lubaczów. Thereafter the analysis of the water supply infrastructure based on the collected operational data was performed. Indicators characterizing the water supply infrastructure in the years 1995 - 2014 were determined. In the analysis the following parameters were used: length of water supply network, the number of water <b>supply</b> <b>connections,</b> water consumption. The analysis was based on data get from the Central Statistical Office for 1995 ÷ 2014 [4]. The increase in the water supply network in Lubaczów in the considered period amounted 125, 8 %, while the average increase in the length of water supply network was 0, 3 km/year, per one inhabitant falls 1, 87 - 2, 38 m of the water supply network. The value of the load intensity of the water supply system in the Podkarpackie region in the years 1995 - 2009, as opposed to Lubaczów, showed an increasing trend. The length of the water supply system per unit area was 0, 88 km/km 2 in 1995 and has grown to a value of 1, 11 km/km² in 2014. The number of water <b>supply</b> <b>connections</b> leading to residential buildings and collective waterworks increased from 1299 in 1995 to 1903. In 2014, the increase amounted 146, 5 %. The average number of water <b>supply</b> <b>connections</b> per 1 km of water supply network in the years 1995 - 2014 was 65 no/km, while the difference between the maximum and minimum was 21 no/km, which shows a slight increase of this indicator...|$|R

5000|$|Stanfield {{arranges}} {{a meeting}} with Sergei Malatov at MCI Jessup {{in the hopes of}} contacting The Greeks and Spiros Vondas. He instead encounters Avon, who reveals that he still has a formidable reputation, and that Sergei had approached him once he began receiving direct payments from Marlo. Avon agrees, philosophically, with Marlo's plan to get around Proposition Joe and cur the Eastsiders out of the <b>supply</b> <b>connection.</b> Avon states that he is prepared to let bygones be bygones in regards to their past war. However, he informs Marlo that in order to gain access to Sergei, Marlo has to pay Brianna $100,000. Marlo agrees, makes the payment, and is granted access to Sergei. Sergei is initially uninterested in cooperating with Marlo's plan, but is swayed when Marlo points out that if any arrangement he can make with Vondas are beneficial to the Greeks, it will be Sergei who [...] "made it happen".

Joe introduces Stanfield to a pastor who can provide the same service. But privately Joe describes [...] "civilizing" [...] Stanfield as an ongoing uphill struggle. Stanfield is suspicious about having his money in foreign banks, so Joe tells him that since {{he does not have}} a felony conviction on his record, he can get a passport and go to the bank, in person, if he has concerns (which he does).

40|$|Abstract—A unified 1 -D {{analysis}} {{model of}} hybrid planar-type electromagnetic-bandgap (EBG) structures is developed. Based on the analysis results, {{three types of}} hybrid design methods to reduce the cutoff frequency of the EBG structures are discussed, and de-sign equations for their noise suppression bandwidths are derived. In order to simulate switching noise characteristics of the hybrid planar-type EBG structures, 2 -D circuit level models are devel-oped and experimentally verified. With the developed circuit-level models and CMOS active switching devices, feasibility studies on the power distribution network design using the hybrid EBG struc-tures are conducted. The hybrid EBG structure with series lumped chip inductors shows efficient noise suppression characteristics in both the frequency and time domains; however, it has potential lim-itations because of its generation of higher switching noise voltages depending on power <b>supply</b> <b>connection</b> configurations.
