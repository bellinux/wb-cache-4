5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that <b>seed</b> <b>set</b> must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature.

This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low <b>seed</b> <b>set</b> make seed relatively expensive.

40|$|We present three {{algorithms}} for {{the construction}} of <b>seed</b> <b>sets,</b> a subset of a cell complex which contains at least one cell for each connected component of each isocontour, for all possible isovalues. <b>Seed</b> <b>sets</b> reduce the storage requirements of high performance search structures for isocontouring, such as the segment tree or the interval tree. The three algorithms determine <b>seed</b> <b>sets</b> with varying properties. The first computes <b>seed</b> <b>sets</b> within a constant factor of the optimal size, requiring O(nlogn) time, where n is the size of the mesh. A more conservative approach computes <b>seed</b> <b>sets</b> of slightly larger size with O(n) processing time, and is very amenable to parallel processing. The seeds produced follow a particular pattern which can be leveraged for performing out-of-core isocontouring, dynamically loading only the data which is necessary from secondary storage or a remote server. A specialized form of the second algorithm for regular grids computes <b>seed</b> <b>sets</b> of intermediate size, with only slightly additional effort and the same computational complexity. We examine the use of three search structures and compare their application to the <b>seed</b> <b>sets</b> and full sets of cells from a variety of computational grids. ...|$|R

In this study, we showed that laccase- 13 (OsLAC 13), a member of laccase family genes which are known for their roles in modulating phenylpropanoid pathway and secondary lignification in cell wall, exerts a regulatory function in rice <b>seed</b> <b>setting</b> rate. OsLAC 13 expressed in anthers and promotes hydrogen peroxide production both in vitro and in the filaments and anther connectives. Knock-out of OsLAC 13 showed significantly increased <b>seed</b> <b>setting</b> rate, while overexpression of this gene exhibited induced mitochondrial damage and suppressed sugar transportation in anthers, which in turn affected <b>seed</b> <b>setting</b> rate. OsLAC 13 also induced H 2 O 2 production and mitochondrial damage in the root tip cells which caused the lethal phenotype. We also showed that high abundant of OsmiR 397, the suppressor of OsLAC 13 mRNA, increased the <b>seed</b> <b>setting</b> rate of rice plants, and restrains H 2 O 2 accumulation in roots during oxidative stress.

In this mechanism, the simultaneous presence of cross and self pollen on the same stigma, results in higher <b>seed</b> <b>set</b> from cross pollen, relative to self pollen. However, as opposed to 'complete' or 'absolute' SI, in CSI, self-pollination without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, {{even in the absence of}} cross-pollination. CSI acts, at least in some species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative to self pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described.|$|E

25|$|Potamogeton alpinus {{generally}} {{grows in}} neutral to mildly acid (but not very base-poor) water bodies such as lakes, slow-moving rivers and streams, and ponds. P. alpinus needs a deep fine substrate such as sand, silt or peat to root in {{and appears to}} avoid exposed situations. It is, mainly restricted to fairly nutrient-poor waters. In European rivers, it is associated with high quality environments. In a large-scale study of the plant communities of 3447 British lakes, red pondweed was found in 169, with a preference for circumneutral, moderate alkalinity lakes. Unlike other broad-leaved pondweeds, the stolons of red pondweed die back in winter, leaving constellations of resting buds rooted in the substrate, which regrow in spring. In rivers, red pondweed can persist entirely by asexual means (rooting of stem fragments and turion-like resting bodies, and growth in summer) though this may reflect weed cutting suppressing flowering and <b>seed</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E

Proteomic analysis showed that 493 proteins had changed the expression after pollination.
