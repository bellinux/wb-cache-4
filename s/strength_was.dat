The German forces were mostly battle groups from various formations and smaller units from different branches. A significant proportion of the German side was constituted of Omakaitse militia battalions with poor weaponry and little fighting ability.|$|E

5|$|British {{imperial}} <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph, {{new technologies}} invented {{in the second}} half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire.

5|$|By {{the end of}} January, the KPA II Corps was {{decimated}} {{during its}} guerrilla operations, and its estimated <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 16,000 to 8,000. The KPA V Corps' attempt to capture Wonju had also resulted in crippling casualties, and its estimated <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 32,000 to 22,000 {{by the end of}} January. In contrast, the UN losses were relatively moderate during the same period. The defeat of the North Korean army enabled the UN forces to consolidate their positions along the Korean central and eastern front, and the retreating US Eighth Army on the Korean western front could finally return to the offensive after its rear and eastern flank were secured. As soon as the US X Corps regained full control of the central front at the end of January, Ridgway immediately ordered the US Eighth Army to launch Operation Thunderbolt against Chinese and North Korean forces on January 25, 1951.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} July 1944, No.75 Wing {{headquarters}} <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> sixty-three staff, including eighteen officers, and a DH.84.

5|$|German losses {{had been}} heavy at Hannut and Gembloux. The 4th Panzer Division {{was down to}} 137 tanks on 16 May, {{including}} just four Panzer IVs. The 3rd Panzer Division was down by 20–25 percent of its operational force, while the 4th Panzer Division 45–50 percent of its tanks were not combat ready. Damaged tanks were quickly repaired, but its <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> initially greatly weakened.|$|E
5|$|Half of the regiment's <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> {{ordered to}} retreat from its {{position}} before the North Korean force was encountered, leaving the flank open for the remaining force, 1st Battalion at Pyongtaek. The battalion encountered North Korean forces the morning of July 6, and after a brief fight, was unable to repel them effectively. The battalion then mounted a disorganized retreat to Cheonan several miles away, having failed to significantly delay the North Korean forces in their movement south.|$|E
30|$|At first, the {{localized}} MOEs and KARs {{within each}} layer in virtual GLT were randomly {{picked up from}} the actual lamina database {{as long as the}} virtual GLT length. Second, localized tensile <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> generated from the adjusted localized MOE and KAR using Eq. (6). Third, in manufacturing process of GLT, the ends of same lamina grades are connected with finger joint. Thus, finger-jointed <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> applied according to lamina size and MOE lamina grade. The finger-jointed <b>strengths</b> <b>were</b> generated by the Weibull inverse cumulative distribution function.

5|$|No. 4 Repair and Salvage Unit (RSU) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, on 18May 1942. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer, from 1June, was acting Flight Lieutenant H.R.P. Relf.

Coming {{under the control of}} North-Western Area Command (NWA), No.4 RSU was responsible for salvaging damaged aircraft, which it subsequently repaired or dismantled for spare parts. By December 1943, its <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> over 500 officers and men. It was renamed No.4 Repair and Servicing Unit on 1January 1945, and re-located to Winnellie, Northern Territory, on 11May.

5|$|On 10March 1953, No.30 Transport Unit re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron, {{which had}} disbanded the {{previous}} day at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Between the armistice in July {{and the end of}} August 1953, the squadron repatriated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war. As of 30November 1954, its <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> seven Dakotas and one Wirraway, and eighty-seven personnel including seven officers. Elements of No.36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955, {{and by the end of}} the month its <b>strength</b> <b>was</b> four Dakotas and one Wirraway, and fifty-eight personnel including five officers. Nominal operational control of the squadron was transferred to Fifth Air Force on 1February 1955, though its purpose continued to be the support of Commonwealth forces. No.36 Squadron ceased flying on 13March, after which its remaining elements departed Iwakuni for Australia, leaving three Dakotas and a Wirraway that formed RAAF Transport Flight (Japan); the flight operated until July 1956 and was disbanded two months later.|$|E
5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins.

40|$|Strength {{characteristics}} of steel beam-columns are discussed by statistically evaluating the {{data obtained from}} previous experimental studies.

Strength of the test data (designated as the experimental <b>strength)</b> <b>is</b> calibrated against the strength assumed in the strength provisions of the LSD Specification (designated as the predicted strength), and following observations are made. (1) The experimental <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> 15 % larger on the average than the predicted strength. (2) The experimental strength relative to the predicted <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> larger for beam-columns with moment-gradient than for those with uniform-moment, and it occurs most likely because the effect of strain hardening on the <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> {{not included in the}} predicted strength. (3) If the nominal yield stress is used instead of the real yield stress, the difference between the experimental and predicted <b>strengths</b> <b>is</b> expanded further by 7 %. (4) The experimental <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> 36 % larger on the average than the design strength stipulated in the LSD Specification. (5) The primary source that have produced the difference between the experimental and design <b>strengths</b> <b>is</b> not the variation of yield stress but the error involved in the predicted strength...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} defect modes in {{optically}} induced photonic lattices are possible in biased photovoltaic-photorefractive crystals. These defect modes exist in different bandgaps when the defect <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> changed. When the defect <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> positive, {{there is a}} defect-mode branch in each bandgap. When the defect <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> negative, there is a defect-mode branch in the first bandgap and are many defect-mode branches in higher bandgaps. For a given defect strength, the strongest confinement of the defect modes appears in the semi-infinite bandgap when the defect <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> positive {{and in the first}} bandgap when the defect <b>strength</b> <b>is</b> negative. On the other hand, these defect modes are those studied previously in optically induced photonic lattices in biased non-photovoltaic-photorefractive crystals when the bulk photovoltaic effect is negligible and predict those in optically induced photonic lattices in photovoltaic-photorefractive crystals when the external bias field is absent.
