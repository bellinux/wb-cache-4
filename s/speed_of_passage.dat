40|$|Quantum {{information}} processing has greatly {{increased interest in}} the phenomenon of environmentally-induced decoherence. The spin boson model is widely used to study the interaction between a spin-modelling a quantum particle moving in a double well potential-and its environment-modelled by a heat bath of harmonic oscillators. This paper extends a previous analysis of the static spin boson study to the driven spin boson case, with the derivation of an exact integro-differential equation for the time evolution of the propagator of the reduced spin density matrix. This is the first main result. By specializing to weak damping we then obtain the next result, a set of Bloch-Redfield equations for the equilibrium fixed spin initial condition. Finally we show that these equations {{can be used to}} solve the classic dissipative Landau-Zener problem and illustrate these solutions for the weak damping case. The effect of dissipation is seen to be minimised as the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is increased, implying that qubits need to be switched as fast as possible.

40|$|The {{influence}} of bile on the motility of the alimentary tract {{has been a}} subject for study and observation since ancient times (6). The majority of investigators in the past 40 years have centered their attention {{on the effect of}} bile on small and large intestinal motility and have placed little or no emphasis on the response of the stomach (1 - 7). In 1922 Berti and Bernucci (8) reported that the feeding of bile to dogs increased the speed of gastric evacuation. The converse was true when small doses of bile were injected intravenously, but when large amounts were so given an acceleration of gastric emptying resulted. Still and Carlson (9) found that the experimental production of jaundice in dogs diminished the rate and magnitude of gastric hunger contractions and shortened the period of activity. Freude (10) reported that the introduction of a 20 % solution of dehydrocholic acid into the stomach of a patient with pylorospasm produced relaxation of the spasm, increased the speed of emptying and increased the tonus of the stomach. Thorner (11) noted that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> of a barium meal from the stomach was decreased in jaundiced dogs and humans and that th...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension of time judgments, namely subjective judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage</b> and what factors influence people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage.</b> Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage: the more {{attention is paid}} to non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage</b> from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage</b> from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage.</b> It shows that both presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli and comparison could influence people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage,</b> but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage.</b> Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage.</b> It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions of movements on judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage.</b> It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism of judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage</b> (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s judgments <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> time <b>passage</b> such as presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R

The Hamiltonian of this system differs by a small, $\sim\varepsilon$, perturbing term from the Hamiltonian of a linear oscillatory system.

The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> this <b>passage</b> is <b>of</b> order of $\varepsilon$. We provide asymptotic formulas that describe effects <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> through a resonance with an accuracy $O(\varepsilon^{\frac 32 }) $.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{function}} was assessed in six patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had developed diarrhoea on treatment with Auranofin. With {{the administration of}} Auranofin whole gut transit time decreased markedly (to 50 % or less of control values) in five of six patients. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> of intestinal contents through the colon was certainly increased but attempts to assess transit through the upper gastrointestinal tract failed because the breath hydrogen method gave inconclusive results. There {{was no evidence of}} colitis and in all cases biopsy of the rectal mucosa appeared normal by light microscopy. In the five patients with rapid intestinal transit faecal weight increased more than two-fold (range + 44 to + 335 %) although in only three cases were the changes sufficient to cause an increased frequency of bowel action. Overall the concentration of sodium in faecal water increased three-fold (mean values rose from 10. 6 to 38. 3 mmol/l). There were no significant changes in the concentrations of either potassium or chloride but bicarbonate was reduced. Faecal pH fell from a mean value of 7. 5 (range 6. 8 - 7. 9) to a mean value of 6. 4 (range 6. 0 - 7. 4). In the three patients who developed overt diarrhoea and in two others taking Auranofin the intestinal uptake of 51 Cr-EDTA was increased on average three-fold and there was a similar change in the ratio of the absorption of lactulose/mannitol. The mean clearance of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract was doubled. These data indicate an increase in intestinal permeability. In contrast the absorption of vitamin B 12 was unaffected and there was no significant change in the excretion of faecal fat although one patient developed mild steatorrhoea. Thus in a selected group of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis the administration of Auranofin caused diarrhoea in association with a reversible defect in intestinal permeability but without significant change in the absorption of nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Background Locomotion {{results from}} the {{generation}} of ground reaction forces (GRF) that cause translations {{of the center of}} mass (COM) and generate moments that rotate the body around the COM. The trot is a diagonally-synchronized gait performed by horses at intermediate locomotor speeds. Passage is a variant of the trot performed by highly-trained dressage horses. It is distinguished from trot by having a slow speed of progression combined with great animation of the limbs in the swing phase. The slow <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> challenges the horse’s ability to control the sagittal-plane moments around the COM. Footfall patterns and peak GRF are known to differ between passage and trot, but their effects on balance management, which we define here as the ability to control nose-up/nose-down pitching moments around the horse’s COM to maintain a state of equilibrium, are not known. The objective was to investigate which biomechanical variables influence pitching moments around the COM in passage. Methods Three highly-trained dressage horses were captured by a 10 -camera motion analysis system (120 Hz) as they were ridden in passage over four force platforms (960 Hz). A full-body marker set was used to track the horse’s COM and measure balance variables including total body center of pressure (COP), pitching moments, diagonal dissociation timing, peak force production, limb protraction–retraction, and trunk posture. A total of twenty passage steps were extracted and partial correlation (accounting for horse) was used to investigate significant (P < 0. 05) relationships between variables. Results Hindlimb mean protraction–retraction correlated significantly with peak hindlimb propulsive forces (R = 0. 821; P < 0. 01), mean pitching moments (R = 0. 546, P = 0. 016), trunk range of motion, COM craniocaudal location and diagonal dissociation time (P < 0. 05). Discussion Pitching moments around the COM were controlled by a combination of kinematic and kinetic adjustments that involve coordinated changes in GRF magnitudes, GRF distribution between the diagonal limb pairs, and the moment arms of the vertical GRFs. The moment arms depend on hoof placements relative to the COM, which were adjusted by changing limb protraction–retraction angles. Nose-up pitching moments could also be increased by providing a larger hindlimb propulsive GRF...|$|E
40|$|Fifth stadium {{tobacco hornworm}} caterpillars, Manduca sexta (L.), given {{artificial}} diet diluted to varying extents with either cellulose or water {{compensated for the}} food's reduced nutrient content by eating more of it. This compensation was, however, in most cases not sufficient to maintain normal growth rates. When the water content of the diet was reduced, the insects ate less than the usual fresh weight of food but maintained their intake of nutrients. Nevertheless, growth rate was impaired. The insects were better able to compensate for dilution of their food with water than with cellulose. The efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) was decreased when the diet was adulterated with cellulose. At moderate dilution (50 % nutrient) this was due mostly to decreased approximate digestibility (AD), but at greater dilution (25 % and 10 % nutrient content) the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) was decreased. ECI was maintained when the water content of the diet was increased to give 50 % nutrient concentration, but was decreased when water content was changed more radically (200 %, 25 % and 10 % nutrient diets). This was due mostly to increased metabolic costs (decreased ECD) in all cases. The retention time of food in the gut was progressively decreased (i. e. <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> was increased) as nutrients were replaced by cellulose. By contrast, dilution of the diet with water resulted in only slight changes in retention time, except at extreme dilution (10 % nutrient content) when retention time was reduced. Compensation of food intake was achieved by spending more (or less) time eating. Video analysis of feeding behaviour showed that there were {{significant changes in the}} length of feeding bouts and of interfeed gaps when caterpillars fed on diets of altered composition. For diets diluted with cellulose, changes in bout length and bout frequency contributed substantially to the increased time spent feeding on the adulterated food. For diets diluted with water, however, almost all of the compensatory change in behaviour was due to increased bout length, with bout frequency affected only slightly. This suggests that volumetric feedback contributes principally to the termination of feeding bouts in caterpillars, while nutrient flow may affect both the initiation and termination of feeding. W.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to examine any {{possible}} associations between the ability to handle spoonerisms and reading skills in monolingual Persian-speaking students. Two hundred ninety seven (151 boys) monolingual Persian-speaking students from levels 1 - 5 of primary schools in Tehran underwent the Assessment of Persian Reading Ability and the Persian Spoonerism Test. Multiple regression analysis showed that spoonerism part 1, part 2 and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> spoonerism could predict 45 % of variance of the accuracy of reading words and 37 % of the accuracy <b>of</b> reading <b>passages.</b> Part 2 and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> spoonerisms could predict 26 % variance of reading comprehension; and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> spoonerisms could predict 24 % variance <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> reading <b>passages.</b> Correlational analyses revealed that age may not have any effect on the observed associations between spoonerisms and reading skills, which in turn indicated to similar properties for these cognitive functions.

40|$|Younger {{students}} {{live in a}} media-centric world. Researchers {{have shown}} that youth today spend more time watching television and movies than most any other leisure-time activity (Pearl, 1982). In addition, the presentation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passages</b> on commercial television has increased significantly in {{the past fifty years}} (Stephens, 1996). Researchers have shown that viewers automatically learn to cope with symbolic presentation methods through repeated exposure to television and visual patterns (Abelman, 1995; Bargh, 1988; Carr, 1982). Because of their increased exposure to rapid sequence and presentation speed brought on by fast-cuts/montage found in television programs aimed at youth, it may also be assumed that these individuals can comprehend these messages on a much wider scale than can their adult counterparts. One cannot assume that exposure to rapid presentation speed is simply a passive viewing activity. Further, not only are these advancements in media technology changing the way viewers look at and interpret video media, but most importantly, the widespread availability of production techniques provide easy access to capabilities that allow people to use video media to easily create their own content. It has been widely shown fashion (Tyner, 1998) that these acquisition/production opportunities also increase exponentially one’s ability to comprehend content delivered in like.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the feeding rates of Balloniscus sellowii on leaves of {{different}} decomposition stages according to their phenolic and flavonoid content. Leaves from the visually most abundant plants were offered to isopods collected from the same source site. Schinus terebinthifolius, the plant species consumed at the highest rate, was used to verify feeding rates at different decomposition stages. Green leaves were left to decompose for one, two, or three months, and then were offered to isopods. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined for all decomposition stages. Consumption and egestion rates increased throughout decomposition, were highest for two-month-old leaves, and decreased again in the third month. The assimilation rate was highest for green leaves. The mode time of passage through the gut was two hours for all treatments. Ingestion of leaves occurred after two or three days for green leaves, and on the same day for one-, two- and three-month-old leaves. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> of leaves with different decomposition stages through the gut does not differ significantly when animals are fed continuously. However, it is possible that the amount retained in the gut during starvation differs depending on food quality. The digestibility value was corrected using a second food source to empty the gut of previously ingested food, so that all of the food from the experiment was egested. The digestibility value was highest for green leaves, whereas it was approximately 20 % for all other stages. This was expected given that digestibility declines during decomposition as the metabolite content of the leaves decreases. The phenolic content was highest in the green leaves and lowest in three-month-old leaves. The flavonoid content was highest in green leaves and lowest after two months of decomposition. Animals ingested more phenolics when consumption was highest. The estimated amount of ingested flavonoids followed the same trend as assimilation rate. Flavonoids accounted for a large portion of total phenolics, and the estimated amount of flavonoids consumed was similar for one-, two- and three-month-old leaves. Our results suggest that the high phenolic and flavonoid concentrations in green leaves are feeding deterrents. Isopods may discriminate among concentrations of flavonoids and modify their consumption rates to maintain their intake of flavonoids when ingesting leaves with lower flavonoid content...|$|E
40|$|Specifics of {{technology}} of prepregs obtaining, namely, semi-finished composite materials which contain a predetermined amount of fibrous filler and a polymer matrix are analyzed. It was studied {{that they are}} obtained from impregnation {{in such a way}} that the most of the physical-chemical properties of the reinforcing material are realized, and to provide specified physical and mechanical performance properties. The main fields of the prepregs application, including aviation, space, nuclear industry, pipeline transportation, construction, wind energy, medicine, sports industry etc. are described. It is shown that provision of certain content of the polymer matrix in the impregnated filler is not less important than its uniform distribution over the cross section and length of the filler. This can be achieved by precise wringing of filler that is saturated with impregnating solution. However, the achieved effect of wringing is limited by forcing node capabilities on the one hand, and on the other ? by saturation of filler. It is shown that the required content of the polymer binder in the fibrous fillers can also be provided by precise control of the viscosity (by varying of solvent content) of impregnating solution in combination with a certain <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> of the filler through the impregnator (by varying a speed of drawing through). It is ascertained that in the technological processes of impregnation and drying of the fabric viscosity and amount of applied polymeric binder, the strength of the fabric tension, the temperature and duration of drying, the amount of volatiles and other parameters are tightly controlled. It is noted that in the technology of production of prepregs a key part is impregnation-drying lines. In this case, vertical type of impregnation and drying equipment, in contrast to the impregnation and drying equipment of horizontal type, allows to save production area considerably, which is an important factor. It is shown that not less important is the achievement of power saving of basic prepregs preparation process, namely, impregnation, for example by integrated using of ultrasonic. Constructive and technological features of modern impregnation-drying equipment designed to obtain prepregs by domestic, Russian, European and Chinese manufacturers are analyzed. It is established that the modern drying and impregnating lines are large and technically complex engineering systems, which are provided with modern means of automatic control, safety, etc. Therefore, these lines require entirely different technological approach to impregnation and subsequent drying of impregnated glass cloth. It is stated that the basic requirements for the operation of these lines come to the need for provision of a continuous impregnation line operation when changing a roll, to the significant reduction in the amount of volatile solvents in the impregnation composition and the continuous monitoring of the content up to explosive concentrations of solvent vapor-air mixtures in the drying cell, and to the use of polymeric binders ensuring efficient drying modes at high speeds of impregnated filler movement in the drying chamber. Based on the analysis of available information it is shown that the aerodynamic heating method and coolant circulation in the drying zones distinguishes domestic impregnation machine MPT- 3 advantageously from a number of foreign counterparts, where in a similar role synthetic oil is used, providing it with a high efficiency. Besides that, the drying chamber of impregnation machine MPT- 3 M consist of two rotary heat generators which provide independent heating and maintaining of the desired temperature of the coolant in each of the drying zones. Thus the two drying zones are used to dry the impregnated fabric, and the third (middle) zone is used for pre-drying of the fabric prior to its impregnation, thereby it is conducive for the better impregnation. The spheres of integrated using of ultrasonic for achieving energy-saving by basic technological process of prepregs producing, namely impregnation, were proposed. The developed results of ultrasonic technological bases can be used for determination of energy efficient modes and structural and technological parameters of produced in the present impregnation-drying machines. Along with that, according to the developed principles the energy savings is achieved through the actions of cumulative factors. Among them are improvement of the homogenization of the polymer matrix by ultrasonic, ultrasonic activation of the surface of the fibrous fillers for improvement of their wettability by the polymer binder, degassing of structure of fibrous filler right before impregnation, increase of the productivity of the process of impregnation and dosed application of the polymer binder by increasing the speed of a fiber-fill drawing, and a significant reduction of total time of preparation of prepregs along with improvement of properties of the final cured resin composite material...|$|E

Anecdotally accidents and other frightening events are extreme examples of the latter; people who have survived accidents often report altered phenomenology including how everything appeared to happen in slow motion.

DeRose said he hoped Dealing Dogs would <b>speed</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the Pet Safety and Protection Act, which, when passed, will put Class B dealers out of business.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{negative}} environmental impact {{caused by the}} <b>passages</b> <b>of</b> different kinds of trains at variable speed. The study {{is based on the}} measurement results which took place in Poland in 2013 on the railway line no. 4. The effect of the traction unit – Pendolino (EMU 250) on the vibration climate was analysed. The impact <b>of</b> <b>passages</b> <b>of</b> new trains was compared to currently operated rolling stock. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> trains was varying between 40 and 250 km/h. Vibration measurements were conducted by stuff of an accredited Laboratory of Structural Mechanics at Cracow University of Technology (Accreditation No. AB 826). The influence of the indicated vibrations due to <b>passages</b> <b>of</b> the trains on the building in the neighbourhood of the line was investigated. The vibration assessment was done for horizontal components of vibrations according to Polish standard code. Assessment of environmental impact was presented by indicator of perceptibility of vibration through construction (WODB), which refers to the Scales of Dynamic Influences (SDI scales). The limits specified by standards in any <b>of</b> the <b>passages</b> have not been exceeded. The change <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> or rolling stock resulted in a change in the characteristic of the vibration spectrum...|$|R

5|$|In most Scottish burghs, in {{contrast}} to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, As the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed to <b>speed</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> souls to Heaven, grew rapidly. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.|$|R
25|$|Bertie {{continued}} {{to be identified with}} the court party (the future Tories) {{for the duration of the}} Cavalier Parliament. He was named to committees involved with the suppression of Catholicism and Nonconformism, but most of his Parliamentary activity in the early 1670s was related to the Bertie family's interests, or local affairs in Lincolnshire. In 1671, he was appointed to the commission on accounts for the loyal and indigent officers fund. In this role, he and John Grobham Howe were sent to Sir Edward Turnour, the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, in January 1673/4 to request that he <b>speed</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> Sir John Bennet's accounts for the fund at the Exchequer. In early February, he participated in the debate on the conduct Duke of Buckingham, suggesting that the Commons hear Sir Thomas Williams, who had reported Buckingham's condemnation of the King, before seeking concurrence from the House of Lords in their resolution condemning Buckingham.|$|R

On June 28, the House considered a bill to amend Pennsylvania's Domestic Relations Act to allow for grandparents to adopt grandchildren {{over the objections of}} their parents. Representative Egolf introduced an amendment to this bill that paralleled his anti-marriage bill. The Republican-controlled House voted to add this anti-marriage amendment to the adoption bill. The vote on the amendment was 177-16. The bill, which had already passed the State Senate, was sent back for a concurrence vote. After this vote, the House recessed for the summer. On October 1, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 43-5 to concur with the anti-marriage language added by the House. Governor Ridge signed the act into law on October 8.|$|R
