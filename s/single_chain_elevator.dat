This extracellular matrix associated protein is expressed around newly forming {{blood vessels in}} the vicinity of many types of tumours. The <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> antibody fragments were functionalised by introduction of C-terminal cysteines and linked to liposomes via maleimide groups located at the terminal ends of poly(ethylene glycol) modified phospholipids. The properties of these anti-ED-B <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> antibody fragments-liposomes were analysed in vitro on ED-B fibronectin expressing Caco- 2 cells and in vivo by studying their biodistribution and their therapeutic potential in mice bearing subcutanous F 9 teratocarcinoma tumours. Radioactively labelled ((114 m) Indium) <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> antibody fragments-liposomes accumulated in the tumours at 2 - 3 -fold higher concentrations during the first 2 h after i. v. injection compared to unmodified liposomes. After 6 - 24 h both liposome types were found in similar amounts (8 - 10 % injected dose g(- 1)) in the tumours.

Recombinant protein quality and activity of several bispecific antibodies comprising different va riable domain combinations {{with respect to}} the paren tal monospecific <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> fragments (scFv) were evaluated after expression in bacteria or mammalian cells. The parental scFv proteins humanized anti- NCAM scFv, murine anti-VEGFR- 2 scFv, murine and humanized anti-CD 3 scFv, respectively, could success fully be expressed in E. coli, whereas the murine anti-NCAM scFv version could not be reliably detected. Bispecific CD 3 × VEGFR- 2 and CD 3 × NCAM anti-bodies were expressed in the bispecific <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> and the <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> diabody format. However, the diabody derived from the murine anti-NCAM scFv could not efficiently be expressed in E. coli or in mam malian cells. Significant binding of the CD 3 × NCAM <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> diabody comprising the humanized version of anti-CD 3 and humanized version of anti-NCAM was efficient to both antigens. Nevertheless, binding of the bispecific <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> version to the NCAM antigen was inefficient in comparison to CD 3 binding.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel competitive method to select from a phage display library a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> Fv which is able to mimic the alpha-bungarotoxin binding site of the muscle nicotinic receptor. The <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> Fv was selected from a large synthetic library using alpha-bungarotoxin-coated magnetic beads. Toxin-bound phages were then eluted by competition with affinity purified nicotinic receptor. Recognition of the toxin by the anti-alpha-bungarotoxin <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> Fv was {{very similar to that}} of the receptor, such as indicated by the epitope mapping of alpha-bungarotoxin through overlapping synthetic peptides. Moreover, several positively charged residues located in the toxin second loop and in the C-terminal region were found to be critical, to a similar extent, for toxin recognition by the <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> Fv and the receptor. However, although the anti-alpha-bungarotoxin <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> Fv seems to mimic the toxin binding site of the nicotinic receptor, it does not bind other nicotinic agonists or antagonists. Our results suggest that competitive selection of anti-ligand antibody phages can allow the production of receptor-mimicking molecules directly and exclusively targeted at one specific ligand. Since physiologically and pharmacologically different ligands can produce opposite effects on receptor functions, such selective ligand decoys can have important therapeutic applications...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} {{vaccination}} approach for prevention of {{type 1 diabetes}} (T 1 D) that selectively attenuates self-reactive T-cells targeting specific autoantigens, we selected phage-displayed <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> antigen receptor libraries for clones binding to a complex of the NOD classII MHC I-A(g 7) and epitopes derived from the islet autoantigen RegII. Libraries were generated from B-cell receptor repertoires of classII-mismatched mice immunized with RegII-pulsed NOD antigen presenting cells or from T-cell receptor repertoires in pancreatic lymph nodes of NOD mice. Both approaches yielded clones recognizing a RegII-derived epitope {{in the context of}} I-A(g 7), which activated autoreactive CD 4 (+) T-cells. A receptor with different specificity was obtained by converting the BDC 2. 5 TCR into <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> form. B- but not T-cells from donors vaccinated with the clones transferred protection from diabetes to NOD-SCID recipients if the specificity of the diabetes inducer cell and the <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> receptor were matched. B-cells and antibodies from donors vaccinated with the BDC 2. 5 <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> receptor induced a state of profound anergy in T-cells of BDC 2. 5 TCR transgenic NOD recipients while B-cells from donors vaccinated with a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> receptor specific for I-A(g 7) RegII peptide complexes induced only partial non-responsiveness. Vaccination of normal NOD mice with receptors recognizing I-A(g 7) RegII peptide complexes or with the BDC 2. 5 <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> receptor delayed onset of T 1 D.

The plasminogen activating potential of <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> JMI- 229 rt-PA was 5 -fold {{lower than that of}} commercially available human rt-PA (Actilyse) in the absence of fibrin, but comparable in the presence of fibrin; it showed a concentration-dependent binding to fibrin, with a significantly more pronounced binding than Actilyse at low fibrin concentration (85 +/- 8 % versus 20 +/- 7 % at 0. 025 mg/ml fibrin; p = 0. 004). In human plasma in the absence of fibrin, the concentrations of both <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> and two-chain JMI- 229 rt-PA required to induce 50 % fibrinogen degradation in 2 h, were about 15 -fold higher than those of Actilyse.

Title: Epitope Stability in <b>Single</b> <b>Chain</b> Trimers of a Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Molecule. Major Professor: Dr. John Martinko The {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I molecule (MHC I) binds antigenic peptides of 8 - 10 amino acids and present them to CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells. Peptide epitopes displayed on the MHC I are targeted by the T cells. Better presentation of peptides was accomplished with a MHC <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimer (SCT). A <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimer is an engineered version of the MHC class I molecule with the β 2 m leader peptide, the antigen peptide, the β 2 m and the heavy chain covalently linked through linker peptides. An engineered disulfide trap improved presentation and recognition of peptides by T cells and B cells. In this project, we investigated changes in epitope recognition of the disulfide-trapped <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimers. We hypothesized that the disulfide trap in <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimers will display a T-cell recognizable epitope even with low affinity peptides. In order to demonstrate and confirm the hypothesis, the SIINFEKL/H- 2 Kb <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimer was mutated to obtain different peptide epitope analogs. The constructs were tested for expression with specific monoclonal antibodies 25 -D 1. 16 (specific for Kb/Ova complex), B 8 - 24 - 3 (specific for folded Kb), and the 64 - 3 - 7, specific for unfolded MHC I. The <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimer constructs were tested for T cell recognition with the B 3 Z assay, T cell clones that recognize SIINFEKL/Kb. A peptide competition assay {{was used to test}} displacement of peptides in <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> trimers by exogenous OVA, and a heterologous competitor, SIYRYYGL, both Kb high affinity binding peptides. We showed that the disulfide trap stabilizes interaction with strong binding peptides SIINFEKL and SIINYEKL, excluding competitors. However, weak binding peptides, even when bound to the site via disulfide trap are still displaced. We also found that the disulfide trap does not allow monoclonal antibody or T cell recognition in the absence of conserved anchor residues. We demonstrated that the B 3 Z assay is more sensitive in our hands the flow cytometry, showing expression of Kb on the surface...|$|R
