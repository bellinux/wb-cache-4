50|$|Although a {{powerful}} engine for its time, the 16 Valve engine can experience some {{problems that can}} be solved easily. One of the few problems is oil pump gear problems leading to broken timing belts. The oil pump gear itself can fail around the mounting flange, or, more often, the weak 8.8(grade 5) grade bolt holding the gear can break. It is strongly recommended to use a 10.9 (grade 8) grade bolt when replacing the oil pump gear. Another cause for timing belt failure is improperly adjusting the timing belt on engines with a manual tensioner (1989 to very early 1990 models only) or improperly adjusting the balance shaft belt. Because this is an interference engine, damage will occur if the timing belt fails. Another common occurrence is that the balance shaft's oil seals are prone to leak on older engines. New replacement sealings tend to start leaking again due to 'worn in irregularities' on the shaft itself. Many people have removed the balance shaft belt or the balance <b>shaft</b> <b>assemblies</b> altogether to prevent belt failure and/or leakage. The balance shafts are only there to lessen high rpm second order vibrations, and removing them will only affect high rpm vibrations. Once all the common problems are solved, the 16 Valve engines are just as reliable as their SOHC counterparts.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to find a}} simple, {{practical}} and sufficiently accurate method for finding the natural frequencies of a propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>assembly.</b> The need for such methods is felt at the early design stages when sufficient data about the system is not available and the need to restrict the cost of analysis is of importance. Due to these facts {{it is clear that the}} methods based on the discretization of the continuum, which can estimate the natural frequencies accurately may not be advisable to go in for in the initial stages. [...] In the class of approximate methods, to which this work belongs, investigations done so far have crudely modelled the propeller, which was avoided in the present work. The propeller was considered to be a flexible rotor mounted with blades. [...] To solve the problem analysis was carried out in three parts. First the blade was studied for the natural frequencies, mode shapes, static deflections and the steady state stresses. The blade was assumed to be a cantilever and the results were cross-checked by a preliminary finite element analysis using beam elements. The assumption was found to be quite valid after doing the finite element analysis using 3 -D isoparametric 20 noded elements. For the airfoil blade effects of rotation, shear deflection, rotary inertia, pitch setting angle were taken into consideration. Second the shaft-rotor system was studied and the equation for the transverse vibrations was derived in the complex plane which was solved for the natural frequencies. Effects of forward and reverse whirl, fixed and simply supported forward bearing end conditions, tail shaft length variation, rotary inertia and shear deflection were investigated. Lastly the natural frequencies of the blades and the shaft-rotor system were coupled to give the resultant natural frequency of the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>assembly.</b> The hydrodynamic effect has been taken into consideration by incorporating the added mass effects for the propeller. Two approximations for the natural frequency of the assembly were arrived at, the zeroth order and the first order. The true value of the frequency is supposed to lie in between the two limits. Effects due to change in the number of blades, blade geometry and the shaft parameters on the propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>assembly</b> were checked for. Agreement between the results obtained from the present work and with those available in the literature was found to be excellent. Finite element analysis comparisons also were very satisfactory...|$|E
