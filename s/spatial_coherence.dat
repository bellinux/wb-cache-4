25|$|A {{calculation}} of the MPE for ocular exposure {{takes into account the}} various ways light can act upon the eye. For example, deep-ultraviolet light causes accumulating damage, even at very low powers. Infrared light with a wavelength longer than about 1400nm is absorbed by the transparent parts of the eye before it reaches the retina, which means that the MPE for these wavelengths is higher than for visible light. In addition to the wavelength and exposure time, the MPE takes into account the spatial distribution of the light (from a laser or otherwise). Collimated laser beams of visible and near-infrared light are especially dangerous at relatively low powers because the lens focuses the light onto a tiny spot on the retina. Light sources with a smaller degree of <b>spatial</b> <b>coherence</b> than a well-collimated laser beam, such as high-power LEDs, lead to a distribution of the light over a larger area on the retina. For such sources, the MPE is higher than for collimated laser beams. In the MPE calculation, the worst-case scenario is assumed, in which the eye lens focuses the light into the smallest possible spot size on the retina for the particular wavelength and the pupil is fully open. Although the MPE is specified as power or energy per unit surface, {{it is based on the}} power or energy that can pass through a fully open pupil (0.39cm2) for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This is relevant for laser beams that have a cross-section smaller than 0.39cm2. The IEC-60825-1 and ANSIZ136.1 standards include methods of calculating MPEs.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{analysis}} of structures with localized nonlinearities, such as intermittent contacts of cracked structures, is a computationally demanding task {{because of the}} large size of the models involved. Thus, high-resolution finite element models are often reduced using a variety of specialized techniques which exploit <b>spatial</b> <b>coherences</b> in the dynamics. In addition, when a steady-state forced response analysis is performed, direct time integration can be replaced with multi-harmonic balance methods. Recently, a technique based on bi-linear normal modes has been successfully applied to piecewise-linear oscillators. The key idea of that approach is to represent the <b>spatial</b> <b>coherences</b> in the system dynamics with two sets of normal modes with special boundary conditions, referred to as bi-linear modes. In this paper, the bi-linear modal representation is extended to the case of intermittent contacts with friction. Furthermore, a novel reduced order modeling method is developed for the 0 th order harmonic used in multi-harmonic balance methods. The forced response of a cracked structure is used to demonstrate the proposed method...|$|R

As the source grating can contain a large number of individual apertures, each creating a sufficiently coherent virtual line source, standard X-ray generators with source sizes of a few square millimeters can be used efficiently and the field of view can be significantly increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{decoherence}} in discrete-time quantum {{walks in}} terms of a phenomenological model that distinguishes spin and spatial decoherence. We identify the dominating mechanisms that affect quantum walk experiments realized with neutral atoms walking in an optical lattice. From the measured spatial distributions, we determine with good precision the amount of decoherence per step, which provides a quantitative indication of the quality of our quantum walks. In particular, we find that spin decoherence is the main mechanism responsible for the loss of coherence in our experiment. We also find that the sole observation of ballistic instead of diffusive expansion in position space is not a good indicator for the range of coherent delocalization. We provide further physical insight by distinguishing the effects of short and long time spin dephasing mechanisms. We introduce the concept of coherence length in the discrete-time quantum walk, which quantifies the range of <b>spatial</b> <b>coherences.</b> Unexpectedly, we find that quasi-stationary dephasing does not modify the local properties of the quantum walk, but instead affects <b>spatial</b> <b>coherences.</b> For a visual representation of decoherence phenomena in phase space, we have developed a formalism based on a discrete analogue of the Wigner function.

50|$|For {{interference}} lithography to be successful, coherence requirements must be met. First, a spatially {{coherent light}} source must be used.

The <b>spatial</b> <b>coherence</b> guarantees a uniform wavefront prior to beam splitting. Second, it is preferred to use a monochromatic or temporally coherent light source. This is readily achieved with a laser but broadband sources would require a filter.

Similarly, if in a double-slit experiment, the space between the two slits is increased, the coherence dies gradually and finally the fringes disappear, showing <b>spatial</b> <b>coherence.</b> In both cases, the fringe amplitude slowly disappears, as the path difference increases past the coherence length.|$|E
