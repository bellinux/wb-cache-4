40|$|Compact muon solenoid (CMS) is a {{general-purpose}} detector {{designed to}} run at the highest luminosity at the CERN large hadron collider (LHC). Its distinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6 m diameter by 12. 5 m long free bore, enclosed inside a 10000 -ton return yoke made of construction steel. Accurate characterization of the magnetic field everywhere in theCMSdetector, including the large ferromagnetic parts of the yoke, is required. To measure the field in and around ferromagnetic parts, a set of flux-loops and Hall probe sensors will be installed on several of the steel pieces. Fast discharges of the solenoid during system commissioning tests {{will be used to}} induce voltages in the flux-loops that can be integrated to measure the flux in the steel at full excitation of the solenoid. The Hall sensors will give supplementary information on the axial magnetic field and permit estimation of the remanent field in the steel after the fast discharge. An experimental R&D program has been undertaken, using a test flux-loop, two Hall sensors, and sample disks made from the same construction steel used for the CMS magnet yoke.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{different}} {{models for the}} prediction of dry density from parameters measured on green wood was tried on different datasets. Data from old literature have been utilized to derive a multivariate PLS model and to compare the significance of different variables. The data was presented as average data for different stands from four different locations in Sweden. Validation was performed by applying the models on two different datasets: One small sample from southern Finland and the large data gathered by STFI and Skogforsk in the project “Skog Massa Papper”. The Finnish data was acquired by measuring properties of log stumps from CT-scanned images. Derived models were compared with an algebraic derived model and the density correction suggested by EN 384. The multivariate model, using green density and position in the stem, can predict dry density of heartwood of Swedish Spruce with a R² of about 60 % and a standard error of prediction of 27. 4 kg/m³ on a <b>sample</b> <b>disc</b> as its best. This is slightly better compared to single variable models only utilizing the green density as variable. The correlation on the testset was 78 % which is promising when considering that mill specific models should be made in case of industrial implementation which should also improve the models fit on a validation data.

40|$|An accurate, all-digital {{measurement}} {{system has been}} developed {{for use in a}} centrifugal analyzer system. The output of the radiation detector is converted directly to a digital count by a new type of charge-to-count convert-er. The converter is characterized by exceptional linear-ity and stability, and has a wide dynamic range. A gating and counting unit integrates the output of the charge-to-count converter and simultaneously measures the period of integration. The integration effectively discrimi-nates against noise and allows an optimum amount of information to be extracted from the signal during the measurement period. Measurement of the integration period reduces requirements for synchronization and control devices, thus simplifying overall analyzer design. Control and data manipulation functions are performed by a minicomputer. The programs were written in OS/ 8 FORTRAN. The basic measurement principles of the new system and test results are described.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the color change of five aesthetic dental materials, before and after immersion in distilled water and blue food color solution for 7 and 21 days, and to study the effect of finishing the surfaces on any color change. MethodsDisc shaped samples of five types of light curing composite (A 2) (n= 10 samples/composite) were prepared and all samples were light-cured with a Plasma Arc light cure unit for ten seconds. One side of each <b>sample</b> <b>disc</b> was finished and polished with a Super-Snap system all samples. After 24 h, color measurements of each sample were conducted using a digital spectrophotometer. Five sample discs from each composite group were immersed in 30 ml of food color solution for 7 and 21 days, while the remaining five sample discs were immersed in 30 ml of distilled water as a control. Color measurements were repeated for all samples at 7 and 21 days after immersion. The color changes were statistically analyzed using t-tests within the same group. A result was considered statistically significant at α= 0. 05. ResultsThe color differences (ΔE) ranged from 0. 4 to 4. 66 and statistically significant differences on the finished and unfinished surfaces were observed after immersion in the food color solution for 7 days. No significant differences were found in any group after immersion in the food color solution for 21 days. The Tetric EvoCeram and Arabesk groups showed less color differences after 7 and 21 days than other composites. ConclusionFinished composite surfaces showed less coloration than unfinished surfaces after 7 days, but all surfaces (finished and unfinished) were highly colored for all composite types after 21 days...|$|E

Viscous food samples are placed in two-piece tubular holders (0. 9 mm inner diameter, 1. 2 mm outer diameter) made from sterling silver, and rapidly frozen. The holders are inserted into the brass block under 1 iquid nitrogen and tightened with individual setscrews. A handle screwed into the central hole of the block facilitates manipulation of the block. The samples are fractured inside the Cryotrans CT 1000 assembly by knocking off the part of the sample located in the upper tube. The subsequent operations are the same as those suggested by Hexland. A second simple type of holder has been developed for low-moisture foods, such as cheese, which are resistant to ice crystal formation during freezing.

40|$|This thesis treats {{static and}} dynamic surface {{characterization}} using radiometric and Fourier optical methods. A Fourier optical method {{has been developed}} for real time image processing in paper production and printing applications. It {{has been shown that}} the method can be used to measure crepe frequency, an important parameter in tissue paper production, as well as to monitor the wire mark pattern at paper web velocities of up to 20 m/s. The wire mark pattern has been used to measure dimensional variations across a paper web. These are important for the mechanical properties of paper. Imaging of the moving surfaces onto a spatial light modulator, necessary for Fourier optical analysis of opaque objects, constitutes a motion blur problem. This problem has been solved by means of optical motion compensation using a rotating mirror. A rotating mirror system has also been developed for the inspection of small particles fixed to a rotating <b>sample</b> <b>disc.</b> The optical motion compensation configurations have made exposure times of more than two orders of magnitude longer than the exposure time without compensation possible. A light scattering model for opaque objects, for example coated paper, has also been developed and verified, with a coefficient of determination between theory and measurement ranging from r 2 = 0. 84 to r 2 = 0. 98, on various paper samples. The light scattering model has been used in the development of an instrument based on the photometric stereo principle. In this instrument the reflectance (or color) and topography of opaque samples are determined from two or more images of the sample illuminated from different directions. The method has been successfully used for studies of the relation between topography and print results in gravure and flexographic printing. Comparisons of surface height profiles measured with the photometric stereo method and profiles obtained with mechanical and optical scanning stylus instruments have shown coefficients of determination of up to r 2 = 0. 97. The main advantages of the method are the high speed, the scalability and the ability to obtain reflectance and surface height maps of a surface simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most severe complications of titanium based implants which leads to complete implant failure. The treatment of such infections requires multiple surgeries followed by long term antibiotic therapies with significant traumatic consequences to patients and high financial burden for healthcare systems. One option to increase the resistance of titanium implants to bacterial {{infection is}} to create an antimicrobial layer on the implant surface without affecting its biocompatibility. Ag based antimicrobial surfaces are currently studied with good antimicrobial activity against multidrug resistant bacteria (e. g. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - MRSA). However silver proved to induce quite strong cytotoxic effect to host cells which may impede the osseointegration process of titanium bone implants. Recently it has been shown that Cu ions (Cu 2 +) seem to be suitable both to kill specific bacteria and stimulate biological responses like cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Therefore incorporation of Cu nanoparticles on a TiO 2 surface that can release Cu 2 + at the implant-tissue interface may lead to a new generation of Ti implants with dual functionalities i. e. bactericidal and osteoconductive. Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is a surface modification technique that enables incorporation of Cu nanoparticles into a porous TiO 2 layer. Furthermore, this technique is suitable to cover complex implant geometries such as hip or knee components. Cu-bearing TiO 2 layers were synthesised by PEO on Ti 6 Al 7 Nb biomedical alloy and characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X‐ray diffraction (XRD). The analyses revealed that the TiO 2 layers were rough, completely covered with interconnected micro pores and Cu nanoparticles had been successfully incorporated into the surface. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis was used to quantify the release of Cu 2 + from the surface of Cu-bearing layers into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) media. Cu 2 + showed sustained release over a period of sixty days. A direct contact assay was used to assess the in vitro surface antibacterial activity of the Cu-bearing TiO 2 layers against specific concentrations of S. aureus and MRSA bacterial species. Both bacterial species were completely killed after 24 hours. An agar diffusion assay was used to study the leachable antibacterial activity of the Cu-bearing TiO 2 layers against S. aureus. A bacterial growth inhibition zone was observed around the <b>sample</b> <b>disc</b> indicating Cu had an at least bacteriostatic effect against bacteria-containing agar. Overall, Cu-bearing layers displayed good antibacterial activity against the pathogen which is the most common cause of bacterial infection in implants (S. aureus) and against a virulent multi-drug resistant pathogen (MRSA). The release of Cu 2 + into PBS coupled with the inhibition of bacterial growth by Cu-bearing TiO 2 layers suggest that a sustained antibacterial effect of Cu-bearing TiO 2 layers is possible which could extend to its surroundings.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Forensic DNA {{profiling}} {{is widely}} used as an identification tool for associating an individual with evidence of a crime. Analysis of a DNA sample involves observation of data {{in the form of}} an electropherogram, and subsequently annotating a DNA “profile” from an individual or from the evidence. The profile obtained from the evidence can be compared to reference profiles deposited in a national DNA database, which may include the potential contributor. Following a match, a random match probability is calculated to determine how common that genotype is in the population. This is the probability of obtaining that same DNA profile by sampling from a pool of unrelated individuals. Each state has adopted various laws requiring suspects and/or offenders to submit a DNA sample for the national database (such as California’s law that all who are arrested must provide a DNA sample). These profiles can then be associated with past unsolved crimes, and remain in the database to be searched in the event of future crimes. In the case of database samples, a physical sample of the offender’s DNA must be kept on file in the laboratory indefinitely so that in the event of a database hit, the sample is able to be retested. Current methods are to collect a buccal swab or blood sample, and store the DNA extracts under strict preservation conditions, i. e. cold storage, typically - 20 ° C. With continually increasing number of samples submitted, a burden is placed on crime labs to store these DNA extracts. A solution was required to help control the costs of properly storing the samples. FTA™ paper was created to fulfill the need for inexpensive, low maintenance, long term storage of biological samples, which makes it ideal for use with convicted offender DNA samples. FTA™ paper is a commercially produced, chemically treated paper that allows DNA to be stored at room temperature for years with no costly storage facilities or conditions. Once a sample is required for DNA testing, a small disc is removed and is to be used directly in a PCR reaction. A high quality profile is important for comparing suspect profiles to unknown or database profiles. A single difference between a suspect and evidentiary sample can lead to exclusion. Unfortunately, the DNA profile results yielded from the direct addition have been unfavorable. Thus, most crime laboratories will extract the DNA from the disc, leading to additional time and cost to analyze a reference sample. Many of the profiles from the direct addition of an FTA™ disc result in poor quality profiles, likely due to an increase in PCR inhibitors and high concentrations of DNA. Currently, standardized protocols regarding the recommended locations for removal of a <b>sample</b> <b>disc</b> from a bloodspot on an FTA™ card does not exist. This study aims to validate the optimal location by comparing DNA profiles obtained from discs removed from the center, halfway, and edge locations of a bloodspot from 50 anonymous donors. Optimal punch location was first scored on the number of failed, partial or discordant profiles. Then, profile quality was determined based on peak characteristics of the resulting DNA profiles. The results for all three disc locations were 5. 3 % failed amplifications, 4. 2 % partial amplifications, and one case of a discordant profile. Profile quality for the majority of the samples showed a high incidence of stutter and the absence of non-template adenylation. Of the three disc locations, the edge of the blood stain was ideal, due to a presumably lower concentration of DNA and likely more dilute amount of the PCR inhibitor heme. Therefore, based on the results of this study, there is a greater probability of success using a sample from the edge of a blood stain spotted in FTA™ paper than any other location of the FTA™ card...|$|E
