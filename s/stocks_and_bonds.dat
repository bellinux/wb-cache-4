The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonds</b> were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{liquidity}} {{movements in}} <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> Treasury <b>bond</b> markets {{over a period}} of more than 1800 trading days. Cross-market dynamics in liquidity are documented by estimating a vector autoregressive model for liquidity (that is, bid-ask spreads and depth), returns, volatility, and order flow in the <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> markets. We find that a shock to quoted spreads in one market affects the spreads in both markets, and that return volatility is an important driver of liquidity. Innovations to <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> market liquidity <b>and</b> volatility prove to be significantly correlated, suggesting that common factors drive liquidity and volatility in both markets. Monetary expansion increases equity market liquidity during periods of financial crises, and unexpected increases (decreases) in the federal funds rate lead to decreases (increases) in liquidity and increases (decreases) in <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> volatility.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} intertemporal {{interaction}} between the <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> market returns, {{we assume that the}} conditional covariance matrix follows a multivariate GARCH process.

Using daily data, we find strong evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the covariance between <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> market returns. The results indicate that not only variances, but also covariances respond asymmetrically to return shocks. Bad news in the <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> market is typically followed by a higher conditional covariance than good news. Cross asymmetries, that is, asymmetries followed from shocks of opposite signs, appear to be important as well. Covariances between <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>bond</b> returns tend to be relatively low after bad news in the <b>stock</b> market <b>and</b> good news in the bond market.

From time to time, the research units of banks and government departments produce studies of profitability in various sectors of industry. The National Statistics Office of Britain now releases company profitability statistics every quarter, showing increasing profits. The American-Jewish magazine Tablet claims that “ essential idea, influenced by Ricardo, was that capitalism would become less and less profitable and that its downward spiral toward the abyss of deflation—lower prices, lower profits—would be followed by worldwide revolution.

25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). <b>Stocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bonds</b> perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of the American political system. This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E
