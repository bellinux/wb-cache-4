40|$|Oyster {{production}} from private grounds in Virginia has declined significantly since 1960. Restoring industry production requires {{a better understanding}} of the reasons for this decline. Currently, state fishery managers and the popular press attribute the decline to the oyster disease Haplosporidiuni nelsoni (MSX). In fact, private planters themselves consider MSX disease as the primary constraint on the future profitability of private oyster culture. This study analyzes potential causes of the decline using a simulation model of oyster production with data from the 1960 s, 1970 s, and 1980 s. The analysis suggests that rising seed prices driven by economic and productivity changes are more important than MSX in reducing the economic incentives to private <b>planting.</b> Therefore, reducing <b>oyster</b> seed prices is an effective policy strategy. However, education of planters will also he needed to assure {{a better understanding of}} the profit potential in <b>oyster</b> <b>planting.</b> bioeconomic model, <b>oysters,</b> Haplosporidium nelsoni, economic returns, simulation, private <b>oyster</b> <b>planting</b> risk, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

5000|$|Salsifies are {{one example}} where hybrid {{speciation}} has been observed. In the early 1900s, humans introduced three species of goatsbeard into North America. These species, the western salsify (T. dubius), the meadow salsify (T. pratensis), and the <b>oyster</b> <b>plant</b> (T. porrifolius), are now common weeds in urban wastelands. In the 1950s, botanists found two new {{species in the}} regions of Idaho and Washington, where the three already known species overlapped.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 36 - 42). Tragopogon porrifolius (Purple salsify) {{is commonly}} known as the <b>oyster</b> <b>plant</b> or vegetable <b>oyster.</b> It is cultivated for its florid flower, edible root and shoot, and herbal qualities. The present research project investigates the effects of the water extract of Tragopogon porrifolius shoot upon lipemia, glycemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, hepatotoxicity and gastric ulcer using a rat model. After one month of Tragopogon porrifolius water extract intake (50, 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight) via drinking water, animals exhibited a significant decrease in the levels of serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose and liver enzyme (ALP, ALT, LDH). Pretreatment of the rats with the extract at 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg body weight demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects in both acute (51, 82, 92 %) and chronic (18, 59, 85 %) inflammation induced by carrageenan and formalin respectively. The extract also showed effective anti-ulcerogenic property (42, 64 and 76 %) against ethanol induced gastric ulcer. Consistent dose dependent protection against paracetamol induced toxicity was observed after testing the serum levels of ALT, ALP, AST and LDH. Tragopogon porrifolius also revealed effective anti-oxidant capacity due to its notable scavenging activity against 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals (81 %). In conclusion, it can be inferred that Tragopogon porrifolius provides a potential source of therapeutic herbal supplements. 1 bound copy: vii, 42 leaves; col. ill.; 30 cm. Available at RNL...|$|R

50|$|Olympia oysters are {{the only}} native oyster to the West Coast of North America. The {{establishment}} of a commercial fishery in the 1860s confirms a historical population within Netarts bay, with evidence of harvesting along the West Coast of North America by humans going back 4000 years. Due to over harvesting, increased consumption, and the export of adult oysters to San Francisco Bay, oyster populations declined in the late 1800s and the commercial fishery collapsed. The last known naturally occurring population of Olympia oysters in Netarts was surveyed in 1954. Subsequent field surveys in 1979 and 1992 {{did not find any}} Olympia oysters within the bay. Potential factors preventing population recovery post fishery collapse include: habitat degradation, sedimentation by increased motorized boat use, suffocation by burrowing shrimp, pollution, predation by invasive Japanese oyster drill and parasitism by non-native flat worm After their 1992 survey, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began a large scale restoration attempt in Netarts, setting out 9 million spat between 1993-1998. Olympia oyster populations did not return to historical levels, but surveys in 2004 detected low populations of transplanted oysters in the bay. Anecdotal observations from residents also suggest small pockets of naturally occurring oysters subsist in the southwest corner of the bay. Juvenile <b>oysters</b> <b>planted</b> on adult <b>oyster</b> shell as substrate demonstrated that Olympia oysters can grow and reproduce in the bay. Small scale, investigative restoration projects run by The Nature Conservancy were undertaken in 2005 and 2006 to rebuild populations of Olympia oysters in Netarts Bay by adding shell cultch with set Olympia oysters to the bay in hopes of increasing settlement substrate and broodstock. Early monitoring of these sites found reproductive tissue and brooded larvae in adults and recruitment of larvae on shell substrate, but monitoring of the site ceased in 2007. Restoration interests are driven by culinary interest in Olympia oysters, the potential economic benefits of a commercial fishery, and the significant ecosystem services that Olympia oysters provide, including filtering the water and providing substrate for other organisms.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Results of {{this study}} suggest that {{laboratory}} growth of full-sib families of five month old Pacific oyster spat can be predictive of growth to market size at different grow-out sites. Seven to ten millimeter spat were selected from each of fifteen full-sib families and commercially available polyploids. Each family was split into two groups and exposed to either variable salinity (V. S., 3 - 30 ppt) or constant salinity (C. S., 30 ppt) laboratory conditions for five months, then planted at either an upriver or downriver subtidal site in the Yaquina estuary, Oregon. After six months of growth in the estuary, the rankings of the families based on average individual weights, specific growth rates (SGR), survival and yields were compared between laboratory and estuary sites. There was a significant effect of family, laboratory treatment and site upon final individual live weights of oysters in the estuary (P= 0. 0001). The rankings of families based on average individual laboratory weights were correlated with average individual estuary weights at the downriver site (C. S. oysters, P= 0. 010, V. S. oysters, P= 0. 005). Tetraploid oysters grew to heavier final estuary weights than either triploids or diploids, with individual C. S. tetraploids averaging 79. 4 g live weight by fifteen months of age. Laboratory family rankings based on SGRs were negatively correlated with estuary rankings of family SGRs for all treatments (P< 0. 0001, Rho=- 0. 668). Rankings of families based on laboratory yields on day 60 were correlated with standardized estuary yield rankings for all treatments, except V. S. <b>oysters</b> <b>planted</b> downriver. Laboratory yields of families were also found to be predictive of estuary yields at an intertidally planted site in Sequim Bay, Washington, indicating the potential for predicting yields across a wide range of sites and culture methods (subtidal vs. intertidal). Oyster breeding programs may realize more efficient progress from the results {{of this study}}. If family yields at grow-out sites can be predicted from spat yields in the laboratory, poor and average families could be identified early at the spat stage, eliminating the need to expend resources to plant them out at test sites...|$|R

40|$|Historically, America's use and {{enjoyment}} of the oyster extend far back into prehistoric times. The Native Americans often utilized oysters, more intensively in some areas than in others, and, {{at least in some}} areas of the Caribbean and Pacific coast, the invading <b>Spanish</b> sought <b>oysters</b> as eagerly as they did gold-but for the pearls. That was the pearl oyster, Pinctada sp., and signs of its local overexploitation were recorded early in the 16 th century. During the 1800 's, use of the eastern oyster grew phenomenally and, for a time, it outranked beef as a source of protein {{in some parts of the}} nation. Social events grew up around it, as it became an important aspect of culture and myth. Eventually, research on the oyster began to blossom, and scientific literature on the various species likewise bloomed-to the extent that when the late Paul Galtsoff wrote his classic treatise "The American oyster Crassostrea virginica Gmelin" in 1954, he reported compiling an extensive bibliography of over 6, 000 subject and author cards on oysters and related subjects which he deposited in the library of the Woods Hole Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (now NMFS). That large report, volume 64 (480 pages) of the agency's Fishery Bulletin, was a bargain at 2. 75, and it has been a standard reference ever since. But the research and the attendant literature have grown greatly since Galtsoff's work was published, and now that has been thoroughly updated. ...|$|R

At harvest, a significantly higher cumulative number of flushes, caps and fresh mass of oyster mushrooms was observed in wheat straw and thatch grass compared with wood chips. The results demonstrated that thatch grass could be used as a viable alternative to the commonly used wheat straw. ARC–ITSC and AgriSETA. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Biologically, oysters {{are not in}} {{the plant}} kingdom, {{but when it comes to}} ethical eating, they are almost indistinguishable from <b>plants.</b> <b>Oyster</b> farms account for 95 percent of all oyster {{consumption}} and have a minimal negative impact on their ecosystems; there are even nonprofit projects devoted to cultivating oysters as a way to improve water quality. Since so many oysters are farmed, there's little danger of overfishing. No forests are cleared for oysters, no fertilizer is needed, and no grain goes to waste to feed them—they have a diet of plankton, which is about as close to the bottom of the food chain as you can get. Oyster cultivation also avoids many of the negative side effects of plant agriculture: There are no bees needed to pollinate oysters, no pesticides required to kill off other insects, and for the most part, oyster farms operate without the collateral damage of accidentally killing other animals during harvesting.|$|R
