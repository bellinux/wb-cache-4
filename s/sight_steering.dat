40|$|ALISEO (Aerospace Leap-frog Imaging Stationary Interferometer for Earth Observation) {{belongs to}} the {{stationary}} interferometers representing a promising architecture for future Earth Observation (EO) sensors due to their simple optical layout. ALISEO has been selected by the Italian Space Agency as the principal payload for a new optical mission based on a micro-satellite (MIOsat). Payloads planned for MIOsat are an extensible telescope, a high-resolution panchromatic camera, a Mach-Zehnder MEMS interferometer, and ALISEO. MIOsat platform is expected to provide the payloads with <b>sight</b> <b>steering</b> capability, in order to mitigate the sensor’s data-rate and improve the integration time. ALISEO operates in the common-path Sagnac configuration, {{and it does not}} employ any moving part to generate phase delay between the two rays. The sensor acquires the target images modulated by a pattern of autocorrelation functions: a fringe pattern that is fixed with respect to the instrument’s field of view. The complete interferogram of each target location is retrieved introducing relative source-observer motion, which allows any image pixels to be observed under different phase delays after moving thorought the sensor’s field of view. In this paper we discuss some experimental and theoretical investigations concerning ALISEO’s architecture and performance. We describe recent advances in the optical layout selected for the sensor, as well as the outcome of simulations of its main chasracteristics. In order to refine the calibration of the optical path difference (OPD) of raw interferograms a new data-processing procedure has been developed, based on a set of measurements have been carried out using a double planar diffuser system and several coloured He-Ne lasers. Standard reflectance tiles have been use...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} for unmanned surface vessels is {{a modern}} and rapidly growing ﬁeld of research. In recent years, many concepts and solutions have been proposed {{in order to achieve}} autonomous control of marine vessels. This thesis reviews the development of an autonomous path-planning and -following system with obstacle avoidance to avoid collisions, for a model-scale surface vessel. The system was developed to be able to navigate in a global or locally known map of static obstacles, where there were uncertainties regrading unknown static and dynamic obstacle present in the area of operation. A LIDAR was used as a proximity sensor, in order for the system to sense the environment and to map the dynamic obstacles {{in the vicinity of the}} vessel, and in addition perform simultaneously localization and mapping. This information was used by the collision avoidance system in order to avoid obstacles. The autonomous path planner used in this thesis is a slightly modiﬁed version of the A* algorithm, that generates a path towards a set goal. In order to follow the path, a Line of <b>Sight</b> <b>steering</b> law has been implemented, that has been modiﬁed for use on an omnidirectional vessel. A modiﬁed version of the Dynamic Window algorithm has been developed and implemented, to enable the vessel to avoid dynamic obstacles that is met along the path. The system was designed for use on the omnidirectional vessel named the CS Saucer, which was used as the platform to test the resulting system in the NTNU Marine Cybernetics Laboratory. The experiments and computer simulations showed that the collision avoidance system could handle static obstacles very well. The collision avoidance system was also shown to handle dynamic obstacles, but there were some limitations to the system in this regards. This was mainly due to the dynamic obstacles velocity not being estimated and compensated for. This should be the main focus of further work, as well as using the obstacle velocity information to make the collision avoidance system abide the International Regulations for Avoiding Collision at Sea (COLREGS) ...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing {{satellites}} {{are often}} built with payloads {{that do not}} include line of <b>sight</b> <b>steering</b> mechanisms, such that pointing their payloads requires rotation of the whole satellite. In cases, when frequent line of sight retargeting is required, {{there is a need}} for efficient actuators and control schemes that would support rapid attitude maneuvering together with adequate pointing accuracy and stability between the maneuvers. These control schemes shall accommodate a variety of realistic conditions, such as general three dimensional maneuver direction, existence of initial and/or final angular rates, non zero net angular momentum and various actuators constraints. Within this frame, this research develops the Backwards Planning approach as one of the possible control methods for rapid maneuvering. The method is based on state feedback and combines time efficiency together with straight forward computation flow. Novel efficient methods to execute the Backwards Planning Control in the 3 D attitude space are proposed here. The methods refer both for the first saturated control phase of the maneuver and for the last braking phase. The actuators used for the spacecraft control in this research are either Reaction Wheels (RWs) or Single Gimbal Control Moment Gyros (SGCMGs) or both of them together. The advantage of the SGCMG is in rapid rotational maneuvering, but their application for high quality pointing requires very accurate gimbal mechanisms. On the other hand, RWs are usually more suitable for accurate pointing, but their torque to power performance is inferior in maneuvering. It is shown that the coordination of SGCMGs and RWs together enables to draw more performance from the SGCMGs in terms of agility and meet the pointing requirements between maneuvers where only the RWs are used. Novel SGCMG steering laws are suggested as well. While the steering laws determine the required angular rate for each gimbal, most steering laws are defined in the angular momentum domain and output the gimbals angular rates to produce a given required torque or angular momentum increment. This research however, practices a novel steering law in the gimbal angles domain. While both steering laws turn to be dynamically equivalent for small control signals, as in the steady state, it is shown that the steering in the gimbal angles domain is more effective in maneuvering with the Backwards Planning control logic.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 January 1807 Galatea was {{off the coast of}} Venezuela when she <b>sighted</b> a sail <b>steering</b> for La Guaira. Galatea {{approached}} and identified the vessel as a man-of-war; she then change her course, heading for Barcelona, Anzoátegui, which lay some 160 miles to the east. By noon Galatea was becalmed; {{at the same time a}} slight breeze enabled Galateas quarry to continue on her way. Two hours later lookouts could barely see her highest sails above the horizon.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} also tested at Lulworth, in tests against a wheeled vehicle {{to test the}} virtues of tracked and wheeled {{arrangements}} for the Prodigal air-portable tank destroyer. The vehicle chosen was the Rhino, a six-wheeled skid-steered experimental chassis, powered by a Rolls-Royce Meteorite engine. Drivers were instructed to drive in pursuit of fixed and moving targets and to track them with a simple windscreen-mounted <b>sight.</b> The Rhinos <b>steering</b> was infamously imprecise and {{it was found that}} the tracked Contentious performed better.|$|R
60|$|Among {{the many}} {{regulations}} of the Light-house Board, hanging {{against the wall}} here, many of them excellent, perhaps, {{if there were a}} regiment stationed here to attend to them, there is one requiring the keeper to keep an account of the number of vessels which pass his light during the day. But there are a hundred vessels in <b>sight</b> at once, <b>steering</b> in all directions, many on the very verge of the horizon, and he must have more eyes than Argus, and be a good deal farther-sighted, to tell which are passing his light. It is an employment in some respects best suited to the habits of the gulls which coast up and down here, and circle over the sea.|$|R
2500|$|The twelfth {{flotilla}} {{commanded by}} Captain Stirling on the destroyer leader Faulknor was following behind the First Battle Squadron. This had fallen behind the main fleet because damage to Marlborough had reduced her speed, so the destroyers were now some 10 miles behind Jellicoe. The flotilla had thirteen 'M' class destroyers plus Faulknor and another destroyer leader, Marksman. At 0143 Obedient <b>sighted</b> ships <b>steering</b> ESE in the slowly lightening dawn. The unidentified ships gave the incorrect challenge signal and an attack was begun in near ideal conditions on German dreadnought and pre-dreadnought battleships. The pre-dreadnought Pommern {{was struck by}} a torpedo. One of Obedient's officers reported: [...] "Right amidship in the Pommern appeared a dull red ball of fire. It spread fore and aft and flared up the masts in big red tongues of flame, uniting in a black cloud of smoke and sparks. Then one saw the ends of the ship come up as though her back was broken before the mist shut her out of view". Six destroyers fired seventeen torpedoes [...] at the German ships, the other destroyers being driven away by gunfire. Stirling attempted to report the engagement, making three reports, but none was received by Jellicoe, either because of damage to his radio aerials or because of German jamming. Had the signals been received, it would still have been possible for Jellicoe to turn his fleet and intercept the German ships before they reached the safety of their own minefields at 0330.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of British ships and squadrons already in the bay, and on the lookout for French ships. Zacharie Allemand, {{commander}} of the Rochefort squadron, had sailed from the port in July 1805, and was currently cruising in the Atlantic, raiding British shipping. One of the British ships sent out on patrol was the 36-gun HMS Phoenix, under the command of Captain Thomas Baker. Baker had orders to patrol west of the Scilly Isles, but in late October he received news from several neutral merchants that Allemand's squadron had been sighted in the Bay of Biscay. Baker immediately left his station and sailed southwards, reaching the latitude of Cape Finisterre on 2 November, just as Dumanoir was entering the bay. Baker <b>sighted</b> four ships <b>steering</b> north-north-west at 11 o'clock, and immediately gave chase. The ships, which Baker presumed {{to be part of the}} Rochefort squadron, but were actually Dumanoir's ships, bore up at noon and began to chase Phoenix, which fled south. In doing so Baker hoped to lure the French onto a British squadron under Captain Sir Richard Strachan that he knew to be in the area.|$|R
