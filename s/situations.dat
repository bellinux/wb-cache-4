5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social <b>situations.</b> They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive <b>situations.</b> Children learn new words in communicative <b>situations.</b> Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old <b>situations</b> to new <b>situations</b> as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new <b>situations.</b> As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new <b>situations)</b> then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a platform for}} <b>situation</b> management, which supports the development of situation-aware applications by offering (i) design artifacts for <b>situation</b> type specification, and (ii) run-time support for <b>situation</b> lifecycle management (<b>situation</b> detection, which may involve composite <b>situation</b> pattern recognition and ultimately <b>situation</b> deactivation). Our approach leverages on JBoss Drools engine (and its integrated Complex Event Processing platform) and enhances its functionality to natively support rule-based situation-awareness. Our platform allows rule-based <b>situation</b> specification (and further <b>situation</b> lifecycle management) {{by means of a}} simple rule pattern. We exemplify our situation-based development approach with an application scenario in the public health domain, in which <b>situation</b> types for detecting and monitoring suspicious cases of tuberculosis are specified as <b>situation</b> rules. The specified rules are then deployed and <b>situation</b> detection is managed by the proposed rule-based <b>situation</b> platform.

In the <b>situation</b> model, information of in-car sensors is used to build up a representation of the environment around the ego vehicle. On top of the <b>situation</b> model, a <b>situation</b> analysis is established to detect the current driving <b>situation</b> according to the given description of driving <b>situation.</b> Furthermore, we briefly discuss two applications that are using the proposed <b>situation</b> analysis to enhance safety and comfort in next generation automotive applications.

In this paper, we introduce an approach to assess host security. Analyzing process and file behaviors, we propose a series of security indices, based on which we compute the value of process <b>situation</b> (PS) and file <b>situation</b> (FS). To make the results more practical, we associate the process <b>situation</b> with its status in operating system, and then modify the file <b>situation</b> by associating it with the process <b>situation.</b> As an output, a <b>situation</b> curve is drew to display recent and past security <b>situation.</b> The experiment results show that the model can reflect host security <b>situation</b> effectively and dynamically.

This level of representation, the <b>situation</b> model, is considered tantamount to deep comprehension of the text. This paper gives an overview of the empirical results concerning the role of <b>situation</b> models in text comprehension.

Moreover, effects of <b>situation</b> models on processes involved in text comprehension as well as the representational format of <b>situation</b> models are discussed.
