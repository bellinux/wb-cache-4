40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to improve upon the current stitching pattern used in UAV catch net applications {{with the intention of}} lengthening their useable life cycle. To achieve this, a testing setup and procedure has been developed to produce material strength and stiffness data for nylon­ webbing strap, and for sewn intersections of the same strap material. The current stitching pattern was tested, and quantitatively characterized based on strength and stiffness. New stitching designs were generated and tested using the same procedure, and the results compared. This allowed for the selection of the most optimized stitching pattern that achieves the longest life without failure of the stitching or the base material (webbing). Our testing procedure is comprised of two main tensile tests; one that tests the stitching intersection in shear failure, and the other in peel failure. Force and displacement data is output through the data acquisition system for each of the tests, which yields stress­ strain data that can be analyzed to characterize the relative strength and stiffness of each setup. The test procedure outlines in detail the loading of the test specimen into the machine, the setup for the machine, and the setup for the data acquisition system. Our stitching pattern redesign begins with a failure model based on theoretical assumptions about how each independent <b>stitched</b> <b>joint</b> is loaded. This theoretical analysis is complimented by our experimental data, to determine what characteristics contribute to the strength of the stitching pattern. The main design goal is to improve the design in peel failure, which is the primary failure mode for nets currently in use. Pattern redesign is an ongoing and iterative process; and thus, additional testing iterations could result in an even more improved design...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of Kevlar {{stitching}} on the tensile static and fatigue properties of co-cured single-lap joints with cross-ply graphite- epoxy adherends. The variables considered {{in this study were}} the overlap length, the stitch spacing, and the off-edge distance. Experimental results indicate that while stitching does not improve the static strength, <b>stitched</b> <b>joints</b> exhibit much better fatigue performance than unstitched joints. Ultrasonic analyses and continuous monitoring of stiffness change during fatigue life allowed us to follow delamination progression and to clearly identify the nucleation and the propagation stages, in particular, stitching was observed to increase the durations of both the crack initiation and crack propagation phases, with stitches remaining intact until complete failure. Moreover, in the range of values examined, the fatigue behavior of <b>stitched</b> <b>joints</b> is improved by reducing the stitch spacing, while it appears to be insensitive to the variation of the off-edge distance of stitches...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of selective stitching on the fracture behaviour of co-cured single-lap joints under fatigue loading was investigated {{by means of}} an experimental and numerical analysis in order to identify the mechanics of through-thickness reinforcement and to quantify its effect on the fracture response of delaminated joints. It was observed that while stitching does not improve the static strength of joints, it significantly extends both the crack initiation and crack propagation phases. The extension of the delamination growth stage, in particular, was attributed to the bridging action of stitches on delaminated adherends, which - as indicated by finite element calculations - suppresses the mode I component of energy release rate and thus reduces crack propagation rates. By exploiting the experimental observations and the results analysis, the fatigue crack propagation and the final failure of <b>stitched</b> <b>joints</b> were successfully predicted by an energy-based approach adopting a Paris power-law...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stitching}} on the fracture response of single-lap composite joints was studied {{by a combined}} experimental and numerical analysis. Unstitched and Kevlar <b>stitched</b> <b>joints</b> were tested under static and fatigue loading to characterize damage progression and failure modes; a three-dimensional finite element analysis was carried out to evaluate the influence of stitches on strain energy release rates {{as a function of}} damage and to identify the role of various stitching parameters on the fracture behaviour of joints. It was observed that the failure of the joints occurs {{as a consequence of the}} propagation of delamination at the interface between the adherends; the propagation is stable under fatigue loads and unstable under static loads. Stitching does not improve the static strength of joints but significantly prolongs the duration of the crack propagation phase under fatigue loading. The results of finite element modelling indicate that the incorporation of stitches reduce GI to zero after the delamination front passes the stitch line, but it is not effective in reducing mode II energy release rate. They also show that strain energy release rates are not greatly affected by the length of stitch-laminate debonding, which, conversely, does influence stitch tensioning. Moreover, 3 D analysis reveals that stitches become less efficient in reducing the crack driving force with increasing stitching steps...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stitches}} on {{the failure of}} a single lap joint configuration was determined in a combined experimental and analytical study. The experimental study was conducted to determine debond growth under static monotonic loading. The stitches were shown to delay the initiation of the debond and provide load transfer beyond the load necessary to completely debond the <b>stitched</b> lap <b>joint.</b> The strain energy release rates at the debond front were calculated using a finite element-based technique. Models of the unstitched configuration showed significant values of modes I and II across the width of the joint and showed that mode III is zero at the centerline but increases near the free edge. Models of the stitched configuration showed that the stitches effectively reduced mode I to zero, but had less of an effect on modes II and III...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of stitching on the static and fatigue failure load of bonded composite single lap joints. The variables considered in the static tests included adherend thickness, overlap length, stitch spacing, and number of rows of stitches. A limited fatigue program was conducted for one configuration to compare the fatigue life of <b>stitched</b> and unstitched <b>joints.</b> Up to a 38 percent improvement in static failure load and an order of magnitude increase in fatigue life compared with unstiffened results are obtained by a single row of stitches {{near the end of the}} overlap. Additional rows of stitching or different stitch spacing has little effect on static joint failure load. Thicker adherends and larger overlap length result in larger improvements in static failure load with stitching. Further research is needed to refine the stitching process in order to obtain the maximum improvements in joint failure load...|$|R
