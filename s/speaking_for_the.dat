5|$|Following {{the death}} of Finan, bishop of Lindisfarne, Alhfrith of Deira, in {{collusion}} with Wilfred of York, Agilbert of Wessex and others, were determined to persuade Oswiu to rule in favour of the Roman rite of Christianity within the kingdoms over which he had imperium. The case was debated in Oswiu's presence at the Synod of Whitby in 664, with Colmán, Hild and Cedd defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from Aidan, and Wilifred <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Roman position. The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not accept it, including Colmán, departed elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E

The story then jumps back to the start, with Delta traversing the storm wall to the outskirts of a mostly buried Dubai, being taunted on broadcasts by the Radioman (Jake Busey), a DJ and former journalist <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 33rd. After coming across refugees being rounded up by the 33rd and engaging in a firefight, Walker elects to disobey orders and find Konrad.|$|E

5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|States sent Union regiments {{south in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.|$|E
5|$|In Crash of the Titans, Crash aids Coco in the {{development}} of a butter-recycling device. This is interrupted when Neo Cortex arrives and kidnaps Aku Aku and Coco. Crash throws Coco's machine at Cortex's airship, severing the chain holding Aku Aku's cage, which causes the cage to fall into the nearby forest. After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that Cortex and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them. Crash is unable to rescue his sister but manages to defeat Cortex, and he begins his search for Coco, interrogating Dingodile, Tiny Tiger, N. Gin, and Uka Uka on her whereabouts. Crash finally confronts and defeats Nina Cortex inside of the Doominator robot, liberates his sister, and averts the destruction of Wumpa Island. Feeling happy for themselves, Crash and his family decide to celebrate their victory with pancakes, which he blurts out (<b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time) in joy. Soon after, in Crash: Mind over Mutant, the NV, a personal digital assistant that everyone must possess, is released to the public. However, this turns out to be a plot by Doctor Cortex and his old partner Doctor Nitrus Brio, who use the NV's Mojo-transmitting powers to control everyone who uses the device. Because Crash is unaffected by the NV, he is able to free his friends from the control of the NV and stop Cortex's and Brio's plot.|$|E

25|$|On February 18, 1935, the Justices' {{decisions}} {{in all three}} cases were announced; all supported the government's position by a narrow 5–4 majority. Chief Justice Hughes wrote the opinion for each case, finding the government had plenary power to regulate money. As such, the abrogation of {{both private and public}} contractual gold clauses was within congressional reach when such clauses represented a threat to Congress's control of the monetary system. <b>Speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Court in the Perry case, Hughes's opinion was remarkable: in a judicial tongue-lashing not seen since Marbury v. Madison, Hughes chided Congress for an act which, while legal, was regarded as clearly immoral. However, Hughes ultimately found the plaintiff had no cause of action, and thus no standing to sue the government.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the process}} of {{establishment}} of the European External Action Service envisioned in the Lisbon Treaty, on 1 January 2010 all former European Commission delegations were renamed European Union delegations and till the end of the month 54 of the missions (marked with † in the list of diplomatic missions) were transformed into embassy-type missions that employ greater powers than the regular delegations. These upgraded delegations have taken on the role previously carried out by the national embassies of the member state holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union and merged with the independent Council delegations around the world.

25|$|In February–March 1994, {{detailed}} {{reports from}} the Canadian embassy in Kigali meant that the Canadian government {{was one of the}} best informed nations in the world about the coming Rwandan genocide. The foreign minister André Ouellet claimed that he nor anyone else in the Cabinet ever saw the reports from Rwanda. On April 6, 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was apparently kept well-informed about what was happening by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada, with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had begun, on May 2, 1994, Ouellet, <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity would do something to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.|$|E
