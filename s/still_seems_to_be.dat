25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry {{to be able to talk}} about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E

[...] This encourages the addressee {{to be thought of}} as a [...] "human individual." [...] The subject of the line <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "'the emotion of love"' and the owner of the love still remains unclear. [...] The use of the word [...] "wink" [...] in line six reinforces the appetite and feeding metaphor. [...] This reinforces the idea that the poet is addressing the [...] "youth" [...] about their love. [...] A [...] "wink" [...] closes the eyes like [...] "two mouths" [...] and so the winker is eating the [...] "sight of the beloved that they shut themselves against further cramming" [...] "Dullness" [...] is likely referencing a sexual lethargy.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Kelis had signed to Interscope Records through will.i.am Music Group, {{and that her}} then-untitled fifth studio album featured production from will.i.am, Free School, Boys Noize, Burns, DJ Ammo, and David Guetta. She played the album to a few record labels before choosing will.i.am's label. [...] "I think that he's brilliant", Kelis said of will.i.am. [...] "As far as this generation goes, there's not a single song that you can bring up to him or a reference or an artist or an era of music that he is not privy to or that he doesn't understand. [...] He's not afraid to push the limits and kinda go further than everyone else and that's exciting. He <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> having fun doing it and that's what it's all about."

60|$|Well, it does really {{turn out}} that Dr. Still, {{in the middle of}} Kansas, in a village, began to {{experiment}} in 1874, only five years after Kellgren began the same work obscurely in the village of Gotha, in Germany. Dr. <b>Still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an honest man; therefore I am persuaded that Kellgren moved him to his experiments by Mental Telegraphy across six hours of longitude, without need of a wire. By the time Still began to experiment, Kellgren had completed his development of the principles of his system and established himself in a good practice in London--1874--and was in good shape to convey his discovery to Kansas, Mental Telegraphically.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{progress}} towards such {{a result}} is very slow, but it <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a progress. We {{are just now}} living at an abnormal period of the world's history, owing to the marvellous developments and vast practical results of science, having been given to societies too low morally and intellectually, {{to know how to}} make the best use of them, and to whom they have consequently been curses as well as blessings. Among civilized nations at the present day, it does not seem possible for natural selection to act in any way, so as to secure the permanent advancement of morality and intelligence; for it is indisputably the mediocre, if not the low, both as regards morality and intelligence, who succeed best in life and multiply fastest. Yet there is undoubtedly an advance--on the whole a steady and a permanent one--both in the influence on public opinion of a high morality, and in the general desire for intellectual elevation; and as I cannot impute this in any way to [...] "survival of the fittest," [...] I am forced to conclude that it is due, to the inherent progressive power of those glorious qualities which raise us so immeasurably above our fellow animals, {{and at the same time}} afford us the surest proof that there are other and higher existences than ourselves, from whom these qualities may have been derived, and towards whom we may be ever tending.|$|E
60|$|The {{housekeeper}} next took us {{into the}} part of the castle which has never been modernized since it was repaired, after the siege of Cromwell. This is a dismal series of cellars above ground, with immensely thick walls, letting in but scanty light, and dim staircases of stone; and a large hall, with a vast fireplace, where every particle of heat must needs have gone up chimney,--a chill and heart-breaking place enough. Quite {{in the midst of this}} part of the castle is the court-yard,--a space of some thirty or forty feet in length and breadth, open to the sky, but shut completely in on every side by the buildings of the castle, and paved over with flat stones. Out of this pavement, however, grows a yew-tree, ascending to the tops of the towers, and completely filling, with its branches and foliage, the whole open space between them. Some small birds--quite a flock of them--were twittering and fluttering among the upper branches. We went upward, through two or three stories of dismal rooms,--among others, through the ancient guard-room,--till we came out on the roof of one of the towers, and had a very fine view of an amphitheatre of ridgy hills which shut in and seclude the castle and the town. The upper foliage was within our reach, close to the parapet of the tower; so we gathered a few twigs as memorials. The housekeeper told us that the yew-tree is supposed to be eight hundred years old, and, comparing it with other yews that I have seen, I should judge that it must measure its antiquity by centuries, at all events. It <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in its prime.|$|E
