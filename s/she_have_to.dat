25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to {{understand the meaning of}} frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance did <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations {{as much as it is}} to reveal new possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{movie is a}} mess: a gassy costume epic with nobody at the center." [...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why does <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> die at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
