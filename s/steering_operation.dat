40|$|BACKGROUND: Leukoaraiosis {{is defined}} as {{extracellular}} space caused mainly by atherosclerotic or demyelinated changes in the brain tissue and is commonly found in the brains of healthy older people. A significant association between leukoaraiosis and traffic crashes was reported in our previous study; however, {{the reason for this}} is still unclear. METHOD: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of driving performance in ordinary older drivers with leukoaraiosis. First, the degree of leukoaraiosis was examined in 33 participants, who underwent an actual-vehicle driving examination on a standard driving course, and a driver skill rating was also collected while the driver carried out a paced auditory serial addition test, which is a calculating task given verbally. At the same time, a steering entropy method was used to estimate <b>steering</b> <b>operation</b> performance. RESULTS: The experimental results indicated that a normal older driver with leukoaraiosis was readily affected by external disturbances and made more operation errors and steered less smoothly than one without leukoaraiosis during driving; at the same time, their steering skill significantly deteriorated.

40|$|On ITALSAT Flight 2, the Italian {{telecommunications}} satellite, the two L-Ka antennas (Tx and Rx) use {{two large}} deployable reflectors (2000 -mm diameter), whose deployment and fine pointing functions are accomplished {{by means of}} an innovative mechanism concept. The Antenna Deployment & Pointing Mechanism and Supporting Structure (ADPMSS) is based on a new configuration solution, where the reflector and mechanisms are conceived as an integrated, self-contained assembly. This approach is different from the traditional configuration solution. Typically, a rigid arm is used to deploy and then support the reflector in the operating position, and an Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) is normally interposed between the reflector and the arm for <b>steering</b> <b>operation.</b> The main characteristics of the ADPMSS are: combined implementation of deployment, pointing, and reflector support; optimum integration of active components and interface matching with the satellite platform; structural link distribution to avoid hyperstatic connections; very light weight and; high performance in terms of deployment torque margin and pointing range/accuracy. After having successfully been subjected to all component-level qualification and system-level acceptance tests, two flight ADPMSS mechanisms (one for each antenna) are now integrated on ITALSAT F 2 and are ready for launch.

The {{ultimate goal is to}} be able to identify patterns of high rating and match them towards a reference database consisting naturalistic driving data. Two segmentations of the drives are used, equilength subsegments and <b>steering</b> <b>operations.</b> An alternative morphed standardised rating scaled is proposed. Two data mining approaches are applied. The first method is based on using an ensemble classifier on features derived from the CAN-data to predict the rating of each segment of the data. The second method uses an outlier detection algorithm and a hierarchical clustering approach on a distance metric based on the angles between the principal variance components of the observations. Using the ensemble classifier and general variables a large proportion of rating variance can be explained when including driver and route factors. Large rating values can be identified well. For the standardised rating the prediction of high values is worse with many false positives. The matching of signals using the covariance structure works well. Using hierarchical clustering clusters with standardised rating high above average can be obtained. Outliers with high standardised rating are extracted and matched towards a larger database. The matches are few but similar to the original situations owing to the fact the matching is strict. In conclusion the ensemble classifier works well for predicting rating when driver and route factors are included. The covariance-based method performs well for situation matching and clusters with high rating can be identified. It also has potential to be be used for extracting and matching more sofisticated patterns...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we apply}} a novel {{statistical}} method, multiset canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA), {{to study a}} group of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) datasets acquired during simulated driving task. The M-CCA method jointly decomposes fMRI datasets from different subjects/sessions into brain activation maps and their associated time courses, such that the correlation in each group of estimated activation maps across datasets is maximized. Therefore, the functional activations across all datasets are extracted in the order of consistency across different dataset. On the other hand, M-CCA preserves the uniqueness of the functional maps estimated from each dataset by avoiding concatenation of different datasets in the analysis. Hence, the cross-dataset variation of the functional activations can be used to test the hypothesis of functional-behavioral association. In this work, we study 120 simulated driving fMRI datasets and identify parietal-occipital regions and frontal lobe as the most consistently engaged areas across all the subjects and sessions during simulated driving. The functional-behavioral association study indicates that all the estimated brain activations are significantly correlated with the <b>steering</b> <b>operation</b> during the driving task. M-CCA thus provides a new approach to investigate the complex relationship between the brain functions and multiple behavioral variables, especially in naturalistic tasks as demonstrated by the simulated driving study...|$|E

The L-SAR features, on top of standard Stripmap and ScanSAR operations, full polarimetric capabilities, repeat-pass ScanSAR interferometry and a Wave Mode. The TerraSAR-L spacecraft flies in a near-polar sun-synchronous low Earth orbit. An attitude <b>steering</b> <b>operation</b> to reduce the Doppler frequency caused by the Earths rotation is foreseen. The knowledge of the relative distance between the spacecraft in orbit and a point scatterer on Earth during the radar illumination time, the so-called slant range history, is a crucial input for SAR focusing. Usually, this trajectory is approximated by an appropriate function. The validity of the approximation within the required accuracy margins has to be ensured. The applied attitude steering is a major driver for the Doppler parameters and thus the allowed approximations. This paper introduces the major TerraSAR-L orbit parameters and imaging configurations. Based on the nominal Kepler reference orbit, the round-orbit Doppler characteristics for TerraSAR-L are derived. The DLR developed Total Zero Doppler Steering is investigated as a suitable candidate for the TerraSAR-L attitude steering. A range trajectory approximation is investigated...|$|E

In order to solve this problem, according to the characteristic that the driving torque of left and right steering wheel can be independently controlled in electric wheel driving vehicle, a new non-trapezium-steering system has been proposed based on electric wheel driving and powering in this paper. This system makes use of the steering torque around the kingpin from electric wheel driving, and is controlled by steering constraint mechanism. Steering system force analysis was conducted to analyze the feasibility of the system in theory. On this basis, a small prototype vehicle was designed. With the use of Bluetooth wireless serial chip and STC 12 c 5 a 60 s 2 microcontrollers, the steering-by-wire system lower computer was developed. With the LabView software, the upper computer system was developed in notebook computer. With these two systems, the steering system can conduct data acquisition and control. To verify the performance of the system, the steering angle step input test while vehicle is stationary, the steering angle step input test at low running speed were carried out respectively on the prototype vehicle.
