If change is gradual, there may be enough time for biota adjustment. Rapid climate change, however, could harm agriculture in many countries, especially those that are already suffering from rather poor soil and climate conditions, because there is less time for optimum natural selection and adaption.|$|E
25|$|A {{right arm}} bowler of slow to medium pace, Walter Mead always {{maintained}} an excellent length and could spin back to deadly effect whenever wickets {{were affected by}} rain. He could vary his stock off break with a ball that turned the other way, but he lacked the deceptive flight that enabled such bowlers as Blythe, Dennett or J.C. White to do well on firm pitches. He rarely did much as a batsman, but when sent in as night-watchman against Leicestershire in 1902 he surprised the crowd <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> making 119 {{that there was a}} special collection for him as a reward.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1860s {{another part of}} the Sydney Common, the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street, was opened for public recreation. It was named Moore Park after the Mayor of Sydney, Charles Moore, who planted a number of Moreton Bay Fig trees which exist to this day. As well as the {{location}} of Sydney's first zoo, Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs Sydney University and the Wallaroos. Sydney at the time was a small, dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts. It was not liked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> cricketers because it was too far from the city.|$|E
25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|Löhe {{was born}} on 21 February 1808 {{in the town of}} Fürth in present-day Middle Franconia. The son of a shopkeeper, his father died in 1816 and he seemed to have had a very lonely childhood. He {{received}} his basic education from C. L. Roth’s gymnasium in Nuremberg and was admitted to theological study at the University of Erlangen in 1826. He was heavily influenced by the Reformed professors of theology Christian Krafft and Thomas von Kempen. Ultimately, he was introduced to the Lutheran Confessions and became a Lutheran under the teaching of David Hollaz. In 1828 he spent a term at the University of Berlin, attracted not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> the lectures of the professors as by the sermons of the famous preachers. Löhe graduated from the Erlangen in 1830, but waited until 1831 before receiving a pastoral assignment to Kirchenlamitz in Upper Franconia (Northeastern Bavaria).|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to Rhodesia, Beadle {{took an interest}} in politics; he joined the United Party, created from the former Rhodesia Party and the conservative faction of the Reform Party to contest the 1934 general election. He was attracted to the United Party not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> its policies but by his admiration for its leading figures—he considered the Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins [...] "a man of the calibre I think of Rhodes". The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial Legislative Assembly were overwhelmingly from the white minority (about 5% of the population). The United Party broadly represented commercial interests, civil servants and the professional classes.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{impact on}} him was {{likewise}} emphatic: [...] "I saw {{a cousin of}} mine dance to... 'Hound Dog' and I {{had never seen her}} get up and be moved <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> anything. It really impressed me, the power of the music. I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet." [...] After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.|$|E

500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reception from critics. Colin Hogg of The New Zealand Herald described the song as a [...] "decidedly scary... guitar-driven barrage". Divina Infusino of The San Diego Union-Tribune {{described it as}} [...] "blistering". Tony Perry of The Patriot-News felt {{it was one of}} the low points of the album, stating [...] "'Exit'... crescendoes into little more than noise", a sentiment echoed by Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News who called it [...] "a dull piece". Writing for the Orange County Registrar, Jim Washburn and Noel Davis called it [...] "a journey through a killer's mind, made harrowing not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> Hewson's creepy-religio lyrics as by the band's (still the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton) overdriven backing, which practically boils right out of the pot." [...] Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel labelled the song's atmosphere [...] "eerie".|$|E
500|$|Despite being a prequel, {{the second}} game {{introduces}} upgraded versions of the original characters called Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Mangle, along with old, ripped, and worn out versions of the original animatronics. Mangle {{is meant to be}} a [...] "toy" [...] version of Foxy, but was ripped apart <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> children that the staff got tired of reassembling it and left it as a [...] "take apart, put back together" [...] attraction, according to Phone Guy. He also mentions that the employees nicknamed it [...] "the Mangle". [...] Two new characters are also introduced: BB (known as Balloon Boy), who has no jumpscare and can only disable the players' lights, and The Puppet (also known as The Marionette), who must be quelled by constantly winding up a music box.The only true animatronic in the third game is Springtrap, who looks like a decayed golden version of Bonnie. Additionally, Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and The Puppet return as hallucinations (or [...] "phantoms"), and although their jumpscares don't kill the player, they can disable certain features that are essential for the player to complete the night easily.|$|E
500|$|Somerset had an {{extraordinary}} season in 1890, going unbeaten in their thirteen fixtures; winning twelve and tying the other. Though he {{was described in}} the Taunton Courier's summary of the season as [...] "one of Somerset's best bats", Roe was no longer relied upon <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> the team, which could now look to the batting of Hewett and Lionel Palairet. Roe finished the season sixth on the counties batting averages, having managed to play in eight of the county's fixtures. Due to their record in 1890, the county were admitted to the County Championship for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status. He played infrequently, and without excelling himself, for Somerset over the subsequent few years. One of his highlights during this period was an innings against Gloucestershire in which he scored 75 runs to help Somerset set up a large victory. The Gloucestershire Chronicle praised him for the pace of his innings; he took an hour to patiently accrue his first 28 runs while the Somerset innings was in trouble, then added another 47 in just over half an hour.|$|E

500|$|Van Meegeren played {{different}} roles, some {{of which}} were shrouded in fraudulent intentions, as he sought to fulfill his goal of besting his critics. Han’s father was said to have once told him, [...] "You are a cheat and always will be." [...] On the other hand, his brothers and sisters perceived him as loyal, generous, and affectionate, and he was always loving and helpful to his own children. The question [...] "what was his character" [...] cannot be answered unequivocally. Indeed, recent works question many of the existing assumptions about van Meegeren and the motivations for his career in forgery. With Han van Meegeren, everything was double-edged, and his character presents itself as fragments rather than unity. In 2008, Harvard-trained art historian Jonathan Lopez had become fluent in Dutch and published 'The Man Who Made Vermeers, Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han Van Meegeren'. His extensive research confirmed that van Meegeren started to make forgeries, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> feeling misunderstood and undervalued by art critics as for the income that it generated, income which he needed to support his addictions and promiscuity. Lopez confirmed the veracity of Jan Spierdijk's article in 'De Waarheid' in which Spierdijk reported that the book 'Tekeningen 1' by van Meegeren was in Hitler's library, signed by the artist and dedicated to the Führer.|$|E
500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us [...] "do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E
