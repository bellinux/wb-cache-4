40|$|To take {{advantage}} of the full potential of ubiquitous computing devices, we will need systems which minimize power consumption. Weiser et al. and others have suggested that this may be accomplished in part by a CPU which dynamically changes speed and voltage, thereby saving energy by <b>spreading</b> <b>run</b> cycles into idle time. Here we continue this research, using a simulation to compare a number of policies for dynamic speed-setting. Our work clarifies a fundamental power vs. delay tradeoff, as well as the role of prediction and of speed-smoothing in dynamic speed-setting policies. We conclude that success seems to depend more on simple smoothing algorithms than on sophisticated prediction techniques, but defer to the eventual replication of these results on actual multiple-speed systems.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is a critical}} design issue in real-time systems, especially in battery- operated systems. Maintaining high performance, while extending the battery life between charges is an interesting challenge for system designers. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) allows a processor to dynamically change speed and voltage at run time, thereby saving energy by <b>spreading</b> <b>run</b> cycles into idle time. Knowing when to use full power and when not, requires {{the cooperation of the}} operating system scheduler. Usually, higher processor voltage and frequency leads to higher system throughput while energy reduction can be obtained using lower voltage and frequency. Instead of lowering processor voltage and frequency as much as possible, energy efficient real-time scheduling adjusts voltage and frequency according to some optimization criteria, such as low energy consumption or high throughput, while it meets the timing constraints of the real-time tasks. As the quantity and functional complexity of battery powered portable devices continues to raise, energy efficient design of such devices has become increasingly important. Many real-time scheduling algorithms have been developed recently to reduce energy consumption in the portable devices that use DVS capable processors. Extensive power aware scheduling techniques have been published for energy reduction, but most of them have been focuse...|$|R

Until recently these studies did not focus especially on children and childhood, but considered children in the larger context of family continuity and inter-family relationships, or legal issues like legitimacy, adoption and inheritance. Recent publications have examined a variety of aspects related to childhood in ancient Greece and Rome, but until now nothing has attempted to comprehensively survey the state of ancient childhood studies. This handbook does just that, showcasing the work of both established and rising scholars and demonstrating the variety of approaches to the study of childhood in the classical world. In thirty chapters, with a detailed introduction and envoi, The Oxford Handbook of Childhood and Education in the Classical World presents current research {{in a wide range of}} topics on ancient childhood, including sub-disciplines of Classics that rarely appear in collections on the family or childhood such as archaeology and ancient medicine. Contributors include some of the foremost experts in the fieldas well as younger, up-and-coming scholars. Unlike most edited volumes on childhood or the family in antiquity, this collection also gives attention to the late antique period and whether (or how) conceptions of childhood and the life of children changed with Christianity. The chronological <b>spread</b> <b>runs</b> from archaic Greece to the later Roman Empire (fifth century C. E.). Geographical areas covered include not only classical Greece and Roman Italy, but also the eastern Mediterranean.

It was also a new direction for head coach Herman Edwards, who has long had a reputation for favoring more conservative, run-oriented offenses.

40|$|The new {{generation}} of the intense X-rays sources based on low energy electron storage ring and Compton scattering (CS) of laser beam allows to produce X-rays with intensity up to 1014 phot/s. There are two basic problems in laser-electron storage rings (LESR) design. The first one is associated with strong effect of the intrabeam scattering at low electron beam energy. Because of this effect the beam size grows quickly and CS intensity decreases. The second problem is associated with large electron beam energy spread because of fluctuation of Compton generation. The value of the energy <b>spread</b> may <b>run</b> up to few percents and one needs to keep electron beam during long term {{in order to achieve}} the high Compton beam intensity.
