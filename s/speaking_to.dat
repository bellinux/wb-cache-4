5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} hear {{a greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. <b>Speaking</b> <b>to</b> peers is different from <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E

5|$|After the war, de Peyster served {{overseas}} as a dignitary. When {{he returned}} to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly.

In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters.|$|E

Each member has one vote, for which they are held to account: full minutes of each meeting are published alongside the Committee's monetary policy decisions, and members are regularly called before the Treasury Select Committee, as well as <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> wider audiences at events during the year.|$|E
5|$|At Edinburgh University, Childe {{focused on}} research, and {{although}} reportedly very kind towards his students, had difficulty <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> large audiences; he organised the BSc degree course {{so that it}} began studying the Iron Age, progressing chronologically backward to the Palaeolithic, confusing many students. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. Involving them in experimental archaeology, {{of which he was}} an early proponent, in 1937 he performed experiments to understand the vitrification process that had occurred at several Iron Age forts in northern Britain.|$|E
6000|$|Angut looked gravely at {{the speaker}} {{for a moment}} or two, and shook his head. Dead silence prevailed. Then in a voice that was unusually soft and deep he said: [...] "I am no angekok.

The winds that whistle round the icebergs and rush among the hummocks on the frozen sea <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me sometimes; the {{crashing}} ice-cliffs that thunder down the glens <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me; the noisy rivulets, the rising sun and moon and winking stars all <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me, though it is difficult to understand what they say; but no familiar spirit ever <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R

5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> Olivia, warning {{that she is the}} only one that can stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a {{warehouse}} which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E

5|$|Fortune saw her occult novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings.

5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
