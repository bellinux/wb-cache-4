5|$|On September 5, 2009, in Michigan's {{season opener}} against Western Michigan, Robinson scored a {{touchdown}} {{on his first}} collegiate (fumbled) snap. As the ESPN television broadcast focused on his untied shoelaces, Robinson took the <b>snap</b> <b>in</b> the shotgun formation, ran to the right, broke a tackle at the 40-yard line, then cut left and ran 43 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of conference play, the Bearcats were 4–1, and their only loss was against top-five {{opponent}} Oklahoma. With Pike still injured, Cincinnati beat Rutgers, 13–10, in the Bearcats' first Big East game of the season. The Bearcats suffered their second defeat {{of the season in}} the following week, however, losing to the UConn Huskies, 40–16. Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, but he left the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take the <b>snap.</b> <b>In</b> the two weeks that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 South Florida and No. 20 West Virginia. The two victories pushed the Bearcats to a 3–1 conference record and the No. 22 position in the AP Poll before Cincinnati's annual rivalry game against Louisville. That game, also known as the Battle for The Keg of Nails, ended in a Cincinnati victory {{for the first time since}} 2002.|$|E
5|$|Iowa {{defeated}} Michigan 24–16 after Michigan {{was unable}} to score a touchdown from the three-yard line {{at the end of}} the game. Iowa scored first with a four-yard touchdown run by Marcus Coker. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown catch by Fitzgerald Toussaint, their only points of the first half; however, the extra point was botched due to a bad <b>snap.</b> <b>In</b> the second quarter, Iowa's Brad Herman caught a one-yard pass from James Vandenberg for a touchdown. Iowa's Mike Meyer then kicked a 42-yard field goal to add to the Hawkeyes' lead. After halftime, Michigan's Brendan Gibbons scored the only points of the 3rd quarter with a 32-yard field goal. Iowa then scored its only points of the second half when Marcus Coker scored his second touchdown of the day, this time with a 13-yard rush. Michigan responded with a seven-yard touchdown catch by Kevin Koger.|$|E

5|$|Major {{political}} parties in Sarawak {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members from more than one group. The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (<b>SNAP)</b> <b>in</b> 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined the national coalition of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.|$|E
5|$|That {{was good}} for {{first place in the}} AFC Central and a trip to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad <b>snap.</b> <b>In</b> the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.|$|E

He, therefore, first became eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Lillooet (along with Lytton) {{holds the}} record for the hottest {{temperature}} recorded in British Columbia. On 16 and 17 July 1941, the temperature reached 44.4°C (112°F). In addition to the hottest July temperature, the town also holds {{the record for}} the hottest temperature recorded in the province during the months of April (36.1°C or 97°F), May (41.7°C or 107°F), and December (22.2°C or 72°F).

25|$|The {{next week}} saw the Bears {{drawn into the}} turmoil of the Vikings' 2010 season. As the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's {{inflatable}} roof had collapsed the week before, the two teams had to play at TCF Bank Stadium at the University of Minnesota campus in frigid winter weather. Despite being a nominal home game for the Vikings, they were not a team prepared for outdoor play and Chicago overwhelmed them 40–14. It was here that Brett Favre took his final <b>snap</b> <b>in</b> the NFL after he was knocked into the frozen ground and suffered a concussion, ending a 20-year career that included 297 consecutive starts.|$|E

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Brady {{completed}} 7 of 8 passes for 54yards on an 82-yard drive. On the last play, he took a <b>snap</b> <b>in</b> shotgun formation with Kevin Faulk to his right, Brady jumped {{in the air with}} his arms raised {{to make it look like}} a play used by the Patriots before where Faulk took the direct snap. The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving Wes Welker open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21–14 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver Dennis Northcutt dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a Josh Scobee 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–17. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's Derek Landri was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28–17 lead.|$|E
25|$|On Buffalo's opening drive, Kelly {{completed}} {{six consecutive}} passes, the last a 13-yard touchdown toss to Lofton after he recovered a fumbled <b>snap</b> <b>in</b> shotgun formation. The Raiders responded with Schroeder's two 26-yard completions to Willie Gault and Mervyn Fernandez, {{setting up a}} 41-yard field goal from Jeff Jaeger, but Buffalo stormed back to score just four plays after the ensuing kickoff. Following a 41-yard completion from Kelly to Lofton, and an 11-yard scramble by Kelly, Thomas' 12-yard touchdown run gave the Bills a 14-3 lead. After a punt, Los Angeles defensive back Garry Lewis intercepted a pass from Kelly. But three plays later, Talley intercepted a pass from Schroeder and returned it for a touchdown. The Raiders were forced to punt on their next possession, and Buffalo stormed down the field again, scoring with a 1-yard touchdown run by Davis on fourth and goal. A 44-yard completion to Steve Tasker set up Davis' second touchdown run, and an interception by Nate Odomes would allow Kelly to hit Lofton for a second touchdown just before the half, giving the Bills a commanding 41–3 lead at the break.|$|E

500|$|Tolliver {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth about $1 million with the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League [...] before the 1995 season began. Early in the season, Tolliver got to compete against former teammate David Archer in the San Antonio Texans' CFL debut. He finished the season having thrown for 3,767 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. After the team folded following a 5–13 season, Tolliver was again without a team.
