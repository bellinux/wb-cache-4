500|$|... 1983 Mar Bass/Midrange units: <b>Sound</b> <b>deadening</b> {{material}} {{painted on}} bass and midrange units. SN. 3000/1 ...|$|R
50|$|A stripped-out {{interior}} {{devoid of}} power windows or seats, rear seats, air conditioning, cruise control, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> or a stereo system (optionally fitted) and new racing-bucket front seats {{were part of}} the package. The trunk hood was made of aluminum, the chassis was seam welded and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> was deleted. Wheels were made of magnesium and the glass was thinner in the doors and rear window. The Carrera RS is approximately 345 pounds (155 kg) lighter than the US version Carrera 2 model. Also available were a heavier Touring variant (with <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> power seats (optional), undercarriage protection and power windows) and an N/GT racing variant with a stripped, blank metal interior and a roll cage. They also came with optional lights on the visors.|$|R
25|$|Dry ice can be {{used for}} {{loosening}} asphalt floor tiles or car <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> material making it easy to prise off, as well as freezing water in valveless pipes to enable repair.|$|R
5000|$|Vibration damping: {{applicable}} {{for large}} vibrating surfaces. The damping mechanism works by extracting the vibration {{energy from the}} thin sheet and dissipating it as heat. A common material is <b>sound</b> <b>deadened</b> steel.|$|R
5000|$|Damping: <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> {{material}} {{is often used}} in the door cavities and boot/trunk area to damp excess vibration of the panels in the car in response to loud subwoofer bass tones, especially the boot/trunk.|$|R
25|$|The Mk2 also {{received}} numerous updates {{including a new}} revised A/C HVAC system, six airbags standard across the range to enhance safety and improved <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> to all models to give a more refined, quiet ride.|$|R
50|$|The basic RS Edition {{does not}} come with power windows, locks, or mirrors, an audio system, rear wing, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> material, map lamps or an {{anti-lock}} braking system. All Evo VIII RS models sold in the US have an air conditioning system.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 Sheller-Globe {{acquired}} the automotive business of Detroit-based Olsonite Corporation, a company which made steering wheels and injection-molded plastic parts and components. In 1984, Sheller-Globe acquired Northern Fibre Products Company, manufacturer of insulation and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> {{materials and products}} for vehicle interiors.|$|R
50|$|Carpet and {{headlining}} were downgraded {{to basic}} specification {{and even the}} documentation wallet was changed from faux leather to cloth. <b>Sound</b> <b>deadening</b> {{was removed from the}} 182 Cup, the horn was downgraded from a twin to single unit and the interior light no longer included a map reading function.|$|R
50|$|For Passenger models, an XLT Premium {{model was}} offered, adding these {{features}} to the XLT: A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, leather seating surfaces, rear cargo door trim, and enhanced interior <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> material. This model appealed {{very much to}} families.|$|R
5000|$|A new [...] "luxury" [...] model became {{available}} starting for 1969, available in only the hardtop body style. The 'Grande' featured a soft ride, 55 lb of extra <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> {{as well as}} deluxe interior with simulated wood trim. It was popular with buyers with 22182 units sold through 1969.|$|R
50|$|All 2.0-litre models had {{the option}} of {{automatic}} transmission, and with the 2.3-litre V6, it was the only transmission offered. The 2.3 also received power steering and additional <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> material. A five-speed box was not available. A unique option, offered under guarantee by a dealership, South Auckland Ford, was a turbocharger.|$|R
50|$|Lancia {{claimed the}} car could reach {{top speed of}} 225 km/h and {{accelerate}} from standstill to 100 km/h in six seconds.In contrast to its bare bones racing sisters, the S4 Stradale featured an Alcantara-upholstered interior, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> a suede steering wheel, and was equipped with power steering, trip computer and air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|With the T6 now {{hitting the}} roads {{it is very}} clear it {{would appear to be}} just a facelift. New front, new {{tailgate}} and a new dash. There are quality improvements, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> new colours and improved consumption, but many believe VW have missed an opportunity {{to go back to the}} top.|$|R
50|$|Perforations {{are usually}} used to allow easy {{separation}} of two {{sections of the}} material, such as allowing paper to be torn easily along the line. Packaging with perforations in paperboard or plastic film is easy for consumers to open. Other purposes include filtrating fluids, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> allowing light or fluids to pass through, and to create an aesthetic design.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{versions}} were produced. The initial 2,500 {{units were}} [...] "homologation specials" [...] {{used to get}} the FIA accreditation for entry into the World Rally Championship. They were fitted with a Garrett T3/T04B turbocharger. Among these initial units, a handful were badged as Motorsport versions, these lacked certain refinements such as a sunroof and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening.</b>|$|R
50|$|Specific {{methods for}} {{improving}} NVH {{include the use}} of tuned mass dampers, subframes, balancing, modifying the stiffness or mass of structures, retuning exhausts and intakes, modifying the characteristics of elastomeric isolators, adding <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> or absorbing materials, or using active noise control. In some circumstances, substantial changes in vehicle architecture may {{be the only way to}} cure some problems cost effectively.|$|R

5000|$|The stages were purpose-designed, sound-proof {{structures}} {{with heavy}} <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> {{material on the}} walls and ceiling, overhead catwalks, sound locks for entry and even pneumatically-sealed large access doors at the rear. Tremaine had installed large wiring troughs of shielded audio cable, running from the stages to the machine room, presumably to allow recording and playback. The building was wired with [...] "wig-wags", bells and flashing lights to warm of active filming.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{produced}} {{a very limited}} number of NSX Type R models from 1992 to 1995 for Japan. Major changes include a more aggressive suspension and an extensive weight reduction to 1230 kg from the normal NSX weight of 1350 kg. The NSX Type R was track oriented and, to reduce weight, lacked <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> audio, electric windows and air conditioning. The NSX Type R's role was fulfilled by the NSX Type S Zero in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{could be}} {{specified}} with factory options of a deluxe velour interior, full leather or the Recaro sports seats. The GT-A interior was different {{in that it}} had chromed door handles, a different instrument panel (to show the gear selection) and chrome edged bezels around the speedo and tach. The GT-A also had additional <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> installed from the factory and the engine manifold and downpipe had been engineered to be quieter.|$|R
5000|$|All AmericInn {{properties}} {{include a}} recreation area with pool and whirlpool, {{as well as}} fourteen different types of guest rooms. A complimentary hot breakfast, called [...] "AmericInn Perk," [...] is also offered at each hotel and includes bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy, waffles, pastries, cereals, juice, and fruit. Rooms are built with masonry block, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> foam and heavy drywall between rooms, as well as concrete slabs, to minimize noise within rooms.|$|R
50|$|Titanium, for Passenger model only adds: A/M-F/M stereo with HD Radio, single-disc CD/MP3 player, rear backup camera, USB and {{auxiliary}} {{audio input}} jacks, leather seating surfaces, third-row seating, keyless entry and security system, increased interior <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> and interior panels, and sixteen-inch alloy wheels (upgradeable to seventeen-inch alloy wheels), {{as well as}} exterior-colored bumpers and exterior accents. This is the top-of-the-line Transit Connect model for the Passenger model, and is only available for the Passenger model.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{fan speed}} allows higher bypass ratios, leading to reduced fuel {{consumption}} and much reduced noise. The Bae 146 is fitted with geared turbofans {{and is still}} one of the quietest commercial aircraft. A large part of the noise reduction is due to reduced fan tip speeds. In conventional turbofans the fan tips exceed the speed of sound causing a characteristic drone, requiring <b>sound</b> <b>deadening.</b> Geared turbofans operate the fan at sufficiently low rotational speed to avoid supersonic tip speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "GT3" [...] {{nameplate}} {{was introduced}} in 1999 {{as part of the}} first generation of the Porsche 996 model range (commonly known as 996.1). As with Porsche's previous 911 RS models, the 996 GT3 was focused on racing, and so was devoid of items that added unnecessary weight to the car. <b>Sound</b> <b>deadening</b> was almost completely removed, as were the rear seats, rear loud speakers, sunroof, and air conditioning, although automatic air conditioning and CD/radio became no-cost optional add-ons.|$|R
5000|$|Sold as the Valiant J series, the South African {{assembled}} Chrysler Valiant lineup {{included the}} Rebel, Rebel 660, Regal, Regal Safari, and the VIP. During 1975 the [...] "J½ series" [...] appeared, first as the VIP only but gradually spreading down the range. <b>Sound</b> <b>deadening</b> was improved, while the Regal sedan {{also received a}} new [...] "iso-clamp" [...] rear axle insulator. The Regals also received new seats, while all J½ series Valiants could be recognized by the ventless front door windows.|$|R
40|$|Transmission loss is {{the main}} method which measure {{silencer}} <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> capacity. The most effective noise elimination technique of compensator is muffler. Muffler is equipment which organizes sound transmission and permits airflow pass and must satisfy definite muffling amount and frequency property. The study builds model and theoretically studies and analyzes the internal sound problem and contrasts between FEM and transmission matrix method and computes transmission loss. On the basis of experimental verification, combining model analysis with sound pressure distribution graph, analyze muffling property deeply...|$|R
5000|$|The 1964 Dodge 426 Hemi Lightweight {{produced}} over [...] This [...] "top drag racer" [...] had an aluminium hood, lightweight front bumpers, fenders, {{doors and}} lower valance, magnesium front wheels, lightweight Dodge van seat, Lexan side windows, one windshield wiper, and no sun visors or <b>sound</b> <b>deadening.</b> Like other lightweights of the era, {{it came with}} a factory disclaimer: Designed for supervised acceleration trials. Not recommended for general everyday driving because of the compromises in the all-round characteristics which must be made {{for this type of}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{for attacking}} both other {{submarines}} and surface ships with torpedoes, the submarine uses a modern teardrop-shape hull for underwater performance. The hull incorporates four rudders and is propelled {{by a single}} propeller. For quieter operation, the engine was mounted with shock absorbers and the hull is plated in rubber tiles for <b>sound</b> <b>deadening.</b> Development was not without problems, as a lengthy testing period for the first vessel (320) attests. Problems with noise levels and underwater performance led to revisions {{in the design and}} only a single boat was ever built to the original specification.|$|R
50|$|Two major updates came in Australia, one in 1992 (GQ Series 2), {{and one in}} 1995 (minor facelift). The {{most notable}} changes in 1992 were the {{introduction}} of fuel-injection on the TB42 motor with fuel injection, EGR valve and oil cooler on the RD28T, new seats, new trim, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> and side intrusion bars. Other 1992 Series 2 refinements included a revised transmission, suspension, introducing bigger brakes, bigger wheels and the standardization of limited slip differentials and auto-freewheeling hubs. This update included new seats, trim and side intrusion bars.|$|R
