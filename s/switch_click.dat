500|$|Hillenburg {{attended}} Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing {{himself as}} a [...] "band geek" [...] who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg {{took part in a}} [...] "dive program" [...] at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, California, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: [...] "The <b>switch</b> <b>clicked</b> and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist." [...] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: [...] "You should just draw fish." [...] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by [...] "making weird, little paintings". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) ...|$|R

(D. Grossman, Be My Knife, 1998) This work intends to be a brief and certainly not comprehensive appraise {{of the state of}} the written word and its meaning in the digi-talized age, as a result of an ever growing utilization of online search engines, and its effects on the individual’s acquaintance with and un-derstanding of his or her world, and is to be considered as a reading of the ideas raised by Boris Groys in Google: Words beyond Grammar from a library and information science point of view. According to Groys, the questions one asks the world, the answers one is willing to receive, and the medium through which one chooses to conduct this dialog, depend on one’s initial world perception (Groys 4). To-day, claims Groys, the individual conducts his or her philosophical interrogation through the World Wide Web, and more specifically through search engines. In fact, proceeds Groys, Google can be described as ”the first philosophical machine that regulates our dia-JLIS. it. Vol. 4, n. 2 (Luglio/July 2013) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} a keyboard, certain computing tasks, such as <b>switching</b> applications or <b>clicking</b> on a URL, benefit from the use of a pointing device. Since the DualPad is held with both hands, using an additional device for pointing (like a mouse or a trackball) requires repositioning the hands. This approach is inefficient due to the increase in the user’s motor workload.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} gaze input for game interaction, we used two tasks commonly found in video game control, target acquisition and target tracking, {{in a set of}} two experiments. In the first experiment, we compared the target acquisition and target tracking performance of two eye trackers with four other input devices. Gaze input had a similar performance to the mouse for big targets, and better performance than a joystick, a device often used in gaming. In the second experiment, we compared target acquisition performance using either gaze or mouse for pointing, and either a mouse button or an EMG <b>switch</b> for <b>clicking.</b> The hands-free gaze-EMG input combination was faster than the mouse while maintaining a similar error rate. Our results suggest that there is a potential for gaze input in game interaction, given a sufficiently accurate and responsive eye tracker and a well-designed interface...|$|R
50|$|An {{active window}} is the {{currently}} focused {{window in the}} current window manager or explorer. Different window managers indicate the currently-active window in different ways and allow the user to switch between windows in different ways. For example, in Microsoft Windows, if both Notepad and Microsoft Paint are open, clicking in the Notepad window will cause that window to become active. In Windows, the active window is indicated by having a different coloured title bar. Clicking {{is not the only}} way of selecting an active window, however: some window managers (such as FVWM) make the window under the mouse pointer active—simply moving the mouse is sufficient to <b>switch</b> windows; a <b>click</b> is not needed.|$|R
5000|$|The tablet design {{initially}} {{consisted of}} a woven grid of Formex wires. Each wire has a 0.1" [...] resolution and is driven by a digital signal which indicates {{its position in the}} matrix. A free-hand stylus would pick up a signal unique to its position when moving over the surface. By the time of the tablet's production, printed-circuit technology had advanced to allow a grid of copper strips on a bi-axially oriented polyethylene terephthalate (boPET) surface to yield a resolution of 0.01". This surface was then covered with a plastic wear layer and mounted in a metal frame. The stylus used on the RAND Tablet had a tiny <b>click</b> <b>switch</b> that, when depressed, would send a signal to the machine.|$|R
5000|$|Exiles {{graphics}} and sound received nearly universal praise, and were credited with completing the game's immersion. The puzzles {{were described as}} less difficult and more contained, meaning that players {{did not have to}} experiment with <b>switches</b> and then <b>click</b> several screens away to see the effect, as in Riven. Macworlds Peter Cohen praised Presto for giving out bits of story throughout the game, rather than providing exposition only during opening and closing sequences. The pacing and rewards system was also appreciated by reviewers. IGN concluded their review of the game by stating that Presto had done [...] "a pretty good job with a notable addition to the series". The Daily Telegraph offered even stronger praise, saying that Presto had crafted the best Myst game in the series thus far, a sentiment that was echoed in other publications. The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Exile their 2001 [...] "Adventure Game of the Year".|$|R
40|$|Electronic Classroom is an Australian-developed {{software}} product {{that provides a}} shared screen facility between two to six Apple Macintosh computers using standard telephone lines and modems. It provides an icon-based "paint " interface with point and <b>click</b> <b>switching</b> of control between sites. Used in conjunction with an additional voice line, the software provides an easy to use, a robust and relatively low cost audiographic teleconferencing system. Electronic Classroom is already in use in distance education programs in every Australian state and mainland territory. Currently over 500 sites {{are being used to}} teach dozens of different subjects from primary school to university. Evaluation studies have found that students using Electronic Classroom often felt involved in the learning process more than might be the case with "regular " classroom methods. They were able to clearly differentiate between different teachers and their respective teaching styles, and preferred teachers who facilitated discussion rather than those who delivered a one-way address.
