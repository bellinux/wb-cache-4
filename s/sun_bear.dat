5|$|The {{subfamily}} Ursinae {{experienced a}} dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first {{members of the}} genus Ursus appeared around this time. The sloth bear is a modern survivor {{of one of the}} earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from U. minimus: the black bears (including the <b>sun</b> <b>bear,</b> the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). Modern brown bears evolved from U. minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{living in}} North America, American black bears are not {{closely related to}} brown bears and polar bears; genetic studies reveal that they split from a common {{ancestor}} 5.05 million years ago (mya). American and Asian black bears are considered sister taxa, and are {{more closely related to}} each other than to other species of bear. According to recent studies, the <b>sun</b> <b>bear</b> is also a relatively recent split from this lineage.|$|E

25|$|Sloth {{bears are}} {{sympatric}} with Asiatic black bears in northern India, {{and the two}} species, along with the <b>sun</b> <b>bear,</b> coexist {{in some of the}} national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. They are also found together in Assam, Manipur, and Mizoram, in the hills south of the Brahmaputra River, the only places occupied by all three bear species. The three species do not act aggressively toward each other. This may be because the three species generally differ in habit and dietary preferences.|$|E
25|$|Many locals say Orang Pendek's feet {{look like}} those of a child, {{evidenced}} by foot prints they have found while walking through the forest. However, another local animal, the <b>sun</b> <b>bear,</b> is a possible source of these sightings. Bears in general are known for having feet that look quite human-like, and the size of a sun bear's {{are similar to those of}} a child. In addition, gibbons populate the forests in this area and are known to occasionally descend to the ground and walk for a few seconds at a time on two legs. Witnesses could possibly be seeing orangutans; however: 1) this species has long been thought to have died out in all but the northern regions of Sumatra and 2) witnesses almost never describe the animal as having orange fur.|$|E
25|$|A {{black bear}} has better {{eyesight}} {{and a better}} sense of hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense is the sense of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies, and hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the <b>sun</b> <b>bear,</b> being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time of the day or night although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Their social behavior is somewhat similar to that of canids.|$|E

Bedding sites consist mainly of fallen hollow logs, but they also rest in standing trees with cavities, in cavities underneath fallen logs or tree roots, and in tree branches high above the ground.|$|R
25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are close {{relatives}} to American black bears, {{with which they}} share a European common ancestor; the two species {{are thought to have}} diverged 3 million years ago, though genetic evidence is inconclusive. Both American and Asiatic species are considered sister taxa, and are more closely related to each other than other species of bear. The earliest American black bear fossils, which were located in Port Kennedy, Pennsylvania, greatly resemble the Asiatic species. The first mtDNA study undertaken on Asian black bears suggested that the species arose after the American black bears, while a second study could not statistically resolve the branching order of sloth bears and the two black species, suggesting that these three species underwent a rapid radiation event. A third study suggested that American black bears and Asian black bears diverged as sister taxa after the sloth bear lineage and before the <b>sun</b> <b>bear</b> lineage. Further investigations on the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence indicate that the divergence of continental and Japanese black bear populations might have occurred when bears crossed the land bridge between the Korean peninsula and Japan 500,000 years ago, which is consistent with paleontological evidence.|$|E
500|$|By January 1927, Marquis {{was working}} this {{material}} {{into a book}} that would eventually become The Cheyennes of Montana. There were to be chapters on Chaudel, Iron Teeth, Wooden Leg, and Tangled Yellow Hair. However, Marquis developed a particularly strong relationship with Wooden Leg, whose lengthy narrative eventually became a separate book, A Warrior Who Fought Custer. Also covered separately was Kate Big Head's narrative, published as She Watched Custer's Last Battle. Another narrative included in The Cheyennes is, [...] "A Cheyenne Old Man". Though the man was not named by Marquis, a photograph of him {{was included in the}} book, and he was subsequently identified as <b>Sun</b> <b>Bear,</b> a veteran of both the Fetterman Fight and the Custer battle.|$|E
500|$|Wooden Leg spoke little English and Marquis spoke no Cheyenne. [...] They communicated {{mainly through}} Plains Indian Sign Language and only {{occasionally}} used an interpreter.

[...] The book is an amalgam of material from Wooden Leg along with support and corroboration from many contributors, including most of the seventeen Northern Cheyenne participants of the Battle of the Little Big Horn still alive {{at the time of}} the interviews. [...] From these, Marquis gives specific credits to Limpy, Pine, Bobtail Horse, <b>Sun</b> <b>Bear,</b> Black Horse, Two Feathers, Wolf Chief, Little Sun, Blackbird, Big Beaver, White Moon, White Wolf, Big Crow, Medicine Bull, and the younger Little Wolf.

500|$|The {{earliest}} criticism {{comes with}} Ghent's {{review in the}} New York Times of the Wooden Leg book after its first publication in 1931. [...] "No student of the battle is likely to accept any of the new revelations." [...] Ghent is dismissive {{of the value of}} Indians as eyewitnesses: [...] "...he tells what he remembers, along with much that he has imagined..." [...] and insists that the [...] "body of authenticated fact is in no danger of being disturbed by any new material from any source". Weist describes this review as [...] "somewhat supercilious" [...] and goes on to point out that Marquis has many other witnesses confirming the story, and that the only eyewitnesses are Indians. Marquis names a dozen of these in the introduction to the Wooden Leg book, one of whom, <b>Sun</b> <b>Bear,</b> gives a similar account in The Cheyennes of Montana. However, Marquis has many other critics who say he either exaggerated the role played by suicide or is entirely mistaken.|$|E
