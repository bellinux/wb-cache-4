500|$|... is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, {{and published by}} Square Enix for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and later for Microsoft Windows via Steam. It was released worldwide in March 2015, while the <b>Steam</b> <b>port</b> was released in August 2015. Type-0 HD is a high-definition remaster of the Japan-exclusive PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type-0, a spin-off from the main Final Fantasy series {{and part of the}} Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, a set of games sharing a common mythos. The story focuses on Class Zero, a group of fourteen students from the Dominion of Rubrum who must fight the neighboring Militesi Empire when they launch an assault on the other Crystal States of Orience. In doing so, the group become entangled in both the efforts to push back and defeat the forces of Militesi, and the secret behind the war and the existence of the crystals.|$|E
2500|$|On December 6, 2014, it was {{announced}} at the PlayStation Experience that Ultra Street Fighter IV will be ported to PlayStation 4 by Other Ocean Interactive; the game was released on May 26, 2015. The port became noted for containing {{a large number of}} bugs and glitches; while the PS4 port was originally scheduled to be used at EVO 2015, it was later announced that the tournament would revert to using the Xbox 360 version. On July 18, 2015, the <b>Steam</b> <b>port</b> of the game was free to play (until the next day) in celebration of EVO 2015. Around the time of EVO 2015, Capcom's Peter [...] "Combofiend" [...] Rosas mentioned in a blog that Capcom and Sony have come to [...] a statement that the PS4 port is now the definitive version. He stated that all major issues with the port have been resolved as well as the input lag being on par with the Xbox 360 port. Regarding Capcom Pro Tour events, all Western Capcom Pro Tour events would be migrating over to the PS4 port starting with VSFighting 5. He mentioned that Asian events will continue to use the PS3 port until the PS4 version's release.|$|E
2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a <b>steam</b> <b>port,</b> [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|E
50|$|Long-travel piston valves {{allow the}} use of large <b>steam</b> <b>ports</b> to ease the flow of steam into, and out of, the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|So {{that the}} entire {{locomotive}} cylinder block {{does not have to}} be changed when the valves are damaged, they are housed in special chests. The valve chest consists of two elements which are forced into the cylinder block from the front and rear. Using special boring tools this chest can be bored out several times during maintenance. In the last illustration the junction of the two halves of the chest and the right-angled ports can be seen towards the rear. These are <b>steam</b> admission <b>ports.</b> <b>Steam</b> is admitted to the pistons of the steam engine through the front diagonal slits. The front area, outside the valve chest, is called the exhaust chest and discharges, via the exhaust pipe, the riser (Standrohr) and the blast pipe cap (Blasrohrkopf) centrally, underneath the chimney of the locomotive. The motion of the valve heads alternately opens and closes the diagonal slits or <b>steam</b> <b>ports,</b> thus controlling the admission and exhausting of steam in the steam engine.|$|R
50|$|In the 3001 {{class the}} steam chest was located {{underneath}} the cylinders, and contained two slide valves. The inverted {{placement of the}} valves allowed them to drop away {{from the face of}} the <b>steam</b> <b>ports</b> when <b>steam</b> was shut off, thus reducing wear. The steam chest and valves lay above the front carrying axle, and there was sufficient clearance to allow the steam chest cover to be removed over the axle for maintenance.|$|R
2500|$|The game's planned year {{of release}} in Japan was {{revealed}} at a Tales Of Festival in June 2014, while its exact release date and period of release {{in the west}} at that year's Tokyo Game Show. As part of the localization process for the game, Bandai Namco announced it was working to release the game across all major regions within the same year, with the localization starting after the game had released in Japan. The motivation behind this was fan reaction to the delayed release of the Xillia games. For the English release, the team actively considered including the Japanese vocal track as in Tales of Symphonia Chronicles. Dual audio was confirmed with {{the announcement of the}} game's western release window. Despite the high popularity of the PlayStation 4 (PS4) in the west, no initial plans were made for a port to that console due to a shortage of manpower. Later, due to the high adoption rate of the PS4 in western territories, and the popularity of PC games, ports of Zestiria to those platforms were created exclusively for western markets. Collector's Editions were created for Europe and North America: the collections feature DLC codes, chibi figures of four of the game's characters, an art book, and special cases for the game disc. In North America, the collection was exclusive to the PS4. In the European Steam version, a code for the <b>Steam</b> <b>port</b> of Tales of Symphonia was included. The PS4 version was later released in Japan on 7 July 2016 as a [...] "Welcome Price!!" [...] budget edition.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Steam</b> <b>port</b> was {{released}} on April 26, 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Lap is {{the amount}} by which the valve {{overlaps}} each <b>steam</b> <b>port</b> at the middle position of each valve. [...] However, {{there are two different}} types of lap.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{the game}} was moved to a newer version of engine with added support of <b>Steam</b> Workshop. <b>Porting</b> job was handled by Abstraction Games.|$|R
50|$|The Class 19D, nicknamed Dolly, {{was very}} similar to its {{predecessor}} Class 19C, but Day specified piston valves and Walschaerts valve gear instead of rotary cam poppet valve gear. The cylinders were redesigned with straighter <b>steam</b> <b>ports</b> while the valve gear itself was revamped with a longer steam lap and greater valve travel. In all other respects they were identical to the Class 19C. The last five locomotives of the first batch from Krupp, numbers 2521 to 2525, were fitted with exhaust steam injectors.|$|R
50|$|In most {{reciprocating}} piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder {{by the same}} port. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events - admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing <b>steam</b> <b>ports</b> communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, {{of which there are}} many types.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{double-acting}} {{slide valve}} cylinder.Steam enters via the <b>steam</b> <b>port</b> SP, and is admitted by the slide valve SV through the upper passage S to push down the piston P. At the same time, exhaust steam from below the piston passes {{back up the}} lower passage S, via the valve cavity, to exhaust E. As the piston descends, the valve moves upwards to admit steam below the piston and release exhaust from above.|$|E
5000|$|When on the move, a steam {{locomotive}} requires steam {{to enter the}} cylinder at a controlled rate. [...] This entails controlling the admission and exhaustion of steam {{to and from the}} cylinders. [...] Steam enters and leaves the valve through a <b>steam</b> <b>port,</b> usually at the middle position of the piston valve. [...] Where the valve is in contact with the steam ports, a consideration of the [...] "lap" [...] and [...] "lead" [...] is required.|$|E
5000|$|... lead is {{the amount}} by which the <b>steam</b> <b>port</b> is open when the piston is static at front or back dead centre. Pre-admission of steam fills the {{clearance}} space between the cylinder and piston and ensures maximum cylinder pressure at the commencement of the stroke. The design criteria is to both cushion or assist {{the mass of the}} piston slow down and change direction and to reach a maximum pressure of the same value as the incoming steam. At slow speeds no lead is ideal. Source Pelland Engineering. Lead is particularly necessary on locomotives designed for high speeds, under which conditions the valve events are taking place in rapid succession.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of Stanier's Jubilee Class also suffered from incorrect boiler proportions. In 1935 a design for an improved taper boiler was schemed out; this was 13 feet long, with 198 tubes 1¾ inches in diameter. In 1943 Stanier instructed Coleman, the chief designer at Derby, to rebuild {{two of the}} Jubilee class with boilers to this design. This type of boiler was designated type 2A. Combined with modifications to the <b>steam</b> <b>ports</b> and valve gear, the rebuilding produced locomotives that were more powerful and economical than either the original Jubilees or the Royal Scots.|$|R

50|$|A {{version for}} the game for the PlayStation Portable was {{released}} on May 31, 2012 in Japan. This version features an exclusive BBQ (BlazBlue Quiz) Mode {{not found in the}} other versions. However, while the other versions have full online play, the PSP version is limited to ad-hoc, with support for two to four players. On November 14, 2014, it was confirmed by Korean studio H2 Interactive that the game would be receiving a port to Valve Corporation's digital store, Steam, to be released on December 11, 2014 with online play intact, unlike the <b>Steam</b> <b>port</b> of Calamity Trigger which had the netplay removed possibly due to the game's usage of Games for Windows - Live.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reversing}} lever in locomotive history is documented from about 1842. The American Railway Master Mechanic's Association had members that published illustrations. Parts for the {{reversing lever}} are drawn in the [...] "Locomotive Dictionary", 1st edition (1906), by George Little Fowler. The lever {{is linked to}} the valve gear piston inside the high pressure <b>steam</b> <b>port.</b> The steam pressure faucet is closed to cut off power, and after coming to a halt, the valve gear piston could safely be moved a short distance using the lever as a fulcrum linked to the piston inside. Although the linkage was designed to give leverage, the Johnson Bar would take a firm throw to move and lock in position. Some locomotives had a screw reversing gear instead.|$|E

50|$|The {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} steam chest and slide valves located beneath the cylinders. The valves were driven by Stephenson valve gear. This {{inverted}} arrangement of slide valves and steam chest, originally introduced by William Stroudley of the LSBCR, allowed the valves to drop away from the cylinder's <b>steam</b> <b>port</b> faces when the regulator was closed, thus reducing wear. Because the steam chest was below the cylinders, and not between them, the latter could have an increased diameter. The centre line of the cylinders was inclined at an angle of 6° to the centre line of the valves, each centre line being aligned with the driving centre. This arrangement allowed the valve rods to be driven directly from the expansion link. First used on the Armstrong and 3031 Classes, this arrangement of cylinders, valves and valve gear was subsequently used on all GWR outside framed 4-4-0s, with the slide valves being eventually replaced by piston valves.|$|E

This position had the advantage that, when the regulator was closed and steam pressure shut off, the valves would drop away from the <b>steam</b> <b>ports,</b> thus reducing wear on the valves and port faces. Dean's earlier designs had used slide valves mounted vertically between the cylinders; the new position allowed an increase in cylinder diameter from 17 in to 20 in in the Armstrong Class. The Dukes had 18 in diameter cylinders, possibly due to permanent way weight restrictions and a reduced supply of steam from the Dukes' smaller boilers.|$|R

50|$|Big Bertha's {{cylinder}} arrangement was unusual. There were four cylinders {{but only two}} sets of piston valves because there was insufficient space under the smokebox to fit piston valves for the inside cylinders. Instead, the large outside piston valves (as well as supplying the outside cylinders) supplied the inside cylinders through cross-over <b>steam</b> <b>ports.</b> The steam-flow characteristics would have been poor (because {{of the length of}} the ports) but this would not have mattered unduly in an engine that ran only at slow speed. It has been suggested that this design has been influenced by the four-cylinder cross-ported arrangement of the Italian 0-10-0 FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotive (in which this was motivated by its being part of an asymmetrical compound design), of which a complete set of drawings were stored at Derby.|$|R
