POLAR 5, the Alfred-Wegener-Institute’s research aircraft, carried the ESA airborne Ku-band SAR interferometric radar altimeter (ASIRAS) and a laser scanner during the CryoVEx campaign. In the blue ice area, partly covered with <b>snow</b> <b>patches,</b> a dense grid of 30 km x 40 km with a line spacing of 1 km was measured. Here, we present results of the comparisons of the final SAR processed ASIRAS elevations with the laser scanner elevation model. We will show the influence of <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> on and the accuracy of the ASIRAS derived surface elevations by using the laser scanner DEM as reference. Furthermore, the derived Ku-band penetration depths and the thickness of the <b>snow</b> <b>patches,</b> derived from the ASIRAS data, are compared with the radar backscatter of a TerraSAR-X scene, acquired at the same time when the campaign took place. Our results show that Ku-band radar penetrates through the snow, while the <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> do not affect the derived ASIRAS surface elevations. In contrast the radar backscatter of TerraSAR-X shows a strong correlation of the thickness of the <b>snow</b> <b>patches.</b> The results of this study highlight the need of careful waveform processing/re-tracking and though will contribute to improved CryoSat- 2 elevation products...|$|R

40|$|Information on the {{temporal}} variation in snow-covered area of watershed dur-ing melt is requisite for accurate predictions of runoff. The {{amount of the}} gross watershed area that is snow-covered affects runoff primarily in two ways: a) it influences the melt rate, because patches of bare ground affect the energy balance of the snow field, and b) it governs the contributing area of runoff. This paper examines the area-frequency and perimeter-area characteristics of soil and <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> that form during ablation of seasonal snowcovers in Prairie and Alpine environments. It uses fractal geometry {{as a basis for}} quan-tifying these properties. Image analyses are applied to aerial photographs taken during snowmelt on two small watersheds: one in the West-central part of the Province of Sas-katchewan in the Canadian Prairies, the other in the alpine region of the Austrian Alps. The results of the study suggest that the soil and melting <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> behave as fractals, that is their perimeter-area and area-frequency characteristics can be described by simple power equations with patch area. The perimeter-area ratio of the soil and <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> decreases with increasing size of patch, but at a smaller rate than for Euclidean objects. The area-frequency characteristics of <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> follow a hyperbolic distribution with relatively few large patches and numerous small patches. It is suggested that the soil and <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> have the same fractal dimension. It is concluded that <b>snow</b> <b>patches</b> are not random and their size distribution is predictable. The variation in the edge length of a snow field per unit basin area during ablation is demonstrated. A maximum value of the ratio is reached when a basin has 45 - 65 % snowcover. With snow coverage in this range the potential for local advection increasing melt under a specific set of climatic conditions is greatest. K. Shook et al...|$|R

5000|$|On July 20, Wiessner and House first {{attempted}} {{the line}} of a great couloir that comes directly down between the main summit tower and the northwest peak. It was an excellent line for quickly ascending but {{they were unable to}} traverse onto the south face proper due to poor rock conditions and were forced to retreat to base camp. By 3 am the next morning they were already climbing up a couloir {{to the right of the}} face. Good weather the past few days had cleared most of the snow away from the ledges making for good climbing conditions. Following the left branch of the couloir, they reached a <b>snow</b> <b>patch</b> in the middle of the face. The final 1000 ft of the south face then presented a fierce hurdle of [...] "sheer forbidding-looking rocks" [...] as noted by Wiessner. While Wiessner initially started in boots, he quickly changed to rope-soled shoes and gave his ice axe and extra rope to House. Wiessner led several pitches up technically difficult rock including several overhangs. After traversing east across the face they rested on a ledge just below the southeastern ridge, a full 9 hours since leaving the <b>snow</b> <b>patch</b> on the south face. After climbing a short chimney they finally reached the small snowy mass at the top, 13 hours after their start in base camp. They aborted their earlier plan of descending the shorter north face and retraced their ascent line, reaching their tent on the Dais Glacier at 2 am. The ascent to the summit and back to base camp had taken over 23 hours.|$|E

50|$|The Bogong High Plains {{contain a}} mixture of various types of vegetation. About 50% of the High Plains are heathlands, which cover some of the steeper and more wind {{protected}} areas in the high plains. The soils are typically shallow and rocky. Approximately 25% of the High Plains are grasslands, which occur in more exposed areas, on gentle slopes are typically more resistant to wind and frosts. Some of the best soils occur in wetlands, which cover about 10% of the high plains. These areas are defined as places where there is stationary water {{for at least one}} month per year. The presence of water typically leads to highly organic soils, from the decay of vegetable matter, and very little mineral matter. <b>Snow</b> <b>patch</b> herb fields occur in places where snow remains for {{a large portion of the}} summer and are very rare.|$|E
50|$|The montane grasslands are a mixed {{habitat of}} grassland, heath and bog that {{is home to}} a rich {{collection}} of Alpine and other plants adapted to the cold climate, snow and harsh dry winters. The ecoregion can be sub-categorised in to montane (between 1,100 m and 1,400 m), subalpine (between 1,400 m and 1,850 m), and alpine (normally above 1,850 m) bands. At lower elevations a number of different types of eucalyptus tree including mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) grow on the rich soils of the mountain valleys while the trees of the subalpine elevations are snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora)and black sallee (Eucalyptus stellulatea) with a ground cover of heath shrubs. The tree line is between 1600 and 1800 m and above that the alpine flora consists predominantly of species of Poa (snow grass), usually associated with closed and open shrublands of orites, Grevillea, Prostanthera, and Hovea. At the highest alpine elevations, these mosaics may give way to a feldmark or, in zones where snow lies into the summer months, to a <b>snow</b> <b>patch</b> community. Sphagnum bog communities of Sphagnum cristatum and Empodisma minus (spreading rope-rush) occur in stream beds or other low-lying areas.|$|E
50|$|The Huntley Col trail {{starts at}} Four and a Half Mile Campground {{on the north}} shore of Azure Lake. It goes {{straight}} up the mountain without the pleasantry of switchbacks and is a steady grind of 1370 m to the Col. This climb takes at least five hours with backpacks. Huntley Col, between Mount Huntley to the west and Batoche Peak to the east, is the best place to camp since there is a year-round <b>snow</b> <b>patch</b> for water and it is sheltered from the near constant wind. On the second day, the route contours along the north side of Batoche and Tryfan, then traverses the hogsback north to Garnet. The climb itself is mostly on the southwest ridge with one rock pitch of 25 m where a rope and pitons are necessary and a rappel on the descent. The round trip from Huntley Col to the summit takes about 12 hours. The third day is the descent to Azure Lake. The optional fourth day is a cushion in case of bad weather, or it can be used for a hike along the Huntley-Buchanan Ridge as far as Tryfan Mountain.
