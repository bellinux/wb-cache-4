25|$|A typical <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> first {{converts}} the AC mains to a DC bus {{by means}} of a bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the AC {{component}} of an applied source (often a <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply)</b> whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is the amount of}} internal series resistance one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> a boost {{converter}} is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E

25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, a <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> chip, {{designated}} U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found}} to be vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E

50|$|A <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode power supply, {{switch-mode}} power supply, {{switched power}} supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|E

50|$|<b>Switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> units (PSUs) in {{domestic}} {{products such as}} personal computers often have universal inputs, meaning that they can accept power from mains supplies throughout the world, although a manual voltage range switch may be required.

50|$|<b>Switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{are usually}} regulated, {{and to keep}} the output voltage constant, the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> employs a {{feedback}} controller that monitors current drawn by the load.

50|$|Flyback diodes are {{commonly}} used when inductive loads are switched off by semiconductor devices: in relay drivers, H-bridge motor drivers, and so on. A <b>switched-mode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> also exploits this effect, but the energy is not dissipated to heat and instead used to pump a packet of additional charge into a capacitor, in order to supply power to a load.|$|E

50|$|Even with noisy sources, like motors, {{the total}} {{harmonic}} distortion (THD) of a grid-connected circuit is generally unmeasurable due to the essentially infinite capacity of the grid that filters these events out. Inverters, on the other hand, generally have much larger distortions, as much as 5% THD.
