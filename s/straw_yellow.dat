5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale <b>straw</b> <b>yellow</b> line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine <b>straw</b> <b>yellow</b> edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from <b>straw</b> <b>yellow,</b> to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E

500|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{a species}} of {{psilocybin}} mushroom in the family Hymenogastraceae. Known only from central Mexico, the fungus grows on decomposing woody debris and is found in mountainous areas at elevations of , typically in meadows or open, grassy forests associated with Hartweg's pine (Pinus hartwegii). The mushrooms have convex to bell-shaped caps [...] in diameter, atop slender cylindrical stems that are up to [...] long. The color of the caps changes with variations in hydration, ranging from dark chestnut brown to <b>straw</b> <b>yellow</b> or whitish when dry. The base of the stem is densely covered with conspicuous white rhizomorphs, a characteristic uncommon amongst Psilocybe species.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} of Suillus sibiricus is a {{medium-sized}} bolete.

In mature specimens, it is obliterated leaving a felty ring around the stem and fragments hanging from the cap periphery. The tubes are initially yellow but become brown, [...] or slightly [...] The pores are angular, wider than 1mm in diameter and the same colour as the tubes but stain dirty pink or vinaceous when bruised. The tubes {{that make up the}} pores are [...] long. Droplets can be present and these leave dark brown spots after drying out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{architectural}} theme continues {{throughout the}} interior of the palace. The first floor, being the piano nobile, is distinguished by windows taller than those of the floors above and below. Each window is divided from its neighbour by a pilaster. The repetitive monotony of the long elevations is broken only by symmetrically placed slightly projecting bays, many with their own small portico. This theme has been constant during all subsequent rebuilding and alterations to the palace. The only external changes have been in colour: at various times in its history the palace has been painted different shades. In the eighteenth century, the palace was painted <b>straw</b> <b>yellow</b> with white and gilded ornament. [...] Under Nicholas I in 1837, it was painted a dull red, which it remained through the revolution and early Soviet period. Following the restoration work after World War II, it was painted green with the ornament depicted in white, the standard Soviet color scheme for Baroque buildings. (The Stroganov Palace, for example, was also green and white in this period.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Hermann's {{tortoises}} {{are small}} to medium-sized tortoises from southern Europe. Young animals, and some adults, have attractive black and yellow-patterned carapaces, although the brightness may fade with age {{to a less}} distinct gray, <b>straw,</b> or <b>yellow</b> coloration. They have slightly hooked upper jaws and, like other tortoises, possess no teeth, [...] just strong, horny beaks. Their scaly limbs are greyish to brown, with some yellow markings, and their tails bear a spur (a horny spike) at the tip. Adult males have particularly long and thick tails, and well-developed spurs, distinguishing them from females.|$|R
6000|$|But what I valued {{almost as}} much as the birds {{themselves}} was the knowledge of their habits, which I was daily obtaining both from the accounts of my hunters, and from the conversation of the natives. The birds had now commenced what the people here call their [...] "sacaleli," [...] or dancing-parties, in certain trees in the forest, which are not fruit trees as I at first imagined, but which have an immense tread of spreading branches and large but scattered leaves, giving a clear space for the birds to play and exhibit their plumes. On one of these trees a dozen or twenty full-plumaged male birds assemble together, raise up their wings, stretch out their necks, and elevate their exquisite plumes, keeping them in a continual vibration. Between whiles they fly across from branch to branch in great excitement, so that the whole tree is filled with waving plumes in every variety of attitude and motion. (See Frontispiece.) The bird itself is nearly as large as a crow, and is of a rich coffee brown colour. The head and neck is of a pure <b>straw</b> <b>yellow</b> above and rich metallic green beneath. The long plumy tufts of golden orange feathers spring from the sides beneath each wing, and when the bird is in repose are partly concealed by them. At the time of its excitement, however, the wings are raised vertically over the back, the head is bent down and stretched out, and the long plumes are raised up and expanded till they form two magnificent golden fans, striped with deep red at the base, and fading off into the pale brown tint of the finely divided and softly waving points. The whole bird is then overshadowed by them, the crouching body, yellow head, and emerald green throat forming but the foundation and setting to the golden glory which waves above. When seen in this attitude, the Bird of Paradise really deserves its name, and must be ranked {{as one of the most}} beautiful and most wonderful of living things. I continued also to get specimens of the lovely little king-bird occasionally, as well as numbers of brilliant pigeons, sweet little parroquets, and many curious small birds, most nearly resembling those of Australia and New Guinea.|$|E

50|$|Little Yellow Jacket's owners, a {{partnership}} of Joe and Nevada Berger, Bernie Taupin, and Tom Teague, retired {{him at the}} end of 2005. Little Yellow Jacket was kept in a pen when the truck/trailer would pull up to take the other bulls away for the bull riding events. He would throw a fit because he wanted to go with them. Other times he spent in the pasture so he had exercise, company, and breeding with the cows. Berger also sold his sperm for artificial insemination at $700 per <b>straw.</b> Little <b>Yellow</b> Jacket would wake up mornings in his pen and command the other bulls to come join him for a drink of water. He was definitely the dominant bull at the ranch. Occasionally, adult visitors were guided to the ranch to view Little Yellow Jacket.|$|R

I could not well go with him, but I planned to overhaul him at Spokane and see how he was coming on.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{production}} process for fetal bovine serum is the harvesting of blood from the bovine fetus after the fetus {{is removed from the}} slaughtered cow. The blood is collected aseptically into a sterile container or blood bag and then allowed to clot. The normal method of collection is cardiac puncture, wherein a needle is inserted into the heart. This minimizes [...] "the danger of serum contamination with micro-organisms from the fetus itself, and the environment". It is then centrifuged to remove the fibrin clot and the remaining blood cells from the clear <b>yellow</b> (<b>straw)</b> colored serum.
