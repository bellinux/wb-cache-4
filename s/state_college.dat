40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to analyze the}} historical relationship between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its <b>state</b> <b>colleges.</b> In 1838, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts established the first normal school in the nation, with a specific mission to train individuals to become teachers in the common schools of the state. Over the past 150 years, much has happened to shape the present design of the Massachusetts <b>State</b> <b>Colleges</b> as they are known today. These institutions have evolved from single purpose institutions into liberal arts oriented <b>state</b> <b>colleges.</b> ^ During {{the development of the}} <b>state</b> <b>colleges,</b> the Commonwealth has consistently neglected to support the colleges. As a result, the <b>state</b> <b>colleges</b> have, in many ways, become the weakest segment of the Massachusetts system of public higher education. This study attempts to show that where a history of ambivalence and neglect meets a period of uncertainty, in a time of declining resources, the dependent organizations are in serious trouble. Given the lack of support shown towards the <b>state</b> <b>colleges</b> as a result of political issues, changes in demographics, and the predominant role of private higher education in the <b>state,</b> the <b>state</b> <b>colleges</b> 2 ̆ 7 mission, funding, and future are clouded in uncertainty. ^ Research on this subject specifically centered on state archives, reports, and texts on the Massachusetts <b>State</b> <b>Colleges</b> and the history of higher education in the Commonwealth. Personal interviews with prominent Massachusetts political and educational leaders were also used to gain present perceptions of the Massachusetts higher education system {{and the role of the}} <b>state</b> <b>colleges</b> within that system. ^ Conclusions were drawn from the data collected and recommendations were made on possible ways to enhance the role of the <b>state</b> <b>colleges</b> within the Massachusetts system of public higher education. ...|$|R
