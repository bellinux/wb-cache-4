[...] Penda's <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> {{during the years}} of Oswald's reign are obscure, and various interpretations of Penda's {{position}} during this period have been suggested. It has been presumed that Penda acknowledged Oswald's authority in some sense after Heavenfield, although Penda was probably an obstacle to Northumbrian supremacy south of the Humber. Higham accepts that Penda acknowledged Oswald's supremacy, but points to what he calls [...] "the apparent failure of Bernician Christianity to penetrate the central Midlands" [...] as evidence against assuming a great deal of authority exercised by Oswald over the Mercians during this period. It has been suggested that Penda's strength during Oswald's reign could be exaggerated by the historical awareness of his later successes. Stancliffe also has a favourable impression of Brooks' interpretation of Penda's position at this time (pages 55–56); see note 29. Kirby says that, while Oswald was as powerful as Edwin had been, [...] "he faced a more entrenched challenge in midland and eastern England from Penda".|$|E

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} {{is one of}} the most important commercial biotechnological processes, and yet the component bacterial populations and their associated metabolic activities are poorly understood. The novel fluorescent dye hexidium iodide allows assessment of Gram status by differential absorption through bacterial cell walls. Differentiation between gram-positive and gram-negative wastewater bacteria was achieved after flow cytometric analysis. This study shows that the relative proportions of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cells identified by traditional microscopy and hexidium iodide staining were not significantly different. Dual staining of cells for Gram <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> proved effective in analyzing mixtures of cultured bacteria and wastewater populations. Levels of highly active organisms at two wastewater treatment plants, both gram positive and gram negative, ranged from 1. 5 % in activated sludge flocs to 16 % in the activated sludge fluid. Gram-positive organisms comprised < 5 % of the total bacterial numbers but accounted for 19 and 55 % of the highly active organisms within flocs at the two plants. Assessment of Gram <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> within activated sludge samples over a 4 -day period showed significant differences over time. This method provides a rapid, quantitative measure of Gram status linked with in situ activity within wastewater systems...|$|R

RESULTS: Work <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> in terms of actual doing were of some, but minor, importance to subjective quality of life domains, whereas satisfying <b>and</b> valuable <b>activities</b> were consistently associated with most quality of life domains. CONCLUSION: Although no causal relationship could be established, the findings indicate that open-market work might not be decisive for subjective quality of life, but that satisfying <b>and</b> meaningful everyday <b>activities</b> could contribute to a better life quality for those who have a severe and lasting mental illness...|$|R

Czech intelligence services must adapt to this situation and that's why I started to investigate particular Czech legislation.

The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them deals with different aspects of the <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> of the intelligence services. Chapter one is more or less general, subsequent chapters are rather focused on Czech intelligence services. The first chapter is introductory. There are stated a few definitions of an intelligence service.

We further compared the spatial distribution by different residential <b>statuses</b> <b>and</b> describe urban environmental features of the detected hotspots.
