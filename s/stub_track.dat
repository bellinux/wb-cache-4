2500|$|After a {{reconfiguration}} of the Nassau Street Line in 2004, {{the eastern}} (former [...] "northbound") platform was abandoned and now {{used as a}} storage area and the platform-level connection was removed, allowing the former southbound express track to continue south. The westernmost (former [...] "southbound") platform remains in operation and both tracks provide through service with southbound traffic using the former southbound [...] "local" [...] track and northbound traffic using the former southbound [...] "express" [...] track. The former northbound local track is now used only for non-revenue moves, train storage and emergencies while the northbound express <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> was removed. The former northbound [...] "local" [...] track merges with the former southbound [...] "express" [...] track (the latter of which is currently the northbound track) south of the station.|$|E

50|$|The only visible {{remnants}} of the original route are a <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> at Jennings, where the unused original track still joins the current main line.|$|E
25|$|South of {{this station}} there are unused <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> that {{formerly}} extended onto the Manhattan Bridge.|$|R
25|$|At North Station, trains heading westbound/outbound toward Lechmere can reverse {{direction}} using <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> {{just north of}} the station. No turnaround is available in the eastbound/inbound direction.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> {{are at the}} station, an {{indicator}} of a future extension to the Silverado development that is scheduled for an opening once there is sufficient development {{in the area to}} sustain LRT.|$|R
5000|$|Hof {{does not}} have the normal {{platform}} numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Instead the platforms are numbered 1a (southern <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> on the home platform), 1b (northern <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> on the home platform), 2 (home platform), 4 and 6 (second pair of platforms), and 8 and 10 (third pair). Even on the through platforms, the southern sections are indicated with an [...] "a", and the northern sections with a [...] "b" [...] (2a/b, etc.). The missing numbers are, or were, allocated to operating tracks not used by scheduled passenger services.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} a train is limited to what will fit on the {{shortest}} <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> in the zig zag. The Lithgow Zig Zag stub was extended at great cost in 1908, only to be completely deviated in 1910.|$|E
50|$|Both {{railways}} share {{a common}} terminal station at Rigi Kulm, although the two tracks are not linked in the station, and the two lines to Rigi Staffelhöhe follow slightly different routes. Each railway has a single <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> and platform.|$|E
50|$|When the Atlantic Avenue Elevated {{was closed}} in 1938, and {{subsequently}} demolished for scrap metal in 1942, the tracks that once served it {{were removed from}} the elevated station, but the abandoned <b>stub</b> <b>trackbed</b> remained part of the station for the remainder of its lifespan.|$|R
50|$|The two <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> at {{the station}} is an {{indicator}} which the city will expand the Red Line, the terminus is unknown at this time due to no specifications from the government, these are some possible places the CTrain will travel in South Calgary: Silverado, Walden and Legacy (210 Avenue) the expansion will be built once the City has completed some of Calgary's RouteAhead.|$|R
50|$|There {{used to be}} {{an upper}} yard having 2 {{parallel}} <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> plus a shorter stub siding all running parallel to the former Belt Line Railway line (today the Kay Gardner Beltline Park). Another track, located on an incline, connected the upper and lower yards; today, a short stub siding {{on the west side of}} the yard is all that is left of that connecting track. Various pieces of work equipment were stored in the upper yard.|$|R
50|$|Chita Handa Station {{has three}} tracks and two {{platforms}} - a western side platform (Track 3) and central island platform (Tracks 1 and 2). The station has a pedestrian overpass facilitating {{access to the}} platforms from both sides. From Track 1, a short <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> branches off {{in the southern part}} of the station.|$|E
50|$|During 2012, the ALP-44's were {{prepared}} for storage in groups of five at a time. This work includes the removal of pantographs and having the cab windows covered with steel plating. These units were then moved to Port Morris Yard and the Lackawanna Cut-Off <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> for storage in Stanhope, New Jersey, {{where they are now}} stored.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} Wörth-Karlsruhe section and Landauer Hauptbahnhof, the only {{remaining}} industrial branches are in Edenkoben. These have not been used for years however. The <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> in the Edenkoben industrial estate of Seewiesen was completely and irrevocably {{cut off from the}} station with the removal of track 3, because the pedestrian underpass was built on its trackbed.|$|E
5000|$|This {{station has}} two tracks and two side platforms. South of this station, {{there are two}} center <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> ending at bumper blocks used for {{laying-up}} and relaying trains. Further south, the two tracks of the BMT Nassau Street Line merge with the BMT Broadway Line via a flying junction as it enters the Montague Street Tunnel into Downtown Brooklyn. No regular service has used this connection since the [...] train was re-routed from the Nassau Street Line to the IND Sixth Avenue Line in June 2010.|$|R
50|$|North of this station, {{there are}} two <b>stub</b> <b>tracks,</b> which end behind the now-closed Queens-bound side platform. These tracks were {{formerly}} connected to the Manhattan Bridge, until they were disconnected in 1967 {{as part of the}} Chrystie Street Connection, with the BMT Broadway Line being connected to the bridge instead. Also north of this station, the former southbound express track (now the northbound track) splits into two tracks just south of Canal Street: the former northbound local track, and the former southbound express track (the current northbound track).|$|R
50|$|Phoenix Park is a tram {{stop on the}} Nottingham Express Transit (NET) {{light rail}} system, {{in the city of}} Nottingham suburb of Bulwell. It serves as one of the two {{northern}} termini (the other being Hucknall) of the NET's initial system, and {{is at the end of}} the short single line branch from Highbury Vale. The stop a single island platform, flanked by two <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> which are segregated from the adjacent road. Phoenix Park serves as one of several park and ride stops on the NET network, with more than 600 car parking spaces located next to the stop.|$|R
50|$|The North Terminal was at Archer and Cicero Aves., {{where there}} was a twin-loop {{arrangement}} with CCRy (CSL after 1914) Archer Ave streetcars. There was a shared station and cross platform changes could be made between the two. The two loops were not physically connected, and there was no joint trackage. There also was a <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> in Archer Ave. to store cars.|$|E
5000|$|The Green Line [...] "A" [...] Branch {{formerly}} diverged {{just north}} of the platforms; its trolleys stopped at a separate Packards Corner stop at Malvern Road. The [...] "A" [...] Branch was closed on June 21, 1969, though it was kept intact for non-revenue moves to Watertown Yard. The line was finally abandoned in 1994; a several-hundred-foot <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> was left until the mid-2000s to temporarily store disabled trains. The switch and the last few feet of track were not disconnected until track work in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|In Boston, Massachusetts, {{most of the}} {{trackage}} for the MBTA's Green Line [...] "A" [...] Branch (last {{used for}} regular passenger service in 1969), branching off at Packards Corner and running to Watertown Yard, was removed during road works in 1996; however, the switch and a <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> were left {{in place at the}} junction. Originally, the stub was several hundred feet long and used to store disabled trolleys; all but the first few feet were removed in the mid-2000s, and the switch was disconnected in 2014, but a very short stub remains.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} techniques {{that can be}} used to achieve such turning. Railway turntables require the least space, but can generally only deal with a single piece of equipment at a time. Balloon or turning loops can turn trains of any length [...] - [...] up to the total length of the loop [...] - [...] in a single operation, but require far more space than wyes. Rail wyes can be constructed on sites where a loop would not be possible, and can turn trains up to the length of the <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> at the end of the wye.|$|R
25|$|Rolling {{stock is}} stabled and {{maintained}} at the Cabot Yard near Broadway in South Boston. The connection to this yard {{is at the}} junction where the two branches split, near JFK/UMass. Trains are also stabled overnight at Braintree (Caddigan Yard) and Ashmont (Codman Yard), and at the <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> west of Alewife. Eliot Yard, on the surface near Harvard, served East Boston Tunnel (now Blue Line) cars {{for a short time}} and Red Line cars until it was demolished in the 1970s. (East Boston Tunnel cars accessed the yard through the now-closed Joy Street portal near Bowdoin and a track connection on the Longfellow Bridge).|$|R
5000|$|As of 2016, {{the tunnel}} portal and <b>track</b> <b>stubs</b> is still visible from Washington Street.|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{overhead}} infrastructure, {{as well as}} {{the tracks}} themselves, were mainly removed {{by the end of the}} summer of 1996 as part of a resurfacing project on North Beacon Street. Remnants of the tracks are still visible today in the Watertown Yard bus terminal (no longer used for railcar maintenance), as well as a short <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> at Packard's Corner, where the [...] "A" [...] branch used to diverge from the [...] "B" [...] branch. The stub, part of the former outbound track, was used for temporarily storing disabled trains until it was shorted to just a few feet long in the mid 2000s; the switch was not disconnected until 2014.|$|E
50|$|No.304 was {{especially}} constructed {{for the use}} of moving full length tram track. Imported tram track was shipped from the United Kingdom and taken to a <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> on Quay Street around the eastern corner from Queen Street where it was craned aboard 304, which has especially dished front aprons so over length rails could be carried. The rails would then be taken to the Permanent Way Department of the Auckland Electric Tramway Company Limited, later the Auckland City Corporation Tramways and finally Auckland Transport Board, where the rail was stored and bent prior to be relocated by 304 to wherever new rail was being laid or repairs or track replacement was required.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, the {{neighborhood}} {{was part of an}} area known as the Eckles Tract. In 1911, construction of the new normal school began in the neighborhood. To serve the construction, the Southern Railroad built a <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> northward from its main line. A streetcar line was extended eastward to serve the site. When the school opened in 1912, the railroad converted the terminus of its stub line into an official stop and built a waiting station in front of the school, near what is now the intersection of Highland Street and Southern Avenue, to serve passengers using the railroad and the streetcars. The neighborhood took on the name of the railway station, Normal Station.|$|E
5|$|The current bellmouth, built {{along with}} the Queens Boulevard connection, is two levels deep with two {{additional}} stub-end subway tracks named T1A and T2A. It is viable for future construction of the bypass or the Northern Boulevard transfer station. The original bellmouth stopped at 29th Street. The lower level of the bellmouth was excavated in 2003 for the LIRR East Side Access project, which also extended the subway <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> farther east towards Sunnyside Yard. Just above the connection sits the 29th Street Ventilation Complex, built with the connector, in {{the site of a}} former parking lot. West of the station, a second ventilation complex lies in Queensbridge Park between Vernon Boulevard and the East River.|$|R
50|$|Today's {{infrastructure}} of the station consists of the station building, two low-lying through passenger platforms and one cargo platform, walking bridge over south yard neck. Station layout consists of 8 <b>tracks</b> including 2 <b>stub</b> ended <b>tracks</b> (the first six tracks are electrified 25 kV AC system).|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} built on {{the west bank of the}} Penobscot River estuary just {{upstream}} of the confluence with Kenduskeag Stream. The train shed extended upstream from the station covering tracks between the station and the Penobscot River. Three tracks ran through and the remaining five were stubs extending downstream. The Maine Central Eastern Division main line extended upstream from the station to connect with the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Maritimes at Vanceboro, Maine. Maine Central Eastern Division branch line trains to Calais, Bar Harbor, or Bucksport required backing moves to cross the Penobscot River bridge approach upstream of the station. The <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> served trains crossing Kenduskeag Stream departing or arriving from the Bangor and Aroostook or from the Maine Central Portland Division to the Boston and Maine Railroad connection at Portland, Maine.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{reconfiguration}} of the Nassau Street Line in 2004, {{the eastern}} (former [...] "northbound") platform was abandoned and now {{used as a}} storage area and the platform-level connection was removed, allowing the former southbound express track to continue south. The westernmost (former [...] "southbound") platform remains in operation and both tracks provide through service with southbound traffic using the former southbound [...] "local" [...] track and northbound traffic using the former southbound [...] "express" [...] track. The former northbound local track is now used only for non-revenue moves, train storage and emergencies while the northbound express <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> was removed. The former northbound [...] "local" [...] track merges with the former southbound [...] "express" [...] track (the latter of which is currently the northbound track) south of the station.|$|E
50|$|The Yellow Line {{begins at}} the Dempster-Skokie {{terminal}} located at 5005 W Dempster St. in Skokie. A <b>stub</b> <b>track</b> extends north of the station to allow trains to switch ends. The line runs south from Dempster-Skokie at street level. After crossing Oakton Street, the Yellow Line turns east and crosses over Skokie Boulevard (U.S. Route 41). After the East Prairie Road grade crossing, the tracks rise to become an elevated route. At this point, the route passes the Skokie Shops CTA maintenance facility and crosses over the North Shore Channel. After passing over Dodge Avenue, the tracks descend into a trench. The line remains in the trench for about 1 mi, then passes under the Metra Union Pacific/North Line and Purple Line tracks to enter Howard Yard. The line then rises to serve the elevated Howard station. A stub extends south of the station to allow Yellow and Purple Line trains to switch ends.|$|E
5000|$|The present Jamaica {{station was}} {{designed}} by Kenneth M. Murchison and built between 1912 and 1913 {{as a replacement for}} two former stations in Jamaica. The first was the LIRR's original Jamaica Station ("Old Jamaica"), built c. 1836 as the terminus of the LIRR. It was remodeled in 1869 and again in 1872, only to be completely rebuilt between 1882-83 adjacent to and in use concurrently with the original depot. Covered platforms were later installed.The other station known as Jamaica-Beaver Street was built by the South Side Railroad of Long Island on the Atlantic Branch. It opened on October 28, 1867. It was razed in 1871 and replaced on Christmas Day of the same year. When the LIRR acquired the SSRRLI in 1867, the depot was moved to the south side of Beaver Street crossing on a <b>stub</b> <b>track.</b> Low platforms for this station stop were located {{on the north side of}} Beaver Street crossing. Timetables of the period show station stop as [...] "Jamaica" [...] for Atlantic Branch trains bound for Locust Avenue, Springfield, and Valley Stream, as [...] "Old Southern Road" [...] station. From 1908-1913, the station stop was listed as [...] "Jamaica (Beaver Street)." ...|$|E
50|$|December 15, 1977: {{extended}} to the North Station Canal St. terminal which was reconfigured with three <b>stub</b> end <b>tracks</b> replacing the turning loop. The Riverside line terminated here {{most of the time}} {{over the next few years}} as it was the only line scheduled with all double ended equipment (Boeing LRVs). Any PCC cars on the line looped at Government Center.|$|R
50|$|Balloon loops {{are used}} {{extensively}} on tramway systems with single-ended trams. Usually located at termini, the loop {{may be a}} single one-way track round a block. Single-ended trams have a cab at only one end and doors on one side, making them cheaper and having more space for passengers. On tram systems with double-ended trams balloon loops are not required but may still be used as they can provide greater turn-around capacity than a stub terminus; the Birmingham Corporation Tramways terminus at Rednal had a balloon loop {{in addition to the}} conventional <b>stub</b> <b>tracks,</b> providing extra capacity to handle weekend and bank holiday crowds visiting the nearby Lickey Hills. The Milan interurban tramway network, although using double-ended trams, had balloon loops at termini within the city limits so that they could be used as backup termini by the single directional trams used on urban service. In Milan, tramway depots are built as balloon loops, just as urban termini. Another example is in Potsdam, Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} reconstructed between 16 September 1907 and 1910 to handle {{increasing}} traffic {{and the proposed}} branch line to Göppingen, the Hohenstaufen Railway. This involved the building of an island platform with an underpass leading to it. A level crossing east of the station was replaced by an underpass. Two <b>stub</b> <b>tracks</b> and a turntable were built for the Hohenstaufen Railway south of the main tracks {{on the western side}} of the station building, where there had previously been a goods shed. North of the main tracks, two locomotive sheds were demolished in order to build the new freight yard. The second track of Rems line was being extended from Deinbach block post to Gmünd and this was put into operation on 27 April 1910. After the redevelopment the station tracks had 116 sets of points and two turntables. It became one of the 24 “first class” stations in Württemberg. The Gmünd-Wäschenbeuren section of the Hohenstaufen line was opened on 1 August 1911.|$|R
