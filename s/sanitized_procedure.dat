40|$|ATP-bioluminescence assay {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the cleaning and <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures</b> of stainless steel milk contact surfaces. Surfaces of a raw milk transportation tank, a raw milk cooling storage tank, an equalization pasteurizing tank, a pasteurized milk storage tank and a pasteurized milk packaging tank, as well as a milk centrifuge were evaluated. The Relative Light Unit (RLU) using a commercial luminometer and mesophilic aerobic counts (CFU. cm- 2) on surfaces were determined. There were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) in RLU on the assessed surfaces before and after the cleaning and <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures.</b> Also, {{there were no significant differences}} (p> 0. 05) in CFU. cm- 2 on the surfaces before the cleaning and <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures,</b> whereas different bacterial numbers were found on surfaces after the hygiene procedures. The surfaces of the milk centrifuge, raw milk cooling tank and milk packaging tank showed the largest mesophilic aerobic numbers after the hygiene, reaching 2. 21, 2. 18, and 1. 21 log 10, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is no agreement among the techniques for classification of hygienic conditions of the evaluated surfaces, showing a non-direct relation between RLU and CFU. cm- 2. The ATP-bioluminescence method showed that 100 % of the surfaces were under inadequate hygiene conditions, while the plate count method detected only 50 %, based on the APHA's recommendation, and 33 %, based on the WHO's recommendation. High variations in RLU measurements were observed, suggesting the need for more than only one surface analysis.

At the end of the cropping cycle, which occurred 120 days after sowing, crop harvesting was carried out and the plants were immediately sanitized with water, chlorine and ozone. After cleansing, the cabbage plants were stored in a cooling chamber at 5 °C between 12 and 20 days. To predict the effect of commercialization, the cabbage head were removed between 12 and 20 days from the cooling chamber, one part was analyzed and the rest maintained in a local temperature (22 ± 2 °C) for 4 days. The biochemical analysis of the following were determined: total phenols, total flavonoids, vitamin C, total chlorophyll, nitrate, polyamines and antioxidant activity after 0, 12 and 20 days storage and 4 days at room temperature (12 + 4 and 20 + 4 days of storage), for market analysis.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in studies on sanitizers other than chlorine that can maintain the quality of organic products without affecting their phytochemical content. The effects of using chlorinated and ozonized water treatments, as <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures,</b> on the post-harvest quality of organic and conventional broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) cv. Italica was evaluated. The biochemical parameters (chlorophyll, polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity) of the broccoli samples were analyzed at day (C) (arrival of the plant from the field, original features), and 1, 4 and 7 days after harvest. The polyamine analysis was performed on arrival of the plant {{from the field and}} on the first and seventh days. The cultivation procedure influenced polyphenol, vitamin C and total chlorophyll content, and the highest value was observed in organic broccoli after the fourth day. Flavenoid content was higher in organic broccoli. The use of ozone appears not to have had an influence on the amount of polyphenolic, flavonoids and vitamin C during storage. Total chlorophyll content was less affected by ozonized water than by the chlorine treatment as at the first and fourth days of storage. The highest content of putrescine was found in conventional broccoli, while the highest levels of spermidine and spermine were found in organic broccoli. Antioxidant capacity was highest in organic broccoli after day 4 of storage and was affected by the bioactive compounds analyzed.

We sampled crevices and junctions where, due to deficient reach by typical <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures,</b> bacteria can survive and establish biofilms. The sampling sites were the holding cell, cold storage tank, pasteurizer and storage tank - transfer pump junction. The culturable bacteria that were isolated after the sanitation procedure were predominantly Pseudomonas spp., Serratia spp, Staphylococcus sciuri and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. We assayed several phenotypic characteristics such as the ability to secrete enzymes and siderophores, as well as the capacity of the strains to form biofilms that might contribute to their survival in a mixed species environment. The Pseudomonas spp. isolates were found to either produce proteases or lecithinases at high levels. Interestingly, protease production showed an inverse correlation with siderophore production. Furthermore, all of the Serratia spp. isolates were strong biofilm formers and spoilage enzymes producers. The organisms identified were not mere contaminants, but also producers of proteins with the potential to lower the quality and shelf-life of milk. In addition, we found that a considerable number of the Serratia and Pseudomonas spp. isolated from the pasteurizer were capable of secreting compounds with antimicrobial properties.

40|$|Seventy-one {{presumptive}} Listeria monocytogenes strains {{were isolated}} {{over a year}} from 152 samples comprising raw fish (salmon, seatrout) and their products (mainly, vacuum-packed cold-smoked sliced salmon) in a selected Polish fish-processing plant. Contamination of raw materials was {{at the level of}} 4. 3 - 15. 4 %, whereas final products revealed significantly higher contamination (up to 77. 8 %) than regarded by other studies as typical (up to 40 %). Strains were identified using conventional microbiological methods (including API®LISTERIA tests) and the PCR technique (aimed at iap gene fragment detection). A random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was applied to analyse their intraspecies diversity. RAPD typing revealed an incidence of eight RAPD types. Three of them were isolated over 8 - 10 months during the plant monitoring. It suggested that they were a persistent element of 'in-house' microflora and the applied typing technique produced evidence that fish products could be probably contaminated at the last stages of fish processing (e. g. smoking, slicing, and/or packaging). Their occurrence was probably supported by clone selection caused by ineffective application of cleaning and <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The possibility of colonization of the production environment by fish-originated L. monocytogenes was also proven. Strains that belonged to a dominant RAPD type were additionally subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism-pulsed field gel electrophoresis (RFLP-PFGE). RFLP-PFGE confirmed intraspecies similarity of strains belonging to a dominant RAPD type. A subset of strains from salmon samples was also characterized by serotyping.

The main {{purpose of this study was}} to establish the effects of the former and in vitro factors, which have incidence upon the establishment of microesquejes. The effects of the former variables previous to the in vitro growing, which were studied, were: <b>Sanitizing</b> <b>procedure,</b> variety incidence, mother plant age incidence, among other ones. On the other hand, the in vitro variables studied were: temperature and hormonal compositions of the crops. This research was held at the vegetal biotechnology laboratory, which belongs to the biotechnology complex of the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander in “Los Patios” Norte de Santander, Colombia. The experimental procedure was held with two months old plants from “Maradol” and “Roja Melonera” varieties. In order to accomplish the different effects of each one of the variables, it was used qualitative statistical method for their measurements. The final results showed that all factors were important to the papaya microesquejes micro propagation.

40|$|Biofilms, {{containing}} pathogenic bacteria, {{represent a}} recurrent economic and safety problem in food industries, {{due to their}} high resistance to cleaning and <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The development of photoactive surfaces with bactericidal property could facilitate the elimination of such microbial biofilms. One solution may be to deposit a photocatalyst top-layer (TiO 2) on conventional materials used in food plants. Our aim is to study the photocatalytic activity of such layers on the adhesion and viability of different bacteria present on food plants, especially in pork meat factory: Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas fragi. Glass substrates were coated with TiO 2 thin films by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering under various deposition conditions (deposition temperature T, oxygen partial pressure PO 2). The characterization of the TiO 2 thin layers was performed using spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. And photocatalytic activity under UVA illumination (365 nm) has been checked for all samples. Bactericidal activity has been demonstrated on the bacteria tested by enumeration of the adherent cells and in situ fluorescent labeling after three hours of contact with the thin film and a subsequent UVA illumination. Adherent bacteria with damaged bacterial cell wall were observed using a scanning electron microscopy; this {{can be associated with}} presence of oxidative stress due to the photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2 thin layer. The selected TiO 2 coating presents a photocatalytic activity leading to an oxidative stress. This activity provides bactericidal properties against different strains from the meat industry. This thin layer could be optimized by modifying anionic composition (band-gap reduction) during coating in order to be active under solar light so it could be used to fight against biofilms...|$|R

Mixed culture biofilms with Pseudomonas putida (labeled with green fluorescent protein) and L. monocytogenes EGD were examined to determine whether one organism would enhance growth of the other. Mono and mixed culture biofilms were grown on glass cover slips, in M 9 1 x minimal salt medium supplemented with 1 mM glucose at 22 C for 24 hours using a flow cell. Images were taken using a scanning electron microscope and with a confocal scanning laser microscope, after staining Listeria cells with a Texas Red-X conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin. Confocal images captured at inlet, middle and outlet of the flow cell were analyzed with the novel biofilm program PHLIP for total biovolume and mean thickness. At the inlet, almost all biofilms produced highest total biovolume and mean thickness; this was significant for P. putida (P < 0. 05). In mixed culture biofilms at the inlet of the flow cell, biovolume contributed by L. monocytogenes cells, though not statistically significant, was higher than in monoculture L. monocytogenes biofilms (532 % increase). In contrast, in mixed biofilms in the middle section and at the outlet, biovolume contributed by P. putida cells was much lower than in monoculture P. putida biofilms, with reductions of 183 % (middle) and 793 % (outlet) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Understanding {{legionella}} {{distribution and}} relatedness {{is essential for}} determining the epidemiology of nosocomial infections and for aiding {{in the choice of}} effective control methods. Molecular typing also allows the assessment of strain interrelationship, so as to evaluate the evolutionary response of the isolates to the environment when <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedures</b> are undertaken. Chlorine-tolerant types may occur in hospital water-system when chlorination is applied, since the disinfection fails to completely eliminate legionella colonisation. Purpose: To assess the circulation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 in different wards of the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana by the study of the genetic variability and the chlorine-susceptibility, prior to and throughout the application of continuous chlorine dioxide treatment. Rapid enumeration and screening of chlorine-susceptibility was also performed by quantitative ATP detection. Materials and methods: A total of 61 Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates, collected during a five-year monitoring programme applied to the hospital water-system between March 2002 and December 2006, were selected on spatial and temporal criteria in order to follow the evolution of the colonisation. Continuous chlorine dioxide treatment of the warm water network was started in April 2003. 	The species identification was carried out by the mip gene nucleotide sequence analysis and the genotyping was performed by sequence-based typing (SBT), using the EWGLI standard schemes. Moreover, genomic profile of DNA macrorestriction digests were analysed applying pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), according to De Zoysa protocol. 	Isolates representative of the prevalent genotypes, isolated prior to and following the start of hyperchlorination, were studied for their chlorine-susceptibility according to the BS EN 1040 : 1997. Feasibility of the rapid assessment of chlorine-susceptibility using quantitative ATP detection was also evaluated. Results: The sequences of the mip gene of all the 61 amplicons of the selected isolates gave a single amplification product, which aligned with L. pneumophila strain Wadsworth. Both PFGE and SBT indicated the circulation in the hospital water-system of three types of L. pneumophila Wadsworth, showing allelic and electrophoretic characteristic profiles. Type 1 and 2 were randomly distributed in space and time, whereas Type 3 was isolated only after two years of water hyperchlorination and only in one building.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the combination of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and ultraviolet light (UV) as an alternative eggshell sanitization procedure for shell egg processing. In each experiment, two cases of eggs (720 total) were collected at a commercial inline egg production facility. To assure egg uniformity, only eggs between 57 and 62 g were collected from a single hen house. Half of the eggs (360) were commercially processed (washer and sanitizing rinse) following normal procedures outlined by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for shell egg processing (control group). The {{other half of the}} eggs (360) were washed as normal but without the sanitizing rinse. These eggs were then treated with 3 percent H 2 O 2 and UV light (treated group). The treatment consisted of spraying the eggs with 3 percent H 2 O 2 over the entire shell surface followed immediately by exposure to UV light for 5 s in an enclosed chamber equipped with germicidal lamps (UV-C). This treatment was performed twice. Eggshell aerobic plate counts (APC), eggshell breaking strength and thickness, albumen height and pH, Haugh units, and yolk color were measured after 1, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of storage. On d 15 and 45, sensory evaluation of scrambled egg samples was conducted to determine if consumers could detect a difference between treatment groups using a triangle test. Results indicate APC for treated eggs were significantly lower than the control eggs for all sampling days in Experiment 1. However, due to low initial APC in the control eggs on d 1 of Experiment 2, no significant differences were observed for APC between control and treated eggs during storage. No consistent differences were found for eggshell and interior quality measures with the exception of albumen pH. Albumen pH was significantly higher in treated eggs than control on d 45 and 60 and d 1, 15, and 45 of Experiment 1 and 2, respectively, with only an average difference of 0. 04 pH. In the sensory evaluation, only 33. 5 percent of the participants correctly differentiated between the control and treated eggs.

Avaliou-se em cada amostra a contagem total de psicrófilos para a temperatura de 10 C e a contagem total de micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos para as temperaturas de 20 C e 30 C. Avaliou-se ainda a presença de Staphylococcus Coagulase Positiva, pesquisa de Salmonella ssp. e a determinação do Número Mais Provável (NMP) de Coliformes Totais e Termotolerantes. Os resultados foram expressos em Log UFC/g. As maiores médias na contagem total de micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos nas amostras de alfaces e tomates foram encontradas nas amostras lavadas com água, independente da temperatura em que foram submetidas. Na contagem total de micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos nas amostras de tomate as menores médias foram encontradas na temperatura de 10 C. As amostras de cenoura verificam-se as menores médias de contagem foram encontradas na temperatura de exposição de 10 C. Em nenhuma das amostras foram encontradas Salmonella ssp, Staphylococcus coagulase positiva e coliformes termotolerantes. Conclui-se que independente da temperatura, tempo e método de higienização todas as amostras encontraram-se dentro dos limites aceitáveis exigidos pela legislação vigente, sugerindo que esses alimentos podem ser expostos a uma temperatura maior do que traz as legislações do Brasil. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the microbiota of vegetables under different conditions of time and temperature. We evaluated samples of lettuce, tomatoes, carrots and beets randomly collected from supermarkets in Santa Maria (RS). The samples of lettuce and tomatoes were divided in 3 treatments: Lettuce and tomato with skin in natura without sanitizing; cleaned with powder sodium hypochlorite, and sanitary water. We also analyzed peeled samples of carrots and beets washed with potable water only (not sanitize). After the washing and <b>sanitizing</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed, the samples were incubated in 3 different temperatures (10 C, 20 C and 30 C) for 4 hours. Samples were collected at time 0 (To) indicating the initial contamination level of each sample and after 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours of exposure at the temperatures of 10 C, 20 C and 30 C (T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4). In each sample we evaluated the total count of psychrophilic and mesophilic aerobic, presence of Staphylococcus positive coagulase, Salmonella ssp. and the determination of the Most Probable Number of Total and thermotolerant coliforms. The results were expressed as log Log UFC/g. The highest averages in the total count of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms in samples of sanitized lettuce and tomatoes were found in the samples washed with water, apart of the temperature in which they were submitted. In the total count of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms in tomato samples the lowest averages were found at 10 C. In the samples of beet, we concluded that in the count of mesophilic aerobic, the increase was directly proportional to the exposure time at 30 C. In the carrot samples we found the lowest averages at 10 C. In none of the samples were found Salmonella ssp, Staphylococcus positive coagulase and thermotolerant coliforms. We conclude that apart of temperature, time and method of sanitizing all samples were within the acceptable limits required by law, and we highlight that these foods can be exposed to a higher temperature than the laws of Brazil bring, without endangering consumer health...|$|R
