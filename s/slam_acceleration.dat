5000|$|Engine {{operation}} {{outside its}} flight manual procedures; e.g., on early jet engines abrupt throttle movements (<b>slam</b> <b>acceleration)</b> when pilot's notes specified slow throttle movements. The excessive over-fuelling raised the operating line until it met the surge line. (Fuel control capability extended to automatically limit the over-fuelling to prevent surging).|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} point for the transient is some steady state point (e.g. Ground Idle, Sea Level Static, ISA). A ramp of fuel flow versus time is, for instance, fed into the model to simulate, say, a <b>slam</b> <b>acceleration</b> (or deceleration). The transient calculation is first undertaken for time zero, with the steady state fuel flow as the engine match, which should result in zero excess turbine power. By definition, the first transient calculation should reproduce the datum steady state point. The fuel flow for '''''' is calculated from the fuel flow ramp and is used as the revised engine match in the next transient iterative calculation. This process is repeated until the transient simulation is completed.|$|E
5000|$|During a <b>Slam</b> <b>Acceleration</b> on {{a single}} spool turbojet, the working line of the {{compressor}} tends to deviate from the steady state working line and adopt a curved path, initially going towards surge, but slowly returning to the steady state line, as the fuel flow reaches a new higher steady state value. During the initial overfuelling, the inertia of the spool tends to prevent the shaft speed from accelerating rapidly. Naturally, the extra fuel flow increases the turbine rotor entry temperature, '''''' [...] Since the turbine operates between two choked planes (i.e. the turbine and nozzle throats), the turbine pressure ratio and the corresponding temperature drop/entry temperature, '''''', remain approximately constant. Since '''''' increases, so must the temperature drop across the turbine and the turbine power output. This extra turbine power, increases the temperature rise across the compressor and, therefore, the compressor pressure ratio. Since the corrected speed of the compressor has hardly changed, the working point tends to move upwards, along a line of roughly constant corrected speed. As time progresses the shaft begins to accelerate and the effect just described diminishes.|$|E
40|$|Inflatable {{boats are}} {{considerably}} more flexible than conventional metal or composite vessels. The RNLI {{have developed an}} inflatable boat, the IB 1, with improved performance which {{has been attributed to}} its flexibility or hydroelasticity. Current design methodologies for planing vessels predict the performance assuming it is rigid. Designing an entirely hydroelastic boat presents completely new design challenges and will require new design methodologies in the future. This paper considers how to approach an entirely hydroelastic planing vessel and how to divide the boat into practical problems. A design approach taking into account hydroelasticity could potentially improve the performance further by decreasing boat motions, reducing added resistance in waves and minimising the <b>slamming</b> <b>accelerations.</b> This paper reviews the literature relevant to rigid inflatable and inflatable boats and shows the construction of the IB 1. The hydroelastic design problem is broken down into three main hydroelastic events: global hydroelasticity, hydroelastic planing surfaces and hydroelastic slamming. Each event is defined, the relevant literature is reviewed and the possible advantages are discussed. A design approach is suggested using a hydroelastic design cycle. The hydrodynamic problem of interacting sponsons is briefly discussed. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the approach used {{in developing a}} real-time Gas Turbine (GT) thermodynamic modular model, based on physical laws and validated by comparison with experimental results. In the model each gas turbine component (i. e. compressor, turbine, combustor) is modelled in a specific module, by means of time dependent momentum, energy and mass equations, non linear algebraic equations and performance correlations. Specific devices are used {{in order to reduce}} the calculation time. The gas turbine simulator has been included in the real-time simulation model of the new aircraft carrier 'Cavour' propulsion plant, characterized by a combined gas turbine and gas (COGAG) configuration.

40|$|A 2. 5 m hydroelastic {{segmented}} catamaran {{model was}} developed {{based on the}} 112 m INCAT wave-piercer catamaran to simulate the vibration response for the measurement of dynamic slam loads during head sea tests at the Australian Maritime College towing tank. Numerical computations and results of dynamic finite element methods were used {{as a basis for}} predicting the motions and loads acting on the hydroelastic catamaran model. A load measurement system and data acquisition system was developed to measure the dynamic wave loads and motions of the catamaran model. A two degree of freedom spring-mass theoretical model was developed to predict the first longitudinal modal frequency response of an NPL 6 A hydroelastic model and was applied {{to the development of a}} three degree of freedom spring-mass system used to predict the wet and dry whipping frequency response of the catamaran model. Vibration tests were performed on the catamaran model in air and still water to investigate the effects of stiffness and mass on the first longitudinal modal frequency response. The whipping frequency of the catamaran model was validated using full-scale <b>slamming</b> and whipping <b>accelerations</b> obtained on a 112 m INCAT catamaran vessel during a delivery voyage to Japan. Towing tank tests were performed in regular seas to measure the dynamic slam loads acting on the centre bow and vertical bending moments acting in the demihulls of the catamaran model as a function of speed, wave frequency and wave height to establish the operational loads acting on the full-scale 112 m INCAT catamaran vessel. An analysis was performed on the catamaran model slamming kinematics in regular seas to form a basis for developing numerical techniques used to predict slam occurrence and slam severity. The effects of variations of wave height, model test speed and wave encounter frequency were combined so as to express slam severity in terms of the maximum relative bow velocity. Peak slam forces measured on the bow of the model were found to approach the weight of the model this being similar to the findings of full-scale vessel trials. Slam impulses when scaled found greater slam durations at full-scale while scaling of the peak strain energy showed that the hydroelastic model provides a good basis for simulating the energy imparted by the slam into whipping. Thorough testing over a range of encounter frequencies and wave heights exposed the catamaran model to extremely severe slamming without evidence of complete bow immersion indicating that the INCAT 112 m wave piercer design is inherently seaworthy and relatively immune from deck diving in seas up to 5. 4 m...|$|R
40|$|Most {{gas turbine}} {{performance}} analysis based diagnostic methods {{use the information}} from steady state measurements. Unfortunately, steady state measurement may not be obtained easily in some situations, and some types of gas turbine fault contribute little to performance deviation at steady state operating conditions but significantly during transient processes. Therefore, gas turbine diagnostics with transient measurement is superior to that with steady state measurement. In this paper, an accumulated deviation is defined for gas turbine performance parameters {{in order to measure}} the level of performance deviation during transient processes. The features of the accumulated deviation are analysed and compared with traditionally defined performance deviation at a steady state condition. A non-linear model based diagnostic method, combined with a genetic algorithm (GA), is developed and applied to a model gas turbine engine to diagnose engine faults by using the accumulated deviation obtained from transient measurement. Typical transient measurable parameters of gas turbine engines are used for fault diagnostics, and a typical <b>slam</b> <b>acceleration</b> process from idle to maximum power is chosen in the analysis. The developed diagnostic approach is applied to the model engine implanted with three typical single-component faults and is shown to be very successful...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} a criterion for the acceleration performance improvement of vessels whose propulsion system {{consists of a}} gas turbine/waterjet combination. The criterion is developed and tested by means of computer simulation, through a complex mathematical model applied here to a fast trimaran ferry. The model consists of several modules, describing the dynamic performance of the different elements of the propulsion system (i. e. : gas turbine, waterjet, hull resistance, telegraph, engine governor, etc.). So, linking together the modules, the dynamic simulation model of the ship propulsion system is obtained. The improvement of the acceleration performance for the considered fast ferry is obtained {{by means of a}} careful choice of the telegraph setting, able to maintain, in combination with the gas turbine governor, each of the propulsion system components within its correct operative range. According to this concept, in order to optimize the acceleration performance of the ship, different acceleration manoeuvres have been considered and analyzed, by applying to the telegraph a setting logic similar to that used for the <b>slam</b> <b>acceleration</b> of a turbojet propelled aircraft. The analysis of the results puts into evidence the considerable improvement of the ferry acceleration performance allowed by the here proposed telegraph setting logic, as compared with an analogue acceleration manoeuvre obtained using a less sophisticated telegraph setting...|$|E
40|$|When a ship {{is caught}} in heavy seas, speed loss follows. This thesis focuses on the {{subjective}} part of speed loss; voluntary speed reductions to maintain {{the safety of the}} ship, the cargo and the people. The objective is to establish reasonable operability limits to objectionable motions that jeopardize the safety. Although the ideas presented in this thesis are intended to be general- ized for any ship, only single-hull surface displacement vessels operating in typical port-to-port missions are considered. Factors that degrade the ship performance, and thus the operability, can be governed by prescribing operability criteria that are set to an acceptable and an unacceptable level. These operability criteria and their influencing factors as well as their significance will be investigated in this thesis. A literature research was conducted to find current operability criteria of a ship. Individual studies were then conducted to verify or find new operability limits. This was done in three ways: First, a questionnaire to look at the subjectivity involved as well as verifying that oper- ability criteria from literature are valid for the type of ship investigated. Second, through ship service investigation to look at actual trends for sea-going vessels, the likelihood of a volun- tary speed loss for a given sea state, the amount of speed loss, and whether it was possible to generalize results. Lastly, the operability criteria found in literature and the questionnaire were implemented in numerical analyses to validate the limiting operability criteria. From the questionnaire, it was found that voluntary speed loss would become prominent for significant wave height around 5. 5 meters in a loaded and ballasted condition for head and beam seas. In following sea, voluntary speed losses become prominent at higher wave heights; around 10 meters. The questionnaire also highlighted a larger tolerance for root mean square roll angle, water on deck and <b>slamming</b> and lateral <b>acceleration.</b> However, with very varying results it was impossible to set operability criteria from the questionnaire. Human comfort was not indicated as a limiting factor in the questionnaire, yet from numerical calculations it was found that motion sickness incidences (MSI) was the operability criteria that dictates safe speed in both head and beam seas. In following seas, numerical results showed that propeller racing was the single most important factor inducing a voluntary speed loss. As no responses were recorded in the ship service data, it was impossible to set operability criteria from it. However, the ship service data gave valuable information about inception and occurrence of voluntary speed loss. It showed that a voluntary speed loss is likely to occur for significant wave height around 5. 5 meters, although ship differences occur, varying from wave height of 4 - 10 meters. Both the questionnaire and service data encompass approximately similar ship type and size. 24 of 26 answers from the questionnaire were received on general cargo vessels, and the ship service data only contains general cargo vessels. The general dimension varies in length from 180 - 230 meters, width of 29 - 32 meters and depth/draft of 10 - 35 meters. The ship service data and questionnaire data show good correlation, yet it must be empha- sized that general operability criteria were found to be highly dependent on ship size, type, heading, area of operation and type of mission. From service data it was found that vessels sailing in significant wave height larger than 3 meters consists approximately of 11 % of the time. For significant wave height around 5. 5 meters, the time is only 4. 6 %. Numerical calculations showed a higher importance of MSI in head and beam seas, and pro- peller racing in following seas. More calculations should be done though, as the questionnaire and service data was prioritized in this thesis. With the high subjectivity involved, {{one of the most important}} factors found was that ev- erything on board must feel safe (for the master), regardless of the actual situation. As the master holds the most responsibility, the action of lowering the ship-speed is dependent on a master s experience, preference, perception of the situation and willingness to expose the ship to hazardous situations. It is also important to emphasize that there is no guarantee that a speed loss will occur when exceeding the operability criteria. The service data showed that although sailing in conditions that normally yield voluntary speed loss, it is highly dependent on vessel. This thesis shows however that a voluntary speed loss is likely to occur for a significant wave height around 5. 5 m for a general cargo ship with dimensions as previously stated. The average voluntary speed loss is around 5 knots. This limit is however very questionable as there are large differences in answers received from the questionnaire and ship service data. Considering the relatively few responses from the survey, one should be careful in transfer- ring results, especially to other ship types. More research should be done on specific ship types, as well as getting an increased trend of more ship service monitoring where responses are recorded. This will make it possible to find feasible operability criteria from ship service data...|$|R
