[...] Specter noted: [...] "The Grads fell with monstrous concussive force throughout the day.

[...] Barsukov later joked that [...] "the usage of the Grad multiple rocket launchers was mainly psychological", and CNN reported that [...] "the general's answers were openly mocking." [...] Among Russian troops deployed to the village was an FSB agent from Nalchik, Alexander Litvinenko, whose ad-hoc squad came under friendly fire from Grad rockets. Heavy losses (including friendly-fire incidents) triggered a collapse in morale among the Russian forces.

5000|$|Speaking to a Mapai party {{meeting in}} Jerusalem on May 11 Prime Minister of Israel Levi Eshkol warned that Israel would not {{hesitate}} to use air power {{on the scale of}} 7 April in response to continued border terrorism, and on the same day Israeli envoy Gideon Rafael presented a letter {{to the president of the}} Security Council warning that Israel would [...] "act in self-defense as circumstances warrant". Writing from Tel Aviv on May 12, James Feron reported that some Israeli leaders had decided to use force against Syria [...] "of considerable strength but of short duration and limited in area" [...] and quoted [...] "one qualified observer" [...] who [...] "said it was highly unlikely that Egypt (then officially called United Arab Republic), Syria's closest ally in the Arab world, would enter the hostilities unless the Israeli attack were extensive". In early May the Israeli cabinet authorized a limited strike against Syria, but Rabin's renewed demand for a large-scale strike to discredit or topple the Ba'ath regime was opposed by Eshkol. BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen reports:The toughest threat was reported by the news agency United Press International (UPI) on 12 May: 'A high Israeli source <b>said</b> <b>today</b> <b>that</b> Israel would take limited military action designed to topple the Damascus army regime if Syrian terrorists continue sabotage raids inside Israel. Military observers said such an offensive would fall short of all-out war but would be mounted to deliver a telling blow against the Syrian government.' In the West as well as the Arab world the immediate assumption was that the unnamed source was Rabin and that he was serious. In fact, it was Brigadier-General Aharon Yariv, the head of military intelligence, and the story was overwritten. Yariv mentioned 'an all-out invasion of Syria and conquest of Damascus' but only as the most extreme of a range of possibilities. But the damage had been done. Tension was so high that most people, and not just the Arabs, assumed that something much bigger than usual was being planned against Syria.Border incidents multiplied and numerous Arab leaders, both political and military, called for an end to Israeli attacks. Egypt, then already trying to seize a central position in the Arab world under Nasser, accompanied these declarations with plans to re-militarize the Sinai. Syria shared these views, although it did not prepare for an immediate invasion. The Soviet Union actively backed the military needs of the Arab states.|$|E
