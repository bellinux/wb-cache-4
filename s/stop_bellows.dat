6000|$|I {{had barely}} started, when, looking up, I saw {{the sky above}} me: a star was {{twinkling}} just above my head. Had I been wide awake, and had the cow <b>stopped</b> <b>bellowing</b> for just one minute, I should have guessed that somehow or another I had got into a chimney. But as things were, the wonder and the mystery of it all appalled me. [...] "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" [...] would have appeared to me, at that moment, {{in the nature of}} a guide to travellers. Had a rocking-horse or a lobster suddenly appeared to me I should have sat and talked to it; and if it had not answered me I should have thought it sulky and been hurt. I took a step forward and the star disappeared, just as if somebody had blown it out. I was not surprised in the least. I was expecting anything to happen.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Sindri puts some iron in the forge {{and tells}} Brokkr not to <b>stop</b> pumping the <b>bellows.</b> Loki comes {{a third time}} and this time bites Brokkr on the eyelid even harder. The bite is so deep that it draws blood. The blood runs into Brokkr's eyes and forces him <b>stop</b> working the <b>bellows</b> {{just long enough to}} wipe his eyes. This time, when Sindri returns, he takes Mjölnir out of the forge. The handle is shorter than Sindri had planned and so the hammer can only be wielded with one hand.|$|R

But I must not let you off--I must keep my word!" [...] Tom cried, sobbed, and implored in vain. [...] "I can't help it," [...] he said, [...] "and now, don't howl! I had rather no one knew it. It will soon be over. I never thought to have this to do to one of us." [...] Tom roared and struggled, till, {{releasing}} him, he said, [...] "There, that will do. <b>Stop</b> <b>bellowing,</b> I was obliged, and I can't have hurt you much, have I?" [...] he added more kindly, while Tom went on crying, and turning from him. [...] "It is nothing to care about, I am sure; look up;" [...] and he pulled down his hands. [...] "Say you are sorry--speak the truth--keep with me, and no one shall hurt you again." ...|$|R

5000|$|The preface is {{followed}} by ten chapters which cover practically every aspect of organ-building: tuning, keyboard construction, making of chests, <b>bellows,</b> <b>stops,</b> etc.; even the instrument's position {{in the church and}} its decorations are discussed (Schlick's point of view being that excessive decorations are undesirable). Among other things, Schlick describes his [...] "ideal" [...] organ, which is a two-manual instrument with eight to ten stops for the Hauptwerk, four for the Rückpositiv, and four in the pedal: ...|$|R
50|$|As befits such {{a momentous}} venue, the Barony houses one of Scotland’s grandest organs, the Maurice Taylor Organ, which was {{installed}} in 2010. A Bach-style organ, {{the first of its}} kind to be commissioned in the UK, the instrument is designed for performances of Bach’s music in their original form and has been used for numerous concerts and recitals since it took its place. The organ has forty-one speaking stops, three manuals, one pedal, three thousand pipes, and features mechanical key and <b>stop</b> action. The <b>bellows</b> feeding air can be blown by foot, authentic to the Baroque period, as well as electrically.|$|R
60|$|The Master at Salem House {{lifted the}} latch {{of one of}} a number of little black doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned window on one side, and another little diamond--paned window above; and we went into the little house of one of these poor old women, who was blowing a fire to make a little {{saucepan}} boil. On seeing the master enter, the old woman <b>stopped</b> with the <b>bellows</b> on her knee, and said something that I thought sounded like 'My Charley!' but on seeing me come in too, she got up, and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of half curtsey.|$|R
5000|$|The ceiling {{came into}} place between 1734 and 1739. The south-side lectern was {{finished}} in 1739.

They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve {{the memory of the}} past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting <b>stops</b> and twelvefold <b>bellows,</b> a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever...|$|R
