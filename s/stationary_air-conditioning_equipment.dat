40|$|In recent years, due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of high-tech industry, <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> has become an essential facility. However, the power consumption of the <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> is considerably high, accounting for 40 ~ 50 % of the total building electricity consumption. The <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> includes chiller, pump, fan, cooling tower fan motor; therefore, how to reduce energy consumption and improve energy utilization {{will be a very}} important topic. This study used the sensors on the site to collect historical data of load change for analysis and conducted simulation and verification using the artificial neural recurrent network and MATLAB. The frequency of cooling tower fan was set as the output parameter and two groups of modules were established to effectively predict the frequency of cooling tower fan by rainfall to optimize the cooling water fan rotational frequency, in order to reduce power consumption of the cooling tower in different environmental conditions for energy saving...|$|R

40|$|Organic Rankine Cycle power {{production}} from low temperature resources has inherently a low thermal efficiency. Low efficiency requires increased power plant equipment size (turbine, condenser, pump and boiler) that can become cost prohibitive. The use of ORC power plant hardware derived from <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> overcomes this cost problem since air-conditioning hardware has a cost structure almost {{an order of}} magnitude smaller than that of traditional power generating equipment. Using the HVAC derivative concept a low-cost 200 kW ORC power plant has been developed as a derivative of a standard 350 ton <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment.</b> The corresponding PureCycleTM 200 product was introduced in 2004. It uses waste heat exhaust gases and air-cooled condenser equipment.

40|$|Energy use of rooftop {{and other}} unitary air-conditioners in {{commercial}} applications {{accounts for about}} 1 quad (10 {sup 15 } Btu) of primary energy use annually in the U. S. [Reference 7]. The realization that this cooling equipment accounts {{for the majority of}} commercial building cooled floorspace and the majority also of commercial building energy use has spurred development of improved-efficiency equipment as well as development of stricter standards addressing efficiency levels. Another key market driver affecting design of rooftop <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> has been concern regarding comfort and the control of humidity. Trends for increases in outdoor air ventilation rates in certain applications, and the increasing concern about indoor air quality problems associated with humidity levels and moisture in buildings points to a need for improved dehumidification capability in <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>equipment</b> of all types. In many cases addressing this issue exacerbates energy efficiency, and vice versa. The integrated dedicated outdoor air system configuration developed in this project addresses both energy and comfort/humidity issues...|$|R
