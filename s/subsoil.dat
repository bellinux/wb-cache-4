One managed site was cropped continuously for 15 yr while the others were cultivated for more than 30 yr. Concentrations of extractable cations and other nutrients from the paired sites were compared to determine the magnitude of change due to management. The ability of the <b>subsoils</b> to support plant growth was evaluated in a missing-nutrient greenhouse experiment with sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{caused by}} random traffic or repetitive tillage {{has been shown}} to reduce water use efficiency, and thus crop yield due to reduced porosity, decreased water infiltration and availability of nutrients. Conservation tillage coupled with <b>subsoiling</b> in northern China is widely believed to reduce soil compaction, which was created after many years of no-till. However, limited research has been conducted on the most effective time interval for <b>subsoiling,</b> under conservation tillage. Data from conservation tillage demonstration sites operating for 10 years in northern China were used to conduct a comparative study of <b>subsoiling</b> interval under conservation tillage. Three modes of traditional tillage, <b>subsoiling</b> with soil cover and no-till with soil cover were compared using 10 years of soil bulk density, water content, yield and water use efficiency data. Cost benefit analysis was conducted on <b>subsoiling</b> time interval under conservation tillage. Yield and power consumption were assessed by based on the use of a single pass combine subsoiler and planter. Annual <b>subsoiling</b> was effective in reducing bulk density by only 4. 9 % compared with no-till treatments on the silty loam soils of the Loess plateau, but provided no extra benefit in terms of soil water loss, yield increase or water utilization. With the exception of bulk density, no-till and <b>subsoiling</b> with cover were vastly superior in increasing water use (+ 10. 5 %) efficiency and yield (+ 12. 9 %) compared to traditional tillage methods. Four years of no-till followed by one <b>subsoiling</b> reduced mechanical inputs by 62 %, providing an economic benefit of 49 % for maize and 209 % for wheat production compared to traditional tillage. Annual <b>subsoiling</b> reduced inputs by 25 % with an increased economic benefit of 23 % for maize and 135 % for wheat production. Yield and power consumption was improved by 5 % and 20 %, respectively, by combining <b>subsoiling</b> with the planting operation in one pass compared with multipass operations of <b>subsoiling</b> and planting. A key conclusion from this is that annual <b>subsoiling</b> in dryland areas of northern China is uneconomical and unwarranted. Four years of no-till operations followed by I year <b>subsoiling</b> provided some relief from accumulated soil compaction. However, minimum soil disturbance and maximum soil cover are key elements of no-till for saving water and improving yields. Improved yields and reduced farm power consumption could provide a significant base on which to promote combined planter and <b>subsoiling</b> operations throughout northern China.

Traffic or no-traffic treatments were accomplished using an experimental wide-frame tractive vehicle (WFTV), which enabled operations without traffic on 6. 1 m wide growing zones. <b>Subsoiling</b> treatments included no <b>subsoiling,</b> annual in-row <b>subsoiling,</b> and initial one-time <b>subsoiling</b> on 25 cm centers to completely disrupt the soil to the 40 cm depth.

To determine the effect of autumn ridging and inter-row <b>subsoiling</b> on potato yield and quality a field experiment was conducted on sandy soil from 2001 - 2003. Autumn ridging showed comparable yields to ploughing and significantly reduced the incidence of black scurf from 2. 5 % to 2. 2 %.
