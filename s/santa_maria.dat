40|$|In this {{comparative}} study {{based on an}} internai analysis of Constantino Ponce de la Fuente's and Fr.

The survival of traditional forms of piety, as seen in Fr. Pedro de <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria's</b> Ordem e regimento de vida cristã (1556), corresponds eclectically to the modern forms - from Franciscan and Ignacian influences -; this concordance can, at that moment, be seen as an eloquent testimony to the «orthodox» integration of Rotterdamian mastership...|$|R

5|$|While Cáceres {{was engaged}} in what would evidently be a lengthy siege, Montejo sent a column of Spanish {{soldiers}} into the area around Gracias a Dios; he sent a second column, with 20 Spaniards accompanied by native auxiliaries, south to the Valley of Xocorro. Montejo led a third column in person, taking 23 Spanish soldiers to Comayagua. He also sent a message ahead, for <b>Santa</b> <b>María</b> de Comayagua to send support to Cáceres at the Peñol, and fourteen soldiers marched from there to join the siege. The Xocorro column was forced to return to <b>Santa</b> <b>María</b> de Comayagua after falling afoul of the Spanish authorities in San Miguel, who claimed they were infringing upon their jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria</b> dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria</b> dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten days}} of balloting in Rome, without any {{candidate}} approaching the requisite two-thirds, the cardinals adjourned until June {{and changed the}} location of the election from Basilica di <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria</b> Maggiore to <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria</b> sopra Minerva. After a summer epidemic in the city, and the death of Cholet in August, they dispersed until late September. The non-Roman cardinals went to Rieti (except Caetani, who went to his native Anagni) while the Roman cardinals remained in the city. As balloting continued into the next summer, the disorder in Rome increased dramatically (even by the standards of a sede vacante, during which, based on the biblical example of Barabbas, all prisoners were released). The deaths of newly elected Roman Senators Agapitus Colonna and Ursus Orsini around Easter 1293 further exacerbated the anarchy within the city, which had been marked by the destruction of palaces, the slaying of pilgrims, and the sacking of churches. After the summer of 1293, the cardinals dispersed and agreed to reconvene in Perugia on October 18.|$|E
5|$|Cairano first {{documented}} work is from December 24, 1489 {{with his}} commission for {{the cycle of}} twelve statues of the Apostles to be installed in the first dome {{of the church of}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria</b> dei Miracoli, Brescia. The installation of Cairano's cycle is contemporaneous with Tamagnino's installation of the twelve angels in the lower section of the dome.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} more important than his debut work at the <b>Santa</b> <b>Maria</b> dei Miracoli. Indeed, work in that church stopped around the same time. The sculptor returned to it only for occasional work over the following years {{to the end of the}} century; overall, however, work ceased until the mid-sixteenth century.|$|E
