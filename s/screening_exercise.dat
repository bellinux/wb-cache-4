40|$|AbstractA risk-based <b>screening</b> <b>exercise</b> {{was carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the significance of chemicals of emerging concern measured in water and sediment of the Great Lakes Basin. Chemical classes included pesticides, pharmaceuticals, organic wastewater constituents, nonylphenol ethoxylates, perfluorinated surfactants, chlorinated paraffins, synthetic musks and flame retardants. Maximum measured concentrations were compared to benchmarks selected or developed to reflect a conservative no-effect level and/or the lowest-effect level. These benchmarks reflected traditional effect information such as survival, growth and reproduction. From this analysis, several pesticides, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nonylphenol ethoxylates were identified as potential concerns and needs for further work were identified. Five of these chemicals (all pesticides) were identified in waters of both the US and Canada (azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion and metolachlor). Chlopyrifos, malathion and metolachlor are still registered for use in both jurisdictions; diazinon is registered for use only in the US and azinphos-methyl is not registered for use in either jurisdiction, reflecting the persistence of these chemicals. The results of this <b>screening</b> <b>exercise</b> also were compared to those of several other studies, revealing some common chemicals. Although there are several uncertainties and data gaps in the benchmarks and monitoring data used in the current <b>screening</b> <b>exercise,</b> {{the results of this}} risk-based screening can be used by agencies for priority setting, program development, and to support ongoing collaborative research and monitoring programs...|$|E

Nevertheless, randomized trial data on the clinical value of <b>screening</b> <b>exercise</b> testing are absent; that is, it is not known whether a strategy of routine <b>screening</b> <b>exercise</b> testing in selected subjects reduces the risk for premature mortality or major cardiac morbidity.
