The result provides an absolute difference between frames. An example of the noise reduction compared to the original <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> is shown in Fig.  6.

30|$|Since {{at least}} one of the filter {{parameters}} depends on the instantaneous magnitude of the <b>difference</b> <b>signal,</b> the differential equation describing such a filter is nonlinear. However, even though in general an NDL is a nonlinear filter, if the parameters remain constant as long as the magnitude of the <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> remains within a certain range, the behavior of the NDL will be linear during that time. Thus, an NDL can be configured to behave linearly as long as the input signal does not contain outliers. By specifying a proper dependence of the NDL filter parameters on the <b>difference</b> <b>signal,</b> it can be ensured that, when the outliers are encountered, the nonlinear response of the NDL limits the magnitude of the respective outliers in the output signal.|$|R

30|$|For {{a linear}} time-invariant filter, the time {{parameter}} τ {{and the quality}} factor Q in Equation 12 are constants, so that, when the input signal z(t) is increased {{by a factor of}} K, the output ζ(t) is also increased by the same factor, as is the difference between the input and the output. For convenience, we will call the difference between the input and the output z(t)−ζ(t)the <b>difference</b> <b>signal.</b> A transient outlier in the input signal would result in a transient outlier in the <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> of a filter, and an increase in the input outlier by a factor of K would result, for a linear filter, in the same factor increase in the respective outlier of the <b>difference</b> <b>signal.</b> If {{a significant portion of the}} frequency content of the input outlier is within the passband of the linear filter, the output will typically also contain an outlier corresponding to the input outlier, and the amplitudes of the input and the output outliers will be proportional to each other. A reduction (limiting) of the output outliers, while preserving the relationship between the input and the output for the portions of the signal not containing the outliers, can be achieved by proper dynamic modification of the filter parameters τ and Q in Equation 12 based on the magnitude (for example, the absolute value) of the <b>difference</b> <b>signal.</b> A filter comprising such dynamic modification of the filter parameters based on the magnitude of the <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> will be called an NDL.|$|R

The color artifacts introduced in the demosaicking process can be magnified in the subsequent zooming process and vice versa. This paper presents a joint demosaicking-zooming scheme by exploiting the fact that red/green and blue/green color <b>difference</b> <b>signals</b> are much smoother than the original red, green and blue <b>signals.</b> The color <b>difference</b> <b>signals</b> are computed using the high spectral-spatial correlations in the color filter array (CFA) image. The computed color <b>difference</b> <b>signals</b> are used to recover the green channel, which is then enlarged using an edge guided zooming scheme. The enlarged red and blue channels are obtained by adding the correspondingly enlarged red/green and blue/green color difference images to the enlarged green channel. Experimental results show that the proposed joint demosaicking-zooming scheme performs well in both visual perception and PSNR measurement, suppressing many color artifacts arising from demosaicking as well as zippers and rings arising from zooming.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) based {{resistive}} damping algorithm of power swing has been simulated. Based on the angle <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> {{extracted from the}} PMU, a resistive load has been switched on and off to damp the oscillation. The simulation {{has been done in}} SIMPOW.

Besides the simulation, measurement with a PMU has been carried out in the Power System lab of the department. The angle <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> derived from the PMU proved to be a reliable indicator of power swing. In the simulation voltage angle difference between two buses has been taken as an indicator for power swing and a resistive load is switched on when the derivative of this angle <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> is positive.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} have demonstrated early target minus nontarget {{differences in the}} human event-related potential (ERP) during visual object recognition tasks. It is unclear whether these differences reflect high-level visual processes, effectively indexing the speed of object recognition, or whether they arise from postsensory decision processes, leaving the actual time of object recognition uncertain. Here we report three sets of ERP experiments designed to determine what processes underlie the target minus nontarget <b>difference</b> <b>signals</b> seen in visual cued-target paradigms. We demonstrate that the same <b>difference</b> <b>signals</b> are present when the target match is made to word stimuli {{as well as to}} object stimuli, suggesting that the disparate mechanisms involved in letter string and object processing are not directly responsible for the signals. We also find that the amplitude of these signals can be reduced by increasing trial difficulty in three different ways: image difficulty, level of semantic categorization, and overall task demands. In many respects, the <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> is similar to the postrecognition P 300. Together, these results suggest that the target minus nontarget difference does not reflect object recognition per se, but rather postsensory decision processes...|$|R

50|$|A simple {{example of}} both {{backward}} and forward compatibility {{is the introduction}} FM radio in stereo. FM radio was initially mono, with only one audio channel represented by one signal. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, {{a large number of}} listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one <b>signal</b> and the <b>difference</b> in another <b>signal.</b> That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the <b>difference</b> <b>signal,</b> which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and <b>difference</b> <b>signals</b> are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Combined {{with the}} {{scanning}} of the probe array, this paper proposes an imaging method of the plate-like structural defects based on matching pursuit {{and the theory}} of time reversal. First, Match pursuit algorithm is used to the original signal processing of guided wave detection to improve signal quality, and provides a good foundation for signal reconstruction. Then it does algebraic <b>difference</b> of the <b>signal</b> before plate injury and the signal after injury to obtain the <b>difference</b> <b>signal,</b> and it uses the <b>difference</b> <b>signal</b> as time reversal excitation signal to obtain a set of time reversal signal. Last, the time-reversed signals are re-energized in the finite element model to simulate the actual plate, and damage imaging is realized {{in accordance with the}} principle of synthetic imaging. Experimental results show that this method can accurately extract the envelope of the signal, and more accurately detect the position of the defect, the range and other characteristics.
