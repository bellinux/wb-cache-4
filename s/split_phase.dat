25|$|The two {{standards}} were initially adopted because {{up to the}} second half of the 20th century in many regions of Italy electricity was supplied by means of two separate consumer connections — one for powering illumination and one for other purposes — and these generally operated at different voltages, typically 127V single phase and 220V single or <b>split</b> <b>phase.</b> The electricity on the two supplies was separately metered, was sold at different tariffs, was taxed differently and was supplied through separate and different sockets. Even though the two electric lines (and respective tariffs) were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s (the official, but purely theoretical date was the summer of 1974) many houses had dual wiring and two electricity meters for years thereafter; in some zones of Lazio the 127V network was provided for lighting until 1999. The two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a de facto standard which is now formalized under CEI23-50. Some older installations have sockets that are limited to either the 10A or the 16A style plug, requiring the use of an adaptor if the other gauge needs to be connected. Numerous cross adaptors were used.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{an image}} {{segmentation}} method based on directed image region partitioning is proposed. The method {{consists of two}} separate stages: a <b>splitting</b> <b>phase</b> followed by a merging <b>phase.</b> The <b>splitting</b> <b>phase</b> starts with an initial coarse triangulation and employs the incremental Delaunay triangulation as a directed image region splitting technique. The triangulation process is accomplished by adding points as vertices one by one into the triangulation. A top-down point selection strategy is proposed for selecting these points in the image domain of grey-value and color images. The merging phase coalesces the oversegmentation, generated by the <b>splitting</b> <b>phase,</b> into homogeneous image regions. Because images might be negatively affected by changes in intensity due to shading or surface orientation change, we propose homogeneity criteria which are robust to intensity changes caused by these phenomena for both grey-value and color images.

25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Shear wave {{splitting}} of SK(K) S phases {{is often}} used to examine upper mantle anisotropy. In specific cases, however, <b>splitting</b> of these <b>phases</b> may reflect anisotropy in the lowermost mantle. Here we present SKS and SKKS splitting measurements for 233 event-station pairs at 34 seismic stations that sample D ″ beneath Africa. Of these, 36 pairs show significantly different splitting between the two phases, which likely reflects a contribution from lowermost mantle anisotropy. The vast majority of discrepant pairs sample the boundary of the African large low shear velocity province (LLSVP), which dominates the lower mantle structure beneath this region. In general, we observe little or no <b>splitting</b> of <b>phases</b> that have passed through the LLSVP itself and significant <b>splitting</b> for <b>phases</b> that have sampled the boundary of the LLSVP.

50|$|In North America and {{countries}} that use their system, the 120/240 V <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> system is used. A pole-mounted distribution transformer usually provides power {{for one or}} two residences. The service drop is made up of two 120 V lines and a neutral line. When these lines are insulated and twisted together, they are referred to as a triplex cable which may contain a supporting messenger cable {{in the middle of the}} neutral conductor to provide strength for long spans. The neutral line from the pole is connected to a ground near the service panel; often a conductive rod driven into the earth. The service drop provides the building with two 120 V lines of opposite phase, so 240 V can be obtained by connecting a load between the two 120 V conductors, while 120 V loads are connected between either of the two 120 V lines and the neutral line. 240 V circuits are used for high-power devices, such as air conditioners, clothes dryers, ovens and boilers, while 120 V circuits are used for lighter loads such as lighting and ordinary small appliance outlets.|$|E

5000|$|On {{electricity}} networks {{with a system}} voltage of 240 V to 1.1 kV, which are mostly used in industrial / mining equipment / machines rather than publicly accessible networks, the earthing system design is as equally important from safety point of view as for domestic users. In most developed countries, 220 V, 230 V, or 240 V sockets with earthed contacts were introduced either just before or soon after World War II, though with considerable national variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120 V power outlets installed before the mid-1960s generally {{did not include a}} ground (earth) pin. In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a connection to an earthing pin of an outlet. [...] For a time, US National Electrical Code allowed certain major appliances permanently connected to the supply to use the supply neutral wire as the equipment enclosure connection to ground. This was not permitted for plug-in equipment as the neutral and energized conductor could easily be accidentally exchanged, creating a severe hazard. If the neutral was interrupted, the equipment enclosure would no longer be connected to ground. Normal imbalances in a <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> distribution system could create objectionable neutral to ground voltages. Recent editions of the NEC no longer permit this practice. For these reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth connections that are now almost universal.|$|E
