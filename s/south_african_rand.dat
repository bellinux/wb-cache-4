40|$|Although service-learning {{pedagogy}} {{is widely}} applied internationally, {{and has been}} shown to effectively incorporate the experiential element of adult learning, its application to business education in South Africa has been limited to less than a handful of studies.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the student learning and community organisation benefits from introducing service-learning into a Master of Business Leadership (MBL) programme in a <b>South</b> <b>African</b> University. Service-learning creates the opportunity for students to apply the theoretical knowledge of their discipline (marketing and operations management in this study) to real (usually Non-profit or Non-Governmental Organizations) workplaces, in this case special-needs schools in various African countries, to the benefit of the needy organisations. In this exploratory, action research case study, teams of MBL students embedded their theoretical learning through practical implementation of a fund-raising project, as well as showed the development of management and leadership competencies.

25|$|On 30 July 2008, {{the dollar}} was redenominated. After 1 August 2008, ZW$10 billion were worth ZW$1. The new {{currency}} code was ZWR. The denominations {{to be issued}} were coins valued Z$5, Z$10 and Z$25, and banknotes worth Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$100, and Z$500. Due to frequent cash shortages and the apparently worthless Zimbabwean dollar, foreign currency was effectively legalised as a de facto currency on 13 September 2008 via a special program. This program officially allowed a number of retailers to accept foreign money. This reflected {{the reality of the}} dollarisation of the economy, with many shop keepers refusing to accept Zimbabwe dollars and requesting US dollars or <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>rand</b> instead.

40|$|I {{examine the}} changes in poverty and {{inequality}} in South Africa during the first 5 years {{following the end of}} the apartheid era. First, I construct new, comparable consumption aggregates for 1995 and 2000. Second, using the “cost-of basic-needs” approach, I derive lower-bound (R 322, in <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>rands)</b> and upper-bound (R 593) poverty lines (per capita per month in 2000 prices, adjusted for provincial cost of living differences) for South Africa. I find that real per capita household expenditures declined at the bottom end of the expenditure distribution during this period of low gross domestic product growth. The squared poverty gap significantly increased for most of qthe relevant range of poverty lines, while the headcount index remained unchanged. Inequality among the African population increased significantly. Even among subgroups of the population that experienced healthy consumption growth, such as coloureds or the Western Cape Province, the rate of poverty reduction was low because the distributional shifts were not pro-poor. I conclude that South Africa needs to grow in a way that also improves the distribution of incomes if it is to make significant progress against poverty in the short to medium run. ...|$|R
50|$|During the hyper-inflationary {{years the}} company {{produced}} high denomination notes {{to beat the}} rapidly rising inflation rate in Zimbabwe. At {{the request of the}} RBZ under the stewardship of its governor Dr. Gideon Gono released several series of the Zimbabwe currency. The Highest note ever printed in the world was the Z$100 Trillion note Printed by Fidelity Printers and Refinery in 2008 when the inflation rate had breached 3,840,000,000,000,000,000% by September 2008. Most of these notes were largely rejected on the market mainly because there was no change for them and secondly lack of confidence {{in the value of the}} notes. People opted to trade in United States dollars, <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Rands</b> and other forms of foreign currency. The rate of inflation and how fast the currency lost value could be seen in the watermarks on the banknote paper. Some bills were printed on paper watermarked with 1000 in them denoting that the paper was intended for $1000 note which was the highest note in the country in other cases the huge figures were printed on paper reserved for 500, 100 or 50 dollar notes.|$|R
40|$|From Mr Richard A. Werner. Sir, You report ("Deutsche Bank rejects claims its deals caused sharp fall in rand", April 5) {{that the}} <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>rand's</b> 37 per cent decline in 2001 "left economists baffled and raised fears that its cause was market {{manipulation}} by financial institutions", for which, among others, Deutsche Bank found itself accused. I {{would like to}} correct the first and clarify {{the second part of}} your statement. The Profit Research Center, an independent research and fund advisory firm based in Tokyo (in no way related to Deutsche Bank), placed a "sell" recommendation on the rand in February 2001, which we have maintained so far. Our international currency models are based on our measure of central bank liquidity injections, and South Africa is no exception. We noticed an extraordinary surge in the liquidity injected by the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Reserve Bank, beginning in late 2000, which has continued until this day. This autonomous policy by the Reserve Bank is responsible for the depreciation of the rand. However, it has also had its benefits: thanks to the booming credit creation we placed a "buy" recommendation on <b>South</b> <b>African</b> equities in January 2001. Equities are up almost 40 per cent in the past year. Therefore, the decline of the rand is neither baffling nor the result of manipulation by financial institutions. If one were to look for a manipulator, the only candidate would be the central bank. Richard A. Werner, Chief Strategist, Profit Research Center, Tokyo 150 - 0001, Japa...|$|R
25|$|In its 2014 mid-term {{monetary}} policy statement, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) {{said it would}} import special coins, known as Zimbabwean bond coins, to ease a shortage {{of change in the}} economy. Like the original 1980 coins, these special coins would be denominated in 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, but would have values at par with US cents.

40|$|Abstract Background In South Africa, where {{health care}} {{resources}} are limited, {{it is important}} to ensure that drugs provision and use is rational. The Essential Drug List includes depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN) as injectable progestagen-only contraceptives (IPCs), and both products are extensively used. Objectives and Methods Utilisation patterns of the injectable contraceptive products DMPA and NET-EN are compared in the context of current knowledge of the safety and efficacy of these agents. Utilisation patterns were analysed by means of a Pareto (ABC) analysis of IPCs issued from 4 <b>South</b> <b>African</b> provincial pharmaceutical depots over 3 financial years. A case study from rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is used to examine utilisation patterns and self-reported side effects experienced by 187 women using IPCs. Results IPCs accounted for a substantial share of total state expenditure on drugs. While more DMPA than NET-EN was issued, NET-EN distribution from 2 depots increased over the 3 -year period. Since DMPA was cheaper, if all NET-EN clients in the 1999 / 2000 financial year (annualised) had used DMPA, the 4 depots could have saved 4. 95 million <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Rands</b> on product acquisition costs alone. The KZN case study showed slightly more NET-EN (54 %) than DMPA (46 %) use; no significant differences in self-reported side effects; and that younger women were more likely to use NET-EN than DMPA (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions Providing IPCs on the basis of age is not appropriate or cost effective. Rational use of these products should include consideration of the cost of prescribing one over another. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Rugby Union ("rugby") is {{a popular}} sport with high injury risk. Burden of injury is {{described}} by the incidence and severity of injury. However reports have ignored the monetary cost of injuries. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to describe the monetary cost associated with youth rugby injuries. Design: This descriptive study quantified medical treatments of injured players at the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Rugby Union Youth tournaments in 2011 / 2012 and the days of work parents missed as a result of the injuries. A health insurer used these data to calculate associated costs. Methods: Legal guardians of the 421 injured players were contacted telephonically on a weekly basis until they returned to play. Treatments costs were estimated in <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>Rands</b> based on 2013 insurance rates and converted to US$ using purchasing power parities. Results: Of the 3652 players, 2 % (n= 71) sought medical care after the tournament. For these players, average treatment costs were high (US$ 731 per player, 95 % CI: US$ 425 -US$ 1096), with fractures being the most expensive type of injury. Players with medical insurance had higher costs (US$ 937, 95 % CI: US$ 486 -US$ 1500) than those without (US$ 220, 95 % CI: US$ 145 -US$ 302). Conclusions: Although a minority of players sought follow-up treatment after the tournaments, the cost of these injuries was high. Players without medical insurance having lower costs may indicate that these players did not receive adequate treatment for their injuries. Injury prevention efforts should consider injuries with high costs and the treatment of players without medical insurance...|$|R
