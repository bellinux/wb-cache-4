5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. <b>Substance</b> dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing <b>substance,</b> whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct <b>substance.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned <b>substance</b> furosemide.

Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the <b>substance</b> and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the furosemide found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing <b>substance.</b>|$|E
30|$|Single <b>substances</b> were {{preferred}} to mixtures of natural <b>substances</b> for two reasons.
