People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over.

25|$|Vienna is {{well known}} for Wiener Schnitzel, a cutlet of veal (Kalbsschnitzel) or pork (Schweinsschnitzel) that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and fried in {{clarified}} butter. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves Viennese cuisine and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include Tafelspitz (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with Geröstete Erdäpfel (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, Apfelkren (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and Schnittlauchsauce (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and <b>stale</b> <b>bread).</b>|$|E

500|$|Historically, acquacotta's primary {{ingredients}} were water, <b>stale</b> <b>bread,</b> onion, {{tomato and}} olive oil, along with various vegetables and leftover foods {{that may have}} been available. In the earlier 1800s, some preparations used agresto, a juice derived from half-ripened grapes, in place of tomatoes, which were not a common food in Italy prior to [...] "the latter decades of the nineteenth century".|$|E
500|$|Acquacotta ( [...] ; Italian for [...] "cooked water") is a broth-based hot soup in Italian cuisine {{that was}} {{originally}} a peasant food. Its preparation and consumption {{dates back to}} ancient history, and it originated in the coastal area known as the Maremma in southern Tuscany and northern Lazio. The dish was invented in part {{as a means to}} make hardened, <b>stale</b> <b>bread</b> edible. In contemporary times, ingredients can vary, and additional ingredients are sometimes used. Variations of the dish include Aquacotta con funghi and Aquacotta con peperoni.|$|E
500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from {{the dishes and}} place it on trenchers of <b>stale</b> <b>bread,</b> wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E

In Newfoundland folklore, the most popular type of fairy protection is bread, varying from <b>stale</b> <b>bread</b> to hard tack or a slice of fresh home-made bread. Bread {{is associated with the}} home and the hearth, as well as with industry and the taming of nature, and as such, seems to be disliked by some types of fairies. On the other hand, in much of the Celtic folklore, baked goods are a traditional offering to the folk, as are cream and butter. “The prototype of food, and therefore a symbol of life, bread was one of the commonest protections against fairies. Before going out into a fairy-haunted place, it was customary to put a piece of dry bread in one’s pocket.” In County Wexford, Ireland, in 1882, it was reported that “if an infant is carried out after dark a piece of bread is wrapped in its bib or dress, and this protects it from any witchcraft or evil.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The chiffonniers (sometimes {{translated}} [...] "rag-pickers" [...] in English) {{were the}} lowest class of Paris workers; they sifted through trash and garbage on the Paris streets {{for anything that}} could be salvaged. [...] They numbered about twelve thousand {{at the end of the}} Second Empire. [...] Before the arrival of the poubelle, or rubbish bin, during the Third Republic, trash and garbage were simply dumped onto the street. [...] The lowest level of chiffoniers searched through the common refuse; they had to work very quickly, because there was great competition, and they feared that their competitors would find the best objects first. [...] The placier was a higher class of chiffonier, who took trash from the houses of the upper classes, usually in arrangement with the concierge. [...] The placier provided certain services, such as beating carpets or cleaning doorways, and in exchange was able to get more valuable items, from silk and satin to old clothing and shoes to leftovers from banquets. [...] Six houses on the Champs-Elysees were enough to provide for the family of a placier. The next level up was the chineur, a merchant who bought and resold trash, such as old bottles and corks from taverns, old clothes and bits of iron. At the top of the hierarchy were the maître-chiffoniers, who had large sheds where trash was sorted and then resold. Almost everything was re-used: old corks were sold to wine-merchants; orange peels were sold to distillers; bones were used to make dominoes, buttons and knife handles; cigar butts were resold; and <b>stale</b> <b>bread</b> was burned and used to make a cheap coffee substitute.

2500|$|With the {{widespread}} arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts {{and a broad}} variety of shorts before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a newsreel, a short and/or a serial, and a cartoon, followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' comprehensive booking policy, which would {{become known as the}} run-zone-clearance system, inadvertently pushed independent theaters toward adopting the double-feature format. As described by historian Thomas Schatz, the system [...] "sent a picture, after playing in the lucrative first-run arena, through the 16,000 'subsequent-run' movie houses; 'clearance' refers to the amount of time between runs, and 'zone' refers to the specific areas in which a film played. Typically, a top feature would play in its second run in smaller downtown theaters [...] and then move steadily outward from the urban centers to the suburbs, then to smaller cities and towns, and finally to rural communities, playing in ever smaller (and less profitable) venues and taking upwards of six months to complete its run." [...] The [...] "clearance" [...] policy prevented independent exhibitors' timely access to top-quality films as a matter of course; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The bottom-billed movie also gave the program [...] "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. As the president of one Poverty Row company would later put it, [...] "Not everybody likes to eat cake. Some people like bread, and even a certain number of people like <b>stale</b> <b>bread</b> rather than fresh bread." [...] The low-budget picture of the 1920s naturally transformed into the second feature, the B movie, of the 1930s and 1940s—the most reliable bread of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
