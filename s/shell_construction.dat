2500|$|While timber {{construction}} was considered outmoded by some, de Havilland claimed that their successes with techniques {{used for the}} DH 91 Albatross {{could lead to a}} fast light bomber using monocoque sandwich <b>shell</b> <b>construction.</b> Arguments in favor of this included speed of prototyping, [...] rapid development, minimisation of jig building time, and employment of a separate category of workforce. [...] At the same time, they had to fight conservative Air Ministry views on defensive armament. Guns and gun turrets would spoil the streamlining, losing speed and maneuverability. The ply-balsa-ply monocoque fuselage and one-piece wings with doped fabric covering gave smooth aerodynamic performance and low weight, combined with strength and stiffness. Whilst submitting these arguments, Geoffrey de Havilland funded his private venture until the eleventh hour. It was a success beyond all expectations. [...] The initial bomber and photo reconnaissance versions were extremely fast, whilst the armament of subsequent variants might be regarded as primarily offensive.|$|E
