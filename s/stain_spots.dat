40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{geological}} factors {{linked to the}} quarrying and quality of roofing slate deposits, and gives recent research results on the loss of fissility by dewatering, and the oxidation of iron sulphides. Mineralogy, resulting (from the original protolith composition and the metamorphic grade, controls the colour, brightness and durability of slate tiles. The microtexture of the rock mainly controls the split fitness of slate (fissility). The structure: (folding, slaty cleavage development, So-S 1 angle, lack of crenulation cleavage and kink-bands, joints and faults) controls the exploitability. Additional factors, such as bed thickness and changes in facies are also important. Both very cold environments, giving frost, and arid conditions, drying the rock enough to remove water, produce a loss of fissility in slate. Ostwald-ripening by dewatering and some collapse of the crystallographic structure of phyllosilicates cause the loss. A mineralogical study of the iron sulphides in roofing Spanish slate (pyrite, pyrrhotite, marcasite), encompassing crystal habit and size, and their biochemical alteration processes (<b>stain</b> <b>spots),</b> allow the oxidation behaviour of different slates to be predicted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of centrioles, {{derived from the}} sperm flagellar basal bodies, and the centrosomal material (MTOCs) on spindle formation in the brown algaFucus distichus(oogamous) was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-centrin and anti-Î²-tubulin antibodies. In contrast to a bipolar spindle, which is formed after normal fertilization, a multipolar spindle was formed in polyspermic zygote. The number of mitotic poles in polyspermic zygotes was {{double the number of}} sperm involved in fertilization. As an anti-centrin <b>staining</b> <b>spot</b> (centrioles) was located at these poles, the multipolar spindles in polyspermic zygotes were produced by the supplementary centrioles. When anucleate egg fragments were fertilized, chromosome condensation and mitosis did not occur in the sperm nucleus. Two anti-centrin <b>staining</b> <b>spots</b> could be detected, microtubules (MTs) radiated from nearby, but the mitotic spindle was never produced. When a single sperm fertilized multinucleate eggs (polygyny), abnormal spindles were also observed. In addition to two mitotic poles containing anti-centrin <b>staining</b> <b>spots,</b> extra mitotic poles without anti-centrin <b>staining</b> <b>spots</b> were also formed, and as a result multipolar spindles were formed. When karyogamy was blocked with colchicine, {{it became clear that the}} egg nucleus proceeded independently into mitosis accompanying chromosome condensation. A monoastral spindle could be frequently observed, and in rare cases a barrel-shaped spindle was formed. However, when a sperm nucleus was located near an egg nucleus, the two anti-centrin <b>staining</b> <b>spots</b> shifted to the egg nucleus from the sperm nucleus. In this case, a normal spindle was formed, the egg chromosomes arranged at the equator, and the associated MTs elongated from one pole of the egg spindle toward the sperm chromosomes which were scattered. From these results, it became clear that paternal centrioles derived from the sperm have a crucial role in spindle formation in the brown algae, such as they do during animal fertilization. However, paternal centrioles were not adequate for the functional centrosome during spindle formation. We speculated that centrosomal materials from the egg cytoplasm aggregate around the sperm centrioles and are needed for centrosomal activation...|$|R

40|$|Superficial {{discolored}} {{spots on}} Atlantic salmon fillets {{is a serious}} problem for the farming industry. Fillets with large dark <b>stained</b> <b>spots</b> are downgraded by the processing industry while smaller spots are removed, requiring extra labour. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of diet on appearance, location and size of dark <b>stained</b> <b>spots.</b> The fish used were Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fed a standard commercial feed (Control) or the same feed added antioxidants (vitamin C, E and selenium) (Antioxidant). The experiment was carried out from 7 th January to 13 th March 2015. The results showed that the supplementation of antioxidants had no significantly effect on growth (average body weight 4 kg) or other biometric traits, but improved the fillet quality. Significantly lower occurrence of spots (31 % vs. 45 %), lower number of dark stained muscle segments (1. 4 vs. 2. 3), smaller fillet spot size (0. 6 vs. 2. 2 score) and lower fillet gaping score (0. 8 vs. 1. 0) were found of the Antioxidant group as compared to the Control group. Results showed that the melanin (40 %) and a combination of melanin and scar (25 %) were dominating the visual appearance of spots. Colorimetric analysis of the dark <b>stained</b> <b>spots</b> of the Antioxidant group revealed paler (higher L* value), less redness (lower a* value) and less yellowness (lower b* value) as compared to the Control group. Colorimetric characteristics of the dark spots were stable during one week of ice storage. Image analysis showed significantly higher lightness (higher L* value), less yellowness, larger area and wider width of myocommata of the Antioxidant group compared with the Control group. It is concluded that dietary supplementation of antioxidants reduced fillet gaping, occurrence of dark spots, spots size and number of dark stained muscle segments significantly...|$|R

40|$|PublicaciÃ³n ISIPurpose: To {{develop a}} method to {{quantify}} tear protein concentration with the sensitivity to measure this variable in the restricted volumes of single human tear samples. Methods: Aliquots of tear fluid from healthy subjects and a solution of standard bovine serum albumin (BSA) were spotted on cellulose membranes. Membranes were fixed, stained for protein with Coomassie blue, and washed until they displayed clear backgrounds. <b>Stained</b> <b>spots</b> were excised and eluted in a defined volume of methanol-ammonia, and the absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 6 10 nm. Membranes were calibrated by calculating their apparent thickness from the areas of <b>stained</b> <b>spots</b> and the corresponding aliquot volumes of either tear fluid or BSA solution. Results: In our dye-binding assay, absorbance (0 - 1. 00 OD) {{was found to have}} a linear relation with tear fluid volume (1 - 7 mu L). In a study involving samples from 33 healthy subjects, aliquots (3 mu L) of tear fluid were found to yield absorbances in the linear range. Protein concentrations in tear fluid were found to be distributed over the range of 2. 20 - 6. 37 mg/mL (mean, 4. 11 +/- 1. 00 mg/mL) with no apparent sex differences. The assay can be applied successfully to quantify protein concentrations in tear fluid by using calibrated Schirmer strips after a tear test. Electrophoretic profiles of proteins present in tear fluid sampled from different healthy individuals were nearly identical when normalized for protein load by using this method. Conclusions: The protein dye-binding assay we developed by using cellulose membranes or Schirmer strips is an efficient and convenient method for measuring tear protein concentration...|$|R

Accordingly, a new mobile phase consisting of ACN/H 2 O/MeOH (15 / 3 / 2) (mobile phase B) was used that resulted in more focused spots and showed a short time of development of less than 10 Â min. The retention factor (Rf) was about 0.35 using this mobile phase. Additionally, warming the iodine chamber to 30 â 40 Â Â°C achieved uniform staining [17].|$|R
30|$|A {{remarkable}} {{result is}} that the coinciding spots in arrays (a) and (c) seem to exhibit no <b>stained</b> neighboring <b>spots.</b> This might indicate that the length of the binding epitope is exactly 15 amino acids. The epitope LIIFGPGPVLNKNEV is unique in the array and in the mapped protein. However, an intrinsic side-effect of protein mapping with surface-bound peptides can be steric hinderance by the surface coating which could have inhibited the binding of antibodies to adjacent peptides with partially identical sequence motifs. Further experiments with longer peptides (e.g. 17 meric) might help to explore this phenomenon. Interestingly, in array (b), a shorter epitope seems to be recognized, which is indicated by <b>stained</b> neighboring <b>spots.</b> This might imply that the corresponding antibodies in serum (b) are directed against a shorter, approximately 10 meric, binding epitope (approximately 5 neighboring double spots are stained; see Fig.Â  3 b, yellow box).|$|R
