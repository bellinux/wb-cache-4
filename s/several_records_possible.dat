50|$|In {{computer}} science, a record-oriented filesystem is a {{file system}} where data is stored as collections of records. This {{is in contrast}} to a byte-oriented filesystem, where the data is treated as an unformatted stream of bytes. There are <b>several</b> different <b>possible</b> <b>record</b> formats; the details vary depending on the particular system. In general the formats can be fixed-length or variable length, with different physical organizations or padding mechanisms; metadata may be associated with the file records to define the record length, or the data may be part of the record. Different methods to access records may be provided, for example sequential, by key or by record number.|$|R
