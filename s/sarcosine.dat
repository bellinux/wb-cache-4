5000|$|<b>Sarcosine</b> {{dehydrogenase}} {{is one of}} the enzymes in <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism, which catalyzes the demethylation of <b>sarcosine</b> to make glycine. It is {{preceded by}} dimethylglycine dehydrogenase which turns dimethylglycine into <b>sarcosine.</b> Glycine can also be turned into <b>sarcosine</b> by glycine N-methyltransferase. Since glycine is the production of <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction, aside from <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism, the enzyme is also indirectly connected to the creatine cycle and the respiratory chain in the mitochondria [...] (See figure 4 for pathway). Even so, the biological significance of <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase beyond <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism is not entirely known. In a study of hereditary hemochromatosis using both wild type and HFE (gene) deficient mice fed with 2 percent carbonyl iron supplemented diet, <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase was shown to be down-regulated in HFE deficient mice, but role <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase in iron metabolism is unknown from the experiment conducted.|$|E
5000|$|In enzymology, <b>sarcosine</b> {{dehydrogenase}} (...) is a mitochondrial {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the chemical reaction N-demethylation of <b>sarcosine</b> to give glycine. [...] This enzyme {{belongs to the}} family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sarcosine:acceptor oxidoreductase (demethylating). Other names in common use include <b>sarcosine</b> N-demethylase, monomethylglycine dehydrogenase, and sarcosine:(acceptor) oxidoreductase (demethylating). <b>Sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase is closely related to dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the demethylation reaction of dimethylglycine to <b>sarcosine.</b> Both <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase use FAD as a cofactor. <b>Sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase is linked by electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) to the respiratory redox chain. [...] The general chemical reaction catalyzed by <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase is: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sarcosine,</b> {{also known}} as N-methylglycine, is an {{intermediate}} and byproduct in glycine synthesis and degradation. <b>Sarcosine</b> is metabolized to glycine by the enzyme <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase, while glycine-N-methyl transferase generates <b>sarcosine</b> from glycine. <b>Sarcosine</b> is an amino acid derivative that is naturally found in muscles and other body tissues. In the laboratory, it may be synthesized from chloroacetic acid and methylamine. <b>Sarcosine</b> is found naturally as an intermediate in the metabolism of choline to glycine. <b>Sarcosine</b> is sweet to the taste and dissolves in water. It is used in manufacturing biodegradable surfactants and toothpastes {{as well as in}} other applications.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sarcosine</b> oxidase is {{an enzyme}} (...) that catalyzes the {{oxidative}} demethylation of <b>sarcosine</b> to yield glycine, H2O2, 5,10-CH2-tetrahydrofolate in a reaction requiring H4-tetrahydrofolate and oxygen. Corynebacterial <b>sarcosine</b> oxidase is a heterotetramer and is produced as an inducible enzyme when Corynebacterium sp.is grown with <b>sarcosine</b> as source of carbon and energy.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to sarcosinaemia, <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase {{also seems to}} play a role in the progression process of prostate cancer. The concentration of <b>sarcosine,</b> along with those of uracil, kynurenine, glycerol 3-phosphate, leucine and proline increases as prostate cancer progresses. Thus, <b>sarcosine</b> can be used as a potential biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer and for measuring the progress of the disease. As Sreekumar, A. et al.’s paper shows, the removal of <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase from benign prostate epithelial cells increases the concentration of <b>sarcosine</b> and increase cancer cell invasions while the removal of either dimethylglycine dehydrogenase or glycine N-methyltransferase in prostate cancer cells decreases cell invasions. This demonstrates that <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism plays a key-role in prostate cancer cell invasion and migration. Sreekumar’s study suggests that <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase and other enzymes in the <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism pathways could be potential therapeutic targets for prostate cancer. However, a study done by Jentzmik F. et al. by analyzing <b>sarcosine</b> level in 92 patients with prostate cancer draws a different conclusion: <b>sarcosine</b> cannot be used as an indicator and biomarker for prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sarcosine</b> has {{no known}} toxicity, as {{evidenced}} by the lack of phenotypic manifestations of sarcosinemia, an inborn error of <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism. Sarcosinemia can result from severe folate deficiency because of the folate requirement for the conversion of <b>sarcosine</b> to glycine.|$|E
50|$|The {{demethylation}} of <b>sarcosine</b> catalyzed by <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase {{can proceed}} {{with or without}} the presence of tetrahydrofolate. Under anaerobic condition and without tetrahydrofolate, however, a free formaldehyde is formed after the N-demethylation of <b>sarcosine.</b> The reaction with 1 mole of <b>sarcosine</b> and 1 mole of FAD, under this condition, yields 1 mole of glycine and 1 mole of formaldehyde (See figure 2 for mechanism).|$|E
50|$|Sarcosinemia is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease {{caused by a}} mutation of the <b>sarcosine</b> dehydrogenase gene in the 9q33-q34 gene locus. This leads to a compromised <b>sarcosine</b> metabolism and causes the build-up of <b>sarcosine</b> in blood and urine, a condition known as sarcosinemia.|$|E

50|$|In a paper {{published}} in the journal Nature in 2009, <b>sarcosine</b> was reported to activate prostate cancer cells and to indicate the malignancy of prostate cancer cells when measured in urine. <b>Sarcosine</b> was identified as a differential metabolite that was greatly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and could be detected in urine. <b>Sarcosine</b> levels seemed to control the invasiveness of the cancer.|$|E
50|$|Sarcosinemia (SAR), {{also called}} hypersarcosinemia and SARDH deficiency, {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder characterized by an increased concentration of <b>sarcosine</b> in blood plasma and urine ("sarcosinuria").

It {{is thought to be}} a relatively benign condition.|$|E
5000|$|However, this {{conclusion}} has been disputed. A German research team reported a different result in 2010. [...] After measuring <b>sarcosine</b> levels in urine samples from prostate cancer patients, {{they concluded that}} measuring <b>sarcosine</b> in urine fails as a marker in prostate cancer detection and identification of aggressive tumors. In addition, another report concluded that serum <b>sarcosine</b> is not a marker for prostate cancer. A {{review of the literature}} reached a similar conclusion.|$|E

50|$|Recently, <b>sarcosine</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{in relation to the}} mental illness schizophrenia. Early evidence suggests that intake of 2 g/day <b>sarcosine</b> as add-on therapy to certain antipsychotics (not clozapine) in schizophrenia gives significant additional reductions in both positive and negative symptomatology as well as the neurocognitive and general psychopathological symptoms that are common to the illness. <b>Sarcosine</b> had been tolerated well. It is also under investigation for the possible prevention of schizophrenic illness during the prodromal stage of the disease. It acts as a type 1 glycine transporter inhibitor and a glycine agonist. It increases glycine concentrations in the brain thus causing increased NMDA receptor activation and a reduction in symptoms. As such, it might be an interesting treatment option and a possible new direction in the treatment of the mental illness in the future. A 2011 meta-analysis found adjunctive <b>sarcosine</b> to have a medium effect size for negative and total symptoms.|$|E

50|$|A {{clinical}} study showed <b>Sarcosine</b> {{to be significantly}} more effective in treating Major Depression (substantially improved scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Global Assessment of Function) than Citalopram over a 6-week period.

5000|$|... {{the first}} step of the {{reaction}} might involve the transfer of a hydride on the N-methyl group of <b>sarcosine</b> onto FAD, allowing H2O to attack the carbocation in order to form intermediate 1 (See figure 1). There is no deamination step. Instead, the demethylation of the N-methyl group on <b>sarcosine</b> occurs directly. The reduced FADH− from {{the first step}} then is oxidized by O2 to form H2O2.|$|E
