5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and <b>some</b> <b>may</b> not survive.|$|E

5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. <b>Some</b> <b>may</b> have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{stars are}} {{inducted}} in an annual group ceremony; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts {{more than two}} major stars at a time. Celebrities can {{have more than one}} star on the Hollywood Walk, the same celebrity can receive as many as five stars under the various categories. This does not happen with Canada's Walk of Fame, although <b>some</b> <b>may</b> have an individual star but are also included {{as part of a larger}} group, such as John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.|$|E
5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though <b>some</b> <b>may</b> be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills {{can be made from}} 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E

5|$|In some species, {{offspring}} {{may become}} independent {{around the next}} spring, through <b>some</b> <b>may</b> stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures {{also help to}} minimize environmental risks. <b>Some</b> <b>may</b> still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the {{need to address the}} threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E
5|$|No {{treatments}} stop {{or reverse}} its progression, though <b>some</b> <b>may</b> temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing {{a burden on}} the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to {{activities of daily living}} and can potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.|$|E

5|$|On 11 July 2012, {{the show}} {{producer}} Christer Björkman advised the public {{not to buy}} tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels. Björkman said that official tickets {{had not yet been}} released, as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made. Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|Other archeological {{findings}} on Andean mountains {{were made on}} Acamarachi and Pular (where ceremonial platforms were found), Cerro Colorado, Juriques, Llullaillaco, Miniques and Quimal. Sites had pirca structures and firewood, and <b>some</b> <b>may</b> {{have been part of}} a signaling system. Many were in use during the Inca civilization, and on Quimal artifacts and reports of use during the Spanish Empire have been found. Aconcagua, Coropuna, Chachani, El Plomo, El Toro, Llullaillaco, Mercedario amd Picchu Picchu are other mountains with Inca sanctuaries.|$|E
5|$|Prayer {{features}} {{prominently in}} services. Services may feature moments where special prayer is offered, often with laypersons leading the prayer {{and the rest}} of the congregation audibly participating. During these corporate prayers, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> pray in tongues. While not in every service, the pastor will pray for the sick. This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may prey on {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is most obvious in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while none have been mapped elsewhere on the forest, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> still exist in the Boulder, Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature plants {{and the depth of}} the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides. In that context, <b>some</b> <b>may</b> be referred to by the hybrid name P. ×hybrida.|$|E

5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). <b>Some</b> <b>may</b> never {{have heard of}} it. Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, emerged from his hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other Japanese soldiers, who had joined Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E

Some commercial bean dips are prepared with additional ingredients to add flavor, such as jalapeño. <b>Some</b> <b>may</b> {{have a high}} fat content, due {{to the presence of}} high-fat ingredients such as lard. Prepared refrigerated styles of bean dip are also mass-produced by some companies, which are stocked in the refrigerated section of grocery stores.|$|E
5|$|The Chincoteague Indians {{gradually}} withdrew northwards in {{the late}} 17th century as European colonization grew; most settled on a reservation at present-day Snow Hill, Maryland, with allied tribes of Native Americans, though <b>some</b> <b>may</b> have remained in their traditional area.
