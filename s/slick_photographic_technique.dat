40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} and compare a stereo-biomicroscopic technique of ocular torsion measurement with fundus <b>photographic</b> <b>technique.</b> METHODS: This prospective masked observational study included 72 eyes of 36 consecutive subjects with normal ocular motility. The disc-foveal angle {{was measured by}} two masked investigators using a slitlamp stereo-biomicroscopic and fundus <b>photographic</b> <b>technique.</b> RESULTS: The mean age was 13. 7 years (6 - 44 years), and 15 (41. 6 &#x 0025;) were males. The average torsion using the slitlamp technique was 5. 5 3. 3 o and 6. 1 4. 3 o with fundus <b>photographic</b> <b>technique.</b> Clinical agreement between the two techniques for 5 o and 6 o torsion was 81 &#x 0025; and 90 &#x 0025; respectively. The average {{difference between the two}} techniques was 3. 0 2. 6 o. The mean inter-ocular difference was 3. 3 2. 7 o (SD, 2. 77) and 5. 5 4. 6 o using the slitlamp and fundus <b>photographic</b> <b>technique</b> respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r 2) was 0. 5 CONCLUSION: The fundus <b>photographic</b> <b>technique</b> remains the gold standard test for the measurement of ocular torsion. The slitlamp biomicroscopic method can be useful where a fundus camera is unavailable. Further studies are required to test the repeatability of these tests...|$|R
