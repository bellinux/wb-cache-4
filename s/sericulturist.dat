50|$|Felix Gillet (born March 25, 1835, Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, France; died January 27, 1908, Nevada City, California, United States) was a California pioneer nurseryman, horticulturist, <b>sericulturist,</b> {{and writer}} who made several {{important}} introductions of superior European deciduous fruit and nut trees to California and the northwestern United States. Beginning in 1869, in his Barren Hill Nursery in Nevada City, Gillet cultivated his own imported scion wood and home-grown nursery stock, experimented with grafting and hybridizing, and continually wrote articles on horticulture and his plant selections, while remaining active in Nevada City civic affairs. Publishing his own nursery catalog for 37 years and advertising widely, {{he sold his}} walnuts, filberts (hazelnuts), chestnuts, prunes, figs, strawberries, grapes, peaches, cherries, citrus {{and dozens of other}} fruit and nut varieties throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. The commercial walnut variety “Felix Gillet” was named in his honor.|$|E
40|$|The Jialing River Basin sericultural area is {{an ancient}} {{mulberry}} growing and silkworm rearing area in China. In the period of Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty, a lot of famous silk products were produced in this sericultural area. Until now, cocoon and silk are still {{the major source of}} revenue for local people, with <b>sericulturists</b> being the major group of people who grow mulberry and rear silkworms. This paper has adopted the method of field research and questionnaire survey to in-vestigate the modern <b>sericulturists</b> in terms of ages, education level, acquisition of silkworm rearing skills, and the support of national policies etc., aiming to explore the reason why sericul-ture, as part of Chinese culture, can continue...|$|R

The eye catching art of crafting silk waste {{is one of the}} interesting utility of silk, which develop human skills besides generating self-employment and additional revenue. The waste cocoons can be used in making art crafts like garlands, carpets, overcoats, decoratives and greeting cards. The in-depth research towards utility optimization and make aware this reality to <b>sericulturists,</b> reelers, weavers, traders, entrepreneurs, policy makers etc., is the upright want of the today’s Sericulture industry.

Identification of DNA markers associated with different economically important biomass traits and its introgression could assist molecular breeding and expression of stabilized high yielding characters, but genetic basis of most quantitative traits in silkworm is poorly understood due to its polygenic control.

50|$|Uzi flies are {{a friend}} to agriculturists and a foe to <b>sericulturists.</b> The life span of adult males is about 5-15 days, adult females is about 20-25 days and {{alternate}} hosts can live 55 days. Its flight range is about 4 km. It gets attracts to rearing room due to kairomone and it can locate host in 30 seconds. Its egg period is 2-3 days. Its larval period is 8 days and pupal period is about 10-14 days. It attacks all the internal organs of silkworm exept silkgland. Uzi flies lay their eggs on the silkworm caterpillar by piercing its skin.|$|R
40|$|Between the American Revolution and the 1840 s, silk {{cultivation}} was pursued enthusiastically {{across the}} United States. Although scorned at first, silk's republican virtues were rediscovered and rearticulated in the antebellum era by {{a range of}} proponents. Owing to an evolving infrastructure that integrated the press, the post, and agricultural societies, the appeal of silk drew in farmers and manufacturers of all classes and across many regions. Their disparate circumstances and motivations made a peculiar interest group, but one that secured considerable political and promotional support. More than just an exercise on paper, American silk was widely produced, thanks especially to the labor of women. Eventually, the far-flung community of <b>sericulturists</b> fell prey to environmental and labor-related limitations. But the speed of their downfall, linked to a speculative bubble in mulberry trees, was also due to the distinctive features of their agricultural reformism and its creative relationship with credibility...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{introduce}} bivoltine races in a tropical country like India, {{it is necessary}} to have stability in cocoon crop under high temperature environment. Considering the poor performance of productive bivoltine hybrids during summer season, emphasis was given to evolve bivoltine silkworm breeds suitable to tropical conditions for achieving the primary objective of establishing bivoltine sericulture with quality raw silk among <b>sericulturists.</b> One of the main aims of the breeders is to recommend silkworm breeds/hybrids to farmers that are stable under different environmental conditions and minimize the risk of falling below a certain yield level. Silkworm breeds that are reared over a series of environments exhibiting less variation are considered stable. Therefore, it becomes imperative or essential to develop bivoltine breeds/hybrids which can withstand high-temperature stress conditions. Keeping these in view, an attempt is made to develop bivoltine double hybrid tolerant to high temperature and low humidity conditions of the tropics...|$|R
40|$|A {{mulberry}} {{harvesting machine}} and harvesting & pruning machine {{have been designed}} newly to suit for sericulture use which save cost and labour. The machines were tested in local field and suit better. Sericulture or silk culture is a labour intensive rural industry. At present it faces a shortage of labour force. Harvesting and pruning of mulberry plants are the most critical activities involved in sericulture. In the survey, 80 % <b>sericulturists</b> felt that the harvesting and pruning are most tedious and stressful activities. The main reasons are high work stress, less rest and health problems associated with it. Hence, labourers show less interest towards sericulture. Hence, mechanized way of harvesting and pruning may be an alternative approach to minimize the problem. The Japanese scientists developed a harvesting and pruning equipment attached to tiller. This machine has certain limitation to Indian cultivation. Hence, a design methodology has been framed to develop mechanized mulberry plant harvesting and pruning system to suite Indian mulberry plantation {{and at the same}} time cost effective...|$|R
40|$|The Kashmir valley {{represents}} temperate {{climatic conditions}} {{and is known}} for its bivoltine sericulture. The sericulture in the region however, sustains on tree type of plants. Majority of <b>sericulturists</b> in this traditional area have taken up mulberry cultivation on small land holdings as a life sustaining occupation. Other farmers with more land have taken up it as subsidiary occupation. Mulberry is facing stiff competition from other economic crops. In order to make the mulberry cultivation more profitable and sustainable, intercrops can be practiced with them. Medicinal plants like Lavendula officinalis, Atropa belladonna and Echinacea purpurea are important source of alkaloids and essential oils, which have huge demand in pharmaceutical industry. The wider spacing available in the tree type of plantation of mulberry facilitates the cultivation of these medicinal plants as an intercrop. The present paper focuses on utilization of medicinal plants as an intercrop with mulberry to generate an additional income to the progressive farmers as the biochemical studies shows that there is no significant impact on mulberry leaf quality and soil health...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} observe the {{preceding}} conditions {{for the formation of}} national education thoughts and movements in last 30 years of the 18 th century in Prussia, I intend to analyse the spreading process of people education on the mature stage of absolutism (1763 - 1790). Before the end of 7 years war (1763), the feudal relations between the feudal land owner, the so called "Gutsherr" and peasantry, which are, at the same time, the feudal productive relations, the feudal governing system and the feudal community, are very tightly, so that these tight feudal relation prevents to rise the capitalism and to spread the people education in this times. However, after the end of 7 years war, these tight feudal relations began to relax keeping pace with the rising of agricaltural productivity. Just this times, Frederick the Great began to drive forward the policies of people education from the view-point of the breeding of the noncommissioned officer class and <b>sericulturists,</b> which are pointed out as his motivations for people education policies by many educatioral historian already, then, if he wishes to reach this goals of people education effectivly and efficiently, I think, his educationl interests will be directed to cildren of, no peasantry, but the middle class farmers and rural handworkers rising from the relaxation of these feudal relations, because they have more probability to become the noncommissioned officers and <b>sericulturists</b> in future. When I analyse his people education policies, for example, "Das General-Land-Schule-Reglement" (1763) and "Das kooig. preuss. General-Landschule-Reglemement fur die Rom. Kath. in Stadt. und Dorf. des Herz. Schlesien und Graf. Glatz". (1765) I find this tendency in these regulations on many sides easily. But the people education by these regulations does not spread easily all over the kingdom, because the peasantry resists these regulations. However, once we observe all over the kingdom in detail and more carefully, we find that the educational demands by the middle class farmers and rural handworkers are rising strongly over the frame of these regulations in 1770 - 1780 and their demands begin to change contents of people education and turn them into their interests, national eduction. So Frederick the Great and his minister Zedlitz warn this tendency as a crisis of their absolutism in the end of 1770. We have the formation of national education thoughts and movements in 1770 - 1800 in this country, this formation has preceding conditions in the background as I pointed out above...|$|R
40|$|Aeolesthes holosericea_, a {{polyphagous}} stem borer {{has been reported}} to damage up to 40 % of tropical tasar silkworm host-plants wherever infestation is high. Known control measures are not very effective as information on its life cycle and susceptible stages against insecticides and bio-agents are insufficient. Laboratory culture of the insect is inevitable for developing control measures as the insect passes most of its life within stem tissues. Culture method of other borer species was not applied to it due to sophistication of process. A convenient laboratory culture method has been developed for the insect. The culture includes complete larval rearing; preservation of pupa; rearing and mating of adults followed by oviposition, incubation and hatching. Other available culture methods are incomplete and hence of little applied value. The present method is simple, economic and easy to be adopted in absence of a sophisticated laboratory having provision for stepwise observation to suit testing of control measures. This method can be utilized by Agriculture and Forest Entomologists and <b>Sericulturists</b> for testing and developing its control measures to save precious forests and to increase production of tasar silk. Anybody can be trained easily. |$|R
40|$|Sericulture is {{labour-intensive}} and well-suited {{to small}} and marginal farms with surplus labour, especially female labour. Ample labour {{and a small}} land-base encourage farmers to practise sericulture as a subsidiary occupation. While income from crop production is seasonal, sericulture provides a year-round income, which is an important incentive for small farmers to take up sericulture. The agricultural production is seasonal, while consumption is evenly spread over the years. Under such circumstances, the planners and policymakers are confronted {{with the challenge of}} formulating a suitable agricultural production policy with which the desired growth of agricultural production can be achieved. In the present study, optimum cropping patterns for different categories of <b>sericulturists</b> have been suggested by selecting Siddlaghatta in Kolar and Kollegal talukas in Mysore as study areas. The primary data have been collected using the personal interview method. The deterministic linear programming technique has been employed to work out the maximum attainable returns by small, medium and large farmers through the optimum allocation of various crops, sericulture and livestock (dairy), using the available resources. The model has suggested fewer crops in the cropping pattern of both the areas. The model has also suggested shifting of the cropping pattern from subsistence-dominated crops like ragi to commercial crops like bivoltine sericulture in the Kolar area and crossbreed sericulture in the Musore area. The suggested cropping patterns have increased the gross income in the range of 83. 55 to 388. 68 per cent in the Kolar area and 2. 71 to 10. 70 per cent in the Kollegal area.

40|$|Sympathetic {{critics of}} world-system {{analysis}} contend that its systemic {{level of abstraction}} results in one-sided generalizations of systemic change. Unequal exchange theory and commodity chain analysis similarly reduce distinct and historical forms of labor and their interrelationships to common functional and ahistorical essences. This paper applies an incorporated comparisons method to give historical content {{to an understanding of}} unequal exchange and global inequality through a study of the JapanUS silk networks formation and change during the mid 18801890 s. Analysis of unequal exchange processes requires, in this case, an examination of the mutual integration and transformation of distinct labor and value forms peasant sericulture, ?lature wage-labor, and industrial silk factory wage-laborand the infundibular market forces they structured. These relations were decisively conditioned by new landlordism and debt-peonage, class-patriarchy, state mediations, migration, and by peasant and worker struggles against deteriorating conditions. Indeed, the transitional nature of the silk networks formation, which concluded the Tokugawa system and decisively contributed to Japans emergence as a nation-state of the capitalist world-economy, was signi?ed by the very last millenarian and quasi-modern peasant uprising in 1884 among indebted <b>sericulturists,</b> the very ?rst recorded factory strikes in 188586, by women raw silk reelers in K?fu, and by strikes among unionizing workers in patriarchal and mechanized silk factories in Paterson, New Jersey, 188586 (Boles 1996, 1998). The local conditions of each con?ict were molded by the interdependence of those conditions that constituted a formative part of the world-system and its development. In the face of struggles and intensifying world-market competition, Japanese and US manufacturers took opposite spatial strategies of regional expansion to overcome the structural constraints of existing labor forms and relations. Analysis of the silk network permits the interconnections among seemingly disparate events and forms of collective protest within historical networks to be understood, revealing the world-historical dimensions of local developments and, conversely, the local faces of global inequality...|$|R

Identification of DNA markers associated with different economically important biomass traits and its introgression could assist molecular breeding and expression of stabilized high yielding characters, but genetic basis of most quantitative traits in silkworm is poorly understood due to its polygenic control. Correlation analysis (R = 0. 9) revealed significant interrelation among biomass traits viz., larval duration (TLD), larval weight (LWT), cocoon weight (CWT), shell weight (SWT), shell ratio (SR) and floss content. PCR using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers revealed 92 % polymorphism among 14 tropical and temperate strains of B. mori, with average diversity index of 0. 747. Stepwise multiple regression analysis (MRA) selected 35 ISSR markers positively or negatively correlated with different biomass traits, illustrated polygenic control. ISSR marker 830. 81050 bp was significantly associated with LWT, CWT, SWT, SR and fl oss content, indicated its pleiotropic role. Two ISSR markers, 835. 51950 bp and 825. 9710 bp showed significant association with floss content and TLD. These markers were segregated in F 2 generation and Chi-square test confirmed (χ 2 = ~ 45; P < 0. 05) its genetic contribution to the associated biomass traits. Strains, with both positively and negatively correlated markers, had intermediate mean value for biomass traits (eg. SWT = 0. 17 ± 0. 014 g in GNM and Moria) indicated interaction of loci in natural populations. Low yielding Indian strains grouped together by Hierarchical clustering. Chinese and Japanese strains were distributed in the periphery of ALSCAL matrix indicated convergence of genetic characters in Indian strains. Average genetic distance between Chinese strains and Indian strains (0. 193) signifi cantly (P < 0. 01) varied from that between Chinese and Japanese strains. Interaction of loci and allelic substitutions induced phenotypic plasticity in temperate B. mori populations on tropic adaptation in India. These outcomes show possibility to combine favorable alleles at different QTL to increase larval, cocoon and shell weight...|$|R
