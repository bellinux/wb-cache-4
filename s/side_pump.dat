40|$|We {{present an}} all-fiber <b>side</b> <b>pump</b> {{combiner}} for high power fiber lasers and amplifiers. It {{consists of a}} capillary with decreasing wall thickness fused around the active fiber {{in a way that}} it becomes an additional cladding layer of it. The pump fibers are spliced at the edge of the capillary with the thickest wall. This provides enough room to allocate around 12 pump fibers (100 µm diameter) in a standard 400 µm double-clad fiber. This <b>side</b> <b>pump</b> combiner offers several advantages such as the fact that it does not interrupt the active fiber core at any point, thus allowing for truly monolithic all fiber lasers and amplifiers. Additionally, the pump light is coupled into the active double-clad fiber all along the combiner's body (~ 1 - 2 cm long), which avoids the concentration of heat in a very small area, resulting in high pump power handling capabilities. If the taper angle of the capillary wall is low enough a high coupling efficiency (< 95 %) is possible. Using this structure we have achieved a maximum combined pump power of 86 Watt from 7 pump diodes. This, we believe, is the highest combined pump power reported so far from a single lumped <b>side</b> <b>pump</b> combiner...|$|E

50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{of heart failure}} are largely determined by {{which side of the}} heart fails. The left <b>side</b> <b>pumps</b> blood into the systemic circulation, whilst the right <b>side</b> <b>pumps</b> blood into the pulmonary circulation. Whilst left-sided heart failure will reduce cardiac output to the systemic circulation, the initial {{symptoms of}}ten manifest due to effects on the pulmonary circulation. In systolic dysfunction, the ejection fraction is decreased, leaving an abnormally elevated volume of blood in the left ventricle. In diastolic dysfunction, the end-diastolic ventricular pressure will be high. This increase in volume or pressure backs up to the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins. Increased volume or pressure in the pulmonary veins impairs the normal drainage of the alveoli and favors the flow of fluid from the capillaries to the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema. This impairs gas exchange. Thus, left-sided heart failure often presents with respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.|$|R

The main fractionator/vapor recovery systems associated with many FCC units have the potential for significant gains in energy efficiency and product recovery through revamping.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{difference}} in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and CABG supported with the intracardiac microaxial pump (ICP, Impella, Aachen, Germany). METHODS: A prospective randomized {{study was conducted in}} seven centers. The study population consists of 199 patients undergoing isolated primary CABG (CPB group 94 patients, ICP group 105 patients). Both groups are equal in demographic variables, number of bypasses performed, and Euroscore predicted mortality. We analyzed clinical outcome, myocardial enzymes and blood parameters of hemolysis, organ function and inflammatory response. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (16 %), randomized in the ICP group, were switched to the CPB group. This was due to the inability to position the right side catheter adequately (n= 8), to a pump failure (n= 1) or to the perioperative decision that beating heart surgery is technically not possible (n= 8). There {{was no significant difference between}} the two study arms regarding the pump assistance time (CPB 67. 1 +/- 22. 9 min; ICP 67. 7 +/- 30. 3 min; P= 0. 88861), the number of grafts (CPB 2. 4 +/- 0. 7; ICP 2. 3 +/- 0. 8) and the number of grafts to the back wall (CFX; both groups n= 37). There is no significant difference in clinical outcome, evolution of myocardial enzymes, indices of organ function and hemolysis. There is a reduced inflammatory response in the ICP group as indicated in the postoperative release of granulocyte elastase (CPB 259 +/- 195; ICP 150 +/- 126 microg/l; P< 0. 00001) and complement C 3 (CPB 0. 73 +/- 0. 2; ICP 0. 65 +/- 0. 2 g/l; P= 0. 008).

40|$|At the moment, the {{worldwide}} demand for air conditioning is rapidly growing, {{and it is}} expected to exceed the demand for space heating by the 2060 s. However, traditional refrigerants such as CFCs and HCFCs are regulated or phased out by the Montreal and Kyoto protocol. Secondary loop refrigerant systems use less of these harmful refrigerants since they make use of a distribution fluid (for example water) as transport medium between the chiller and the coolers. The efficiency of these systems can be improved by using a phase change material as a secondary refrigerant. Tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) is a promising phase change material for air conditioning applications. The phase change can take places at a temperature up to 12. 5 ºC, which allows for an increase in the evaporation temperature. Furthermore, due to its phase change, the TBAB slurry has an up to 4 times larger cooling capacity than chilled water. This can be utilized {{in order to reduce the}} flow rates in the system. At his moment, the TU Delft has in collaboration with Hollander Techniek installed a small pilot air conditioning system in the sports hall 'De Jachtlust' located in Twello, the Netherlands. The system has a capacity of approximately 3. 5 kW. It has a single 300 L storage tank of and it is equipped with sensors to monitor the performance of the system. In this study, an existing model of a secondary air conditioning system is improved and extended taking into account the design parameters of the installation in Twello. This model is validated using the experimental data from the actual system. The simulations predict that using a 36. 5 wt% TBAB solution increases the COP of the system from 2. 96 to 4. 00, while the energy consumption reduces by 24. 8 %. This reduction is mainly due to a 30. 5 % decrease in the power consumption of the compressor. At the same time, the generation <b>side</b> <b>pump</b> consumes 204 % more electricity due to adhesion of the produced crystals to the heat transfer surface. The performance of the TBAB can still be improved by lowering the initial TBAB fraction to 35. 0 wt% or by further optimizing the control strategy for the crystal production. <br/...|$|E
