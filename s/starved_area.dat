40|$|In this work, {{the dynamic}} {{behavior}} of Fuel Cell operation under Dead-Ended Anode conditions is shown. A DEA can be fed with dry hydrogen, since water crossing through the membrane {{is sufficient to}} humidify the fuel. The reduced requirements for inlet humidification yield a system with lower cost and weight compared to FCs with flow-through or recirculated anodes. The accumulation of water and nitrogen in the anode channel is first observed near the outlet. A stratified pattern develops in the channel where a hydrogen-rich area sits above a depleted region and is stabilized by the effect of gravity. A model is presented which describes the dynamic evolution of a blanketing N 2 front in the anode channel and a hydrogen starved region. Understanding, modeling, and predicting the front evolution can reduce the H 2 wasted during purges, avoid over drying the membrane, and mitigate degradation associated with hydrogen <b>starved</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

5000|$|By June 1642, the {{starving}} peasants {{have started to}} either run away or sell their lots en masse, alerting Shogunate {{on the scale of}} the famine. The Shogunate reaction was the ordering the re-planting of tobacco plantations with food crops, restricting alcohol production (no new breweries, suspension of production of rural breweries, and halving production of urban and highway breweries), and prohibition of land lots sale. Also, manufacture and sale of non-essential food products - the millet udon, wheat flour, sōmen, manjū, [...] and soba was prohibited. The improvement of rice distribution system and recalling rice-retaining daimyo to Edo were also practiced, along with the emergency food distribution sheds. Despite the government and clans best efforts, the number of people dying from hunger steadily increased in 1642-1643 winter.

50|$|Weather alone {{cannot be}} blamed {{as there was}} enough grain in Russia to feed the <b>starving</b> <b>areas.</b> The peasants used medieval {{technology}} like wooden ploughs and sickles. They rarely had modern fertilizers or machinery (the Petrovsky academy in Moscow was Russia's only agricultural school). Russia's primitive railways were not up to redistributing grain. The affected area was a stronghold of communal land distribution so that households had no incentive to improve the land or mechanize, but every incentive to produce as many children as possible (Russia had Europe's highest birth rate).The main blame was laid at the government, which was discredited by the famine. It refused to use that word: , they called it a poor harvest, , and stopped the papers reporting on it. The main reason the blame fell on the government was that grain exports were not banned till mid-August and merchants had a month's warning so they could quickly export their reserves. Minister of Finance Ivan Vyshnegradsky even opposed this late ban. He {{was seen as the}} main cause of the disaster as it was his policy to raise consumer taxes to force peasants to sell more grain. Even Russia's capitalists realized the industrialization drive had been too hard on the peasants.The government also contributed to the famine indirectly by conscripting peasant sons, sending taxmen to seize livestock when grain ran out, and implementing a system of redemption payments as compensation to landlords who had lost their serfs.|$|R

40|$|The {{attractive}} {{properties of}} Glass Fiber Composites {{have made it}} a very popular material for use in several industries including energy, oil 2 ̆ 6 gas, healthcare, transportation and others. As with all materials, composites too have the inherent challenge of defects getting incorporated during manufacture and material getting degraded during service. This demands a reliable and robust nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique {{to be used for}} inspection of this material. The search for newer and more advanced Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques is a constant endeavor in the industrial world. In the realm of electromagnetic NDE, Microwave NDE has been gaining a lot of attention in the last decade as a potential tool for inspection of various materials especially dielectrics like plastics, ceramics, composites, etc. Microwave NDE is non-contact, portable and fast in addition to offering imaging capability. These features make it an attractive option to be explored seriously as an advanced NDE tool. Glass fiber composites encounter a number of different types of defects such as foreign material inclusions, wrinkle / waviness, resin rich and resin <b>starved</b> <b>areas,</b> etc. Microwave NDE has the advantage of being able to penetrate more easily through dielectric materials, thus enabling detection of deeper defects vis-à-vis techniques like ultrasound or Infrared imaging. This paper explores the application of Microwave NDE to the detection and characterization of different type of defects. The effect of probe frequency and stand-off are explored. A comparative assessment of Microwave NDE capability with that of Ultrasound in terms of the depth of penetration, defect size resolution and signal contrast for the various defect types will also be reported...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{hydrogen}} generation in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) is described. Under certain operating conditions hydrogen generation occurs in DMFC causing an additional methanol consumption and a decrease of the cell voltage. For the present experiments a segmented cell with an active area of 244 cm 2 is used. The cell has 196 segments which are regularly distributed on the whole area. By this experimental setup hydrogen generation was found in regions with insufficient air supply. Hydrogen generation was analyzed by systematically applying different air flow rates and detecting the local current densities. The theory for hydrogen generation is confirmed by the results obtained from the segmented cell. A correlation between open circuit voltage (OCV), air flow rate and hydrogen generation was observed. Furthermore, half-cell measurements with different methanol concentrations were performed and used for analyzing the processes during hydrogen generation. The work clearly indicates the importance of sufficient cathode air supply for DMFC. <b>Starved</b> cathode <b>areas</b> not only do {{not contribute to the}} overall current generation but in addition reduce the power and efficiency by the parasitic generation of hydrogen.

40|$|The {{introduction}} and spread of two Asian Carp species, Bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix have caused severe ecological damage throughout North America. Currently, academic institutions, {{and state and}} federal agencies are investigating ways of controlling the spread of these species and managing existing populations to minimize further damage. One promising method of control is the commercial harvest of Asian carps for export to China, as both species are highly valued foodfish throughout Asia. Habitat modification and destruction, along with the questionable quality of fish produced in aquaculture facilities throughout China, have caused members of the foodfish industry to search elsewhere for a high quality product destined for middle and upper class consumers in China. At this time, harvest practices are not standardized, and taking market potential into consideration, it is important to optimize aspects of harvest so commercial fishermen and processors can supply consumers with the highest quality product. Therefore, the present studies evaluated the effects of season (summer and fall), geographic origin (Alton and Peoria Reach), and harvest gear type (trammel nets and hoop nets) on commercially caught fresh fish and those subjected to standard processing practices and simulated shipping conditions to China (blast frozen to core temperatures near - 33 oC and stored at- 20 oC for 6 wk) using quality evaluation methods common in the foodfish industry. Impacts of season, geographical origin, and gear type on fresh Bighead and silver carp were assessed using fillet internal and external pH, color, Torrymeter freshness, and proximate analysis (percent moisture, protein, lipid, and ash). The effects of season, geographical origin, and gear type on fish processed and held under simulated shipping conditions were analyzed using fillet internal and external pH, color, Torrymeter freshness, K value, and peroxide and aldehyde concentrations. Results indicate negligible effects of season of harvest or geographical origin on final quality of Asian carp products, but the optimization of Asian carp products may require only exporting Bighead carp. Hoop nets yielded better quality fish overall, indicating that commercial fishermen should consider using these specifically for the harvest of fish destined for human consumption. Information assembled in this research can be used by commercial fishermen and processors to develop standardized methods for the harvest of Asian carps. Providing a high quality product is vital considering market potential and the resulting economic stimulation provided to fiscally <b>starved</b> <b>areas</b> where these facilities are located. Most importantly, the development of this industry could, in conjunction with continued academic and agency efforts, offer an independent solution to the serious ecological threat posed by these species...|$|R

In addition, we account for permeation of gases through the membrane and for the local water content within the membrane. The {{results show that the}} membrane potential locally drops in <b>areas</b> <b>starved</b> from hydrogen.

40|$|Our early {{twenty-first century}} civilization is being {{squeezed}} between advancing deserts and rising seas. Measured by the land area that can support human habitation, {{the earth is}} shrinking. Mounting population densities, once generated solely {{by the addition of}} over 70 million people per year, are now also fueled by the relentless advance of deserts and the rise in sea level. The newly established trends of expanding deserts and rising seas are both of human origin. The former is primarily the result of overstocking grasslands and overplowing land. Rising seas result from temperature increases set in motion by carbon released from the burning of fossil fuels. The heavy losses of territory to advancing deserts in China and Nigeria, the most populous countries in Asia and Africa respectively, illustrate the trends for scores of other countries. China is not only losing productive land to deserts, but it is doing so at an accelerating rate. From 1950 to 1975 China lost an average of 600 square miles of land (1, 560 square kilometers) to desert each year. By 2000, nearly 1, 400 square miles were going to desert annually. A U. S. Embassy report entitled "Desert Mergers and Acquisitions" describes satellite images that show two deserts in north-central China expanding and merging to form a single, larger desert overlapping Inner Mongolia and Gansu provinces. To the west in Xinjiang Province, two even larger deserts [...] the Taklimakan and Kumtag [...] are also heading for a merger. Further east, the Gobi Desert has marched to within 150 miles (241 kilometers) of Beijing, alarming China's leaders. Chinese scientists report that over the last half-century, some 24, 000 villages in northern and western China were abandoned or partly depopulated as they were overrun by drifting sand. All the countries in central Asia [...] Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan [...] are losing land to desertification. Kazakhstan, site of the vast Soviet Virgin Lands Project, has abandoned nearly half of its cropland since 1980. In Afghanistan, a country with a Canadian-sized population of 31 million, the Registan Desert is migrating westward, encroaching on agricultural areas. A U. N. Environment Programme (UNEP) team reports that "up to 100 villages have been submerged by windblown dust and sand. " In the country's northwest, sand dunes are moving onto agricultural land, their path cleared by the loss of stabilizing vegetation from firewood gathering and overgrazing. The UNEP team observed sand dunes nearly 50 feet (15 meters) high blocking roads, forcing residents to establish new routes. Iran, which has 70 million people and 80 million goats and sheep, the latter the source of wool for its fabled rug-making industry, is also losing its battle with the desert.

40|$|The glucose {{tolerance}} test has been carried on 28 female cattle during five different fasting periods to test the starving behaviour. First test started in spring with 28 heifers (Holstein and Holstein–Friesian breedings). A repetition proceeding have bee carried out in autumn same year on 28 pregnant cattle (Holstein and Holstein-Friesian breedings). Five different fasting periods have been used. Every animal group had to starve for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours per each week. To test the insulin response and the glucose reaction were used the body weight, basal glucose– and insulin concentration, maximal glucose– and insulin concentration, corrected maximal glucose– and insulin concentration, glucose– and insulin area, corrected glucose– and insulin area, end concentration of glucose and insulin and corrected end concentration of glucose– and insulin. Further were used the glucose– and insulin half-life and {{the moment when the}} maximal insulin concentration were reached. The corrected version marks the usual test parameter without the basal concentrtation of glucose or insulin. The aim of this study was, including the assessment of the individuel insulin response and glucose reaction under influence of the five different fasting periods, to get a statement about the development of the testing parameters during the repetition proceeding in autumn. This also ensure the extent of spot checks. Under consideration the different fasting times, there was an increase of most of the glucose parameters with the duration of the fasting periods after the glucose loading. Glucose half-life increased after a 0 hours fasting time from 28, 0 minutes up to 52, 2 minutes after 48 hours <b>starving,</b> the glucose <b>area</b> started with 72, 5 (0 hours fasting) and increased up to 88, 1 (48 hours fasting). Also the end concentrations of glucose increased from 4, 4 mmol/l (0 hours fasting) up to 6, 7 mmol/l (48 hours fasting) and maximal concentrations of glucose rised up from 14, 1 mmol/l (0 hours fasting) up to 14, 7 mmol/l (36 hours fasting), while the maximal glucose concentration decreased for a moment after 48 hours starvation (14, 3 mmol/l). The only exception in this study is the basal glucose concentration, which decreased with the duration of the fasting periods (4, 5 mmol/l to 3, 8 mmol/l). Normaly there was in any cases an distinct increase of the glucose parameters from 12 hours fasting. Between 24 and 36 hours fasting, there were only minor differents between the glucose parameters. There were signifikant differents between both testing proceedings in spring and autumn and most of the glucose parameters. During the second testing proceeding (autumn) the glucose parameters kept on a distinct higher level than during the first testing proceeding (spring). Nevertheless all glucose parameters described the same diagram, but on different level of concentration. This characteristics relates to the differences of life weight (Ø 50 kg) during second testing proceedings and the accordingly daily increase in weight. In this connection, the intensity of fodder and fodder quality also plays an important part, which were different between the two testing proceedings. The basal glucose concentration (significancy = 0, 13) and glucose half-life (significancy = 0, 171) behaved identical at both testing proceedings without any significant differents. Under consideration the fasting periods the insulin parameters behaved contrary to the glucose parameters. Some of the insulin parameters decreased with the duration of starving, in some cases appeared enormous variations between fasting times. Especialy during the first testing proceeding. Basal insulin concentrations constant decreased from 10, 2 μU/ml after 0 hours fast till 3, 3 μU/ml during 48 hours starvation. Maximal insulin concentration decreased from 140, 9 μU/ml (0 hours fast) down to 86, 4 μU/ml (48 hours fast), insulin area decreased from 754 (12 hours) down to 501 (48 hours). Same behaviour showed corrected maximal insulin concentration and corrected insulin area. Insulin end concentrations and corrected insulin end concentrations increased with the duration of fasting times, but decreased after 48 hours starvation (32, 9 μU/ml). The concentrations kept between 20, 6 μU/ml (0 hours) and 40, 1 μU/ml (36 hours). In no case the basal insulin concentrations were reached after one hour duration of the i. V. GTT. The moment, at wich the highest insulin concentration were reached, ranged between 13, 5 minutes (12 hours fast) and 16, 5 minutes (24 hours fast). This testing parameter showed some fluctuation. The maximal insulin concentration without fastening were reached after 14, 5 minutes, after 36 hours fastening in 16, 0 minutes and after 48 hours starvation in 14, 7 minutes. This results were also proved in other studies. Insulin half-life also showed different fluctuation. The fastest insulin elimination took place after 12 hours starvation (19, 7 minutes), the longest insulin half-life stayed between 24 hours fast (41, 5 minutes) and 36 hours fast (42, 9 minutes). After 48 hours starvation the insulin half-life stayed at 37, 3 minutes. The slightest differences between the insulin parameters, like the glucose parameters, appeared between 24 and 36 hours of fasting. The insulin testing parameters kept, like the glucose testing parameters, during the second testing proceeding on a significant higher level than during the first testing proceeding. Some insulin test parameters, like insulin area, the moments for reaching maximal insulin concentrations and insulin half-life behaved different during the first testing proceeding than at second testing proceeding. Only basal insulin concentrations showed no significant differences between both testing proceedings. In this case, the higher life weight during the second testing proceeding and the daily increase in weight including intensity of feeding playes a decisive role for this differences in the level of concentration. In this study, it was discovered, that a fasting duration between 24 and 36 hours is most reliable for an reliable assessment of the insulin answer and glucose reaction after intravenous glucose {{tolerance test}}, because this fasting durations presents the slightest differences in insulin– and glucose testing parameters between the testing animals. But it needs further proofments how insulin and glucose parameters behave between 12 and 18 hours fasting or respective 18 and 24 hours fasting to get reliable results...|$|R
