50|$|Until the 1970s, it {{was common}} for <b>stamps</b> to be <b>mounted</b> using hinges and there was little {{difference}} in value between unmounted and previously hinged stamps. Since then, a significant price difference has developed between {{the two types of}} stamps and unscrupulous stamp collectors and dealers have been tempted to regum previously <b>mounted</b> <b>stamps</b> to make them appear as if they have full original gum.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{earliest}} albums, stamps were {{adhered to the}} pages, using either their own gum (as if put on an envelope) or glue. Stamp hinges were introduced soon after, allowing stamps to be removed without major damage to either the stamp or the album page. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, <b>stamp</b> <b>mounts</b> were introduced. Mounts typically hold the stamp between two layers of plastic, with the front layer transparent, and are attached to an album page, allowing the stamp to be displayed without an adhesive touching the stamp. When properly used, <b>mounts</b> allow the <b>stamp</b> to be removed from the album in the same condition in which it was inserted. An album in which the mounts are affixed at the factory, either as <b>mounts</b> for individual <b>stamps</b> or as larger strips, is called [...] "hingeless".|$|R

6000|$|Von Baumser {{was sitting}} in the major's campaigning chair, smoking his china-bowled pipe and gazing dreamily at the long blue wreaths. Times had been bad with the comrades of late, as the German's seedy {{appearance}} sufficiently testified. His friends in Germany had ceased to forward his small remittance, and Endermann's office, in which he had been employed, had given him notice that for a time they could dispense with his services. He had been spending the whole afternoon in perusing the long list of [...] "wanteds" [...] in the Daily Telegraph, and his ink-stained forefinger showed the perseverance with which he had been answering every advertisement that could possibly apply to him. A pile of addressed envelopes lay upon the table, and it was only the uncertainty of his finances {{and the fact that the}} humble penny <b>stamp</b> <b>mounts</b> into shillings when frequently employed, that prevented him from increasing the number of his applications. He looked up and uttered a word of guttural greeting as his companion came striding in.|$|R

30|$|The {{concrete}} <b>stamp</b> (1) <b>mounted</b> on rock foundation {{was loaded}} by the shear load T {{applied to the}} front plane (1 a) and normal load N applied to stamp top. The normal load was increased from zero up to N value which was kept constant during loading test. The shear load was increase by steps ΔT from zero up to ultimate value Ts. The ultrasonic probes (2) were located within drill holes (2) in central vertical stamp plane. One of zondes was always located near the front plane and the second one near the back plane (1 b). Third probe was used for ultrasonic tomography between drill holes. Such scheme permitted studying of the macrofracture forming zones at all loading level.|$|R
25|$|Mount Vernon is {{the first}} of the shrines in the Liberty Series, a 1-1/2-cent <b>stamp</b> issued at <b>Mount</b> Vernon, Alexandria Virginia, on February 22, 1956. The {{vignette}} shows the east, “River Front” of the building, designed by William K. Shrage of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, from a photograph. Washington inherited the place on his brother’s death; Lawrence had named it for his commander in the British Navy, Admiral Edward Vernon.|$|R
50|$|Nissan New Zealand {{assembled}} several {{versions of}} the Bluebird 910. These were shipped in CKD from Japan, including a top ZX model that was the first, and only, car to be assembled {{in the country with}} electrically adjustable Japanese domestic style 'hockey stick' rear view mirrors on the front guards (which had to be sent out after kit unpacking for a local specialist to <b>stamp</b> the <b>mounting</b> holes). NZ cars initially had the two-tone brown interior; this was switched to grey at the mid-life facelift when the top model's power exterior mirrors were relocated to the door mounting now universal today. Japan itself eventually phased out the mandatory wing-mount mirrors that also distinguished thousands of used cars imported from Japan into NZ in the late 1980s and early 90s.|$|R
50|$|Some stamps {{have been}} issed without any gum at all, either {{due to a}} lack of materials, or (in {{particular}} in tropical countries) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together. Such stamps cannot be found other than in (*) condition. Traditionally, in particular before World War II, <b>stamps</b> were <b>mounted</b> in albums with stamp hinges no matter whether they were used or unused. Hence some experts claim that very few unused stamps from the 19th century have not been hinged at some point in their existence. This means that old unused stamps in supposedly mint condition often come under suspicion of having been regummed, and the detection of regummed stamps is an important part of philatelic expertisation. Regummed stamps cannot be valued any higher than unused stamps without gum.|$|R
