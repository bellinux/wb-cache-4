40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} the WTO <b>security</b> <b>exception,</b> {{with a particular}} focus on State practice. In {{the absence of any}} GATT or WTO jurisprudence, State practice affords the best vehicle to understand the meaning of Article XXI. In the few instances when invocation of the <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> has been challenged, State practice suggests that the <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> is not judicially reviewable. A critical question emerges from this analysis of State practice. If a Member State can avoid WTO obligations through a self-judging <b>security</b> <b>exception,</b> what is to prevent bad faith invocations? The WTO regime includes a number of devices to address this concern, including opting out of normal trade relations, opting in to deeper trade relations, granting preferential treatment to developing countries consistent with security interests, and protecting against the nullification or impairment of Member States’ legitimate expectations {{even in the absence of}} a WTO violation. These arrangements provide broad discretion to act in furtherance of the national interest without violating trade rules. As such, Member States quite often can advance national objectives without the need to invoke the <b>security</b> <b>exception.</b> Notwithstanding these mitigating factors, a self-judging <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> poses grave risks. If abused, it could undermine the entire WTO regime. But the practice of WTO Member States is to invoke the <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> in good faith, with a margin of discretion. A Member State may do so because of a fear of sanction, out of a sense of norm legitimacy, or because it is in its self-interest to do so. The Article concludes with brief reflections on why nations comply with the good faith obligation of a self-judging exception. Compliance with a self-judging rule offers useful insights into larger questions of why nations obey international law. Rational choice and normative theories best explain compliance with a self-judging international norm...|$|R

The three are all instances of a refined state monad. Our semantics allows a precise comparison of the similarities and differences of these mechanisms.

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the British government, by invoking {{national}} security as an unexplained justification for quashing a bribery investigation, violated the Anti-Bribery Convention. Under U. K. law, the important issue is how exercises of prosecutorial discretion are constrained by treaty obligations. In this case, failure to prosecute undermines the basic purpose of the OECD Convention, as agreed on by the treaty partners. This fact, we argue, should influence exercises of prosecutorial discretion. The main thrust of our analysis, however, concerns the international law of national security. The Convention does not contain an explicit national security exception. Moreover, we argue that international law does not authorize states to read into treaties an implicit open-ended exception.

40|$|Problem statement: Most {{institutions}} {{recognize the}} critical role that information security risk management plays in supporting their missions and objectives. Often, institutions do not pay enough attention towards assessing effectiveness of existing security measures. They are also unable to respond to new security threats in reasonable time.

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} new theory for {{locating}} the World Trade Organization (WIO) in the larger transnational legal system. The theory would require 2 ̆ 2 institutional comity 2 ̆ 2 between the VITO and other equally significant institutions, in particular the United Nations, in the emerging global 2 ̆ 2 constitutional 2 ̆ 2 structure. Institutional comity would govern the conflicts between the VITO and United Nations, much as the traditional public international law concept of comity facilitates the management of analogous conflicts arising between sovereign nation states {{in the implementation of}} their regulatory policies. The theory of institutional comity presented in this Article accommodates the competing global interests in trade and security, as well as balances contending visions of national sovereignty and globalization. It also provides a more compelling account of the place of the WTO in international law than that currently available in WTO scholarship, which would treat the VITO either as a mere bargain among states or as having a quasi-constitutional status. The explanatory power of the institutional comity approach is revealed in analysis of the national <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GA 77), which the United States recently threatened to invoke before the WTO in the case concerning 2 ̆ 2 Helms-Burton 2 ̆ 2 sanctions against countries doing business with Cuba.

40|$|Agencies {{performing}} {{national security}} functions regulate citizens’ lives in increasingly intimate ways. Yet national security rulemaking {{is a mystery}} to most Americans. Many rules—like those implementing the National Security Agency’s vast surveillance schemes— remain secret. Others are published, but the deliberations that led to them and the legal justifications for them remain hidden. Ordinarily, these rules would undergo the Administrative Procedure Act’s notice-and comment process, which has earned wide, if not universal, praise for advancing democratic values and enhancing agency effectiveness. But a national <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> from noticeand-comment in the APA itself, along with the overuse of classification authority, combine to insulate most national security rulemaking from public scrutiny and meaningful judicial review. The result is a national security administrative state that is insular and unaccountable to the public. Some scholars find this exceptional treatment inevitable, while others have proposed reforms. But no one has sought to provide a full accounting of national security rulemaking’s scope and historical origins. By doing so, this Article demonstrates that the APA exception is historically contingent—a response {{to the rise of}} totalitarian states and the Second World War. As a product of its time rather than an essential attribute of all administrative law systems, it is a relic in a globalized world in which the foreign and the domestic are increasingly intertwined, and the line between national security and ordinary rulemaking therefore begins to fade entirely. This Article suggests reforms that would increase public deliberation in national security rulemaking, while accounting for the importance of secret-keeping when truly necessary. Among these proposed reforms is a change to the current practice allowing national security agencies to invoke the <b>security</b> <b>exception</b> to notice-and-comment after a rule is challenged in court, rather than at the notice-and-comment stage itself. These reforms would improve the current rulemaking practice, which undermines the transparency necessary for effective democratic participation...|$|R

40|$|Tracking {{information}} flow in dynamic languages {{remains an open}} challenge. It might seem natural to address the challenge by runtime monitoring. However, there are well-known fundamental limits of dynamic flow-sensitive tracking of {{information flow}}, where paths not taken in a given execution contribute to information leaks. This paper shows how to overcome the permissiveness limit for dynamic analysis by a novel use of testing. We start with a program supervised by an information-flow monitor. The security of the execution is guaranteed by the monitor. Testing boosts the permissiveness of the monitor by discovering paths where the monitor raises <b>security</b> <b>exceptions.</b> Upon discovering a security error, the program is modified by injecting an annotation that prevents the same security exception on the next run of the program. The elegance of the approach {{is that it is}} sound no matter how much coverage is provided by the testing. Further, we show that when the mechanism has discovered the necessary annotations, then we have an accuracy guarantee: the results of monitoring a program are at least as accurate as flow-sensitive static analysis. We illustrate our approach for a simple imperative language with records and exceptions. Our experiments with the QuickCheck tool indicate that random testing accurately discovers annotations for a collection of scenarios with rich information flows...|$|E
40|$|Popup blocking, form filling, {{and many}} other {{features}} of modern web browsers were first introduced as third-party extensions. New extensions continue to enrich browsers in unanticipated ways. However, powerful extensions require capabilities, such as crossdomain network access and local storage, which, if used improperly, pose a security risk. Several browsers try to limit extension capabilities, but an empirical survey we conducted shows that many extensions are over-privileged under existing mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive new model for extension security that aims to redress the shortcomings of existing extension mechanisms. Our model includes various components. First, we develop a logic-based specification language for describing finegrained access control and data flow policies that govern an extension’s privilege over web content. We show how to understand security policies by providing visualization tools that highlight {{the impact of a}} policy on particular web pages. We formalize the semantics of policies in terms of a safety property on the execution of extensions and we develop a verification methodology that allows us to statically check extensions for safety. Static verification eliminates the need for costly runtime monitoring, and increases robustness since verified extensions cannot raise <b>security</b> <b>exceptions.</b> We also provide compiler tools to translate extension code authored in ML to either. NET or JavaScript, facilitating cross-browser deployment of extensions. We evaluate our work by implementing and verifying 17 extensions with a diverse set of features and security policies.

40|$|The {{movement}} of natural persons constitutes {{one of the}} modes of supply for services identified under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (`GATS'). However, entry regulations have been recognised as a major barrier to such movement. Proponents of strict visa requirements often justify their position by invoking the sovereign right of states to adjudicate the entry of foreigners into their territory to protect the welfare of their society. Highlighting the cumbersome nature of procedures for the application and processing of these visas through {{an examination of the}} immigration laws of the US, Britain, Germany, France, Canada, and Australia, this thesis argues that the administration of that right in an unreasonable, subjective and discriminatory manner is inconsistent with Members' specific commitments on Mode 4 and the provision of art VI(1) of the GATS. It is argued that the general and <b>security</b> <b>exceptions</b> embodied in arts XIV and XIV bis of the GATS should not be seen as allowing Members the right to adopt any measure they wish domestically, even if it is welfare-related, to regulate the {{movement of}} natural persons. Such an interpretation could render unenforceable the specific commitments and relevant WTO obligations on Mode 4 of service supply. The thesis further suggests that the psychological nature of the barrier on the movement of natural persons from developing to developed countries may not be given expression through legal reasoning. In order to support this argument, a case study of Australian business visa requirements will be offered to give an account of the administration of the sovereign's right to adjudicate the entry of the foreigner at the moment of the encounter between the foreigner and the host. The host (abuses) his or her right to interrogate the foreigner to establish the foreigner's `genuineness', by, asking questions for which honest answers are not easy to provide. This encounter will be discussed through engaging with Jacques Derrida's reading of Immanuel Kant's right to hospitality. The findings of this research can prove significant given that the impasse on the liberalisation of the movement of natural persons was one of the difficulties that resulted in the collapse of the Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
