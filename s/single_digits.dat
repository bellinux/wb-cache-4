5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with <b>single</b> <b>digits</b> and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E

5|$|MDOT is {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the State Trunkline Highway System, which includes the U.S. Highways in Michigan. The numbering for these highways is coordinated through AASHTO, an organization composed of the various state departments of transportation in the United States. Under the scheme finalized in 1926, two-digit US Highways are numbered in a grid; east–west highways have even numbers while north–south routes have odd numbers. The lowest numbers are {{in the east and}} the north. The east–west highways in Michigan number in the <b>single</b> <b>digits</b> up to the low 20s. The north–south highways range from the low 20s into the 40s. There are also three three-digit highways numbered in the 100s and one in the 200s as branches of related two-digit highways.|$|E

However, the team from Spain did not quit, and out-scored the USA in the second quarter. They were unable to take the lead, but cut the margin to <b>single</b> <b>digits.</b> The game {{continued}} to see-saw, with the USA opening up a large lead, then Spain responding and trimming the margin to <b>single</b> <b>digits.</b> Spain was unable to close the gap, and the USA ended up earning the gold medal with a 75–62 win.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Finger Based Technique (FBT) prototypes, a {{novel interaction}} system for blind users, which is especially designed and developed for non-visual touch screen devices and their applications. The FBT prototypes were developed with virtual keys {{to be identified}} based on finger holding positions. Two different models namely the <b>single</b> <b>digit</b> FBT and double digit FBT were propounded. FBT technique were applied using two different phone dialer applications: a <b>single</b> <b>digit</b> virtual key for the <b>single</b> <b>digit</b> FBT model and a double digit virtual key with audio feedback enabling touch as input gesture for the later one. An evaluation with 7 blind participants showed that <b>single</b> <b>digit</b> FBT was significantly faster and more accurate than double digit FBT. In addition to that, <b>single</b> <b>digit</b> FBT {{was found to be}} much faster than iPhone VoiceOver entry speeds in performing similar tasks. Furthermore, our research also suggests 11 accessible regions for quick access or navigation in flat touch screen based smart phones for blind users. These accessible regions will serve as a usability design framework and facilitate the developers to place the widget for the blind user for dynamic interaction with the touch screen devices. As far as is known to the authors, this is a novel suggestion...|$|R
