This paper aims to examine the presentation <b>of</b> the sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nurses by newspapers and the sex/pornography industry. Both national and local newspapers in the UK frequently use derrogatory terminology to depict the sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nurses. Images and sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nursing by the sex industry is also noted. The media was found to emphasize both positive and negative nursing stereotypes and in comparison with other occupations and professions sexual stereotyping was prevalent. The utilization of nursing imagery is also significantly visible across a wide range of pornographic and sex industry material...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} pilot study and two main studies that address the nature <b>of</b> <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> social groups in Norway within the {{framework}} <b>of</b> the <b>Stereotype</b> Content Model (SCM). The first study focused on <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> {{a wide range of}} groups across categories such as gender, age, religious conviction, socioeconomic and health status. The second study focused on <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> immigrant groups. Participants (n = 244 and n = 63, respectively) rated the groups on perceived warmth, competence, status, and competition. Results from both studies support the applicability of the SCM in Norway and provides a unique insight into <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Norwegian social groups...|$|R
5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the Polish Jewish {{community}} was decimated during World War II, coupled with well-known collaboration stories, has contributed to a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> the Polish population having been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. Also, the postwar portrayals of Holocaust perpetrators based on court testimonies greatly contribute to this multifaceted distortion in perspective, because the German policemen remained silent till the end about Polish help to Jews and their own brutal punishment for such help.|$|E
5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to explore {{the effects of the}} sociopolitical ideologies colorblindness and multiculturalism on perceivers’ (1) automatic awareness of race and (2) automatic racial stereotyping. Study 1 showed that a colorblind prime caused White perceivers to notice White targets’ race more compared to a no prime condition, although non-White perceivers were able to ignore race when primed with colorblindness. Multiculturalism, on the other hand, caused individuals to notice race no differently than the control. In terms <b>of</b> <b>stereotyping,</b> Study 2 showed that a colorblind prime did not change automatic <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> Black or White targets. In contrast, multiculturalism increased automatic positive <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> Black targets compared to the control condition, but did not affect <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> White targets. Implications discussed include why colorblindness might affect White and non-White perceivers differently as well as whether or not decreased positive <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> Whites (in the case of colorblindness) and increased positive <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> both Blacks (in the case of multiculturalism) are beneficial ways to attain national unity...|$|R

Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E

After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly falls apart. Chris admits that he had bought into a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had promised to do.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg {{travelled}} to Algeria, {{touring the}} desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran {{on a daily}} basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and played up to the sensationalist <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} the stereotypes that people hold about fans of heavy metal and rap music.

The results support the hypothesis. Heavy metal fans are seen as a threat to themselves while rap fans are seen as a threat to others. In addition, fans of rap music {{were more likely to be}} described in reference to race and demographic factors. The study is discussed in terms of public concern about the negative influences of popular music on teens. <b>Stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Music...|$|R

5|$|On {{account of}} his caricature-like nature, Mitică survived in common {{reference}} beyond Caragiale's age. The character was portrayed by several actors, and most notably by Ştefan Iordache in the film De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?. In contemporary Romanian, his name {{was turned into a}} common noun, and often pluralized under the form mitici. During and after the 1990s, the terms surfaced in polemics surrounding Romania's centralism and the alternative projects for Transylvania's regional autonomy. In this context, it was used in reference to administrators from Bucharest or the Old Kingdom. In parallel, the term was adapted into a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> modern Bucharesters and inhabitants of other regions over the Southern Carpathians, who are often portrayed as belonging to the Balkans, as opposed to the Central European traditions of Transylvania. Under these definitions, Mitică and mitici were notably present in essays authored by the Transylvanian activist Sabin Gherman.|$|E
5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film not {{directed}} by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a promiscuous woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E
5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It {{is only in the}} successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{folk music}} in Northern England is a {{combination}} of styles of England and Scotland – what is now called the Anglo-Scottish border ballad was once prevalent as far south as Lancashire. In the Middle Ages, much of Northern folk was accompanied by bagpipes, with styles including the Lancashire bagpipe, Yorkshire bagpipe and Northumbrian smallpipes. These disappeared {{in the early nineteenth century}} from the industrialising south of the region, but remain in the music of Northumbria. The British brass band tradition began in Northern England at around the same time: the dismissal of the Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire military bands after the Napoleonic Wars, combined with the desire of industrial communities to better themselves, led to the founding of civilian bands. These bands provided entertainment at community events and led protest marches during the era of radical agitation. Although the style has since spread across much of Great Britain, brass bands remain a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> the North, and the Whit Friday brass band contests draw hundreds of bands from across the UK and further afield.|$|E

Drawing on social identity theory and stereotype content research, the current studies investigated the role <b>of</b> <b>stereotype</b> content in intergroup differentiation and discrimination. Across two studies, students from high- and low-status groups differentiated themselves positively on <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> competence and warmth respectively, and in allocations of resources in domains relevant to competence (academics, research) and warmth (sports, community outreach). Furthermore, there was evidence that discrimination by high- and low-status groups was driven by their respective <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> competence and warmth. It is argued that <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> competence and warmth, derived from status and power relations between groups, define the domains in which groups pursue positively distinct identities...|$|R
