40|$|The recent {{process of}} {{globalisation}} of international markets {{has managed to}} sustain the economic growth of the countries that have actively participated in this process. The available empirical evidence suggests, however, {{that it has been}} accompanied by a worldwide increase in environmental degradation and economic inequality. Therefore, there is growing concern that these features of the globalisation process may jeopardise its social and environmental sustainability. In order to clarify to what extent the recent process of globalisation may be considered as sustainable, this paper draws some hints from a critical assessment of the literature on the Kuznets curve and the environmental Kuznets curve. In particular it is argued that the optimistic implications of this literature on the sustainability of globalisation are ungranted and that the Kuznets approach is in principle unable to give reliable answers to the questions raised in this work. These curves, however, may be generalised as Kuznets relations whose analysis allows a clarification of a few basic conditions for <b>sustainable</b> <b>globalisation.</b> We conclude that these conditions can be met by implementing a systematic policy strategy aimed at shifting both Kuznets relations downwards...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of {{corruption}} studies and anti-corruption activism has been corruption within sovereign states. However, over {{the last twenty years}} ‘globalization’, the flow of money, goods, people and ideas across borders, has threatened to overwhelm the system of sovereign states. Much activity has moved outside the control of nation states {{at the same time as}} nation states have ‘deregulated’ and in so doing have transferred power from those exercising governmental power at the nominal behest of the majority of its citizens to those with greater wealth and/or greater knowledge in markets in which knowledge is typically asymmetric. It is now recognized that many governance problems have arisen because of globalisation and can only be addressed by global solutions. It must also be recognized that governance problems at the national level contribute to governance problems and the global level and vice versa. Nevertheless, many of the lessons learned in combating corruption at the national level are relevant to a globalized world – in particular, the need for ethics and leadership in addition to legal and institutional reform; the need to integrate these measures into integrity systems; and the awareness of corruption systems. These are applied to areas of concern within <b>sustainable</b> <b>globalisation</b> raised by the conference – including peace and security, extractive industries, climate change and sustainable banking...|$|E

This paper aims at contributing to the improvement of the overall quality of composite indicators (or indexes) by looking at one of their technical weaknesses, that is, the aggregation convention used for their construction. For this aim, we build upon concepts coming from multi-criteria decision analysis, measurement theory and social choice.

30|$|A first {{review of}} this {{approach}} shows that the stringent problem-orientation is very practicable and effective in fulfilling the demand of a ‘mid-term radar’, which allows the identification and prioritisation of TA topics. Moreover, the method contributes to agenda-setting and policy development. In particular, around 750 potential topics for further TA research resulted from the coarse radar. These overlapping topics could be clustered around various societal problems (e.g. food security, <b>sustainable</b> consumption, <b>globalisation,</b> social conditions for human enhancement, children’s obesity) and technology innovations (e.g. ICT developments such as avatars, methane hydrate, crowd sourcing, service robots). So, {{in the first instance}} the approach generally enables the identification of future topics for TA. Secondly, it was shown that a selection and prioritisation of topics is feasible with the help of external experts (see Table  1). Further, the exchange of arguments during this workshop was of value in itself. It gave an important indication of challenges and sub-topics that should be covered in the short studies. As a result of the experts’ arguments and advice (for example, of incorrect focus or combining topic sketches), some topic sketches were modified and included in the subsequent project cycle. Using this multi-cyclical process, as we propose, these kinds of topics are not lost, thus providing the need for a continuous process.|$|R

Small, medium and large firms are focusing more than ever on marketing goals, branding, distribution channels and production quality in order to address the growing opportunities and challenges of this globalisation. An industry in which firms are responding effectively to these opportunities and challenges is the Australian wine industry. In terms of export growth, intensity, diversity and sustainability, this industry is increasingly seen as a template for others. Using empirical data derived from a survey and in-depth interviews with Australian wine SMEs this article attempts to provide a set of characteristics common to successful exporters. Such characteristics, based on core export indicators and management attributes may help to provide lessons for firms in general and wine firms in particular...|$|R
40|$|This {{overview}} {{is divided}} into two main sections. The first sections reviews the literature on the impact of economic globalisation (involving of liberalisation of international trade and investment) {{on the state of the}} environment and sustainable development. While the WTO and Bretton Woods institutions believe that this impact can be expected to be favourable, divergent rational views can be found in the economics literature. A review of the relevant literature reveals that the situation is far from being black-and-white – there are grounds for rational doubt not withstanding the use of Environmental Kuznet’s curves, which on the surface seem to provide grounds for optimism. The second main section dealt with the attitude and policies pursued by GATT-WTO in relation to the environment and sustainable development. These appear to be based on orthodox neoclassical economic theory which is mostly static in nature. In practice, virtually no allowance is made by the WTO for the environment and for sustainable development. The Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and the Winnipeg Principles have had little or no impact on its policies. A charitable interpretation of its policies would be that it is pursuing weak conditions for sustainable development. Both changing public opinion and evolving academic thought are raising major challenges to WTO’s basic theory and its approaches to environmental protection. Different views expressed at the Seattle Meeting cannot continue to be ignored. New efforts are needed to ensure that WTO plays a more constructive role in the future in coordinating trade, environment and development, and a way forward is suggested.

40|$|Over the years, {{globalisation}} {{was given}} different conceptions, which {{reached the point}} of the introduction of the verb “to globalise”- first time appeared in 1944, in Merriam Webster Dictionary. Previous to that it only existed the concepts of “global” and “globalisation”. Through global it is understood an extension of the different connections between cities, giving birth to a new phenomenon, but also a special attribute. The “global space” or “global geography” concepts appear and they eliminate the bad influences of distances between cities and connecting them to each other, drawing new maps on which the lines will mark ways of travels, migrations, movements, communications, exchanges, etc. The application of global in the geographic field, lading to the physical expansion of that, has generated the globalisation, which meant an increase of the number and volume of global fluxes, but also an increase of the impact f global forces upon local life.

This paper aims to explore the main channels of influence through which the recent process of globalisation has affected the health of people, exerting an important influence on the sustainability of world development. To this end we try to identify the principal, direct and indirect, empirical correlations between the main features of globalisation and different indices of health; we proceed then to a preliminary discussion of their causal contents. The indirect correlations run in both directions. This feature turns out to be particularly important since the feed-back between the main intermediate variables (income growth, income inequality and environmental degradation) and different aspects of health plays a crucial role in determining the sustainability of world development. globalisation; inequality; environmental degradation; economic growth;...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{economic}} development, {{no matter}} the geographical area it is applied to, relates to improving living standards and incorporates a new focus and challenge for the economy: the measurement of intangible and social assets.

The essential point here is that investing in intangibles produces more welfare on long term and improves labour productivity, creating a more competitive and knowledge based economy and society. Secondly, several indices are presented and the ranking for Romania is analysed, in order to provide a systematic view and debate upon the importance of social and intangible assets and their ways of measurement at a country level. We consider that our study's results are just a starting point for possible future theoretical and empirical investigations. This paper seeks to develop in Romania a framework of understanding the value of social and intangible assets and their importance for sustainable development.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} {{of tobacco}} marketing, trade, research, and industry influence represents {{a major threat}} to public health worldwide. Drawing upon tobacco industry strategy documents prepared over several decades, this paper will demonstrate how the tobacco industry operates as a global force, regarding the world as its operating market by planning, developing, and marketing its products on a global scale. The industry has used a wide range of methods to buy influence and power, and penetrate markets across the world. It has an annual turnover of almost US$ 400 billion. In contrast, until recently tobacco control lacked global leadership and strategic direction and had been severely underfunded. As part of moving towards a more <b>sustainable</b> form of <b>globalisation,</b> a global enabling environment linked to local actions should focus on the following strategies: global information management; development of nationally and locally grounded action; global regulation, legal instruments, and foreign policy; and establishment of strong partnerships with purpose.

Therefore, global and local actions should not provide the tobacco industry with the two things that it needs to ensure its long term profitability: respectability and predictability.    Keywords: globalisation of tobacco marketin...|$|R
40|$|Pages {{missing from}} print copies: 12, 158 & 252 Globalisation and uneven {{development}} of tourism results from unequal power relationships {{within and between}} producers and consumers. The relative strengths of exogenous and endogenous influences have shaped a phenomenon marked by extensive spatial and intensive economic integration. Of the exogenous influences the major influences are technology, education, world trade and finance. Internal drivers include changes in demand, <b>sustainable</b> development, technology, <b>globalisation</b> of operators and industrial concentration. Whilst tourism is both cause and consequence of globalisation reflecting and incorporating changes in economy and society and has emerged to become a fundamental characteristic of consumer society in the late 20 th century {{it is also the}} 'Cinderella' of economic geography. In the long boom following the cessation of war in 1945 entrepreneurial investment in transport and accommodation and their coordination by tour operators led to mass tourism as a natural response to the demand for holidays. Increased competition during the 1980 s stimulated a move to deregulation and restructuring in a move to create more efficient systems of organisation and management. The disintegration of vertical integration and its replacement by contracting out aspects of production and service delivery to other producers and suppliers depends on an efficient system of information and data transfer. However, from the early 1980 s the onset of a more market driven economy provided the incentive for horizontal alliance formation as strategic planners sought to 'buy out' opponents and capitalise on their combined strengths. Thus a variety of strategic alliances leading to concentration of control and convergence of supply marks the current phase of tourism production. Information systems and technology which have enabled these changes to take place may be seen as the lubricant that allows the production of the tourist experience. The uneven distribution of tourist attractions {{is a reflection of the}} nature of, and the ways in which, attractions are recognised and signposted. Mass tourism attracted to sun, sand and sea is focussed on those locations where the resources are accessible. Consequently uneven development follows as investors capitalise on the ready demand for accommodation and a wide variety of services. This form of tourism is clearly driven by political economy with the power of the producer focussed on a relatively small number of places catering for large numbers of tourists. The divergent demands of independent tourism can be argued to be market, or consumption led and comprises many widely dispersed destinations and attractions each catering for relatively low numbers of tourists. Global patterns of tourism development are reflected in the New Zealand situation. The country is integrated into global systems of transport and accommodation, finance and insurance. Mass tourism is an important aspect of some markets whilst independent tourism characterises other markets, consequently the uneven spatial development which characterises tourism elsewhere in the world is mirrored in New Zealand. The concentration of mass tourism on a few destinations contrasts markedly with the widespread distribution of independent international and domestic tourists...|$|R
40|$|Preface: Modern {{agriculture}} and food systems, including organic agriculture, are undergoing a technological and structural modernization and {{are faced with}} a growing globalization. Organic agriculture (OA) can be seen as pionering efforts to create sustainable development based on other principles than mainstream agriculture. There are however large differences between the challenges connected to, on the one hand, modern farming and consumption in high-income countries and, on the other hand, smallholder farmers and resource-poor consumers in low-income countries. 	The point of departure is the increasing globalization and the production and trade of food and fodder and how this influences the role of OA. The main aim of this book is to provide an overview of the potential role and challenges of organic agriculture in this global perspective, as seen from different perspectives such as sustainability, food security and fair trade. 	Initially, the book provides an overall status of global trends in agriculture followed by discussions of sustainability, globalisation and the relative new concepts of ‘ecological justice’ and ‘political ecology’. Different views on economy and trade are furthermore discussed with a focus on ecological economics. Then, the status and possibilities of organic agriculture in developing countries are discussed, including problems of nutrient cycles and soil depletion plus issues on veterinary medicine. Furthermore, organic farming is related to the world food supply. The possibilities of knowledge exchange in organic agriculture are also evaluated and it is assessed how a large scale conversion to OA would impact on food security. Finally, prospects and challenges of organic farming in a globalized world are discussed in a synthesis chapter. Readers who seek first an overview and summary across the different chapters are recommended to start by reading the synthesis. 	The book springs from a so-called ‘knowledge synthesis’ initiated by The Danish Research Centre for Organic Food and Farming (DARCOF) in January 2004 to provide an overview of the potential role of organic agriculture in a global perspective. 	In short, a knowledge synthesis analyses, discusses and synthesizes the existing knowledge on a subject not yet clarified and often disputed in relation to the main points of view. This work takes place in a group of experts from different fields that represent the different points of view on the subject. It is therefore important to include experts with different backgrounds and different perceptions of the subject. The work was initiated by five key questions: To which extent and under which circumstances: 1. 	Can organic production contribute to global food security? How? 2. 	Can organic production in developing countries contribute to a sustainable development? How? 3. 	Can organic certification protect natural resources, improve work conditions, etc. ? How? 4. 	Can a fair global trade with organic products be realized? How? 5. 	Can organic research in high-income countries benefit organic agriculture in low-income countries? How? 	An international workshop, ‘Organic farming in a global perspective – <b>globalisation,</b> <b>sustainable</b> development and ecological justice’, was held in April 2004 in Copenhagen to provide inputs to the knowledge synthesis, discuss the issue and clarify ambiguous concepts. Experts from USA, Sweden, Austria, The Netherlands and Denmark were invited to give presentations on the international workshop. On the basis of presentations, discussions and group work at the workshop the outline of this book was laid down and the Danish and international experts started preparing the chapters. 	The knowledge synthesis on organic agriculture in a global perspective was performed by a group of Danish experts {{from a wide range of}} relevant fields in cooperation with international experts (see list of contributors). A website was established to communicate background material and working papers, and facilitate critical comments from other participants. Thus all chapters have been improved from reviews made by other experts, whom we wish to thank here.
