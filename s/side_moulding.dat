25|$|In 2009, the 2010 {{model year}} ES {{underwent}} a mid-cycle facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled {{that of the}} new Lexus HS, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed. Other exterior changes included chrome-trimmed <b>side</b> <b>moulding,</b> turn signal indicators on the side mirrors, and new split 5-spoke alloy wheels. Memory seating, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags were now standard.

40|$|Abstract. A {{model of}} side pattern CAD/CAM on mould for auto lamp {{integrated}} with CATIA V 5 is built. After analyzing {{the properties of}} design and the manufacture of <b>side</b> pattern on <b>mould</b> for auto lamp, key technology, such as grouping, sorting, determination of continuity, fairing and fitting of side pattern curves, generating of NC files and G codes, are presented. Using out-process redeveloping tools of CATIA V 5, a CATIA V 5 integrated side pattern CAD/CAM system for mould of auto lamp is developed. At last, a practical example shows that the technology and the software satisfy the design and manufacture of <b>side</b> pattern on <b>mould</b> for auto lamp. The technology and the software {{have been used in}} related enterprise successfully...|$|R
50|$|Aug 1980: Introduction of the Maxi 2 {{range in}} 1750 L, 1750 HL and 1750 HLS variations. All models feature new {{revisions}} including new bumpers incorporating indicators (front) and reversing lights (rear), new side repeaters, full cover plastic wheel trims and broader <b>side</b> <b>moulding</b> inserts. Inside the instrument bezels were now in matt black, the switchgear was also again revised, the headlight switch was {{now on the}} steering column {{and there was a}} choke warning light. The L replaced the previous Base model and added LM/MW push button radio, nylon trim, door bins, laminated windscreen and walnut veneer dashboard. The HL gained intermittent screen wipe, velour seats, tinted glass and extra sound insulation. The HLS gained a burr walnut veneer dashboard. However, LHD export Maxi 2s were still referred to as 'Austin' Maxis in sales literature, only one version being available, the single carburettor HL, though unlike the UK spec cars it did not feature a radio as standard.|$|E
5000|$|Turbo All-Trac: The turbo All-Trac (chassis code ST165), or turbo 4wd as it {{was named}} in Canada, is the American version of the GT-Four. It was given a DOHC turbo-charged, water-to-air {{intercooled}} 2.0L engine (3S-GTE) featuring T-VIS producing [...] at 6000 rpm and 190 ft-lbs of torque at 3200 rpm. The All-Trac only came with a 5-speed all wheel drive transmission with a viscous-coupling center differential, bringing the curb weight to 3197 lbs. The ST165 was not sold in North America before 1988 except for seventy-seven special-edition cars sold in 1987 as 1988 models {{at each of the}} 77 Toyota dealerships in California to commemorate Toyota's IMSA GTO championship win. These Celicas are all white with white wheels and blue interior and have [...] "IMSA GTO CHAMPION" [...] printed in small letters on the <b>side</b> <b>moulding,</b> as well as a white stripe on the grill. This top of the line trim came with the same options as the GT-S {{with the exception of the}} power interior options, leather steering wheel, fog lights, V-rated tires, and a factory full body kit as standard. One interior feature that is missing from the GT-S trim and other trims is the cup holder as the center console is different due to a larger center body tunnel to accommodate for the ST165's center drive shaft.|$|E
5000|$|A PA {{tested by}} the British {{magazine}} The Motor in 1958 had {{a top speed of}} 89.8 mph and could accelerate from 0-60 mph in 16.8 seconds. A petrol consumption of 25.2 mpgimp was recorded. The test car cost £1073 including taxes of £358. They tested the 2.6 Litre version with overdrive in 1960 and found the top speed had increased to 94.7 mph, acceleration from 0-60 mph to 15.2 seconds and fuel consumption improved to 26.8 mpgimp. The test car cost £1077 including taxes of £317. The car without overdrive cost £1014.In August 1959 the Cresta was given a facelift, with a new, larger, grille and the replacement of the three piece rear window with a single wrap around screen. The previous ribbed roof panel was replaced with a smoothly contoured version (with structural revisions to the C pillars and rear parcel shelf area to retain structural strength). The Vauxhall flutes on the front wings finally disappeared, replaced by a straight chrome <b>side</b> <b>moulding</b> which was also the division point for the two tone colour scheme. Further changes came in August 1960 with the introduction of a new engine of square dimensions (bore and stroke were both 82.55mm) with a redesigned, longer, cylinder block and a capacity of 2651cc. A further increase in compression ratio to 8.0:1 and larger valves in wedge shaped combustion chambers contributed to a power output of 95bhp at 4,600rpm. Increased diameter wheels allowed larger brakes to be fitted, but these were still of the drum type (Ford had introduced front disc brakes as an option on the rival Zephyr/Zodiac models in September 1960 and would make them standard in June 1961). Externally, there was a redesign of the rear lights, with shallower units replacing the elongated oval ones of the previous versions. The direction indicators, previously in the rear tail fins were now incorporated in the main lamp unit and the fins were now solid with a V for Vauxhall badge. The rear bumper was now a higher mounted straight topped design. The front sidelights and direction indicators, previously separate were now in a combined housing and there were redesigned wheel trims and hub caps. Inside, a redesigned fascia with a padded top and a horizontal speedometer was featured. In October 1961 the final updates to the PA series were made. Front disc brakes became an optional extra (four months after Ford had made them standard on the Zephyr/Zodiac). Separate front seats became an option to the standard bench and there was now wood trim to the fascia and door cappings. The PA Cresta continued in production in this form until replaced by the PB series in October 1962. During the 1970s many PA Crestas were modified and customised. The model was very popular with fifties revivalists; many were driven by teddy boys and were very much seen as part of the rock 'n' roll image. A 1960 PA Cresta features in the 1981 video for [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials, in which the band are wearing '50s-style clothing.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{alternative}} fabrication method based on polymeric materials and technologies for three-axis thermal accelerometers. The device is composed by four microinjected parts forming an external structure {{responsible for the}} coupling and sealing of a polymeric membrane. The membrane contains and protects the heater and thermoresistors and is fabricated by microtechnologies. The fabrication process was successful although some issues were noticed in the mould during the microinjection process. Regarding the ejection side, a redesign was done to first assure the locking of the micro-parts on the movable <b>side</b> of the <b>mould</b> and second to improve the extraction of the parts avoiding its deformation. Overheating of the mould and polymer freezing on the injection nozzle were the main issues found on the injection <b>side</b> of the <b>mould.</b> Three different injection nozzle designs and two different fabrication materials were analyzed and simulated. The results show that an intermediate injection nozzle design using Ampcoloy 940 ® as construction material can improve {{the maintenance of the}} established temperature values for both mould and injection nozzle...|$|R
