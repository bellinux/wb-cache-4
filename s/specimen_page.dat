For it grows very gloriously on the limestones of Savoy, presumably, therefore, at the Grande Chartreuse; though I did not notice it there, and made a very unmonkish use of it when I gathered it last:--There was a pretty young English lady at the table-d'hôte, in the Hotel du Mont Blanc at St. Martin's,[3] and I wanted to get speech of her, and didn't know how. So all I could think of was to go half-way up the Aiguille de Varens, to gather St. Bruno's lilies; and I made a great cluster of them, and put wild roses all around them as I came down. I never saw anything so lovely; and I thought to present this to her before dinner,--but when I got down, she had gone away to Chamouni. My Fors always treated me like that, in affairs of the heart.|$|E

40|$|Two {{closely related}} species of the genus Orectolobus (Orectolobidae), O. ornatus (De Vis) and O. halei Whitley, are redescribed based on fresh {{material}} from temperate eastern Australia. Although described as a subspecies by Whitley (1940), O. halei was formerly synonymized with O. ornatus {{because of the lack}} of research material to assess their conspecificity. Due to its smaller size, O. ornatus was previously thought to be the juvenile form of the larger O. halei. Orectolobus ornatus occurs from Port Douglas, (Queensland) to Sydney (New South Wales) whereas O. halei occurs from Southport (Queensland) around the southern coast to Norwegian Bay (Western Australia). Both species are commercially targeted within the hook and line fishery off New South Wales. Orectolobus ornatus differs from O. halei in color pattern, a smaller adult size, fewer dermal lobes at the posterior preorbital group, lower vertebral and spiral valve counts, and the absence of supraorbital knob. Morphometrically, O. ornatus has a longer pelvic fin to anal fin interspace, smaller pectoral fins, smaller head dimensions, and relatively smaller claspers in mature <b>specimens.</b> 23 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aberrant {{activation}} of the androgen receptor (AR) {{plays a key role}} during prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CR-PCa) after androgen deprivation therapy, the mainstay systemic treatment for PCa. New strategies to abrogate AR activity and biomarkers that predict aggressive tumor behavior are essential for improved therapeutic intervention. PCa tissue microarrays herein reveal that prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE 4), an X-linked cancer/testis antigen, is highly up-regulated in the epithelium of preneoplastic lesions compared with benign epithelium, but subsequently decreases with tumor progression. We show that AR signaling is attenuated in PAGE 4 -expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo, most likely via impaired androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation and subsequently reduced AR protein stabilization and phosphorylation at serines 81 and 213. Consistently, epithelial PAGE 4 protein levels inversely correlated with AR activation status in hormone-naive and CR-PCa clinical <b>specimens.</b> Moreover, <b>PAGE</b> 4 impaired the development of CR-PCa xenografts, and strong PAGE 4 immunoreactivity independently predicted favorable patient survival in hormone-naive PCa. Collectively, these data suggest that dysregulation of epithelial PAGE 4 modulates AR signaling, thereby promoting progression to advanced lethal PCa and highlight the potential value of PAGE 4 as a prognostic and therapeutic target...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} cancer-related deaths worldwide, and is {{considered}} one of the most aggressive human cancers, with a 5 year overall survival of 10 - 15 %. Early diagnosis of lung cancer is ideal; however, it is still uncertain as to what technique will prove successful in the systematic screening of high-risk populations, with the strongest evidence currently supporting low dose computed tomography (LDCT). Analysis of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has recently been proposed as an alternative low risk and non-invasive screening method to investigate early-stage neoplastic processes in the airways. However, there still remains a relative paucity of lung cancer research involving EBC, particularly in the measurement of lung proteins that are centrally linked to pathogenesis. Considering the ease and safety associated with EBC collection, and advances in the area of mass spectrometry based profiling, this technology has potential for use in screening for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. This review will examine proteomics as a method of detecting markers of neoplasia in patient EBC with a particular emphasis on LC, as well as discussing methodological challenges involving in proteomic analysis of EBC <b>specimens.</b> 26 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{model to}} {{describe}} Cooper pairs near the transition point (on temperature and magnetic field), when {{the distance between}} them is big compared to their sizes, is proposed. A superconducting plate whose thickness is less than the pair size in the transverse magnetic field near the critical value $H_{c 2 }$ is considered as an application of the model. A new state that is energetically more favourable than that of Abrikosov vortex state within an interval near the transition point was obtained. The system's wave function in this state looks like that of Laughlin's having been used in fractional quantum Hall effect (naturally, in our case - for Cooper pairs as Bose-particles) and it corresponds to homogeneous incompressible liquid. The state energy is proportional to the first power of value $(1 - H/H_{c 2 }) $, unlike the vortex state energy having this value squared.
