In fact, what is written about funeral customs, is that the widow is brought back from the funeral pyre, typically by a trusted servant. Altekar thinks it significant that Gautama Buddha, who castigated customs of animal sacrifice, and other customs where pain was inflicted, is entirely silent about burning women alive. Altekar takes these elements as proofs that burning widows alive had long ago died out as a practice. Nor do the authors of the Dharmasutras (c. 400 BCE–100 BCE) or Yajnavalkya (c. 100 CE–300 CE) <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> being commendable to burn a widow alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although we have late fourth-century BCE evidence from Greek authors and the Mahabarata for the 'existence' of the custom of sati, Altekar thinks it did not really begin to grow in popularity before 400 CE, by the manner of which it is infrequently mentioned in the Puranas of that time. A very early attested case from 510 CE is that of the wife of Goparaja, who immolated herself with her dead husband, according to the Eran inscription of king Bhanugupta, with another similar case attested from 606 CE. As the custom grew in popularity, Altekar highlights as determined opponents of this aristocratic custom in particular 7th-century poet Bāṇabhaṭṭa, but also 9th-century theologian Medhātithi and 12th-century Devana Bhatta. In Altekar's view, their crusades against the custom were largely unsuccessful.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{what is the}} use of <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all?" [...] I urge. [...] "The merest school-boy {{must know}} all about the Ober-Ammergau Passion Play by this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's as you behave. You didn't {{suppose that}} I should allow such {{a piece of}} tomfoolery as that to be passed over without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it!</b> If you marry her and behave well to her I will--" [...] Then he paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at the lodge," [...] he remarked, {{preparing}} to depart. [...] "Anderson is as nervous {{as a cat}} already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} effect it did have. Well, don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> forward, at present. The men shall be told later on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some {{young woman}} or other,' replied the collector, rising; 'some other friend of Henrietta Petowker's. Well, you'll {{be careful not}} to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> will you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Five year ago, or then about,' said Bill. 'He {{had set up}} in {{the public}} line here, and couldn't meet his engagements, so he cut off to Liverpool one day, without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and went and shipped himself for the U-nited States.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I say," [...] the boy broke out, [...] "don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it!</b> I do {{hate being}} thanked, {{and there was}} nothing in {{swimming}} ten yards in a calm sea. Please don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I would rather you hit me, ever so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear, major, that I cannot {{answer your}} question. I {{may say that}} I have had no {{specific}} orders to keep silence but, as {{it seems that the}} whole matter has been kept a profound secret, I do not think that, unless it comes out in some other way, I should be justified in <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I had {{a letter}} saying {{he had to go}} on to Kalgan. But don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He told me I was to keep it a secret.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} if I told you, Harold, you would object," [...] said the older man, [...] "and I thought I would {{have a talk with}} several {{applicants}} before <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to any one. Of course, whoever we get will work with you, but I would rather not have <b>it</b> generally known <b>about</b> the plant. There seems to be a leak somewhere and evidently we are too close to the work to see it ourselves. It will require an outsider to discover it." ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{were taking}} their after luncheon {{coffee in the}} library when the {{telegram}} arrived. Denis blushed guiltily {{as he took the}} orange envelope from the salver and tore it open. [...] "Return at once. Urgent family business." [...] It was too ridiculous. As if he had any family business! Wouldn't it be best just to crumple the thing up and put it in his pocket without <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> He looked up; Mary's large blue china eyes were fixed upon him, seriously, penetratingly. He blushed more deeply than ever, hesitated in a horrible uncertainty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't say. I'm {{expecting to}} hear shortly. But we needn't worry ourselves. The next move's with him. If {{he wants to}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he must come to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mary, then I'll {{tell you}} exactly how it is--but mind, I don't want it talked about yet for rasons; so you won't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> if I tell you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{want this}} {{house to be}} a surprise, so don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I never talk of my affairs until they're carried through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{dare say}} you have," [...] Frank said; [...] "but {{then there are}} tens of {{thousands}} of cases in which dreams don't come true. A man dreams, for instance, that his wife, or his mother, or some one he cares for, is dead; when he gets home he finds her all right, and never thinks any more about the dream, or <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If in one case out of ten thousand he finds she is dead, he tells every one about his dream, and it is quoted all about as an instance that dreams come true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] Wolfenden said, [...] "that {{you will}} not think it {{necessary}} to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I did what any one in my place would have done without a moment's hesitation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it's no use my <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but I {{think your}} father might have {{consulted}} me before {{he gave his}} consent to your going on such a hazardous journey as this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and I'll {{tell you}} who that {{somebody}} else is. Mind, I shouldn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> if I wasn't sure; that is almost sure; for one never can be quite sure about anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{tell you}} so. I {{have been a}} fool to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> However, I have got over my envy now, and am {{ready to go out}} with your aunt. Here she is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So long as {{they don't}} want to do it, and don't do it," [...] said she, [...] "pray don't let us <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Let's try to make things as {{pleasant}} as we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please {{do not let}} us <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The matter, so far as I am concerned, is concluded; {{and nothing}} that can {{possibly}} be said will shake my determination, in any way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} supposed {{there would}} be a small company here," [...] he said, [...] "probably neighborhood people, but if I was mistaken, of course I don't wish to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you are quite right, and I am much obliged to you for your kind advice, but we won't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I suppose that you can let me have some money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--a {{man named}} Lopez. Don't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at present. Won't she live {{to find out}} the difference, and to know what she has done! I can tell her of one that won't pity her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-by, ol' man; I hope it'll {{come out}} all right, but I'm afraid--But there! I {{promised not to}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Good-by till we meet in Congress," [...] he ended in a lamentable attempt at being funny.|$|E
6000|$|... "They didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Penrose, {{when they}} came home, {{and it was only}} when one of the men came in next day to ask after them that I heard that they had really been of use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt;--but they didn't, {{and it is}} no use <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Good-day, sir." [...] Then he flounced out of the room, {{impatient}} of {{that single}} word of rebuke which had been administered to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish, of course, {{that you}} had not spoken; but I am not angry. I {{have no right to}} be angry. I made the misfortune for myself. Do not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> dear Bernard;--that is all." ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{drums and}} {{trumpets}} is no phrase. Indeed, Piccadilly and Holborn, {{and the empty}} sitting-room and the sitting-room with fifty people in it are liable at any moment to blow music into the air. Women perhaps are more excitable than men. It is seldom that any one <b>says</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{and to see the}} hordes crossing Waterloo Bridge to catch the non-stop to Surbiton one might think that reason impelled them. No, no. It is the drums and trumpets. Only, should you turn aside into one of those little bays on Waterloo Bridge to think the matter over, it will probably seem to you all a muddle--all a mystery.|$|R
