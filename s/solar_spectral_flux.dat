40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new spectral method for the re-trieval of optical thickness and effective radius from cloud transmittance that relies on the spectral slope of the nor-malized transmittance between 1565 nm and 1634 nm, and on cloud transmittance at a visible wavelength. The stan-dard dual-wavelength technique, which is traditionally used in reflectance-based retrievals, is ill-suited for transmittance because it lacks sensitivity to effective radius, especially for optically thin clouds. Using the spectral slope rather than the transmittance itself enhances the sensitivity of transmit-tance observations {{with respect to the}} effective radius.

This time we added a few new features to the SMART system: a solar tracker for direct and diffuse components of solar fluxes; the scanning capability to the microwave radiometer; a whole sky camera for documenting the sky conditions every minute; and a mini-weather station for atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction. A surface SSFR (<b>Solar</b> <b>Spectral</b> <b>Flux</b> Radiometer) from NASA Ames also joined us for the measurements. This is a unique data set with reasonably long observational period and high accuracy. The data show good correlation with the local weather patterns.

To quantify the surface radiative forcing of biomass burning aerosols, many pyranometers, pyrgeometers, and pyrheliometers measure the global, direct, and diffuse irradiance at the surface. These fluxes combining with the collocated optical thickness retrievals from sun photometer (or shadow-band radiometer), the solar radiative forcing, proportional to delta F/delta tau, can be investigated.

We have used a 3 -D chemical transport model (CTM), forced by meteorology from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), to simulate middle atmospheric O 3 using three different solar flux data sets (SORCE, NRL-SSI and SATIRE-S). Simulated O 3 changes are compared with Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) satellite data. Modelled O 3 anomalies from all solar flux data sets show good agreement with the observations, despite the different flux variations. The off-line CTM reproduces these changes through dynamical information contained in the analyses. A notable feature during this period is a robust positive solar signal in the tropical middle stratosphere, which is due to realistic dynamical changes in our simulations. Ozone changes in the lower mesosphere cannot be used to discriminate between solar flux data sets due to large uncertainties and the short time span of the observations.

Airborne {{measurements of the}} ratio of spectral upward and downward irradiances (so-called spectral albedo) are used to derive the areal spectral surface albedo in the wavelength range from 330 to 1670 nm. The data were collected over different sea and land surfaces in cloudless atmospheric conditions during three field campaigns. Measurements from the Albedometer (developed at IfT) and the NASA <b>Solar</b> <b>Spectral</b> <b>Flux</b> Radiometer (SSFR) are employed. Spectral radiative transfer calculations show that atmospheric scattering and absorption within the layer beneath the flight level considerably contribute to the airborne albedo measurements reported here, even for low flight altitudes (0. 2 – 0. 5 km). To remove this atmospheric masking, a nonlinear extrapolation of the airborne albedo measurements to the ground is performed. The nonlinearity {{is due to the}} vertically inhomogeneous distribution of the particle microphysical properties. This fact underlines the importance of aerosol profile measurements for the proper correction of atmospheric masking. Examples of the extrapolated areal spectral surface albedos are discussed in terms of their solar zenith angle dependence, their small-scale, and general variability.

IN this paper, we examine the data obtained for two cases: a moderately thick aerosol layer, 12 April, and a relatively thin aerosol case, 16 April 2001. ON both days, the Twin Otter flew vertical profiles in the Korean Strait southeast of Gosan Island. For both days we determine the aerosol spectral absorption of the layer and estimate the spectral aerosol absorption optical depth and single-scattering albedo. The results for 12 April show that the single-scattering albedo increases with wavelength from 0. 8 at 400 nm to 0. 95 at 900 nm and remains essentially constant from 950 to 1700 nm. On 16 April the amount of aerosol absorption was very low; however, the aerosol single-scattering albedo appears to decrease slightly with wavelength in the visible region. We interpret these results {{in light of the}} two absorbing aerosol species observed during the ACE-asia study: mineral dust and black carbon. The results for 12 April are indicative of a mineral dust-black carbon mixture. The 16 April results are possibly caused by black carbon mixed with nonabsorbing pollution aerosols. For the 12 April case we attempt to estimate the relative contributions of the black carbon particles and the mineral dust particles. We compare our results with other estimates of the aerosol properties from a Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite analysis and aerosol measurements made aboard the Twin Otter, aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ronald H Brown ship, and at ground sites in Gosan and Japan.

While this is the only practical method of deriving absorption from aircraft radiation measurements, it differs from true absorption when horizontal flux divergence is nonzero. Differences between true and apparent absorption are inevitable in any inhomogeneous atmosphere, especially clouds. We show, for the first time, the spectral shape of measured apparent absorption and compare with results from a three-dimensional radiative transfer model. The model cloud field is created from optical thickness and effective radius retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator and from reflectivity profiles from the Cloud Radar System, both on board the ER- 2.

A brief review is given on the extraterrestrial <b>solar</b> total and <b>spectral</b> irradiance values. Computed values of <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> irradiance at ground level for different air mass values and various levels of atmospheric pollution or turbidity are also presented. Wavelengths are given for computation of solar absorptance, transmittance and reflectance by the 100 -selected-ordinate method and by the 50 -selected-ordinate method from air mass two <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> irradiance for the four degrees of atmospheric pollution. Total <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> irradiance measured with a prism monochromator is examined to evaluate the direct <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> irradiance for a surface normal to the sun's rays and to compare the computed spectrum with the experimentally observed one...|$|R
40|$|We use the spectrally {{invariant}} {{method to}} study the variability of cloud optical thickness au and droplet effective radius r(sub eff) in transition zones (between the cloudy and clear sky columns) observed from <b>Solar</b> <b>Spectral</b> <b>Flux</b> Radiometer (SSFR) and Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Zenith (SASZe) during the Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) field campaign. The measurements from the SSFR and the SASZe are different, however inter-instrument differences of self-normalized measurements (divided by their own spectra at a fixed time) are small. The spectrally invariant method approximates the spectra in the cloud transition zone as a linear combination of definitely clear and cloudy spectra, where the coefficients, slope and intercept, characterize the spectrally invariant properties of the transition zone. Simulation results from the SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) model demonstrate that (1) {{the slope of the}} visible band is positively correlated with the cloud optical thickness while the intercept of the near-infrared band has high negative correlation with the cloud drop effective radius r(sub eff) even without the exact knowledge of au; (2) the above relations hold for all Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) and for cloud-contaminated skies. In observations using redundant measurements from SSFR and SASZe, we find that during cloudy-to-clear transitions, (a) the slopes of the visible band decrease, and (b) the intercepts of the near-infrared band remain almost constant near cloud edges. The findings in simulations and observations suggest that, while the optical thickness decreases during the cloudy-to-clear transition, the cloud drop effective radius does not change when cloud edges are approached. These results support the hypothesis that inhomogeneous mixing dominates near cloud edges in the studied cases...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>flux</b> {{radiometer}} (SSFR) flight instrument with the Ames 25 meter base-path White cell to obtain about 20 moderate resolution (8 nm) pure water vapor spectra from 650 to 1650 nm, with absorbing paths from 806 to 1506 meters and pressures up to 14 torr. We also obtained a set at 806 meters with several different air-broadening pressures. Model simulations were made for the 940, 1130, and 1370 nm absorption bands {{for some of these}} laboratory conditions using the Rothman, et al HITRAN- 2000 linelist. This new compilation of HITRAN includes new intensity measurements for the 940 nm region. We compared simulations for our spectra of this band using HITRAN- 2000 with simulations using the prior HITRAN- 1996. The simulations of the 1130 nm band show about 10 % less absorption than we measured. There is some evidence that the total intensity of this band is about 38 % stronger than the sum of the HITRAN line intensities in this region. In our laboratory conditions the absorption depends approximately on the square root of the intensity. Thus, our measurements agree that the band is stronger than tabulated in HITRAN, but by about 20 %, substantially less than the published value. Significant differences have been shown between Doppler-limited resolution spectra of the 1370 nm band obtained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and HITRAN simulations. Additional new intensity measurements in this region are continuing to be made. We expect the simulations of our SSFR lab data of this band will show the relative importance of improving the HITRAN line intensities of this band for atmospheric measurements...|$|E
40|$|Belmiloud, et al have {{recently}} {{suggested that the}} HITRAN line intensities in the 1130 nm water vapor band are much too weak. Giver, et at corrected unit conversion errors to make the HITRAN intensities compatible with the original measurements of Mandin, et al, but Belmiloud, et al believe {{that many of those}} line intensity measurements were too weak, and they propose the total intensity of the 1130 nm water vapor band is 38 % stronger than the sum of the HITRAN line intensities in this region. We have made independent assessments of this proposal using 2 spectra obtained with the Ames 25 meter base path White cell. The first was made using the moderate resolution (8 nm) <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>flux</b> radiometer (SSFR) flight instrument with a White cell absorbing path of 506 meters and 10 torr water vapor pressure. Modeling this spectrum using the HITRAN linelist gives a reasonable match, and the model is not compatible when the HITRAN line intensities are increased by 38 %. The second spectrum was obtained with a White cell path of 1106 meters and 12 torr water vapor pressure, using a Bomem FTIR with near Doppler width resolution. This spectrum is useful for measuring intensities of isolated weak lines to compare with the measurements of Mandin, et al. Unfortunately, as Belmiloud et al point out, at these conditions the strong lines are much too saturated for good intensity measurements. Our measurements of the weak lines are in reasonable agreement with those of Mandin, et al. Neither of our spectra supports the proposal of Belmiloud et al for a general 38 % increase of the absorption intensity in the 1130 nm water vapor band...|$|E
40|$|The {{tendency}} {{to move to}} music seems to be built into human nature. Previous studies have shown a relationship between movement {{and the degree of}} <b>spectral</b> <b>flux</b> in music, particularly in the lower sub-bands. In this study, listeners’ perceptions of a range of frequency-restricted musical stimuli were investigated in order to find relationships between perceived musical aspects (rhythm, melody, and fluctuation) and the <b>spectral</b> <b>flux</b> in three different frequency bands. Additionally, the relationship between the perception of features in specific frequency bands and participants’ desire to move was studied. Participants were presented with clips of frequency-restricted musical stimuli and answered four questions related to musical features. Both perceived strength of the rhythm and the propensity to move were found to correlate highly with low-frequency <b>spectral</b> <b>flux.</b> Additionally, a lower but still significant correlation was found between these perceived musical features and high-frequency <b>spectral</b> <b>flux.</b> This suggests that the <b>spectral</b> <b>flux</b> of both low and high frequency ranges can be utilized as a measure of perceived rhythm in music, and that the degree of <b>spectral</b> <b>flux</b> and the perceived rhythmic strength in high and low frequency bands are at least partly responsible for the extent to which listeners consciously desire to move when listening to music...|$|R
30|$|The CESM model {{uses the}} Kurucz solar source {{function}} whose radiative transfer calculation {{is based upon}} solar measurements. It assumes a total solar irradiance {{at the top of}} the atmosphere of TSI = 1368.22 W/m^ 2. The value is then “scaled in each spectral band through the specification of a time-varying <b>solar</b> <b>spectral</b> irradiance” (Neale et al. 2012). The model uses a combination of solar parametrisations to specify the spectral irradiances over two spectral intervals (soft X-ray to Lyman-α (λ = 121.6 nm) and from Lyman-α to 100 m). The first <b>spectral</b> interval <b>fluxes</b> are calculated using the parametrisation of Solomon and Qiang (2005). It accepts as input the 10.7 cm solar radio flux, whose daily values are obtained from the NOAA’s Space Environment Center (www.sec.noaa.gov) and its 81 -day average (f 10.7 a). The second <b>spectral</b> interval <b>fluxes</b> are calculated using the empirical model of the wavelength-depending sunspot and facular influences (Lean 2000; Wang et al. 2005; Neale et al. 2012).|$|R
