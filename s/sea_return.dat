6000|$|Here, then, we rest: [...] "The Universal Cause Acts to one end, but acts {{by various}} laws." [...] In all {{the madness of}} {{superfluous}} health, The trim of pride, the impudence of wealth, Let this great truth be present night and day; But most be present, if we preach or pray. [...] Look round our world; behold the chain of love Combining all below and all above. See plastic Nature working to this end, The single atoms each to other tend, Attract, attracted to, the next in place Formed and impelled its neighbour to embrace. See matter next, with various life endued, Press to one centre still, the general good.

[...] Has God, thou fool! worked solely for thy Thy good, Thy joy, thy pastime, thy attire, thy food? Who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn, For him as kindly spread the flowery lawn: Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings? Joy tunes his voice, joy elevates his wings. Is it for thee the linnet pours his throat? Loves {{of his own and}} raptures swell the note. The bounding steed you pompously bestride, Shares with his lord the pleasure and the pride. Is thine alone the seed that strews the plain? The birds of heaven shall vindicate their grain. Thine the full harvest of the golden year? Part pays, and justly, the deserving steer: The hog, that ploughs not nor obeys thy call, Lives on the labours of this lord of all. [...] Know, Nature's children all divide her care; The fur that warms a monarch, warmed a bear. While man exclaims, [...] "See all things for my use!" [...] "See man for mine!" [...] replies a pampered goose: And just as short of reason he must fall, Who thinks all made for one, not one for all. [...] Grant that the powerful still the weak control; Be man the wit and tyrant of the whole: Nature that tyrant checks; he only knows, And helps, another creature's wants and woes. Say, will the falcon, stooping from above, Smit with her varying plumage, spare the dove? Admires the jay the insect's gilded wings? Or hears the hawk when Philomela sings? Man cares for all: to birds he gives his woods, To beasts his pastures, and to fish his floods; For some his interest prompts him to provide, For more his pleasure, yet for more his pride: All feed on one vain patron, and enjoy The extensive blessing of his luxury. That very life his learned hunger craves, He saves from famine, from the savage saves; Nay, feasts the animal he dooms his feast, And, till he ends the being, makes it blest; Which sees no more the stroke, or feels the pain, Than favoured man by touch ethereal slain. The creature had his feast of life before; Thou too must perish when thy feast is o'er! [...] To each unthinking being, Heaven, a friend, Gives not the useless knowledge of its end: To man imparts it; but with such a view As, while he dreads it, makes him hope it too; The hour concealed, and so remote the fear, Death still draws nearer, never seeming near. Great standing miracle! that Heaven assigned Its only thinking thing this turn of mind.|$|E

50|$|The {{scheme was}} {{designed}} to export power from coal-fired power stations on Sardinia to the Italian mainland, and thus was only required to operate in one direction. Although the converter stations are inherently capable of operating in either direction of power transmission, advantage was taken of the unidirectional power-flow requirement to economise {{on the design of}} the sea electrodes. The <b>sea</b> <b>return</b> current enters the sea at the Sardinian end (Anode) and leaves the sea at the mainland end (Cathode). The mainland electrode consists of bare copper (a section of insulated copper cable with the insulation stripped off), which would corrode rapidly if used as an anode but suffers no degradation when used as a cathode. However, the anode electrode on Sardinia required a more sophisticated design using platinum-coated titanium pipe, subdivided into 30 sub-electrodes, in order to prevent corrosion.|$|E

50|$|A {{means of}} {{detecting}} surfaced submarines at night, {{when they were}} at their most vulnerable, recharging batteries, and felt most safe, was a top priority for Coastal Command. ASV gave it to them. The previous AI.II (Mark 2 Airborne Interception) radar became ASV.II (Air to Surface Vessel Mark 2) fitted in Coastal Command aircraft. Coastal Command priority for it, however, ranked behind Fighter Command's night fighter units. ASV.II's 1½-metre wavelength (actually 1.7 m, 176 MHz),mid-VHF band emissions meant however, that a submarine was usually lost in <b>sea</b> <b>return</b> before it came in visual range, at around a mile (1,850 m), by which time it was already diving. In response, the Leigh light was developed. Though it had to overcome Air Ministry indifference, and only entered service in June 1941, it proved very successful. This, however, required a large aircraft, such as the Wellington or Liberator, to carry the generator needed to power the light, and most of Coastal Command's aircraft were incapable of it, nor were Bomber Command inclined to turn over anything better. Moreover, the Germans developed Metox, which picked up ASV's radar pulses before {{it was able to}} detect a submarine at all, rendering it useless.|$|E
40|$|Data from {{infrared}} imaging systems and satellite infrared spectrometer (SIRS) for determining sea surface temperature and the atmospheric structure in cloudless areas over the oceans are discussed. Although some interpretations differ, {{it is clear}} that simultaneous measurements of radar <b>sea</b> <b>return</b> and passive microwave temperature will provide estimates of the wind speed, and perhaps wind direction, over the oceans, especially in cloudless areas, {{for a wide range of}} wind speeds. The problem of integrating the data that would be obtained by a spacecraft, especially one with a combination radar-radiometer, into global analysis procedures for meteorological, wave, and oceanographic predictions is described...|$|E

40|$|Sea {{electrodes}} {{have been}} used since the first HVDC subsea links were installed in the 1950 s and provide a simple proven solution for the return current path. Today around 30 % of the approximately 40 HVDC subsea links in service use sea electrodes as the return current path under normal or emergency operation conditions. This paper reviews the evolution of interconnectors with sea electrodes and the factors, such as location, environmental impact, current capacity and financial factors (cost, flexibility, losses) which need to be assessed before adopting a sea electrode. In particular findings from environmental studies undertaken on existing sea electrodes are reviewed, as well as, the detailed content of recent Environmental Impact Statements for HVDC projects with proposed sea returns. Finally, the reasons {{for a change in}} design on links with a proposed <b>sea</b> <b>return</b> to a metallic return are also considered...|$|E
40|$|Radar is {{currently}} used for detecting and monitoring oil slicks {{on the sea}} surface. The four-frequency radar system is used to acquire synthetic aperature imagery of the sea surface on which the oil slicks appear as a nonreflecting area on the surface surrounded by the usual <b>sea</b> <b>return.</b> The value of this technique was demonstrated, when the four-frequency radar system was used to image the oil spill of tanker which has wrecked. Imagery was acquired on both linear polarization (horizontal, vertical) for frequencies of 428, 1228, and 8910 megahertz. Vertical returns strongly indicated the presence of oil while horizontal returns failed to detect the slicks. Such a result is characteristic of the return from the sea and cannot presently be interpreted as characteristics of oil spills. Because an airborne imaging radar is capable of providing a wide-swath coverage under almost all weather conditions, it offers promise {{in the development of}} a pollution-monitoring system that can provide a coastal watch for oil slicks...|$|E
40|$|The marine {{surface wind}} field (10 m) over the Greek seas is {{analyzed}} {{in this study}} using The RegCM. The model’s spatial resolution is dynamically downscaled to 10 km × 10 km, in order to simulate more efficiently the complex coastlines and the numerous islands of Greece. Wind data for the 1980 – 2000 and 2080 – 2100 periods are produced and evaluated against real observational data from 15 island and coastal meteorological stations {{in order to assess}} the model’s ability to reproduce the main characteristics of the surface wind fields. RegCM model shows a higher simulating skill to project seasonal wind speeds and direction during summer and the lowest simulating skill in the cold period of the year. Extreme wind speed thresholds were estimated using percentiles indices and three Peak Over Threshold (POT) techniques. The mean threshold values of the three POT methods are used to examine the inter-annual distribution of extreme winds in the study region. The highest thresholds were observed in three poles; the northeast, the southeast, and the southwest of Aegean Sea. Future changes in extreme speeds show a general increase in the Aegean Sea, while lower thresholds are expected in the Ionian <b>Sea.</b> <b>Return</b> levels for periods of 20, 50, 100, and 200 years are estimated...|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} characteristics {{and the main}} features of the new Italy-Greece HVDC link (GRITA), whose commissioning was achieved within 2001, are shown. This link, realized by ENEL-TERNA and Public Power Corporation (PPC) with ENELPOWER acting as main contractor and with the engineering support of CESI, was designed and manufactured by ABB and PIRELLI and will be operated according to the prescriptions of Italian and Greek Independent System Operators (ISO). The Italy-Greece HVDC link consists in a mono-polar link with <b>sea</b> <b>return,</b> with a rated voltage of 400 kV, a rated current of 1250 A and a rated power of 500 MW (guaranteed at the inverter side), which can flow in both directions between Galatina (Italy) and Arachthos (Greece). The link {{is based on a}} grid commuted twelve pulse thyristor bridge and is already conceived for a possible 1000 MW bipolar extension. Its design is characterized by a state-of-art level of quality and reliability of the overall converter stations equipment (DC cable, thyristor valves, converter transformers, AC and DC filters, smoothing reactors, AC and DC yard switching equipment), as well as by a modern and effective control and protection system (converter firing, pole power control, frequency regulation, inter-station tele-communication, station control and monitoring). The main performances of the Italy-Greece HVDC link, documented during the commissioning tests, will be compared with the system design results to give evidence of the high technical competence and quality of the combined engineering effort provided by all parties involved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe MEUST (Mediterranean Eurocentre for Underwater Sciences and Technologies) is apermanent {{deep sea}} cabled {{infrastructure}} currently being deployed off shore of Toulon, France. MEUST is shared between the neutrino physics and astro-physics {{communities in the}} contextof the European KM 3 NeT project, and the Environmental Science communities as the West-Ligurian site of the EMSO European network of submarine observatories. The MEUSTsubmarine network has a modular and extendable topology which will allow hosting up to 120 neutrino detection units and to instrument a seafloor area with sea science sensors. TheMEUST terrestrial base is located in La Seyne sur Mer near Toulon, where a new buildingis planned to host the technical activities, including a control room of the infrastructure. The MEUST submarine site has been selected after intensive characterization campaignsconducted in the past years leading to {{the choice of the}} site located ˜ 40 km offshore of Toulonat a depth of 2500 m and 15 km west of the Antares site. The full MEUST submarine networkhas up to 6 nodes connected to the shore by two Main Electro Optical Cables (MEOC). TheMEOCs are standard telecommunication cables with optical fibres for data transfer and oneelectrical conductor for power transfer. The nodes are equipped each with 8 wet mate-ableconnectors allowing to connect at least 20 neutrino detection units (daisy chained by 4) and aset of environmental instruments, with some redundancy. The power transfer is performedin HV AC with <b>sea</b> <b>return,</b> as for Antares, and provides a usable power of ˜ 10 kW on eachnode (˜ 1 kW/connector). A dedicated control/command system controls the power and opticalsystems. The data transfer uses Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). Theproposed talk will focus on the design and the status of the infrastructure with the first lessonslearnt from the ongoing deployments...|$|E
40|$|With {{plans for}} future {{offshore}} wind farms having larger power ratings and being situated much further offshore, {{there will be}} a growing trend towards the usage of High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission technology for submarine cables [1]. HVDC submarine cables provide lower investment cost for long-haul transmission, higher operating voltages and have no reactive power consumption, thus they have less losses than AC lines. DC transmission schemes may consist of a single polarity cable (monopole) carrying full circuit power with <b>sea</b> <b>return,</b> but there is a preference for having two cables of positive and negative polarity (bipole) each carrying half circuit power. The power output generated by these wind farms is not constant, fluctuating with wind speed [2]. They generate a lot of electricity when they are working at their maximum, {{but most of the time}} they generate at a much lower rate. The conventional rules for calculating cable ratings use thermal models based on steady state conditions with maximum load. This approach often leads to cables being oversized compared to real requirement. Incorrectly rated subsea cables can lead to poor asset utilisation. Therefore, new modelling techniques are essential to drive down the cost of connecting offshore renewable energy projects to the grid. Using predictive rating modelling to assess cable requirements more accurately, should result in a smaller and (therefore cheaper) cable; thus reducing the cost of connecting wind farms to the electricity grid. This research project uses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to create a 2 D predictive model a pair of extruded XLPE HVDC submarine cables, laid side by side in a trench on the seabed. Historical wind farm output data will be used to compare the performance of cables using conventional assumptions with those using the predictive model. Adoption of such approaches by the industry could lead to substantial savings on wind farm export cable systems, improving the viability of offshore wind and delivering long term cost savings to the consumers. <br/...|$|E
