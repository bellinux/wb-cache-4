Two different experimental protocols were used: hypervolemia (iv saline infusion, 0. 9 % NaCl, 20 ml/min, volume up to 5 % body weight) and controlled hemorrhage (up to a 50 % drop in mean arterial pressure). Mean ileocolonic flow (N = 6) was gradually and significantly decreased during the expansion (17. 1 %, P< 0. 05) and expanded (44. 9 %, P< 0. 05) periods while mean ileal flow (N = 7) was significantly decreased only during the expanded period (38 %, P< 0. 05). Mean colonic flow (N = 7) was decreased during expansion (12 %, P< 0. 05) but returned to control levels during the expanded period. Mean ileocolonic sphincter flow (N = 6) was not significantly modified. Mean ileocolonic flow (N = 10) was also decreased after hemorrhage (retracted period) by 17 % (P< 0. 05), but <b>saline</b> <b>flow</b> was not modified in the other separate circuits (N = 6, 5 and 4 for ileal, ileocolonic sphincter and colonic groups, respectively).

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning flow evolution and turbulence structure of sustained <b>saline</b> and turbidity <b>flows</b> generated on 0 °, 3 °, 6 °, and 9 ° sloping ramps that terminate abruptly onto a horizontal floor. Two-component velocity and current density were measured with an ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiler and siphon sampler on the slope, just beyond the slope break and downstream on the horizontal floor. Three main factors influence longitudinal flow evolution and turbulence structure: sediment transport and sedimentation, slope angle, {{and the presence of}} a slope break. These controls interact differently depending on flow type. Sediment transport is accompanied by an inertial fluid reaction that enhances Reynolds stresses in turbidity flows. Thus turbidity flows mix more vigorously than equivalent <b>saline</b> density <b>flows.</b> For <b>saline</b> <b>flows,</b> turbulent kinetic energy is dependent on slope, and rapid deceleration occurs on the horizontal floor. For turbidity flows, normalized turbulent kinetic energy increases downstream, and mean streamwise deceleration is reduced compared with <b>saline</b> <b>flows.</b> The slope break causes mean bed-normal velocity of turbidity flows to become negative and have a gentler gradient compared with other locations. A reduction of peak Reynolds normal stress in the bed-normal direction is accompanied by an increase in turbulent accelerations across the rest of the flow thickness. Thus the presence of particles acts to increase Reynolds normal stresses independently of gradients of mean velocity, and sediment transport increases across the break in slope. The experiments illustrate that saline density currents may not be good dynamic analogues for natural turbidity currents...|$|R

40|$|Microneedles {{have been}} {{developed}} as a minimally invasive alternative to painful hypodermic needles to deliver modern biotherapeutics. Previously, several in-vitro and in-vivo animal {{studies have been conducted}} to show that microneedles increase skin permeability {{to a wide range of}} molecules that cannot cross the skin using conventional transdermal patches due to the skin's stratum corneum barrier. However, only a limited number of studies have been performed to study microneedle-based drug delivery in human subjects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform the first-in-humans microneedle studies to: a) characterize skin repair responses to solid microneedle insertion to determine the extent of increased skin permeability coupled with predictions of pharmacokinetics of drug delivered through premeabilized skin, b) determine the effect of hollow microneedle-based infusion parameters on <b>flow</b> <b>conductivity</b> of skin and pain and thereby identify barriers to fluid flow into the skin from hollow microneedles, c) assess the safety and efficacy of systemic therapeutic effects through measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters, pain and irritation for microneedle-based insulin delivery in type 1 diabetes subjects, and d) assess the safety and efficacy of local therapeutic effects though delivery of lidocaine to the skin. Results showed for the first time that solid microneedle-treated skin reseals rapidly (< 2 h) in the absence of occlusion whereas occluded skin reseals slowly (3 - 40 h) depending on microneedle geometry as determined by skin impedance measurements. Increased microneedle length, number, and cross-sectional area led to slower recovery kinetics in the presence of occlusion. This thesis also demonstrated that the <b>flow</b> <b>conductivity</b> of skin decreased as fluid was infused to the dermis through hollow microneedles due to the dense structure of the dermis. Microneedle retraction, low flow rates, and the addition of hyaluronidase helped increase <b>flow</b> <b>conductivity.</b> Microneedles were able to deliver 800 µl of saline to the dermis without causing significant pain. Further, microneedle-based insulin delivery in type 1 diabetes subjects revealed that microneedles provided faster pharmacokinetics and improved glycaemic control than conventional subcutaneous catheters. Lastly, microneedle-based lidocaine injection demonstrated that microneedles were less painful, as effective, and more preferred than hypodermic needles in anesthetizing clinically relevant areas.

On the basis of theoretical analysis and simulation with FracproPT software, basic experiments, and innovative physical modeling experiment, a new impulse-stage fracturing process has been developed by combining a special pumping process with fiber, liquid and other auxiliary engineering means. Compared with conventional fracturing, the open seepage channel created by the new fracturing process has an obvious edge in effective fracture length and <b>flow</b> <b>conductivity.</b> Moreover, the open seepage channel can also improve fracture cleanliness and reduce pressure loss in artificial fractures, thus reaching the goal of prolonging the single-well production time and maximizing productivity.

The results indicated that (1) the new process is highly operable and feasible; (2) compared with the adjacent wells with similar geological conditions, the proppant' cost is reduced by 44 %– 47 %, the ratio of effective fracture length to propped fracture length is increased by about 16 %, the fracturing fluid recovery rate is up to 63 % after 18  h in the test, and the normalized production is 1. 9 – 2. 3 times that of the adjacent wells; and (3) the new process can significantly lower the cost and enhance production.

40|$|From {{numerical}} model simulations, fluxes of volume, heat and salt have been calculated for different hydrographical sections in areas which {{are important for}} the deep water exchange in the Baltic Sea. The calculated deep water flow in the Arkona basin is in accordance with independent estimations obtained from profile data. Model results reveal strong seasonal and inter-annual variability in the calculated fluxes. The variability is governed by the prevailing atmospheric conditions. It is found that {{the strength of the}} upper layer low <b>saline</b> <b>flow</b> in the Arkona Basin which on average is directed to the west, opposite to the mean wind direction, is compensated by a high <b>saline</b> <b>flow</b> in deeper layers. The upper layer flow is a combination of a flow forced by the fresh water surplus directed to the west, and a wind-driven part. In dependence on the prevailing wind conditions the resulting flow is either increased or decreased. Furthermore, increasing upper layer flow results in an increased lower layer flow in opposite direction. The annual mean flow is weakly correlated with the annual mean runoff to the Baltic Sea. In accordance with the mean circulation, the flow through the Bornholm Channel is on average directed to the east, and south of Bornholm to the west indicating an import of heat and salt to the Bornholm Basin through the Bornholm Channel and an export south of Bornholm. Flux characteristics change further downstream in the Stolpe Channel. The volume flow in the upper layer shows a strong seasonal signal. During autumn to spring the flow is mainly directed to the east, in summer, the flow direction is reversed. Flow in westerly directions is related to increased lower layer flow in easterly directions. On average, the net flow through the Stolpe channel is directed to the east which is in accordance with the mean circulation. Calculated fluxes show high intra- and inter-annual variability with no obvious trend during the simulation period. The variability of the deep water stratification in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea is directly controlled by the changing flux characteristics...|$|R
