5000|$|Signs of {{impending}} communist action were noticed among the allied intelligence collection apparatus in Saigon. During {{the late summer}} and fall of 1967 both South Vietnamese and U.S. intelligence agencies collected clues that indicated a significant shift in communist strategic planning. By mid-December, mounting evidence convinced many in Washington and Saigon that something big was underway. During {{the last three months}} of the year intelligence agencies had observed signs of a major North Vietnamese military buildup. In addition to captured documents (a copy of Resolution 13, for example, was captured by early October), observations of enemy logistical operations were also quite clear: in October, the number of trucks observed heading south through Laos on the Hồ Chí Minh Trail jumped from the previous monthly average of 480 to 1,116. By November this total reached 3,823 and, in December, 6,315. On 20 December, Westmoreland cabled Washington that he expected the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese [...] "to undertake an intensified countrywide effort, perhaps a maximum effort, over {{a relatively short period of}} time."Despite all the warning signs, however, the allies were <b>still</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the scale and scope of the offensive. According to ARVN Colonel Hoang Ngoc Lung the answer lay with the allied intelligence methodology itself, which tended to estimate the enemy's probable course of action based upon their capabilities, not their intentions. Since, in the allied estimation, the communists hardly had the capability to launch such an ambitious enterprise: [...] "There was little possibility that the enemy could initiate a general offensive, regardless of his intentions." [...] The answer could also be partially explained by the lack of coordination and cooperation between competing intelligence branches, both South Vietnamese and American. The situation from the U.S. perspective was best summed up by an MACV intelligence analyst: [...] "If we'd gotten the whole battle plan, it wouldn't have been believed. It wouldn't have been credible to us." ...|$|E

When a show takes a wrong turn, the patience required to stick around and {{wait for it to}} re-route—if it does re-route—can be hard to find. So while Grimm has been lucky as of late in that its list of shortcomings has been, well, short, I was <b>still</b> <b>surprised</b> (and delighted) <b>by</b> how quickly the series rectified what few issues I've had with it in the recent past.

50|$|When the Germans invaded on 10 May, French tank units had {{an organic}} {{strength}} of 606 Lorraine 37Ls; the numbers produced were thus insufficient to provide each unit with its official complement. About a third {{had to do}} without. That day French General Headquarters decided to increase the TRC 37L strength of 1e and 2e DCR with a half; these armoured divisions had been earmarked as reserves against an expected German breakthrough attempt in the Gembloux Gap and the low range of the Char B1 bis worried French command. To free enough tractors, 3e DCR, {{still in the process}} of being constituted, had to give up its twelve TRC L37s to 1e DCR. Ironically, the main German breakthrough would be at Sedan and 3e DCR was sent to block it — and despite its larger number of fuel tractors, 1e DCR would <b>still</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> 7.

50|$|The Conservative party's {{decision}} to partake in local elections was largely {{driven out of}} a desire to increase party efficiency. In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour had been competing in Scottish local elections for many years. This was seen as providing Labour party activists a great deal of valuable campaigning experience, whilst the Conservative party electoral machine had only been deployed in the intermittent general elections and by-elections. The lack of involvement in local elections also meant that the Conservatives were unable to assess party support as well as Labour. Even in 1974, when the Conservatives had been fighting local elections for several years, the party was <b>still</b> taken <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> the surge in SNP support in what were seen as traditional Scottish Tory heartlands.|$|R

Friend of Humfrey though he were, she could not feel secure of his generosity, and wished the engineer had been the nearer referee; but she did not say so, as much for shame at her own uncharitableness, as for fear of rousing Mervyn's distrust; and she was afraid that her injunctions to secrecy would be disregarded.

[...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Monda connected with New York viscerally, though his particular affinity was for the city's Jewish-American experience. It might seem curious, since Mr. Monda is a practicinc Catholic, educated by Jesuits. Today he <b>still</b> seems <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the attraction. [...] "All of a sudden I discovered everything I like - music-wise, novel-wise - is either written, composed, or directed by a Jew", he said. He immersed himself {{in the writing of}} Singer ("my hero"), Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer and Mr. Roth, as well as in Mr. Allen's films, in Arthur Miller's plays and in George Gershwin and Bob Dylan. Next, he had an idea, to make a documentary for Italian audiences on Jewish-American authors. He interviewed as many of them as he could and in each case began with a blunt question: “Why do I like you?” [...] This style caught the attention of director Wes Anderson, who cast Monda as himself in the film The Life Aquatic and included a parody—a DVD extra called [...] "Mondo Monda" [...] in which Monda asks such questions of Anderson and his associate, co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach, to befuddled reactions. Monda often manages to use his interview connections for book topics, classroom speaker series, or social gatherings.|$|R
60|$|What is more, Lady Lillycraft, {{with her}} usual benevolence and zeal in all matters of this tender nature, on {{hearing of the}} {{reconciliation}} of the lovers, undertook the critical task of breaking the matter to Ready-Money Jack. She thought {{there was no time}} like the present, and attacked the sturdy old yeoman that very evening in the park, while his heart was yet lifted up with the Squire's good cheer. Jack was a little surprised at being drawn aside by her ladyship, but was not to be flurried by such an honour: he was <b>still</b> more <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the nature of her communication, and by this first intelligence of an affair which had been passing under his eye. He listened, however, with his usual gravity, as her ladyship represented the advantages of the match, the good qualities of the girl, and the distress which she had lately suffered: at length his eye began to kindle, and his hand to play with the head of his cudgel. Lady Lillycraft saw that something in the narrative had gone wrong, and hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiterating the soft-hearted Phoebe's merit and fidelity, and her great unhappiness; when old Ready-Money suddenly interrupted her by exclaiming, that if Jack did not marry the wench, he'd break every bone in his body! The match, therefore, is considered a settled thing: Dame Tibbets and the housekeeper have made friends, and drank tea together; and Phoebe has again recovered her good looks and good spirits, and is carolling from morning till night like a lark.|$|R

50|$|His bench debut {{took place}} on 6 September 2008 in a {{qualifier}} against the Faroe Islands in front of less than 10,000 spectators at the almost empty Marakana Stadium. And although the 2-0 win was far from convincing, Antić and his team received passing marks as all eyes were on the match away at powerhouse France in Saint Denis four days later. Looking at the team he fielded on his debut, Antić introduced some fresh talent from the domestic league such as midfielders Nenad Milijaš and Zoran Tošić as well as defender Ivan Obradović. Furthermore, he brought back skillful attacking midfielder Miloš Krasić, who was completely ignored by Đukić. Taking on France in the next match, Antić returned to the tried and tested players, however he <b>still</b> caused a <b>surprise</b> <b>by</b> starting 19-year-old Miralem Sulejmani on the left wing thus continuing his long-standing practice of throwing in-form youngsters into the fire. Also surprising was leaving tall striker Nikola Žigić {{on the bench and}} starting with only on attacker, Marko Pantelić, upfront in 4-5-1 formation. And while Serbia lost 2-1 to somewhat wounded France that just days earlier shockingly lost to Austria, many positives were taken from the match at Stade de France such as a brave attacking approach with a lot of running from the wings.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{claims that}} {{situated}} normativity {{is part of}} the task constraints which affect the dynamic process of decision making. Situated normativity is mainly defined by behavioural modes and levels of expertise, expressed in and as ethnomethods. 12 Krav Maga participants (five novices, five intermediates, two experts) were distributed into two experimental groups. Each group underwent a different experimental breaching condition: G 1 faced a boxer that performed a judo attack (Morote Dori); G 2 faced a judoka that performed a boxing attack (Jab). Results showed that every participant, irrelevant of their level of expertise, was <b>surprised</b> <b>by</b> the attack in T 1. During T 2, expectancies of the previous trial acted as a task constraint that affected participants in different ways. As a general trend, novices were <b>still</b> <b>surprised</b> but experts and intermediates were not.
