He could fix no {{possible}} meaning to it, and he was glad {{that it did not}} come when he was in company with Margaret. It was too late to disturb her now, and he most earnestly hoped that an explanation would come before he saw her again.|$|E

They {{have left their}} place of rendezvous; but {{as they may be}} lurking in the neighbourhood, and as you say you have special reason to apprehend violence from them, I will put you under the charge of a <b>steady</b> <b>person,</b> who will protect you as far as Stamford, and see you into a light coach, which goes from thence to London." ...|$|E

But his Grace is the best judge; {{and you are a}} <b>steady</b> <b>person,</b> Mr. Archibald. It is not every one that comes from a great man's house I would trust my cousin with.--But, Jeanie, you must not go through the streets with Mr. Archibald with your tartan what-d'ye-call-it there upon your shoulders, as if you had come up with a drove of Highland cattle. Wait till I bring down my silk cloak. Why, we'll have the mob after you!" ...|$|E
500|$|St James' {{has had a}} choir {{since early}} colonial times. James Pearson {{accepted}} the office of choir leader in 1827 and arranged some of the music that was sung. He also offered to teach [...] "a few <b>steady</b> <b>persons,</b> of either sex," [...] if they would volunteer to join the choir. In those early days, the choir was a [...] "mixed one, {{of male and female}} voices, some of them professional", {{but by the end of}} the 19th century, the choristers were all males. Until Anthony Jennings was appointed Director of Music in 1995, the choirmaster was also the organist. Some choirmasters, such as James Furley, also composed original works for the choir. Arthur Mason, chief organist at the turn of the 20th century, was succeeded by George Faunce Allman in the role.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the green}} carpet itself, and {{gathered}} round the altar, {{was a perfect}} army of cardinals and priests, in red, gold, purple, violet, white, and fine linen. Stragglers from these, went to and fro among the crowd, conversing two and two, or giving and receiving introductions, and exchanging salutations; other functionaries in black gowns, and other functionaries in court- dresses, were similarly engaged. In {{the midst of all}} these, and stealthy Jesuits creeping in and out, and the extreme restlessness of the Youth of England, who were perpetually wandering about, some few <b>steady</b> <b>persons</b> in black cassocks, who had knelt down with their faces to the wall, and were poring over their missals, became, unintentionally, a sort of humane man-traps, and with their own devout legs, tripped up other people's by the dozen.|$|R

"I must say," [...] resumed my grandmother, after {{a little}} pause, in which {{she seemed to be}} {{considering}} the subject, [...] "that I was not altogether in favor of that young woman taking the position of your secretary. She can have had but little experience, and I thought that an older and <b>steadier</b> <b>person</b> would answer your purpose much better; but this one was unemployed at the time, and wished very much to do literary work; and as the institution needed the money you would pay, which would probably amount to a considerable sum if your book should be a long one, and as you were in a great hurry, and might engage some one from the city if one of the Martha sisters were not immediately available, Mother Anastasia and I concluded that it would be well to send this young person until one of the older sisters, competent for the work, should be disengaged. I thought you would be very anxious to have this change made as soon as possible, so that you might feel that you had a permanent secretary." ...|$|R
60|$|Phyllis and Adeline {{had been}} possessed by Reginald {{with a great}} dread of governesses; and they were agreeably {{surprised}} in Miss Aylmer, whom they found neither cross nor strict, and always willing to forward their amusements, and let them go out with their papa and sisters whenever they were asked. Phyllis, without much annoyance to one so obedient, was trained into more civilisation, and Ada's more serious faults were duly watched and guarded against. The removal of Esther was a great advantage to Ada; an older and more <b>steady</b> <b>person</b> was taken in her place; while to the great relief of Mr. Mohun and Lilias, Rachel Harvey took Esther to her brother's farmhouse, where she promised to watch and teach her, and hoped in time to make her a good servant.|$|E
40|$|People with HIV / AIDS are {{infected}} with the HIV virus in the body, most individuals with HIV / AIDS is more easily discriminated and stigmatized in society. So that people with HIV / AIDS have a problem {{not only on the}} physical but also psychological, then it need by treatment and mental health recovery. On mental recovery or soul family support is a very important thing needed by people with HIV / AIDS. So that people with HIV are fully supported by both families of everything can improve or restore the social functioning of people with HIV / AIDS themselves. The research was conducted at Caritas Shelter Home PSE Field which is an organization engaged in the issue of HIV / AIDS and Narcotics. Handling a socialized understanding of HIV / AIDS transmission and prevention by way of direct visits to the hospital that specialized care for people with HIV or come directly to the house to meet clients or their families (family based), and provide information about therapy ARV treatment (Anti-Retroviral). This research is explanatory research that aims {{to examine the relationship between}} the study variables and test hypotheses that have been formulated previously. Variables in this study consists of the independent variable (x) is a family support and the dependent variable (y) the social functioning of people with HIV / AIDS. Based on the calculation of Spearman rank correlation coefficient, it can be seen that the correlation between X and Y with N = 50 obtained a value of 0. 67. Results of data analysis showed that the effect of family support has a positive relationship to social functioning <b>steady</b> <b>person</b> with HIV / AIDS (PHAs). Based on the research I have done if there are many families who do not understand well about HIV / AIDS so that there should be an institution that approaches to tackle the issue of HIV / AIDS, in order to be disseminated to families living both urban and rural areas...|$|E

Louis paused in ardent contemplation of the image he had called up, and poor James gruffly whispered, 'Go on: you were happy.' ...|$|R

We had better say what we mean. You feel strongly with regard to your old playfellow; I cannot think well of her; but while this is matter of opinion, it is childish to dispute. Time will show which is the correct view--I shall be glad if it is yours. The elder sister is a <b>steady</b> amiable <b>person,</b> whom my aunt likes, and that is in their favour. I do not wish you to break with an old friend while we know of no positive charge against her, though I should think there could be little to attract you. For me it is another matter, and I will not.' ...|$|R
60|$|It sufficed him {{in its way}} {{for months}} and the year elapsed; it would doubtless even have carried him further but for an accident, superficially slight, which moved him, quite in another direction, with a force beyond any of his {{impressions}} of Egypt or of India. It was {{a thing of the}} merest chance--the turn, as he afterwards felt, of a hair, though he was indeed to live to believe that if light hadn't come to him in this particular fashion it would still have come in another. He was to live to believe this, I say, though he was not to live, I may not less definitely mention, to do much else. We allow him at any rate the benefit of the conviction, struggling up for him at the end, that, whatever might have happened or not happened, he would have come round of himself to the light. The incident of an autumn day had put the match to the train laid from of old by his misery. With the light before him he knew that even of late his ache had only been smothered. It was strangely drugged, but it throbbed; at the touch it began to bleed. And the touch, in the event, was the face of a fellow-mortal. This face, one grey afternoon when the leaves were thick in the alleys, looked into Marcher's own, at the cemetery, with an expression like the cut of a blade. He felt it, that is, so deep down that he winced at the <b>steady</b> thrust. The <b>person</b> who so mutely assaulted him was a figure he had noticed, on reaching his own goal, absorbed by a grave a short distance away, a grave apparently fresh, so that the emotion of the visitor would probably match it for frankness. This fact alone forbade further attention, though during the time he stayed he remained vaguely conscious of his neighbour, a middle-aged man apparently, in mourning, whose bowed back, among the clustered monuments and mortuary yews, was constantly presented. Marcher's theory that these were elements in contact with which he himself revived, had suffered, on this occasion, it may be granted, a marked, an excessive check. The autumn day was dire for him as none had recently been, and he rested with a heaviness he had not yet known on the low stone table that bore May Bartram's name. He rested without power to move, as if some spring in him, some spell vouchsafed, had suddenly been broken for ever. If he could have done that moment as he wanted he would simply have stretched himself on the slab that was ready to take him, treating it as a place prepared to receive his last sleep. What in all the wide world had he now to keep awake for? He stared before him with the question, and it was then that, as one of the cemetery walks passed near him, he caught the shock of the face.|$|R
