40|$|Mucosal {{surfaces}} are {{prominent in the}} gastrointestinal, urogenital, and respiratory tracts and provide portals of entry for pathogens. The mucosal immune system consists of molecules, cells, and organised lymphoid structures intended to provide immunity to pathogens that impinge upon mucosal surfaces. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess humoral immunity in the vaginal mucosa and compare this immune response to a systemic response. The use of commercially available tampons provided a self-administered, pain free method for the collection of vaginal secretions. To <b>standardise</b> <b>specimens,</b> a total protein determination was performed on vaginal secretions and on sera. All subjects were screened for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using conventional and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) amplification tests. Immunoglobulin levels in vaginal secretions and in sera were quantitated using a quantitative sandwich enzyme- linked- immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The immunoglobulin levels quantitated were analysed on the basis of pregnancy status and the presence or absence of an STI. Immunoglobulin results for serum showed a significan...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The study {{investigated}} whether test results for human papillomavirus (HPV) {{are influenced by}} the sampling site of the specimens. Methods: The present study was a pilot study for a large case-control study currently been conducted and included 14 immune-competent north Australian patients with histologically confirmed basal cell carcinoma. Specimens assessed were the cancer tissue, peri-lesional skin, healthy skin, and eyebrow hairs. HPV types were identified by single-tube nested 'hanging droplet' polymerase chain reaction. Results: HPV was isolated from four patients (28. 6 %; 95 %-confidence interval = [4. 0, 32. 7]) with up to three of the samples from these patients testing positive for HPV. The prevalence of HPV and the types involved varied with the sampling site. All healthy skin samples were negative for HPV. Conclusions: HPV results varied considerably with the sample site in patients with basal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the authors suggest that <b>standardising</b> <b>specimen</b> collection for HPV analysis to the cancer site should reduce the possibility of detecting HPV types unrelated to the development of skin cancer...|$|R
40|$|Summary Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} various environmental (clinical) conditions on the physical and chemical characteristics of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA). Methodology: Initially preparation of <b>specimens</b> was <b>standardised.</b> Moreover, a novel mixing technique, trituration of encapsulated MTA, was developed. The effects of acid and blood contamination on various characteristics of MTA including compressive strength, surface microhardness, push-out bond strength and total porosity were then evaluated. Furthermore, by using X-ray diffraction analysis the hydration process of blood contaminated MTA was studied. In addition, the microstructure of contaminated MTA specimens was compared with control groups. Results: Methods of mixing and placing MTA significantly affected the hydration process and consequently the physical properties of the material. The lowest and greatest compressive strength, Vickers surface microhardness, and push-out strength values of MTA were found after exposure to pH levels of 4. 4 and 7. 4, respectively. In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed a lack of needle-like crystals when the material was in contact with more acidic solutions. The hydration state of specimens partially mixed with blood was more complete than those mixed entirely with blood and less than specimens that were hydrated only with water. Conclusion: In experimental investigations, use of controlled mixing and placement techniques when using MTA is essential in order to <b>standardise</b> <b>specimen</b> preparation. Delaying {{the placement of the}} final coronal restoration in clinical situations when MTA is contaminated is recommended so that the material can acquire sufficient physical properties to withstand the acid-etch procedure and the condensation pressures that occur during the placement of a restoration and/or produced through indirect masticatory forces...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} the surface {{quality of a}} new low-shrinking experimental resin restorative material after polishing with seven different techniques. METHODS: The composite resin {{used in this study}} was the experimental material, Hermes (3 M/ESPE). Seventy <b>standardised</b> <b>specimens</b> were prepared using a perspex mould. All samples were stored in distilled water for 10 days. Samples were randomly divided into 7 groups (n= 10). Thereafter, the average roughness of one side of each specimen (formed against the matrix) was recorded using a surface roughness meter (Surftest SJ 301) (control). The other side of each specimen was roughened with 320 grit silicone-carbide paper in a polishing machine for 45 seconds. The finishing/polishing of specimens was performed following the five different protocols according to the manufacturer’s instructions: (1) Enhance polishing cones (E), (2) Enhance followed by POGO (EPG), (3) Jiffy Polishing Cups (J), (4) consecutive use of four flexible Sof-Lex discs (S), (5) consecutive use of four flexible Sof-Lex discs followed by Sof-Lex brush(SB), (6) consecutive use of three flexible OpenDiscs (O), and (7) consecutive use of three flexible OpenDiscs followed by Openshine brushes (OB). The mean roughness of each polished surfaces was determined using the surface profilometer, collecting 5 measurements from each specimen. Data was analyzed statistically (ANOVA). Results: The mean average roughness (Ra) values obtained for specimens in Groups 2 - 8 that were treated with one of the polishing systems ranged from 0. 63 – 1. 21 μm. ANOVA analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between Enhance (roughest) compared to all the other groups (P < 0. 001). There were no statistical significant differences (p< 0. 001) between Groups 3 (Enhance and POGO 2), 4 (Jiffy Polishing Cups), 5 (Sof-Lex), 6 (Sof-Lex and Sof-Lex Brushes), 7 (OpenDiscs) and 8 (OpenDiscs and OpenShine Brushes). Clinical Significance: All the polishing techniques evaluated in this study, {{with the possible exception of}} Enhance Points, can be utilised to produce a smooth surface on Hermes composite resin material. The material Hermes can be polished to a high gloss and excellent smoothness, and will be acceptable for usage in the mouth...|$|R
40|$|Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is {{the most}} common used {{titanium}} alloy in aerospace. Parts are typically machined from wrought material with often high buy-to-fly ratios. Additive manufacturing, however, allows to build parts rapidly and directly from computer-aided design information, offering better material utilisation and lead time reduction. Despite the high potential for aerospace applications, the reliability of the mechanical properties is still at an early stage. This work gives an overview by determining and comparing the mechanical properties of DMLS, EBM and DMD processed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material. Each process is compared, based on <b>standardised</b> post treatments, <b>specimen</b> geometries and test methods. It can be seen, that the chemical composition, the microstructure, and the defect formation differs between the processes, which leads to a scatter in the experimentally determined static tensile, axial fatigue, and crack growth properties...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{continues}} {{dealing with}} the issues of influence of microwave hardening on mechanical properties of waterglass-based mouldingsands. This {{second part of the}} research includes examining moulding sands containing 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 % of hydrated sodium silicate grade 150. <b>Standardised,</b> microwave-hardened cylindrical <b>specimens</b> for mechanical testing were held at temperatures from 100 to 1200 °C for 30 minutes, cooled-down to ambient temperature and then their residual strength was determined. An attempt was made to explain theeffect of microwave hardening on strength of moulding sands as a function of baking temperature, supported by SEM observations of thebaked sandmixes. On the grounds of these observations, destruction nature of linking bridges was identified. It was found that the applied microwave hardening is beneficial by reducing residual strength of waterglass-containing moulding sands and thus improving their knockout properties...|$|R
40|$|Background—Intestinal metaplasia, {{whether in}} the cardia or the distal oesophagus, has been uniformly defined as {{specialised}} columnar epithelium, suggesting a relation with Barrett's oesophagus. It is, however, {{not clear whether the}} risk factors associated with intestinal metaplasia are identical at both sites.  Aims—To investigate biopsy specimens obtained below the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) in relation to endoscopic aspect, gastric histology, and clinical presentation.  Patients and methods—In 423 patients investigated the endoscopic aspect of the SCJ was classified as unremarkable (group I, n= 315) or suggestive of Barrett's oesophagus (group II, n= 108). <b>Standardised</b> biopsy <b>specimens</b> from the antrum, corpus, and directly below the SCJ were investigated.  Results—Intestinal metaplasia was detected at the SCJ in 13. 4 % of group I patients, where it was significantly associated with gastric intestinal metaplasia (odds ratio (OR) 6. 96; confidence interval (CI) 2. 48 to 19. 54) and H pylori (OR 7. 85; CI 2. 82 to 21. 85), and in 34. 3 % of group II patients where it was significantly associated with reflux symptoms (OR 19. 98; CI 6. 12 to 65. 19), erosive oesophagitis (OR 12. 16; CI 3. 86 to 38. 24), and male sex (OR 6. 25, CI 2. 16 to 18. 14), but not with H pylori or gastric intestinal metaplasia.  Conclusion—This study suggests that the pathogenesis of intestinal metaplasia at the SCJ is not uniform: at an endoscopically unremarkable SCJ it is a sequela of H pylori gastritis, but coexisting with endoscopic features of Barrett's oesophagus it is associated with male sex and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{recently}} {{shown that the}} severity of human colonic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) varies {{in a manner consistent}} with the action of modifier genes. These modifier genes may harbour common alleles which increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the general population. Analyses have suggested several common polymorphisms as risk alleles for CRC. METHODS: We determined the association between the severity of colonic FAP (151 patients) and polymorphisms in MTHFR, NAT 1, NAT 2, GSTM, GSTT, cyclin D 1, E-cadherin, and APC. All of these loci have been suggested as influencing the risk of CRC. Colonic FAP severity was quantitated as the number of polyps per colectomy <b>specimen,</b> <b>standardised</b> for colon size. We analysed the relationship between disease severity and genotype at the polymorphic site, making allowance for the position of the germline APC mutation. RESULTS: We identified significant associations between more severe disease and the absence of the NAT 1 * 10 genotype in the whole group of patients. In a subset of patients with germline mutations in the so-called "mutation cluster region", there was an association between more severe disease and the presence of NAT 2 *fast alleles. In the whole patient set, a relatively strong association existed between more severe disease and possession of both the NAT 1 *non- 10 and NAT 2 *fast genotypes. There was weak evidence for an association between the APCT 1493 C allele and more severe disease in the whole patient group. No consistent association with disease severity was found for the other polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The severity of colonic FAP may be modified by alleles at the NAT 1 and/or NAT 2 loci. The identity of any functional variation remains unknown as NAT 1 * 10 appears to be non-functional and there is linkage disequilibrium between alleles at multiple sites within these loci which are adjacent on chromosome 8 p 22. While evidence from this study cannot be conclusive, our data suggest that NAT 1 and NAT 2 variants may explain an approximately twofold increase in polyp number in the FAP colon...|$|R
