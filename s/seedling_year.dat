40|$|This study {{compared}} {{physiological responses}} of fully-irrigated seedling and regrowth lucerne crops (Medicago sativa L.) grown under similar environmental field conditions. Measurements occurred for 2 – 4 years after sowing on 24 Oct, 15 Nov, 05 Dec and 27 Dec 2000 at Lincoln, Canterbury, New Zealand. Irrespective {{of the date}} of sowing, on average lucerne accumulated less shoot dry matter (DM) in the <b>seedling</b> <b>year</b> (11 ± 0. 44 t. ha⁻¹) than during the regrowth year (18 ± 0. 76 t. ha⁻¹). Slower shoot-growth rates in seedlings were explained by less intercepted light and reduced efficiency in conversion of light to biomass. Specifically, seedlings had a longer phyllochron (47 ± 2. 3 °Cd leaf⁻¹) and slower leaf area expansion rate (0. 009 m² m⁻² °Cd⁻¹) than regrowth crops (35 ± 1. 8 °Cd leaf⁻¹ and 0. 016 m² m⁻² °Cd⁻¹, respectively). There were no differences in canopy architecture with a common extinction coefficient of 0. 93. The radiation use efficiency (RUE) for shoot production (RUEshoot) was 1. 2 ± 0. 16 g DM MJ⁻¹ of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PARᵢ) in seedlings and 1. 9 ± 0. 24 g DM MJ⁻¹ PARᵢ in regrowth crops. Reproductive development was slower in seedling than regrowth crops due to an apparent juvenile period ranging from 240 to 530 °Cd in seedlings. For both seedling and regrowth phases, the thermal time accumulation to reach 50 % buds visible (Tt₀-bv) and 50 % open flowers (Tt₀-fl) increased as photoperiod shortened in autumn. The minimum Tt₀-bv, or the thermal-time duration of the basic vegetative period (TtBVP), was estimated at 270 ± 48 °Cd at photoperiods > 14 h for regrowth crops. The theoretical threshold below which reproductive development is projected to cease, or the base photoperiod (Ppbase), was estimated at a common 6. 9 h for seedling and regrowth crops. The transition from buds visible to open flowers (Ttbv-fl) was mainly controlled by air temperature and ranged from 161 °Cd for seedlings to 274 °Cd for regrowth crops. These results {{can be used as}} guidelines to develop differential management strategies for seedling and regrowth crops and improve the parameterization of lucerne simulation models...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Field, greenhouse, {{growth chamber}} and {{laboratory}} experiments evaluated factors affecting establishment, survival {{and production of}} birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) Field studies investigated {{the effects of a}} barley companion crop, <b>seedling</b> <b>year</b> harvest management and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization upon stands, survival and subsequent production of legumes. Seedings were made in each of two years. Stands of legumes were not affected by fertilization or harvest management, but decreased with increasing levels of companion crop competition. Death of seedlings occurred early in the establishment period and the degree of loss was similar for both species. Additional losses of plants did not occur during the establishment year. Losses of birdsfoot trefoil plants established with a companion crop occurred during the first winter following seeding. Stand reduction in the seeding year persisted {{for the duration of the}} experiment. Companion crops inhibited the growth of surviving seedlings. Growth inhibition was less when barley was clipped periodically than when it was matured to grain. In the absence of a companion crop, growth of seedlings was inhibited more by frequent clipping of thin weed stands than by allowing weeds to mature. Yields of weeds were inversely proportional to density of barley plants. Wild oats was more detrimental to seedling growth and was less readily controlled by clipping than redroot pigweed or pigeon grass. The percentage of solar radiation intercepted by barley varied from 89 in early morning or late evening to 22 at noon. Light intensity was reduced more by barley in early season and less by barley in late season than by wild oats. Yields of mixtures in the year after seeding were reduced as a result of establishment with a companion crop and to a greater degree and for a longer period of time when barley had been allowed to mature. Yield reductions of legumes were compensated for by increased grass yields. Grass grown with birdsfoot trefoil yielded significantly more in early season and significantly less in late season than grass grown with alfalfa. Greenhouse studies evaluated the influenee of soil temperature and phosphorus fertilization upon growth and phosphorus uptake of birdsfoot trefoil and alfalfa. Root growth of both species increased with increasing soil temperatures. Weight of alfalfa roots was twice that of birdsfoot trefoil at all temperatures. Top growth of birdsfoot trefoil increaeed to a greater degree than that of alfalfa with increasing temperature. The greater top growth of birdsfoot trefoil resulted in reduced root-shoot ratios. Birdsfoot trefoil produced less dry matter per cm. ² of leaf area than alfalfa. Root growth of both species increased with increasing applications of P fertilizer. Phosphorus appeared to be more important to growth at low than at high temperatures. Phosphorus and nitrogen uptake by both species increased with increasing soil temperature. Growth chamber studies evaluated the influence of low light intensities and seedling age upon growth of seedlings and distribution of accumulated dry matter. Seedlings gained weight at light intensities of 200 to 800 f. c. With decreasing light intensity, stem elongation occurred at the expense of roots. A smaller percentage of accumulated dry matter went into roots of two-week than in older seedlings. Roots of two-week old seedlings of alfalfa lost weight at 200 f. c. Laboratory studies evaluated oxygen uptake of germinating birdsfoot trefoil and alfalfa seeds. Average oxygen uptake by both species on a per unit weight basis was similar. Alfalfa, due to its greater size, had a greater oxygen uptake on a per plant basis than did birdsfoot trefoil...|$|E

40|$|Since {{climate change}} {{projections}} contain many uncertainties and are normally unable {{to predict the}} direction and magnitude of change at the small scale needed by forest managers, some understanding about {{the functioning of the}} target forest should be obtained before a robust management strategy can be applied. Structure and regeneration patterns are related to key ecosystem processes which, on the other hand, can be modified by silvicultural treatments. In this research, the structure and recruitment dynamics of two stands with different histories of management were investigated in the southern limit of the range of Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii (Southeast Spain). We described forest structure and facilitation effects by forest canopies and nurse shrubs, and quantified the processes affecting each stage of regeneration (dispersed seed, first <b>year</b> <b>seedling</b> and second <b>year</b> <b>seedling)</b> in different microhabitats. Forest structure was more complex in the stand scarcely influenced by human activities. Juniperus communis shrubs seemed to facilitate the establishment of tree saplings. Most seedlings died of desiccation during their first summer. At best, 190 out of 10, 000 emerged seedlings survived the first summer. In light of these results, the possibilities of applying close-to-nature forestry in the study forests and other aspects of silviculture under a frame of adaptive forest management are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two factors {{limiting}} successful {{recruitment of}} planted blue oak (Quercus douglasii) seedlings are dry soils and animal damage. Many approaches {{have been used}} to mitigate these factors including several types of protective cages and alternative methods of weed control. This study examined how treeshelters, screen cages and varying intensities of weed removal affect the establishment and growth of blue oak <b>seedlings.</b> After 5 <b>years,</b> <b>seedlings</b> protected with treeshelters had higher survival, greater diameter, and were taller than those in screen cages. Seedlings receiving no weed control had lower survival, shorter height, and smaller diameter than those with the two highest intensities of weed removal. This study suggests that treeshelters are a promising tool for regenerating blue oaks in California and that providing adequate weed control can improve the growth and survival of planted seedlings. Blue oak (Quercus douglasii) is one of several species of native California oaks that is reported to be regenerating poorly in some locations (Bolsinger 1988, Muick and Bartolome 1987). Recent studies indicate that a variety of factors limit natural recruitment, including herbivory by deer, livestock, and rodents; defoliation by insects; root clipping by gophers; girdling by voles; and limite...|$|R
