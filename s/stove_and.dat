5|$|Twenty-one cabins {{can be used}} by {{visitors}} at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, built by the CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> a wood-burning stove, refrigerator, and bunk beds. Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge, with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as the rustic cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. Pets are prohibited in all cabins in the park.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station {{burned down}} around 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire {{originated in the}} office <b>stove,</b> <b>and</b> spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A passenger car {{was used as a}} temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E
5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognjište {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E

50|$|Gradually the {{soapstone}} production declined {{until it}} reached the current level. There is still limited production of soapstone for wood <b>stoves</b> <b>and</b> fireplaces. A/S Granit still produces wood <b>stoves</b> <b>and</b> fireplaces. The soapstone was until the fall of 1995 extracted mostly from Åsårberget, but the company is now extracting soapstone from both Bårstad and Nyseterberget.|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} {{operated a}} number of blast furnaces until 1982. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989, but due to asbestos content many of the adjacent <b>stoves</b> <b>and</b> support buildings still remain. The <b>stoves</b> <b>and</b> foundations {{for some of the}} furnaces can be easily seen from Interstate 25, which runs parallel to the plant's west boundary.|$|R

25|$|In 1950, Armstrong {{formed an}} Anti-Conscription Committee with David <b>Stove</b> <b>and</b> Eric Dowling, all three former {{students}} of John Anderson, the Australian philosopher, who supported conscription and {{also believed that}} anti-conscription opinions ought to be suppressed.|$|E

25|$|Under Gompers's tutelage, the AFL {{coalition}} gradually gained strength, {{undermining the}} position previously {{held by the}} Knights of Labor, which as a result had almost vanished by 1900.

The Racquets led the second match, 18–17, after the first three sets, when Stöve came up with a dominant 6–1 set win over Françoise Dürr to give the Golden Gaters a 23–19 lead heading to the final set of mixed doubles which matched <b>Stöve</b> <b>and</b> McMillan against Kris Kemmer Shaw and Tony Roche. After holding in their first two service games, <b>Stöve</b> <b>and</b> McMillan broke Shaw's serve in the fourth game for a 3–1 lead in the set ending the match.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{when the}} University of Sydney's Philosophy {{department}} {{split into two}} departments—the Department for General Philosophy and the Department for Traditional and Modern Philosophy—Armstrong joined the latter along with David <b>Stove</b> <b>and</b> Keith Campbell, while the former department pursued more radical politics and taught courses on Marxism and feminism. The two departments were reunified in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The heating {{industry}} has considerably shifted toward biomass <b>stoves</b> <b>and</b> heating devices based on efficient combustible and renewable resources. This was {{a trend that}} began with the 1973 oil crisis causing the creation of the first pellet stoves. Even so, pellet stoves have become a viable, economical, and popular option for home heating systems only in the last ten years. Between 1998 and 2010, 824,410 pellet <b>stoves</b> <b>and</b> fireplace inserts were made in the U.S..|$|R

25|$|The {{evolution}} of the kitchen {{is linked to the}} invention of the cooking range or <b>stove</b> <b>and</b> the development of water infrastructure capable of supplying running water to private homes. Food was cooked over an open fire. Technical advances in heating food in the 18th and 19th centuries changed the architecture of the kitchen. Before the advent of modern pipes, water was brought from an outdoor source such as wells, pumps or springs.|$|E
