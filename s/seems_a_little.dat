As {{for people}} who didn’t care for Swan Songs, you'll {{probably}} still love American Tragedy." [...] Instrumentally, Solomon noted one of his only complaints of the album, being that, [...] "At times, the synthesizer <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too heavy handed, but it succeeds more often than not." [...] Solomon complimented the album being different and further encouraged the Deluxe Edition tracks {{in addition to the}} album itself.|$|E
500|$|Horton Hatches the Egg was {{published}} by Random House in fall 1940 to immediate success. It received primarily positive notice from critics. Kirkus Reviews called it [...] "sheer nonsense, but good fun." [...] The reviewer for The New York Times Book Review wrote, [...] "A moral is a new thing to find in a Dr. Seuss book, but it doesn't much interfere with the hilarity with which he juggles an elephant up a tree. To an adult the tale <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> forced compared to his first grand yarns, less inevitable in its nonsense, but neither young nor old are going to quibble with the fantastic comedy of his pictures." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are unclear and widely disputed, he {{had spent much of}} September 17 in London with Monika Dannemann. He awoke late that morning at Dannemann's {{apartment}} in the Samarkand Hotel. By around 2 p.m., he was sitting in a garden area outside the apartment enjoying some tea while she took photographs of him holding his favorite Fender Stratocaster guitar that he called the [...] "black beauty". In the opinion of author Tony Brown, [...] "Jimi doesn't look particularly healthy in these photographs: his face <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> puffy and on only [...] a few of the pictures does he attempt to smile." ...|$|E

500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for IGN, Robert Canning {{described}} [...] "I'm with Cupid" [...] as [...] "very {{smart and}} very funny" [...] and [...] "a great episode representing {{one piece of}} Apu's journey." [...] However, he disliked John's guest appearance in the episode, describing it as [...] "completely unnecessary" [...] and [...] "very tacked on," [...] and described John's performance as [...] "very flat." [...] Nevertheless, Canning gave the episode an 8.8 rating and concluded his review by describing it as a [...] "tightly written Valentine's episode." [...] Giving the episode a more mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide criticized it for being to similar to an earlier episode, writing [...] "Didn’t we already see that Flanders makes everyone else look like a jerk on Valentine’s Day? Doesn’t that theme mean that 'Cupid' is somewhat redundant?" [...] He added [...] "Not that the show lacks any spark, as it throws out a reasonable number of laughs," [...] and concluded his review by writing that [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stale {{and not one of}} the year’s better programs." ...|$|E
500|$|Centrally placed above each {{window is}} a faux marble tablet with a {{decorative}} frame. On each is painted {{the names of}} the male line by which Jesus, through his Earthly father, Joseph, is descended from Abraham, according to the Gospel of Matthew. However, the genealogy is now incomplete, since the two lunettes of the windows in the Altar wall were destroyed by Michelangelo {{when he returned to the}} Sistine Chapel in 1537 to paint The Last Judgment. Only engravings, based on a drawing that has since been lost, remain of them. The sequence of tablets <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> erratic as one plaque has four names, most have three or two, and two plaques have only one. Moreover, the progression moves from one side of the building to the other, but not consistently, and the figures the lunettes contain do not coincide closely with the listed names. These figures vaguely suggest various family relationships; most lunettes contain one or more infants, and many depict a man and a woman, often sitting on opposing sides of the painted plaque that separates them. O'Malley describes them as [...] "simply representative figures, almost ciphers".|$|E

500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: [...] "One finishes Great Gatsby {{with a feeling of}} regret, not for the fate {{of the people in the}} book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald." [...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about." ...|$|E
500|$|Being There was {{received}} positively by critics. AllMusic editor Jason Ankeny gave the album a four-and-a-half stars {{and referred to}} it as [...] "the group's great leap forward." [...] He praised the band's ability to juxtapose psychedelia and power pop with tracks that [...] "wouldn't sound at all out of place on Exile on Main Street". Greg Kot, writing for Rolling Stone, gave the album four stars and lauded how it [...] "venture out into an anxiety-ridden world sure thing... the solace they continue to find in rock and roll." [...] Robert Christgau was more modest, writing [...] "there's no point in denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as you recognize its insularity." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called the album [...] "massively improved as both a band and as songwriters" [...] but also noted that [...] "the two-disc set <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than a marketing scheme." [...] In 2003, Pitchfork named it the 88th best album of the 1990s. Critics at The Village Voice named Being There the 14th best of the year on its Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1996. In 2004, Stylus Magazine placed 178th on their [...] "Top 101–200 Favorite Albums of All-Time" [...] list. [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Elana Gorgan of Softpedia {{focused on}} the single cover and concept of the song. She said [...] "While {{the idea of the}} track is original, critics and fans alike say, the artwork is lackluster at best... There is a certain old vibe to the cover, what with the font of the writing and the shot in itself, but it's not helping the singer in any way garner much interest in the release." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said [...] " [...] does for the ultra high-end shoe brand what Crocs do for sexy." [...] She pointed out how the song was not as good as Lopez's previous material and at one point even called the song [...] "Poo". Further to this, Peter Gicas of E! Online was also critical of the song, suggesting that the song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what Lopez was about to inflict on them. [...] "The track begins with the singer insisting, [...] "I'm taking back my love." [...] Personally, we wish we could take back the last three minutes and 49 seconds." [...] Tom Stacks of Entertainment Weekly was less than impressed saying [...] "J. Lo needs to move on from her recording career. She had some fun, catchy songs ('If You Had My Love,' 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'), but trying to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high-heels just <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sad.

500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today showed {{appreciation}} for [...] "I Was Here": [...] "At 29, the still-in-her-prime Beyoncé <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{young to be}} worrying about her legacy, as she does on the Warren power ballad I Was Here. But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album's most moving song." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

2500|$|Hal Hinson {{writing in}} the Washington Post gave the film a lukewarm review and said [...] "The punk jaggedness they bring to their derivations is the only hint of originality, but this, too, <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> staid. It feels like punk on the {{downward}} swing, after most of its rude energy has dissipated." [...] Vincent Canby in the New York Times was more favourable and drew comparisons to [...] "an upscale John Waters satire" [...] and [...] "Jean-Luc Godard's pre-Maoist period" [...] In January 1988 the film {{was one of several}} attacked in the Sunday Times by Oxford University historian Norman Stone for their critique of Thatcherite society and values, Stone describing them as [...] "worthless and insulting" [...] and [...] "riddled with left wing bias".|$|E

2500|$|Benjamin McKenzie portrays Ryan Atwood, {{a troubled}} {{teenager}} from Chino who {{is brought into}} the privileged community of Newport Beach, California after his mother, Dawn Atwood, throws him out of their family home. Ryan is subsequently taken in by his public defender, Sandy Cohen. He forms fast bonds with the entire Cohen family, especially Sandy's son Seth, {{as well as an}} extreme attachment to the girl next door, Marissa Cooper. Ryan slowly finds himself a place within his new materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university. Casting director Patrick Rush found the role of Ryan Atwood particularly hard to cast and only invited Benjamin McKenzie to an audition after Fox had made them aware of the young actor after his unsuccessful audition for a UPN sitcom. Rush said, [...] "When Benjamin [...] came in, he wasn't physically what Josh had envisioned, but he inhabited the character unlike anyone we had seen. I think that the character of Ryan is a kid that always <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lost and has a sense of mystery and danger; Benjamin has all those qualities." [...] Chad Michael Murray was originally offered the role of Ryan Atwood but turned it down for the lead role of Lucas Scott on One Tree Hill.|$|E
2500|$|When Socrates and Phaedrus {{proceed to}} recount the various tools of speechmaking as written {{down by the}} great orators of the past, {{starting}} with the [...] "Preamble" [...] and the [...] "Statement Facts" [...] and concluding with the [...] "Recapitulation", Socrates states that the fabric <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> threadbare. He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor {{who knows how to}} raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or came across some potions knows nothing of the art. One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing tragedies; if one were to claim to have mastered harmony after learning the lowest and highest notes on the lyre, a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, {{but it is not the}} knowledge of harmony itself. This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through [...] "Preambles" [...] and [...] "Recapitulations"; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{called the}} first episode [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "gripping".

[...] He said the characters of Agnes and Dermott had [...] "immediately caught our attention" [...] but wondered if the show would appeal to viewers who are not EastEnders fans, saying [...] "surely you have to be an EastEnders watcher to really care about Kat's quest for her son?" [...] but said [...] "for us it's a thumbs up if Redwater can keep up the suspense, surprises, gothic tone and sense of foreboding that sets it apart from EastEnders." [...] The series was reviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Afternoon Edition, where TV critic Emma Bullimore from TV Times said that it was [...] "enjoyable" [...] but more [...] "soapy" [...] and less [...] "complex" [...] than Broadchurch, and said that viewers should not expect it to be like EastEnders or Broadchurch but should [...] "accept it as a new thing", adding that it had good production values and deemed it a [...] "worthy experiment". Sinéad Garvan from Newsbeat, speaking at the same time, said that she found it [...] "weird" [...] seeing Kat and Alfie in a different setting and was more intrigued by the new characters but said that that Kat and Alfie still had the same chemistry that they have in EastEnders.|$|E
