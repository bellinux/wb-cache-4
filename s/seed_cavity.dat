50|$|Within the ovary, fungal mycelia form a white cottony mass {{in each of}} {{the four}} locules, or fruit <b>seed</b> <b>cavities,</b> and grow into the fleshy fruit tissue. The {{infected}} berry itself remains firm, categorizing this type of rot as a hard rot (a soft rot is characterized by total tissue maceration and seepage). Eventually, the fungus consumes the fruit pericarp and a hard black pseudosclerotium (mummy) develops from 25 - 50% of the diseased fruit. Mature pseudosclerotia often float and may be dispersed by harvest or cold protection floods. The fungus will overwinter in these mummies—which can be difficult to detect—at or near the soil surface. Wet conditions in the spring stimulate apothecia growth and the cycle moves forward. Berries without pseudosclerotia decompose by the next spring.|$|R
50|$|The {{pathogen}} {{can survive}} in the seed of infected papaya, even after drying, for approximately 30 days (Obrero 1980). Thus far, seed-borne transmission is the predominant method of spread and infection; in fact, studies indicate the pathogen has the ability for long-range dispersal via seed (Ramachandran et al. 2015). Although symptoms can be seen year round, rain and splashing water aid in the transmission and exacerbate the disease (Webb 1985). The bacterium relies on wounds or natural plant openings to enter the papaya. Upon infection by the pathogen, juvenile stem tissue initially shows dark green, water-soaked lesions, which develop into putrid wet rot on the stems (Vawdrey 2011). E. papayae causes a systemic infection—coalescing brown angular lesions spread from the stem lamina to the crown meristems. The firm depressed lesions that progress on unripe fruit penetrate <b>seed</b> <b>cavities.</b> The pathogen does not survive longer than two weeks in soil—instead, the pathogen survives inside the infected vascular bundles of diseased papaya (Vawdrey 2011).|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Eulychnia acida and Trichocereus chiloensis. They feed on {{and within}} the fruit of their host plant.

When full grown, the larvae lower themselves to the ground by a thread and spin a cocoon among the debris where pupation takes place. The larvae are blue to blue green.|$|E
50|$|The fruit has a {{distinct}} warty exterior and an oblong shape. It is hollow in cross-section, with a relatively thin layer of flesh surrounding a central <b>seed</b> <b>cavity</b> filled with large, flat seeds and pith. The fruit is most often eaten green, or as it is beginning to turn yellow. At this stage, the fruit's flesh is crunchy and watery in texture, similar to cucumber, chayote or green bell pepper, but bitter. The skin is tender and edible. Seeds and pith appear white in unripe fruits; they are not intensely bitter and can be removed before cooking.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds of}} Taxus masonii are rounded and bilaterally {{symmetrical}} with a pointed tip. The seeds have an overall length ranging between 4.3 - 6.2 mm and a width between 4.5 - 5.6 cm.

The overall cross section shape is lensoid, with a truncate base where an aril would have attached, a keeled apex, and a pair of vascular scars near the base. The vascular supply consists of two vascular strands that extend from the vascular scars near the base along the seeds upper and lower surfaces to points approximately one third of the way towards the apex. The strands then pass into the <b>seed</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{have found}} {{evidence}} that water plugs in hydrophilic nanochannels can be at significant negative pressure due to tensile capillary forces. The negative pressure of water plugs in nanochannels induces bending of the thin channel capping layer, which results in a visible curvature of the liquid meniscus. From {{a detailed analysis of}} the meniscus curvature, the amount of bending of the channel capping can be calculated and used to determine the negative pressure of the liquid. For water plugs in silicon oxide nanochannels of 108 nm height, a negative pressure of 17 ± 10 bar was found. The absence of cavitation at such large negative pressures is {{explained by the fact that}} the critical radius for <b>seeding</b> <b>cavities</b> (bubbles) is comparable to the channel height. Scaling analysis of capillarity induced negative pressure shows that absence of cavitation is expected at other channel heights as well. Nanofluidics, the study of fluid behavior in nanoconfinement, is still in its infancy. An important aspect of nanofluidics is the extremely large surface-to-volume ratios, leading to the prominence of surface forces. A clear example is the filling of nanochannels by capillarity, where the wetting properties of channel walls play a crucial role.

40|$|Seed {{development}} in Arabidopsis {{and in many}} dicots involves an early proliferation of the endosperm to form a large embryo sac or <b>seed</b> <b>cavity</b> close {{to the size of}} the mature seed, followed by a second phase during which the embryo grows and replaces the endosperm. Short hypocotyl under BLUE 1 (SHB 1) is a member of the SYG 1 protein family in fungi, Caenorhabditis elegans, flies, and mammals. SHB 1 gain-of-function enhances endosperm proliferation, increases seed size, and up-regulates the expression of the WRKY transcription factor gene MINISEED 3 (MINI 3) and the LRR receptor kinase gene HAIKU 2 (IKU 2). Mutations in either IKU 2 or MINI 3 retard endosperm proliferation and reduce seed size. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of the <b>seed</b> <b>cavity</b> and hence the seed size remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the expression of MINI 3 and IKU 2 is repressed before fertilization and after 4 days after pollination (DAP), but is activated by SHB 1 from 2 to 4 DAP prior to the formation of the <b>seed</b> <b>cavity.</b> SHB 1 associates with their promoters but without a recognizable DNA binding motif, and this association is abolished in mini 3 mutant. MINI 3 binds to W-boxes in, and recruits SHB 1 to, its own and IKU 2 promoters. Interestingly, SHB 1, but not MINI 3, activates transcription of pMINI 3 ::GUS or pIKU 2 ::GUS. We reveal a critical developmental switch through the activation of MINI 3 expression by SHB 1. The recruitment of SHB 1 by MINI 3 to its own and IKU 2 promoters represents a novel two-step amplification to counter the low expression level of IKU 2, which is a trigger for endosperm proliferation and <b>seed</b> <b>cavity</b> enlargement...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Fraxinus {{americana}} L. and F. pennsylvanica {{were introduced}} 100 {{years ago in}} forest management in the lowland regions of Croatia to afforestation sites where the native narrow-leaved ash could not survive. These species are not distinguished in the practice in Croatia. The aim of the article was to determine distinguishing traits between these introduced North American ash species based on morphological traits of samaras. Reliable determination is the necessary precondition for successful forest management of plantations of these two species. Materials and Methods: Samaras were collected from 50 trees in Croatian plantations on 5 localities (Karlovac, Dugo Selo, Đurđevac, Batina, Gunja), and from 3 voucher trees of F. americana and from 1 voucher tree of F. pennsylvanica. The following traits were measured: length of samara, length and width of samara wing, length and width of <b>seed</b> <b>cavity,</b> {{and the length of}} wing along the cavity. The results were evaluated using UPGMA method of cluster analysis with Euclidean distance (DE). Results: The most variable trait was absolute length of wing along <b>seed</b> <b>cavity</b> with coefficient variability (CV) from 8. 38 % to 23. 41 %, while the least variable trait was the ratio between the length of <b>seed</b> <b>cavity</b> and the length of samara (CV= 3. 64 – 7. 84 %). Samaras from Croatian plantations showed similarity with F. pennsylvanica. Cluster analysis separated voucher trees of F. americana from trees from Croatian plantations of North American ash species, while the tree of F. pennsylvanica fitted among the trees from Croatian plantations.

Because Fsc 1 and Fsc 2 are not easily distinguished morphologically, we developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid identification. Taxon-specific primers were designed from translation elongation factor 1 -alpha sequences. Because clean seed is critical for disease control, we conducted experiments to determine if we could predict whether seed would be infected based on a visual rating of the fruit at harvest.
