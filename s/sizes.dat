40|$|Environmental {{variation}} along altitudinal gradients {{can promote}} life-history trait differentiation in ectothermic animals. Life-history theory predicts that increased environmental stress {{results in a}} shift in reproductive allocation from offspring quantity to quality and a stronger trade-off between egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size.</b> To test this prediction, we investigated patterns of variation in life-history traits (i. e. age, body <b>size,</b> clutch <b>size</b> and egg <b>size)</b> among four populations of Bufo andrewsi from Baoxing County, western China, at different altitudes. We found that body <b>size,</b> age, egg <b>size</b> and total reproductive output, but not clutch <b>size,</b> differed between populations. Clutch <b>size</b> and total reproductive output increased with female <b>size</b> and age. However, egg <b>size</b> decreased with female <b>size</b> and did not change with female age. The egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size</b> trade-off was evident for all populations except at lowest altitude, {{and the strength of}} trade-off between egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size</b> increased with altitude. Our findings suggest that environmental constraints at high altitude select for investment in larger eggs at a cost of offspring number...|$|R

5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small <b>sizes</b> more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text <b>sizes.</b> In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three <b>sizes</b> of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller <b>sizes.</b>|$|E

Identifying the factors that limit group <b>size</b> is therefore fundamental for a complete understanding of social behavior.

The <b>size</b> of the largest (breeding) female and the minimum <b>size</b> difference required for hierarchy stability strongly but not perfectly predicted maximum group <b>size,</b> suggesting that social conflicts and hierarchy structure set the upper limit on group <b>size.</b> Deviations in group <b>size</b> around the predicted maximum were explained by variation in average body <b>size</b> ratios but not by variation in coral <b>size,</b> suggesting that coral <b>size</b> does not directly influence group <b>size.</b> In contrast, coral <b>size</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} body <b>size</b> ratios, and possible explanations for this relationship are discussed. Group <b>size</b> may be limited by the social conflicts that characterize size-based dominance hierarchies.

40|$|The {{development}} of the perception of <b>size</b> is currently interpreted as the {{development of}} <b>size</b> constancy. Using data from prior studies, this paper reports a functional measurement analysis of the perceived <b>size</b> of rectangles located on a frontal plane.

While <b>size</b> constancy may change during childhood with the ability to use cues of <b>size</b> and distance, it is proposed that the extent of <b>size</b> isomorphism may change with age given change with age in the neural representation of perceived length and in the working parameters of the neural mechanism which generates perceived length.

40|$|<b>Size</b> labels {{adopted by}} food vendors {{can have a}} major impact on <b>size</b> {{judgments}} and consumption. In forming <b>size</b> judgments, consumers integrate the actual <b>size</b> information from the stimuli with the semantic cue from the <b>size</b> label. <b>Size</b> labels influence not only <b>size</b> perception and actual consumption, they also affect perceived consumption. <b>Size</b> labels can also result in relative perceived <b>size</b> reversals, so that consumers deem a smaller package to be bigger than a larger one. Further, consumers are more likely to believe a label that professes an item to be smaller (vs. larger) in the <b>size</b> range associated with that item. This asymmetric effect of <b>size</b> labels can result in larger consumption without the consumer even being aware of it (“guiltless gluttony”). ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the correlations among breast <b>size,</b> brassiere cup <b>size,</b> and moment-in-time reporting of shoulderneck pain in a group of adult women. Three hundred thirty nine female volunteers from the hospital staff answered the questionnaire.

The relationship among breast <b>size,</b> brassiere cup <b>size</b> and shoulder-neck pain was investigated.
