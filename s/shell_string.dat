Ribbed latticed <b>shell</b> <b>string</b> {{structure with}} a span of 100 m is taken as an example and the modal analysis is performed. The effects of the rises of radial cables and the curvatures of latticed shell on dynamic characteristics of this structure are also investigated.

40|$|AbstractCell–tissue–tissue {{interaction}} {{is determined by}} specific short range forces between cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and ligands of the tissue, long range repulsion forces mediated by cell surface grafted macromolecules and adhesion-induced elastic stresses in the cell envelope. This interplay of forces triggers the rapid random clustering of tightly coupled linkers. By coupling of actin gel patches to the intracellular domains of the CAMs, these clusters can grow in a secondary process resulting {{in the formation of}} functional adhesion microdomains (ADs). The ADs can act as biochemical steering centers by recruiting and activating functional proteins, such as GTPases and associated regulating proteins, through electrostatic–hydrophobic forces with cationic lipid domains that act as attractive centers. First, I summarize physical concepts of cell adhesion revealed by studies of biomimetic systems. Then I describe the role of the adhesion domains as biochemical signaling platforms and force transmission centers promoting cellular protrusions, in terms of a <b>shell</b> <b>string</b> model of cells. Protrusion forces are generated by actin gelation triggered by molecular machines (focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src-kinases and associated adaptors) which assemble around newly formed integrin clusters. They recruit and activate the GTPases Rac- 1 and actin gelation promoters to charged membrane domains via electrostatic–hydrophobic forces. The cell front is pushed forward in a cyclic and stepwise manner and the step-width is determined by the dynamics antagonistic interplay between Rac- 1 and RhoA. The global cell polarization in the direction of motion is mediated by the actin–microtubule (MT) crosstalk at adhesion domains. Supramolecular actin–MT assemblies at the front help to promote actin polymerization. At the rear they regulate the dismantling of the ADs through the Ca++-mediated activation of the protease calpain and trigger their disruption by RhoA mediated contraction via stress fibers.

We prove the consistency of our prescription by explicitly evaluating the renormalizations of the two, three and four-gluon amplitudes, and showing that they obey the appropriate Ward identities. The field theory limit thus performed corresponds to the background field method in Feynman gauge. We identify precisely the regions in string moduli space that correspond to different classes of Feynman diagrams, and in particular we show how to isolate contributions to the effective action. Ultraviolet divergent terms are then encoded in a single string integral over the modular parameter ø. Finally, we derive a multiloop expression for the effective action by computing the partition function of an open bosonic string interacting with an external non-abelian background gauge field. e-mail: DIVECCHI [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Line {{singularities}} including cosmic strings may {{be screened}} by photonic shells until they {{appear as a}} planar wall. KEY WORDS: Levi-Civita spacetime, photonic shells. Infinitely thin static photonic shells composed of equal amounts of oppositely moving photons following circular, helical or axial trajectories around a cosmic string [1] and, around a general line singularity [2] have recently been found. In this paper, we will find solutions giving multiple photonic shells around a line singularity. Multiple photonic <b>shells</b> around cosmic <b>strings</b> will be obtained as a limiting case. We will show that the exterior region of the (multiple) shells may become an infinite plane wall. The vacuum spacetime exterior to a static, cylindrically symmetric source is described by the Levi-Civita metric [3] which can be written as: ds 2 = −ρ 4 σ dt 2 + ρ 4 σ(2 σ− 1) (dρ 2 + P 2 dz 2) + Q 2 ρ 2 (1 − 2 σ) dφ 2 where t, ρ, z and φ are the time, the radial, the axial and the angular variables of the cylindrical coordinates with ranges − ∞ < t, z < ∞, 0 ≤ ρ < ∞ and 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2 π. σ, P and Q are real constants.

40|$|Many viruses have a {{symmetrical}} structure made from basic building blocks, and biologists {{have struggled to}} {{explain some of the}} more detailed shapes. Now, mathematicians are using complex theories of symmetry to reveal these viral structures, ultimately leading to new treatments for diseases. Viruses are responsible for a variety of illnesses, ranging from the common cold to more serious conditions such as AIDS and some types of cancer, but their methods of infection are always similar. Once a virus has entered a host’s body, it hijacks the replicating mechanisms within the host’s cells and starts pumping out copies of itself. Viruses can only do this by concealing their genomic material within a protein shell, or capsid, which allows them to slip inside the host’s body like a Trojan horse. These capsid shells often have complex {{symmetrical structure}}s, so mathematicians are investigating their shapes in the hope of discovering new treatments for viral infections. A virus is essentially just a short string of DNA (or RNA, a related molecule) wrapped inside a capsid <b>shell,</b> and longer <b>strings</b> of genomic material require a larger shell to hold them. This creates a problem because the genomic material must describe the entire virus, including the capsid, and a larger shell in turn requires a longer string of DNA or RNA. Francis Crick and James Watson, the biologists who also discovered the structure of DNA, suggested in 1956 that symmetrical capsids provide a solution as they can be constructed from just a few basic building blocks. This means the genomic material of a symmetrical virus can be much smaller, because it simply needs to describe small sections of the capsid and instructions for repeating them in a symmetrical pattern. It was later found that many viruses use icosahedral symmetry to compact their genome, as their capsids resemble a shape made from 20 triangular faces called an icosahedron. It can be rotated in 60 different ways and still appear to be the same – in other words, it has 60 axes of symmetry. “Modelling the structure of viruses could have enormous ramifications for drug design and the development of new treatments. ” Although this model works well for small viruses with 60 proteins, it cannot explain the structures of larger capsids, suggesting there is a more intricate pattern at work...|$|R
