40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the dynamic {{response}} of the induction machine to low-frequency perturbations in the shaft torque, supply voltage and supply frequency. Also the response of a two-machine group connected to a weak grid is investigated. The results predicted by various induction machine models are compared with measurements performed on a laboratory set-up. Furthermore, the influence of machine and grid parameters, machine temperature, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect, saturation level and operating points is studied. The results predicted by the fifth-order non-linear Park model agree well with the measured induction machine responses to shaft torque, supply frequency and voltage magnitude perturbations. To determine the electric power response to very low-frequency perturbations in {{the magnitude of the}} supply voltage, the Park model must be modified to take varying iron losses into account. The temperature and supply frequency affect the low-frequency dynamics of the induction machine significantly while the influence of saturation, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect and <b>static</b> <b>shaft</b> torque is of less importance to an ordinary industrial machine. The <b>static</b> <b>shaft</b> torque is, however, of importance for determining the responses to voltage magnitude perturbations. The performance of reduced-order induction machine models depends on the type of induction machine investigated. Best suited to be represented by reduced-order models are high-slip machines as well as machines that have a low ratio between the stator resistance and leakage reactances. A first-order model can predict the rotor speed, electrodynamic torque and electric power responses to shaft torque and supply frequency perturbations up to a perturbation frequency of at least 1 Hz. A second-order model can determine the same responses also for higher perturbation frequencies, at least up to 3 Hz. Using a third-order model, all the responses to torque and frequency perturbations as well as the reactive power response to voltage magnitude perturbations can be determined up to at least 10 Hz...|$|E

This is a large capacity single machine operated in dual mode (i. e., motor or generator) {{with the help of}} static sources. It is well known that bearings of the rotating machines are vulnerable to the effects of the shaft voltages caused by the <b>static</b> sources. <b>Shaft</b> voltage is the prime concern for this special machine too due to SES.

40|$|AbstractThe tail {{drive shaft}} (TDS) of a {{helicopter}} is vital component {{which is responsible for}} its stability, is often prone to impact damage during combat and is damaged. Usually when the {{tail drive shaft}} is damaged, it is replaced during maintenance. But during the time of conflict, the replacement shaft may not always be available. Hence the damaged shaft is patched by a repair technique known as adhesively bonded repair technique or Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) technique. In this study, finite element analysis is carried out on the undamaged, damaged, and the patched model of the tail drive shaft, which determines that the deformation, stress and strain in the patched model of the shaft is reduced. Thus, the adhesively bonded repair is an emergency technique that is used to regain the <b>static</b> strength <b>shaft.</b> Mechanical characterization of Kevlar/Epoxy composite material is carried out to choose the apt lay-up sequence for the patch by evaluating its mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} of fitting the {{inlet guide vanes}} at the {{entrance}} of centrifugal fan impeller is to resolve the non uniformity of the flow and {{to get rid of the}} vortices that are generated by the existence of inlet distortion. The main purpose of this work is to evaluate the use of the inlet guide vanes (IGV) made of sheet metal and fiber reinforced plastic to improve the fan performance and saving of energy. For this purpose the ring of blades in radial direction i. e. Radial cascade, with different exit blade angles of impellers is used. Comparison with free inlet (without IGV) fans is performed.

50|$|Dynamic spine {{is largely}} {{determined}} by shaft length, head weight, and static spine. Static spine is the stiffness {{of the center}} portion of the <b>shaft</b> under <b>static</b> conditions. The Archery Trade Association (ATA) (formerly the Archery Manufacturers and Merchants Organization (AMO)) static spine test method hangs a 2 lb weight {{from the center of}} a 26 in suspended section of the arrow shaft. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F2031-05 ("Standard Test Method for Measurement of Arrow <b>Shaft</b> <b>Static</b> Spine (Stiffness)") hangs an 880 g weight from the center of a 28 in suspended section of the arrow shaft. The (obsolete) British Grand National Archery Society (GNAS) system used a 1.5 lb weight and a variable length with the arrow supported just behind the head and {{just in front of the}} nock. Because of this, GNAS cannot be directly converted to ATA or ASTM.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Critical {{response}} of seawater pump impeller shaft structure to various exciting loads {{is a fundamental}} factor in re-designing of the structure after its functional failure. In this paper, a typical case of the shaft structure's failure is investigated for re-designing purposes. Failure causes of interest are excessive bending moment, fatigue loads and dynamic resonance due to relevant motor rotation and unbalancing of the rotation loads. <b>Static</b> analyses of <b>shaft</b> structure under the conditions of concerned loads are carried out, followed by a dynamic investigation {{of the effects of}} resonance between the shaft and the motor on the structure. The relevant structural analyses are carried out using the Finite Element Methods combined with ANSYS code. Based on these, the primary cause for the shaft's structural failure is obtained. It is found that the change of the bending stiffness of the shaft is the primary concern in the re-designing process. A guideline for the re-design process of the seawater pump shaft structure is established, and a re-design scheme of the structure is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A drive shaft, {{also known}} as a {{propeller}} shaft or cardan shaft, it is a mechanical part that transmits the torque generated by a vehicle's engine into usable motive force to propel the vehicle. Now a day’s two piece steel shaft are mostly used as a drive shaft. The two-piece steel drive shaft consists of three universal joints, a center supporting bearing and a bracket, which increases the total weight of an automotive vehicle and decreases fuel efficiency. This work deals with the replacement of conventional two piece steel drive shafts with a one piece Hybrid Aluminum E glass/epoxy composite drive shaft for an automotive application. The basic requirements considered here are torsional strength, torsional buckling and bending natural frequency. A hybrid of Aluminum and E-glass/epoxy as in which the aluminum has a role to transmit the required torque, while the E-Glass epoxy composite increases the bending natural frequency. An experimental study was carried out to study the static torsion capability. Four cases were studied using aluminum tube wounded by different layers of composite materials. Results obtained from this study show that increasing the number of layers would enhance the maximum static torsion approximately 66 % for [+ 45 /- 45] 3 s laminates higher than the pure aluminum and mass reduction of 42 % compared with of steel drive shaft. A one-piece hybrid composite full drive shaft is optimally analyzed using Finite Element Analysis Software and simulation results were compared with the existing steel drive shaft.

40|$|In the dual-axis {{rotation}} {{inertial navigation}} system (INS), besides the gyro error, accelerometer error, rolling misalignment angle error, and the gimbal angle error, the shaft swing angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle also affect the attitude accuracy. Through {{the analysis of the}} structure, we can see that the shaft swing angle and axis non-orthogonal angle will produce coning errors which cause the fluctuation of the attitude. According to the analysis of the rotation vector, {{it can be seen that}} the coning error will generate additional drift velocity along the rotating shaft, which can reduce the navigation precision of the system. In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the shaft swing angle and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the <b>static</b> condition, the <b>shaft</b> swing angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF). This kind of KF method has been widely recognized as the standard optimal estimation tool for estimating the parameters such as coning angles (α 1, α 2), initial phase angles (ϕ 1,ϕ 2), and the non-perpendicular angle (η). In order to carry out the system level verification, a dual axis rotation INS is designed. Through simulation and experiments, the results show that the amplitudes of the attitude angles’ variation are reduced by about 20 %– 30 % when the shaft rotates. The attitude error equation is reasonably simplified and the calibration method is accurate enough. The attitude accuracy is further improved...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles use a powertrain architecture that includes components of traditional powertrains such as internal combustion engines and transmissions, {{as well as}} components found in battery {{electric vehicles}}. The combination of both technologies enables vehicles to drive emission free, when using the battery as the energy source, while also providing the typical long driving range offered by traditional combustion engines using liquid fuel as the energy source. The goal {{of this study is}} to contribute to the design and analysis of machine elements and components used in a series plug-in hybrid vehicle. This vehicle was built for the University of Washington’s team that competes in the EcoCAR 3 Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition. A motorcycle combustion engine was used in the generator system of the vehicle, and a CAE software GT-Power model was used to analyze the engine’s fuel efficiency. Approximations and estimations of model parameters were used to predict the fluid dynamics, combustion process, energy conversion and heat transfer occurring in the engine. Speed and engine load are varied over a broad range to establish a map for brake specific fuel consumption which is data of value for the development of an optimal generator control strategy. The electric drivetrain used in the series hybrid involves single speed reduction gearboxes between motors and drive <b>shafts.</b> <b>Static</b> and fatigue strength analysis is performed to evaluate the strength of an undersized gearbox part for the re-specification of the material and heat treatment used to increase the part’s strength to an acceptable level. The increased number of powertrain components used in hybrid vehicles, particularly the electric battery, lead to an increased vehicle rear mass. This is accommodated for in the analysis of the vehicle’s rear suspension and the design of a new set of coil springs...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} heat {{transfer}} measurements {{made on a}} rotating test rig representing the internal disc-cone cavity of a gas turbine high-pressure (H. P.) compressor stack. Tests were carried out {{for a range of}} flow rates and rotational speeds at engine representative nondimensional conditions. The rig also had a central drive shaft, which could rotate {{in the same direction as}} the discs, contrarotate relative to the discs, or remain static. Measurements of heat transfer were obtained from a conduction solution method using measured surface temperatures as boundary conditions. Results from the outer surface of the cone are in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions for the heat transfer from a free cone in turbulent flow. The heat transfer measurements from the inner surface of the cone reveal two regimes of heat transfer: one governed by rotation, the other by action of the throughflow. In the rotationally dominated regime, the heat transfer from the inner surface of the cone is higher for a co-rotating shaft than for either a <b>static</b> or contra-rotating <b>shaft.</b> In the throughflow-dominated regime the heat transfer shows little consistent dependence on the direction of shaft rotation. Tests carried out at different values of surface-to-fluid temperature difference add support to the hypothesis that in the rotationally dominated regime the heat transfer occurs through a process of free convection, where the buoyancy force is induced by rotation. The heat transfer from the disc is significantly lower than that from the inner surface of the cone and more or less insensitive to the sense of shaft rotation. The disc average Nusselt numbers show similar behavior to those from the inner surface of the cone and suggest that the disc heat transfer too is governed either by rotationally induced buoyancy or by the axial throughflow...|$|R

A study indicated that the most desirable type of blower drive turbine is one using main turbine throttie steam conditions and exhausting to the main turbine cross-over line. Preliminary planning for the initiation of a dynamic structural analyses of the overall steam generator was completed. External pressure loading and thermal stress calculations show that the calandria has a suitable design margin. A revised fuel latch operable from the rear face of the core was designed. A study was initiated to determine the feasibility of substituting Zircaloy for the stainless steel tubing within the active core. Preliminary sizing of control rod extensions and gang plates was completed. Initial loading of the second configuration of the 630 A critical experiment reactor was completed. Detailed power distributions were measured in the 11 typical positions. Subcritical and critical rod worth curves were obtained in the critical experiment with up to 132 shim rods in the core. Moderator temperature coefficient measurements were made and agreed well with analytical data. Critical experiment correlation of fine radial power calculations in the revised mock-up showed good agreement. Performance specifications were prepared for a 1 -Mw(e) power plant. Parametric thermal analyses, based on various tube sheet thicknesses and heating rates, were completed for {{the top and bottom}} tube sheets. The shield plug was redesigned to accommodate additional shim rods and to facilitate fabrication and moderator flow adjustments. Calculations of the operating and shutdown dose at the nuclear sensor location was started. Studies were performed to determine the size of the port openings needed to prevent buckling in the containmert vessel in the event of ship sinking. A blower <b>shaft</b> <b>static</b> seal was built and tested with satisfactory results. Manufacture and procurement of all parts for two developmental dynamic rod actuators were completed. The two-tube boiler was modified and operated satisfactorily on automatic control down to 20 percent power. A reactor control system that meets response and accuracy requirements was simulated on the analog computer. Investigation of a possible test site for power testing the prototype reactor was continued with cost estimates and a facility layout drawing being made for the IET facility at ITS. Specimen ORF- 4 was removed from test after 4800 hours of actual operation at 1300 deg F, equivalent to approximately 15, 000 hours of full- power 630 A operation. An estimated 40 percent burnup of the /sup 235 /U atoms occurred. Creep tests on warm-finished fuel sheet have accumulated more than 12, 000 hours at 630 A stress and temperature conditions with no greater than 0. 75 percent plastic creep.
