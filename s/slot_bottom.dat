40|$|In all {{manufacturing}} processes there are tolerances; however, orthodontic bracket manufacturers seldom state the slot dimensional tolerances. This experiment develops a novel method of analyzing slot profile dimensions using {{photographs of the}} slot. Five points are selected along each wall, and lines are fitted to define a trapezoidal slot shape. This investigation measures slot height at the slot&# 39;s top and bottom, angles between walls, slot taper, and the linearity of each wall. Slot dimensions for 30 upper right central incisor self-ligating stainless steel brackets from three manufacturers were evaluated. Speed brackets have a slot height 2 &# 37; smaller than the nominal 0. 559 &#x 2009;mm size and have a slightly convergent taper. In-Ovation brackets have a divergent taper at an average angle of 1. 47 degrees. In-Ovation is closest to the nominal value of slot height at the slot base and has the smallest manufacturing tolerances. Damon Q brackets are the most rectangular in shape, with nearly 90 -degree corners between the <b>slot</b> <b>bottom</b> and walls. Damon slot height is on average 3 &# 37; oversized...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} design of a compact multi-layer layer, high selectivity wideband bandpass filter using stub loaded and `U' shaped resonators over a <b>slotted</b> <b>bottom</b> ground plane. While the resonators with folded open circuit stub loadings create the desired bandpass characteristics. the IT shaped resonators {{reduce the size of}} filter. The <b>slotted</b> <b>bottom</b> ground plane is used to enhance the coupling to achieve the desired bandwidth. The proposed filter has been analyzed using circuit model, and the results were verified through full wave simulations and measurements. The fabricated filter is compact and measures a size of 18 mm x 25 mm x 1. 6 MM. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Micro-EDM milling is an {{effective}} machining process for three-dimension (3 D) micro-cavity of high hardness materials. Because of the sharp wear of the electrode, fix-length compensation method is proposed, thus results in a cone-shaped electrode. This compensation method can produce a slot with stable depth and conic cross-section. Because of layer by layer strategy in micro structure machining, the challenge for fix-length compensation method {{is to keep the}} whole process repeating continuously. This paper gives a double layers’ machining strategy {{in order to maintain the}} repeated machining for layer units. A concept of equivalent plane is proposed in order to construct a curved surface that can use fix-length compensation method. Then a simplified triangle model is presented in order to get corresponding algorithm for the compensation length of the second slot. Experiment results showed that the error of the compensation length was within 2 μm. A simulation about the influence of the curved surface's fluctuation on the profile of the machined <b>slot</b> <b>bottom</b> of next layer was performed with Matlab. Simulation results showed that the influence was limited. An experiment of two layers’ machining with proposed strategy and algorithm was conducted. The evenness of the machined surface with depth of 66 μm was within 4 μm. Therefore, fix-length compensation method can be used to machining 3 D cavity. status: publishe...|$|E
