40|$|A new, {{simple and}} {{fit for purpose}} method based on liquid {{chromatography}} with UV spectrophotometric detection and post-column derivatisation (LC-UV-PCD) for the determination of <b>semduramicin</b> in poultry compound feed, premixtures and feed additive {{as well as its}} discrimination from other coccidiostats in poultry compound feed has been developed and single-laboratory validated. The concentration levels of the target analyte at which the validation experiments have been carried out varied between 12. 8 and 51. 3 mg kg− 1 in compound feed, covering the authorised levels of <b>semduramicin</b> according to European Union legislation. Furthermore, the method has been validated for a premixture sample containing <b>semduramicin</b> at 3 g kg− 1 and the feed additive containing <b>semduramicin</b> at 51 g kg− 1. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats with acetonitrile from the feed samples followed by a filtration of the supernatants. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. When analysing the feed additive and the premixture samples, the extraction solution was appropriately diluted prior to LC-UV-PCD analysis. The analytes were quantified through an external calibration curve prepared with pure <b>semduramicin</b> standards. The relative standard deviations for repeatability and for intermediate precision varied from 2. 4 to 8. 8 % and from 2. 6 to 8. 8 %, respectively, and the values for the relative recovery rate ranged from 89 to 95 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were estimated to be below 1 mg kg− 1 and 3 mg kg− 1, respectively. Moreover, the results showed a comparable performance profile, when using methyl isobutyl ketone instead of acetonitrile as extraction solvent. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for the determination of <b>semduramicin</b> in poultry compound feed at authorised level, in premixtures and in the feed additive, hence allowing the enforcement of the European Union legislation regarding the control and the monitoring in feedingstuffs.

40|$|A novel liquid {{chromatography}} single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC¿MS) method for {{the determination of}} the feed additive <b>semduramicin,</b> in poultry feed, was developed and single-laboratory validated. This work was selected as a real case scenario to outline the different steps that may be needed whenever the standardisation of an analytical method in the field of methods of analysis for animal feedingstuffs is attempted. In this manuscript the main achievements reached within the development and the singlelaboratory validation of an analytical method for the determination of <b>semduramicin</b> in feedingstuffs are detailed. <b>Semduramicin</b> is extracted from the feedingstuffs with acetonitrile. The obtained extracts are then filtered and diluted appropriately. The separation has been carried out in a reverse phase C 18 column using isocratic elution with a mixture of methanol and 20 mM ammonium formate solution as mobile phase. The ammonium adducts have been selected for monitoring the coccidiostats signals in the mass spectrometry detector. The method has been successfully validated for the determination of <b>semduramicin</b> concentrations ranging between half of the minimum authorized concentration (10 mgkg- 1) to twice of the maximum authorized concentration (50 mgkg- 1). Agood relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) varying from 2. 8 to 3. 2 % has been obtained whereas the relative standard deviation for intermediate precision (RSDInt.) ranged from 3. 7 to 7. 3 %. The obtained analytical performance characteristics of the method demonstrated its fitness for the purpose, making thus the proposed method suitable to be submitted for the last phase within the standardisation procedure, i. e. the inter-laboratory study.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method based on HPLC with postcolumn derivatization and spectrophotometric detection for the quantification of <b>semduramicin</b> in poultry feedingstuffs have been determined via a collaborative study. <b>Semduramicin</b> is a feed additive that is authorized for fattening chickens within the European Union at a minimum and maximum content of 20 and 25 mg/kg in feedingstuffs, respectively. The target concentration of <b>semduramicin</b> in the test samples ranged from 11. 5 to 45. 0 mg/kg. The study has been conducted with {{two different types of}} test material, namely, feedingstuff samples that have been previously ground in our laboratory and pelleted feedingstuffs. In the latter case, the laboratories participating in the study had to grind the samples prior to analysis. The obtained RSD for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2 to 10 % for the ground materials, and from 2 and 7 % for the pelleted materials. The RSD for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 11 and 16 % for the ground materials, and between 12 and 15 % for the pelleted materials. These data indicated that grinding as an additional step in the analytical procedure did not influence the precision profile of the method. In addition, the HorRat values for all test materials were below or equal to 1. 5, thus demonstrating that the obtained precision data were acceptable for the purpose of the method. Furthermore, an estimation of trueness based on statistical treatment of the results reported from the laboratories for spiked samples revealed acceptable mean recovery values of 88 ± 4 %. Based on the obtained performance profile, the method can be considered fully validated and transferable to control laboratories to be used within the framework of official control. JRC.

Each bird was inoculated with a well-characterized strain of serotype Typhimurium DT 104 on day 10. On day 49, the birds were euthanatized humanely. Bulk fecal samples were collected on days 13, 43, and 48 and were examined for organisms which had acquired resistance.

The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For calf feed an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for maduramicin ammonium alpha and <b>semduramicin</b> sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix.

40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, lasalocid sodium, salinomycin, narasin, maduramicin and <b>semduramicin)</b> or non-ionophoric (robenidine, decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|E

The concentration level of the target analytes at which the validation experiments {{have been carried out}} varied between 1 and 9 mg kg. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by a clean-up by solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified either by matrix matched standards or by the standard addition technique, obtaining the following performance profile of the method for the various analyte/matrix combinations. When quantifying against matrix matched standards, the concentration independent intermediate precision expressed in terms of relative percentage standard deviation varied between 4 and 10 % and the relative percentage recovery rates ranged from 87 to 120 % depending on the target analyte and matrix. When using the standard addition technique, the corresponding values for the intermediate precision varied between 2 and 8 % and the relative percentage recovery rate ranged from 73 to 115 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix combinations but were in all cases below 0. 014 mg kg and 0. 046 mg kg respectively. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for {{the determination of}} ionophore coccidiostats in target feed. The main field of application of the validated method is to enforce European legislation regarding the authorisation of coccidiostats, focusing on the measurement at the authorised levels and at low level in feed during the withdrawal period at which the coccidiostats must not be added to the feed. Overall, the method proposed appears to be appropriate as a confirmatory method for the monitoring of these six ionophore coccidiostats and can therefore be considered as complimentary to the official PHLC-UV methods.
