25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} pinions, generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> on the individual half-shafts. Each pinion pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the pinion pairs are displaced axially, such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two <b>spur</b> <b>gears,</b> and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given pinion meshes with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Therefore, each pinion couples that spur gear to the other pinion, and in turn, the other spur gear, {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a bevel-gear differential.|$|E

40|$|A {{vibration}} {{diagnostic system}} {{was used to}} detect <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> surface pitting fatigue in a closed-loop <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> fatigue test rig. The diagnostic system, comprising a personal computer with an analog-to-digital conversion board, a diagnostic system unit, and software, uses time-synchronous averaging of the vibration signal to produce a vibration image of each tooth on any gear in a transmission. Several parameters were analyzed including gear pair stress wave and raw baseband vibration, kurtosis, peak ratios, and others. The system provides limits for the various parameters and gives a warning when the limits are exceeded. Several <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> tests were conducted with this system and vibration data analyzed at 5 -min. intervals. The results presented herein show {{that the system is}} fairly effective at detecting <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> tooth surface fatigue pitting failures...|$|R

50|$|Gear {{pumps are}} also {{widely used in}} {{chemical}} installations to pump high viscosity fluids. There are two main variations; external gear pumps which use two external <b>spur</b> <b>gears,</b> and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). Gear pumps are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution. Some gear pumps are designed to function as either a motor or a pump.|$|E
50|$|The angled teeth engage more {{gradually}} than do {{spur gear}} teeth, {{causing them to}} run more smoothly and quietly. With parallel helical gears, each pair of teeth first make contact at a single point at {{one side of the}} gear wheel; a moving curve of contact then grows gradually across the tooth face to a maximum, then recedes until the teeth break contact at a single point on the opposite side. In <b>spur</b> <b>gears,</b> teeth suddenly meet at a line contact across their entire width, causing stress and noise. <b>Spur</b> <b>gears</b> make a characteristic whine at high speeds. For this reason <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> are used in low-speed applications and in situations where noise control is not a problem, and helical gears are used in high-speed applications, large power transmission, or where noise abatement is important. The speed is considered high when the pitch line velocity exceeds 25 m/s.|$|E
