40|$|This {{book for}} the first time {{examines}} periodic motions to chaos in time-delay systems, which exist extensively in engineering. For a long time, the stability of time-delay systems at equilibrium has been of great interest from the Lyapunov theory-based methods, where one cannot achieve the ideal results. Thus, time-delay discretization in time-delay systems was used for the stability of these systems. In this volume, Dr. Luo presents an accurate method based on the finite Fourier series to determine periodic motions in nonlinear time-delay systems. The stability and bifurcation of periodic motions are determined by the time-delayed <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> in the Fourier series and the method for nonlinear time-delay systems is equivalent to the Laplace transformation method for linear time-delay systems.

It is revealed in the article that one of the main ways to maintain prices at a competitive level is to decrease the share of transport and logistics component in the price and increase the delivery speed.
