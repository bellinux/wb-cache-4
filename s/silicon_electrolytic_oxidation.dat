The effect of plasma <b>electrolytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> treatment time on surface morphology and corrosion resistance of the oxide films was further investigated. The phase composition, surface morphology, thickness and elemental composition of the oxide films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The corrosion behavior of substrate and oxide films in simulated body fluid environment was studied by open circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization tests. The apatite forming ability of the oxide film was evaluated after immersing in simulated body fluid for 14 days. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the oxide films predominantly comprised of monoclinic zirconia {{with a small amount}} of tetragonal zirconia. With prolonging treatment time, phase transformation of tetragonal to monoclinic zirconia was observed. Scanning electron microscopy results show that for a treatment time of 2 – 8 min, uniform and highly dense oxide films, thickness varying from 3 to 14 μm with no obvious pores were formed and the phosphorous content in the films was found to be in the range of 2. 8 – 6. 8 at. %. Corrosion test results reveal that all oxide films improved their corrosion resistance especially in terms of pitting potential and showed superior passivity in simulated body fluid environment. Bioactivity test results confirm that plasma <b>electrolytic</b> <b>oxidation</b> treated zirconium was fully covered by apatite layer in simulated body fluid medium.
