25|$|Fentanyl {{lozenges}} (Actiq) are a solid {{formulation of}} fentanyl citrate {{on a stick}} {{in the form of}} a lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These lozenges are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain. It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial. The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge on a <b>stick</b> <b>swabbed</b> on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, and the rest is swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the mouth mucosa and 25 % via the gut).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Total knee {{arthroplasty}} {{represents a}} common orthopedic surgical procedure. Achieving proper alignment of its components with the predrilled patellar and tibial peg holes prior to polymerization {{of the bone}} cement can be challenging. Technique After establishing the femoral, patellar and tibial bone cuts, the cancellous bone around the tibial keel, {{as well as the}} peg holes for the patella and femoral components are marked with methylene blue using a cotton <b>swab</b> <b>stick.</b> If bone cement is then placed onto the cut and marked bone edges, the methylene blue leaches through the bone cement and clearly outlines the tibial keel and predrilled femoral and patellar peg holes. This allows excellent visualization of the bone preparations for each component, ensuring safe and prompt positioning of TKA components while minimizing intraoperative difficulties with component alignment while the cement hardens. Conclusion The presented technical note helps to improve the accuracy and ease of insertion when the components of total knee arthroplasty are impacted to their final position. </p...|$|R

40|$|The core {{objectives}} {{of the current study}} are to generate human DNA profiles from used lipsticks and blush sticks of various brands available in Pakistan. A total of 12 international and local brands of lipsticks and blush sticks were selected. The lipsticks and blush sticks were applied by twenty different healthy female volunteers of 21 - 30 years of age. The heads of used lipsticks and blush <b>sticks</b> were <b>swabbed</b> with dry sterile cotton swabs. The qualitative and quantitative analysis was done by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a Quantifiler® Duo DNA Quantification Kit on Real Time PCR ABI™ 7500. Samples were amplified for 16 STR loci using an AmpFlSTR® Identifiler® PCR amplification kit on Thermocycler ABI 9700. The amplified product was run on Applied Biosystems 3130 ™ Genetic Analyzer. The genetic profiles were analyzed on GeneMapper® ID-X software version 1. 0. The quantification results showed that the yield of DNA obtained from lipstick samples was greater than that of DNA obtained from blush stick samples. The real-time PCR results showed that only 16 % of cosmetic samples had shown inhibition. The DNA profiles obtained from all blush stick samples were of good quality compared to those from lipstick samples. No profile was obtained from one blush stick sample (DNA 0. 001 ng/μL) and four lipstick samples (DNA 0. 001 - 0. 003 ng/μL) because the amount of DNA in each of these samples was less than the amount required for successful amplification.

MethodsThirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile <b>swab</b> <b>sticks.</b> These samples were collected from two major dental clinics in Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) respectively and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile Mitis salivarius agar (MSA) plates and incubated as above. The isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. Tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. The plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum cidal concentration (MCC) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. Antibiotic sensitivity test was also carried out. The results were statistically analyzed. ResultsThe extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. Our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. The microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of S. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be Staphylococcus spp. The Gram reaction confirmed 13 Gram-negative and 18 Gram-positive organisms. The n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. MIC showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. The antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. ConclusionsSince the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (S. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that over 80 % of injury related deaths occur in low and middle-income Countries, including Tanzania. Alcohol and illicit drugs are major contributing factors leading to severe injuries by impairing motor and cognitive functions. In Tanzania, {{the use of}} alcohol and illicit drugs among injured patients {{has not yet been}} studied Objective: To describe the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use among injured patients presenting to the Emergency Medicine Department of Muhimbili National Hospital (EMD-MNH) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Materials and methods: This was a prospective descriptive cohort study of a consecutive convenience sample of patients aged 18 years and above presenting to the EMD-MNH with injury related complaints between October 2015 and November 2015. Structured data sheet was used to record demographic information, nature of injury, clinical presentation, alcohol and illicit drug test results, EMD outcome and disposition. Patients‟ alcohol level and illicit drug levels were tested by breathalyser device or <b>swab</b> <b>stick</b> alcohol test and 5 -multidrug panel check respectively. Patients were followed up for 24 hours and 30 days using ward-chats and phone call. We presents the descriptive statistics, sensitivity and specificity, and relative risk were used as appropriate. Results: We screened 1011 patients and we enrolled 143 (14. 1 %) patients who met our inclusion criteria. Most 123 (86 %) were male, and the median age was 30 years (IQR: 23 - 36). The most frequent mechanism of injury was road traffic accident 106 (74. 1 %) followed by assault 22 (15. 4 %). All 143 patients were tested for alcohol, while 122 were also tested for illicit drugs. 67 (47 %) of patients tested positive for alcohol. 44 (36. 1 %) of the 122 patients tested for illicit drugs, tested positive for drug(s). 29 (26. 1 %) of injured patients tested positive for both alcohol and illicit drug(s). The most frequently illicit drug was Marijuana 30 (68 %) of the positive illicit drugs tests. At 24 hours, 88 (61. 5 %) had underwent major surgery, 135 (94 %) were admitted, and 6 (4. 1 %) died. Among 53 patients with positive alcohol test 30 (57 %) denied the use of alcohol and among the 25 patients with positive illicit drug test, 22 (88 %) denied the use of substance abuse. At 30 viii days follow-up, 8 (5. 5 %) injured patients with positive test for alcohol and illicit drugs had died and 73 (54 %) had not yet returned to their baseline activities. Conclusion and recommendations: The prevalence of alcohol and illicit drugs is very high in patients presenting to the EMD-MNH with injury. Most patients who are affected are young males and the majority of the injured patients who had used drugs or alcohol before their injury had not returned to baseline functional level at 30 days post injury.
