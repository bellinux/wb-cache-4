40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of foreign market {{knowledge}} on innovative performance in emerging economy firms. We also study how this relationship is moderated by <b>country</b> <b>sales</b> breadth, i. e., the diversity of countries in which the firm derives sales. We test two competing theoretical perspectives on this relationship: diversity logic suggesting <b>country</b> <b>sales</b> breadth is beneficial to innovative performance, and time compression diseconomies logic suggesting the opposite. Drawing from a sample of 92 Chinese firms, we show that foreign market knowledge has a positive impact on innovative performance, and that this relationship is positively moderated by <b>country</b> <b>sales</b> breadth. Our study suggests that managers in Chinese firms develop effective capabilities in accessing, integrating and utilising foreign market knowledge from a breadth of international sources in their quest for innovation...|$|R

50|$|When {{goods or}} {{services}} are sold (and sent) to a private person across a border within the area, the buyer usually pays the <b>sales</b> <b>country's</b> VAT to the seller, and does not pay any VAT in the buyer's country. But if the seller's annual sales of goods to the buyer's country exceed a threshold (which varies by country), the seller must instead charge VAT in the buyer's country. These are known as the distance selling rules. When a private person visits another EU country and buys goods, the seller {{does not have to}} take special action, just claim the local VAT, and the buyer can bring it home for personal use or gifts without limits.The 2015 EU VAT legislation requires two non-conflicting pieces of evidence to be produced so as to determine what VAT rate should be applied to these digital goods sales.|$|R
