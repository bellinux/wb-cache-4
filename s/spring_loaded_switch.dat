A treadmill is equipped with a reversible motor controlling the velocity control of the treadmill itself. This provides a constant acceleration of the treadmill unless a subject-controlled, <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>switch</b> is depressed. If this switch is depressed, the treadmill decelerates at a constant rate. A subject is instructed to walk at maximum rate at all times, controlling the velocity of the treadmill with the switch.

40|$|Abstract Recently, a novel <b>switch</b> architecture, the <b>load</b> bal-anced (LB) <b>switch</b> {{proposed}} by C. S. Chang et al [1], [2] {{opened a new}} avenue for designing a large-capacity packet <b>switch.</b> The <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch</b> consists of two stages. First, a load-balancing stage spreads arriving packets equally among all linecards. Then, a forwarding stage transfers packets from the linecards to their nal output destination. The <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch</b> does not need any centralized scheduler and can achieve 100 % throughput under a broad class of trafc distributions. However, the <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch</b> may cause packets at the output port to be out of sequence. Several schemes have been proposed to tackle the out-of-sequence problem of the <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch.</b> However, they are either too complex to implement, or introduce a large additional delay. In this paper, we present a practical <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch,</b> called the Byte-Focal switch, which uses packet-by-packet scheduling to signicantly improve the delay performance over switches of comparable complexity.

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> rack and pinion. This <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in <b>spring</b> <b>loading.</b> The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint linkage <b>loaded</b> with linear <b>springs</b> or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there are <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> and some are restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length <b>load</b> <b>spring</b> with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) based {{resistive}} damping algorithm of power swing has been simulated. Based on the angle difference signal {{extracted from the}} PMU, a resistive <b>load</b> has been <b>switched</b> on and off to damp the oscillation. The simulation {{has been done in}} SIMPOW. Three phase faults were applied to obtain transient instabilities. These instabilities were characterized by ESPRIT method (frequency of oscillation, time constant) and were damped out by <b>load</b> <b>switching.</b> Besides the simulation, measurement with a PMU has been carried out in the Power System lab of the department. The angle difference signal derived from the PMU proved to be a reliable indicator of power swing. In the simulation voltage angle difference between two buses has been taken as an indicator for power swing and a resistive <b>load</b> is <b>switched</b> on when the derivative of this angle difference signal is positive. It has been found that resistive <b>load</b> <b>switching</b> with appropriate value improves both transient stability margin and damping of the power swing.
