5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian <b>stimulus,</b> others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for <b>stimulus</b> packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian <b>stimulus</b> does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal <b>stimulus</b> are particularly effective.|$|E

Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the <b>stimulus</b> package was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such <b>stimulus</b> in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the <b>stimulus</b> is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this <b>stimulus</b> are not frivolous, as the <b>stimulus</b> is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the claim that}} equivalence classes contain all positive elements in a reinforcement contingency by asking whether negative <b>stimuli</b> in a reinforcement contingency will also form an equivalence class, based on their shared function as S-minus <b>stimuli.</b> In Experiment 1, 5 subjects were tested for equivalence for positive and negative <b>stimuli.</b> Testing of positive <b>stimuli</b> preceded testing of negative <b>stimuli.</b> Two of five subjects demonstrated equivalence for positive <b>stimuli,</b> and three subjects demonstrated equivalence for negative <b>stimuli.</b> In Experiment 2, order of testing was reversed. Four of six subjects demonstrated equivalence for positive <b>stimuli,</b> and none demonstrated equivalence for negative <b>stimuli.</b> In Experiment 3, positive and negative <b>stimuli</b> were tested together. Only one of five subject demonstrated equivalence for positive and negative <b>stimuli.</b> These data suggest that negative <b>stimuli</b> may enter an equivalence class, and so Sidman paradigm should be expanded. Order of testing was found as a meaningful variable...|$|R
40|$|When {{switching}} tasks, occasionally {{responding to}} bivalent <b>stimuli</b> (i. e., <b>stimuli</b> with relevant features for two different tasks) slows performance on subsequent univalent <b>stimuli,</b> {{even when they}} do not share relevant features with bivalent <b>stimuli.</b> This performance slowing is labelled the bivalency effect here, we investigated whether the bivalency effect results from an orienting response to the infrequent <b>stimuli</b> (i. e., the bivalent <b>stimuli).</b> To this end, we compared the impact of responding to infrequent univalent <b>stimuli</b> to the impact of responding to infrequent bivalent <b>stimuli.</b> For the latter, the results showed a performance slowing for all trials following bivalent <b>stimuli.</b> This indicates a long-lasting bivalency effect, replicating previous findings. For infrequent univalent <b>stimuli,</b> however, the results showed a smaller and shorter-lived performance slowing. These results demonstrate that the bivalency effect does not simply reflect an orienting response to infrequent <b>stimuli.</b> Rather it results from the conflict induced by bivalent <b>stimuli,</b> probably by episodic binding with the more demanding context created by them...|$|R

These indude focal <b>stimuli,</b> contextual <b>stimuli,</b> and residual <b>stimuli.</b> Focal <b>stimuli</b> are those that immediately confront the individual in a particular situation.

50|$|More recently, {{research}} on the N1 has expanded into the processing of socially relevant <b>stimuli.</b> Attention is especially relevant to the processing of emotional <b>stimuli</b> because emotional <b>stimuli</b> (vs. unemotional <b>stimuli)</b> are believed to receive preferential attention and perceptual processing. ERP research has been useful in understanding how emotion relates to attention because the N1 provides a means of examining the significance of emotion in capturing attentional resources. Several studies, {{using a variety of}} paradigms, have found that emotional <b>stimuli</b> are influential in capturing attention. For example, in one study, both <b>stimuli</b> that were positively valenced (e.g., nude person of the opposite sex) and negatively valenced (e.g., snarling wolf) were shown to elicit greater N1 amplitudes than neutrally valenced (e.g., wrist watch) <b>stimuli.</b> Similarly, the valence of interpersonal <b>stimuli</b> has been found to influence the amplitude of the N1. Positive <b>stimuli</b> (e.g., smiling faces) and negative <b>stimuli</b> (e.g., sad faces) have been found to elicit a greater N1 than neutral <b>stimuli</b> (e.g., neutral faces). These findings support the claim that emotional <b>stimuli</b> are more effective in capturing attentional resources than non-emotional <b>stimuli.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{subliminal}} <b>stimuli,</b> researchers will often prime the participants with specific visual <b>stimuli,</b> often images, and determine if those <b>stimuli</b> elicit different responses. Subliminal <b>stimuli</b> has mostly been studied in the context of emotion, in particular, researchers have focused {{a lot of attention to}} the perception of faces and how subliminal presentation to different facial expression affects emotion. Visual subliminal <b>stimuli</b> has also been used to study emotion eliciting <b>stimuli</b> and simple geometric <b>stimuli.</b> A significant amount of research has been produced throughout the years to demonstrate the effects of subliminal visual <b>stimuli.</b>|$|R

To minimise wasteful firing, two types of <b>stimulus</b> are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact.

40|$|People {{obtain a}} lot of {{information}} from visual and auditory sensation on daily life. Regarding the effect of visual <b>stimuli</b> on perception of auditory <b>stimuli,</b> studies of phonological perception and sound localization have been made in great numbers. This study examined the effect of visual <b>stimuli</b> on perception in loudness and pitch of auditory <b>stimuli.</b> We used the image of figures whose size or brightness was changed as visual <b>stimuli,</b> and the sound of pure tone whose loudness or pitch was changed as auditory <b>stimuli.</b> Those visual and auditory <b>stimuli</b> were combined independently to make four types of audio-visual multisensory <b>stimuli</b> for psychophysical experiments. In the experiments, participants judged change in loudness or pitch of auditory <b>stimuli,</b> while they judged the direction of size change or the kind of a presented figure in visual <b>stimuli.</b> Therefore they cannot neglect visual <b>stimuli</b> while they judged auditory <b>stimuli.</b> As a result, perception in loudness and pitch were promoted significantly around their difference limen, when the image was getting bigger or brighter, compared with the case in which the image had no changes. This indicates that perception in loudness and pitch were affected by change in size and brightness of visual <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R
40|$|Six {{normally}} capable adults {{first learned}} three conditional relations {{in each of}} two prospective equivalence classes via match-to-sample training with figures as conditional (sample) and discriminative (comparison) <b>stimuli.</b> Then one trained conditional relation in each prospective class was brought {{under the control of}} contextual <b>stimuli,</b> two dictated nonsense syllables. Test performances indicated the emergence of untrained conditional relations, and therefore two equivalence classes, that were conditional on the contextual <b>stimuli.</b> These tests involved untrained combinations of contextual <b>stimuli</b> and <b>stimuli</b> in conditional relations, suggesting that the contextual <b>stimuli</b> functioned independently to control conditional relations rather than forming compound <b>stimuli</b> with samples and comparisons in training. Next, two novel figures were made equivalent to each of the original dictated contextual <b>stimuli</b> by match-to-sample training and testing. On subsequent tests, all subjects demonstrated transfer of conditional control of untrained conditional relations from the original auditory contextual <b>stimuli</b> to equivalent visual <b>stimuli.</b> These outcomes further supported the conclusion that the contextual <b>stimuli</b> exerted true conditional control over conditional relations in the equivalence classes and were not merely elements of compound <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{a series}} of 6 {{experiments}} (5 preregistered), we examined how not responding to appetitive <b>stimuli</b> causes devaluation. To examine this question, a go/no-go task was employed in which appetitive <b>stimuli</b> were consistently associated with cues to respond (go <b>stimuli),</b> or with cues to not respond (either no-go cues or the absence of cues; no-go <b>stimuli).</b> Change in evaluations of no-go <b>stimuli</b> was compared to change in evaluations of both go <b>stimuli</b> and of <b>stimuli</b> not presented in the task (untrained <b>stimuli).</b> Experiments 1 to 3 show that not responding to appetitive <b>stimuli</b> in a go/no-go task causes devaluation of these <b>stimuli</b> regardless {{of the presence of}} an explicit no-go cue. Experiments 4 a and 4 b show that the devaluation effect of appetitive <b>stimuli</b> is contingent on the percentage of no-go trials; devaluation appears when no-go trials are rare, but disappears when no-go trials are frequent. Experiment 5 shows that simply observing the go/no-go task does not lead to devaluation. Experiment 6 shows that not responding to neutral <b>stimuli</b> does not cause devaluation. Together, these results suggest that devaluation of appetitive <b>stimuli</b> by not responding to them is the result of response inhibition. By employing both go <b>stimuli</b> and untrained <b>stimuli</b> as baselines, alternative explanations are ruled out, and apparent inconsistencies in the literature are resolved. These experiments provide new theoretical insight into the relation between not responding and evaluation, and can be applied to design motor response training procedures aimed at changing people's behavior toward appetitive <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} a graph of threshold <b>stimulus</b> strength versus <b>stimulus</b> duration should show a decay toward zero as <b>stimulus</b> duration is increased, so the <b>stimulus</b> strength required to reach threshold is predicted to increase during more protracted stimulation. The strength-duration curve for a typical nerve membrane is slightly skewed from the predicted graph, in that the curve flattens out in response to repetitive stimulation reaching an asymptote representing rheobase. When the duration of a <b>stimulus</b> is prolonged, charge transfer and membrane potential rise exponentially to a plateau (instead of increasing linearly with time). When rheobase exceeds {{the strength of the}} <b>stimulus,</b> stimulation fails to generate action potentials (even with large values of t); thus if the <b>stimulus</b> is too small, the membrane potential never reaches threshold. The disparity between the shape of the strength-duration curve predicted by Weiss's equation and the one actually observed in neural membranes can be attributed to leakage of charge that occurs under physiological conditions, a feature of the electrical resistance of the membrane. Weiss' equation predicts the relationship between <b>stimulus</b> strength and duration for an ideal capacitor with no leakage resistance.|$|E
25|$|Breese {{first found}} that {{although}} observers {{could increase the}} time one rival <b>stimulus</b> was seen by attending to it, they could not increase the rate of that <b>stimulus.</b> Moreover, when he asked his observers to refrain from moving their eyes over the attended <b>stimulus,</b> control was abolished. When he asked observers specifically to move their eyes over one <b>stimulus,</b> that <b>stimulus</b> predominated in rivalry. He could also increase predominance of a <b>stimulus</b> by {{increasing the number of}} its contours, by moving it, by reducing its size, by making it brighter, and by contracting the muscles {{on the same side of}} the body as the eye viewing that <b>stimulus.</b> Breese also showed that rivalry occurs between afterimages. Breese also discovered the phenomenon of monocular rivalry: if the two rival stimuli are optically superimposed to the same eye and one fixates on the stimuli, then alternations in the clarity of the two stimuli are seen. Occasionally, one image disappears altogether, as in binocular rivalry, although this is much rarer than in binocular rivalry.|$|E
25|$|Despite this limitation, Weiss’s {{equation}} {{provides the}} best fit for strength-duration data and indicates that rheobase and time constant (chronaxie) can be measured from the charge duration curve with a very small margin of error. Weiss used rectangular, constant-current pulses and found that threshold charge required for stimulation increased linearly with pulse duration. He also found that <b>stimulus</b> charge, the product of <b>stimulus</b> current and <b>stimulus</b> duration is proportional to rheobase, so that only two <b>stimulus</b> durations are necessary to calculate rheobase.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of studies investigating responses of thalamocortical neurons to tactile <b>stimuli</b> {{have focused on}} the whisker representation of the rat thalamus: the ventral–posterior–medial nucleus (VPM). To test whether the basic properties of thalamocortical responses to tactile <b>stimuli</b> could be extended to the entire ventrobasal complex, we recorded single neurons from the whisker, forepaw and hindpaw thalamic representations. We performed a systematic analysis of responses to stereotyped tactile <b>stimuli</b> − 500 ms pulses (i. e. ON–OFF <b>stimuli)</b> or 1 ms pulses (i. e. impulsive <b>stimuli)</b> − under two different anesthetics (pentobarbital or urethane). We obtained the following main results: (i) the tuning of cells to ON vs. OFF <b>stimuli</b> displayed a gradient across neurons, so that two-thirds of cells responded more to ON <b>stimuli</b> and one-third responded more to OFF stimuli; (ii) on average, response magnitudes did not differ between ON and OFF <b>stimuli,</b> whereas latencies of response to OFF <b>stimuli</b> were a few milliseconds longer; (iii) latencies of response to ON and OFF <b>stimuli</b> were highly correlated; (iv) responses to impulsive <b>stimuli</b> and ON <b>stimuli</b> showed a strong correlation, whereas the relationship between the responses to impulsive <b>stimuli</b> and OFF <b>stimuli</b> was subtler; (v) unlike ON responses, OFF responses did not decrease when <b>stimuli</b> were moved from the receptive field center to a close location in the excitatory surround. We obtained the same results for hindpaw, forepaw and whisker neurons.

To investigate this, we performed six experiments in which participants switched between two tasks. In one task, incongruent <b>stimuli</b> appeared occasionally; in the other task, <b>stimuli</b> shared no feature with the incongruent trials.

Omissions of left-sided tactile <b>stimuli</b> were minimal at the longest SOA. Moreover, at 0 and 65 ms SOA omissions were significantly higher in unimodal than in cross-modal combinations. This figure indicates that detection of contralesional tactile <b>stimuli</b> is modulated over time both uni- and cross-modally. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
