50|$|In the {{classical}} sense, six gram-positive genera are typically pathogenic in humans. Two of these, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, are cocci (sphere-shaped). The remaining organisms are bacilli (rod-shaped) {{and can be}} subdivided based {{on their ability to}} form spores. The non-spore formers are Corynebacterium and Listeria (a coccobacillus), whereas Bacillus and Clostridium produce spores. The <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> can again be divided based on their respiration: Bacillus is a facultative anaerobe, while Clostridium is an obligate anaerobe. Also, Rathybacter, Leifsonia, and Clavibacter are three gram-positive genera that cause plant disease. Gram-positive bacteria are capable of causing serious and sometimes fatal infections in newborn infants.|$|E
50|$|Midichloria is a genus of Gram-negative, non <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria,</b> with {{bacillus}} shape around 0.45 µm {{in diameter}} and 1.2 µm in length. First described in 2004 with the temporary name IricES1, Midichloria species are symbionts of the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. They live in {{the cells of the}} ovary of the females of this tick species. These bacteria have been observed in the mitochondria of the host cells, a trait that has never been described in any other symbiont of animals. Midichloria bacteria seem to consume the mitochondria they parasitize, possibly using them as a source of energy and/or molecules to multiply. The interaction of these symbionts with their host is currently unknown, though the 100% prevalence in the females of the host tick seems to suggest a mutualistic association.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> are of {{particular}} concern {{in the context of}} planetary protection because their tough endospores may withstand certain sterilization procedures as well as the harsh environments of outer space or planetary surfaces. To test their hardiness on a hypothetical mission to Mars, spores of Bacillus subtilis 168 and Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 were exposed for 1.5 years to selected parameters of space. It was clearly shown that solar extraterrestrial UV radiation (λ ≥110 nm) as well as the Martian UV spectrum (λ ≥200 nm) was the most deleterious factor applied; in some samples only a few survivors were recovered from spores exposed in monolayers. Spores in multilayers survived better by several orders of magnitude. All other environmental parameters encountered did little harm to the spores, which showed about 50% survival or more. The data demonstrate the high chance of survival of spores on a Mars mission, if protected against solar irradiation. These results will have implications for planetary protection considerations.|$|E

5000|$|Soil steam {{sterilization}} (soil steaming) is a {{farming technique}} that sterilizes soil with steam in open fields or greenhouses. Pests of plant cultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced hot steam which causes their cell structure to physically degenerate. Biologically, {{the method is}} considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-resistant, <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> survive and revitalize the soil after cooling down. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances blocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker growth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the application of hot steam is considered {{the best and most}} effective way to disinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. It is being used as an alternative to bromomethane, whose production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol. [...] "Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to levels that cause protein coagulation or enzyme inactivation." ...|$|E
30|$|Mesophilic {{bacteria}} are dominant {{during the early}} stages of composting by degrading the organic matter; thereby raising the temperature of the system. Once the thermophilic stage has reached, <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> are considered to take over and act upon the organic matter, which is clearly observed with the rise in populations of <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> especially in trial 3 {{and at the same time}} decline in mesophilic bacteria was observed in all the trials. The results were in accordance with the reports by Ishii et al. (2000), stating the significant role of temperature over the populations of one another. In comparison to all the trials, trial 3 reached a maximum reduction of bacterial count with highest temperature and with higher spore-forming bacterial count during the process. The higher temperature may be observed due to the combinations of waste materials in appropriate amounts in trial 3, which favored the growth of mesophilic and <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> to act effectively during the composting process.|$|E
40|$|Bedded pack barns for dairy housing are an {{alternative}} and {{new type of}} housing in the Netherlands and have positive impacts for animal welfare. Several beddings can be used, including a composting bedding of woodchips. In the composting bedding, however, heat-resistant <b>spore-forming</b> <b>bacteria</b> appear to be present.
