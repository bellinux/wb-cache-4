2500|$|Scorpions are predatory arachnids of {{the order}} <b>Scorpiones.</b> They have eight legs and are easily {{recognized}} by the pair of grasping pedipalps and the narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a characteristic forward curve over the back, ending with a venomous stinger.

2500|$|Scorpions (formally {{the order}} <b>Scorpiones)</b> are characterised by a metasoma (tail) {{comprising}} six segments, the last containing the scorpion's anus and bearing the telson (the sting). The telson, in turn, {{consists of the}} vesicle, which holds a pair of venom glands and the hypodermic aculeus, the venom-injecting barb. The abdomen's front half, the mesosoma, {{is made up of}} six segments. The first segment contains the sexual organs as well as a pair of vestigial and modified appendages forming a structure called the genital operculum. The second segment bears a pair of featherlike sensory organs known as the [...] "pectines"; the final four segments each contain a pair of book lungs. The mesosoma is armored with chitinous plates, known as tergites on the upper surface and sternites on the lower surface.|$|E

2500|$|Solifugae is {{an order}} of animals in the class Arachnida known {{variously}} as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order <b>Scorpiones)</b> nor true spiders (order Araneae) – though they are {{more closely related to}} scorpions than to spiders. Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a [...] "tail". Most species of Solifugae live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.|$|E
2500|$|The Opiliones [...] or [...] (formerly Phalangida) are {{an order}} of arachnids colloquially known as harvestmen, {{harvesters}} or daddy longlegs. Although both harvestmen and spiders are arachnids, the two orders are not otherwise closely related. , over 6,500 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, although {{the total number of}} extant species may exceed 10,000. The order Opiliones includes five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and the recently named Tetrophthalmi. With the exception of the Dyspnoi (which are restricted to North America and Eurasia), representatives of each can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, and 305-million-year-old rocks in France, which look surprisingly modern, indicating that their basic body plan appeared very early on, and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time. Their phylogenetic position within the Arachnida is disputed: their closest relatives may be the mites (Acari) or the Novogenuata (the <b>Scorpiones,</b> Pseudoscorpiones, and Solifugae). Although superficially similar to and often misidentified as spiders (order Araneae), the Opiliones are a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders. They can be easily distinguished from long-legged spiders by their fused body regions and single pair of eyes {{in the middle of the}} cephalothorax. Spiders have a distinct abdomen that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, and they have three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of the cephalothorax.|$|E
