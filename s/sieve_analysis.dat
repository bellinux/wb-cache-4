2500|$|However, for {{material}} that is finer than 100 mesh, dry sieving can be significantly less accurate. [...] This is because the mechanical energy required to make particles pass through an opening and the surface attraction effects between the particles themselves and between particles and the screen increase as the particle size decreases. [...] Wet <b>sieve</b> <b>analysis</b> can be utilized where the material analyzed is not affected by the liquid - except to disperse it.

2500|$|Sands and gravels that {{possess a}} wide range of {{particle}} sizes with a smooth distribution of particle sizes are called well graded soils. If the soil particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes, the sample is uniformly graded. If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no coarse sand, the sample may be gap graded. [...] Uniformly graded and gap graded soils are both considered to be poorly graded. There are many methods for measuring particle-size distribution. The two traditional methods are <b>sieve</b> <b>analysis</b> and hydrometer analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The size {{distribution}} of {{gravel and sand}} particles are typically measured using <b>sieve</b> <b>analysis.</b> The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put {{into the top of}} a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. [...] Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method. If {{there are a lot of}} fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and clods through.|$|E

The aim of this research was to rationalize three grades of an additive fine powder used in the manufacturing of a mixed product to one grade, with the aim of reducing or eliminating the potential risk of particle segregation within the product. The use of a segregation tester, specifically to quantify the propensity of a sample of bulk solid to segregate when poured on to a heap, was central to this research. Particular attention was paid to the particle size distribution curves of the final product within different areas of the segregation tester. Two different techniques for characterizing particle size were used in the investigation— one based on size separation using <b>sieving</b> <b>analysis</b> and the other based on the laser diffraction technique.

40|$|Seven alleles at the esterase- 5 {{locus of}} Drosophila pseudoobscura appear {{approximately}} uniformly spaced on 5 % acrylamide gels. Such stepwise "ladders" in mobility {{have been used}} to argue for the charge-state model of electrophoretic mobility. To evaluate this interpretation, flies of the seven strains were examined in replicate electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels of differing pore size, permitting estimation of the relative contributions of charge and of size/conformation to electrophoretic mobility. Six of the seven strains examined proved to be heterogeneous, containing multiple variants that migrate to similar positions on 5 % acrylamide gels. In the one strain genetically analyzed to date, the hidden variants segregate in crosses. A total of fourteen variants are detected by this gel <b>sieving</b> <b>analysis,</b> many of them involving apparent conformational differences. Thus, protein properties in addition to net charge appear {{to play an important role}} in determining the degree of mobility difference between alleles.

A total of 24 samples were taken from two separate beaches and were subjected to dry <b>sieving</b> <b>analysis.</b> Discriminant analysis and analysis of variance were conducted to determine if accreting beaches, with smaller grain-sizes and eroding beaches, with larger grain-sizes exhibit contrasting concentrations of heavy metals. Two separate series of line graphs were constructed to ascertain whether spatial variations in the concentrations of heavy metals were discernible and distinct in both across-shore and along-shore directions within accreting and eroding beaches. Lastly, correlation and regression analysis was performed to reveal the role of grain-size in the spatial distribution of heavy metals. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Earth Sciences.

The aim {{of this research was}} to study properties of composite powders based on self-fluxing alloys and recycled cermets and to examine the properties of thermally sprayed (HVOF) coatings from composite powders based on iron self-fluxing alloy and recycled cermet powders (Cr 3 C 2 -Ni and WC-Co).

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{formation}} of spherical pectin pellets by investigating the effect of additive concentration in the granulation liquid on the shape and size of the products as well as by identifying an optimal additive concentration. Methods. High-methoxylated, low-methoxylated, and amidated low-methoxylated pectin types were evaluated in combination with different concentrations of methanol, ethanol, citric acid, lactic acid, and calcium chloride. Pellets were prepared in a power-consumption-controlled twin-screw extruder, then spheronized and dried. The moisture content of the extrudate was determined, and the final products were characterized by image <b>analysis</b> and <b>sieving</b> <b>analysis.</b> A cloud point test was employed for the identification of an optimal additive concentration. Results. The concentration of additive in the granulation liquid affected the moisture content of the extrudate and the shape, size, and mechanical stability of the pectin pellets. Improvements in the pellet characteristics are dependent on the pectin type employed. The 2 low-methoxylated pectins were more sensitive to concentration changes than was the high-methoxylated type. Above a certain threshold concentration, the quality of the pellets are improved. This additive concentration differs according to type of pectin and type of additive. Conclusion. It was demonstrated that there is a concentration-dependent interaction between pectin and substances added to the granulation liquid that can be utilized to improve the formation of spherical pectin pellets...|$|R
