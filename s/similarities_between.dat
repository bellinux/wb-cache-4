40|$|Measuring {{perceived}} similarity is {{an important}} issue in visual perception of faces, since a measure of the perceived <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> faces may be used to investigate fundamental tasks like face categorization and recognition.

In this paper we present theoretical arguments that undermine the method currently most used to measure perceived <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> faces in visual perception, and we propose an alternative method.
