30|$|Internal {{layering}} {{is commonly}} {{observed in the}} tsunami deposits that are {{at least a few}} cm thick. The number of layers ranges from one to four. A single layer is the most common, and two layers exist in approximately 20 % of the documented sites. Three layers are found in 3 trenches, and four layers are found at only one site. The multiple layers are generally observed in deposits thicker than 15 cm; however, the thinnest tsunami deposits with two layers are only 4 cm thick. The layers are usually delineated with changes in the grain size and/or by the erosional contacts. Multiple layers are more common in transects with a run up > 6 m (Table 1). Regardless of the number of layers, certain beds may be massive in structure (Fig. 2 (C, F)), may reveal normal grading (fining upwards) (Fig. 5), reverse grading, plane parallel lamination (Fig. 2 (A, B, D)), crossbedding (Fig. 2 (D)), and scour and fill structures. Within a multi-layered tsunami deposit, particular layers may be of various kinds (Fig. 2 (A)). The most common combination is a lower part composed of plane or cross laminated <b>sands,</b> <b>reverse</b> graded <b>sands</b> or of massive sediments and an upper part composed of normally graded sediments.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{development}} of filtration technique for water purification has been performed {{ranging from the}} conventional to the advanced technique such as coagulation, sedimentation, <b>sand</b> filtration, <b>reverse</b> osmosis and nanofiltration.

A drum collector electrospinning system was used to produce uniform nanofiber membrane. The morphology of the membrane was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM analysis showed that uniform nanofiber was formed with average fiber diameter of 290 - 370 nm. Three different concentrations of antacid suspension were prepared as the sample in order to test the performance of PAN nanofiber as membrane filter.

In IMS 2 pretreated Rhine River water is treated sequentially by ozonation, biologically activated carbon filtration, slow sand filtration and electrodialysis reversal (EDR).

The IMSs were compared for temperature dependency, scaling and fouling, disinfection strategy and bromate control, dual-barrier concept, and energy and chemical consumption. All IMSs performed well with respect to scaling and fouling. The IMSs using EDR were much more affected by temperature as compared with IMS 1 using RO. IMS 2, in which EDR was used as the final process unit, cannot comply with the bromate standard of 5 μh/l in the finished water. Hence, the choice is between IMS 1 and IMS 3.

40|$|The Round Mountain Silt and the {{underlying}} Olcese Sand, northeast of Bakersfield, California, are famous for their large collection of marine vertebrates from the Sharktooth Hill Bonebed and fossil mollusks from both units. Their ages are poorly constrained, although they {{are thought to be}} early to middle Miocene. Magnetic samples were taken from two sections spanning 180 feet of the Round Mountain Siltstone: one at Ernst Ranch and the other along Poso Creek; and from the 220 -foot thick Nickel Cliff section of the Olcese Sand. The samples were demagnetized with both alternating filed and thermal demagnetization, and produced stable remanence that passed a reversal test. Most of the Round Mountain Siltstone is reversed in polarity except for the very base of the section, and a short normal magnetozone in the upper third. Based on a Sr isotope ages of 15. 9 Ma for the base of section, the best correlation is with Chrons C 5 Bn 1 r to C 5 Cn 1, or 15. 0 to 16. 2 Ma. The entire middle part of the section, including the Sharktooth Hill Bonebed, correlates with Chron C 5 Br (15. 2 - 16. 0 Ma).

40|$|Hazard {{mitigation}} against natural terrain landslide {{requires the}} understanding of its mobility and impact behaviour. In this research, the flow mobility and impact behaviour of granular materials were investigated. Flume model tests and numerical simulations using the sled model, the dynamic analysis (Hungr, 1995) and Particle Flow Code in Three Dimensions (PFC 3 D) were conducted. Two flumes {{were used in the}} physical model tests, namely the runout flume and the barrier flume. The runout flume included an inclined channel of 1. 4 m long, 45 ° slope angle and 0. 4 m wide. The inclined channel was connected to a horizontal channel of 1. 2 m long. The travel angle was measured in each runout tests. The barrier flume consisted of an inclined channel of 3. 8 m long, 40 ° slope angle and 0. 4 m wide. The confinement angle was adjustable for both flumes. An aluminium barrier with a finite stiffness was adopted on the barrier flume. A high speed camera was used to record the impact behaviour. Leighton Buzzard sand fraction C & E, as well as completely decomposed granite (CDG) were used in physical model tests. Measured data were compared and analysed with computed results using the sled model, the dynamic analysis (Hungr, 1995) and PFC 3 D. Parametric studies using the dynamic analysis (Hungr, 1995) with different flow resistance models and PFC 3 D were conducted. Flume data revealed the existence of critical water contents. The critical water contents were around 20 % and 25 % for fraction C sand and CDG respectively. The travel angle decreased with mean particle size in a granular mixture. A critical confinement angle was observed between 0 ° and 8 ° using fraction C and fraction E <b>sands</b> respectively. <b>Reverse</b> segregation was observed using CDG soil. Back analysis of measured data shows that the sled model fails to model the effects of mass on travel angle. By including side resistance and dynamic drag in calculation using the dynamic analysis, the critical confinement angle could be captured. The deposition process has a longer duration by adopting the Bingham model than the friction model and the Voellmy model. The duration of impact was longer for fraction E sand than that of fraction C sand. No peak force was measured and progressive deposition was observed for both sands. The duration of impact was shorter for wet fraction C sand. The measured impact force reduced with the confinement angle. Parametric study using PFC 3 D shows that the maximum impact force for dry granular material is contributed mostly by static load. The computed impact force on a vertical barrier is larger than a barrier which is perpendicular to the inclined flume. By incorporating a deposition zone of 0. 5 m in front of the vertical barrier, the computed static load is reduced by around 80 %...|$|R
40|$|Amsterdam Water Supply {{introduced}} ozone-{{activated carbon}} filtration (biological activated carbon filtration) {{in the production}} plant Leiduin in 1995. This full-scale plant (capacity 70 million m 3 yr- 1) {{can be characterized as}} an integrated treatment process. Experience since 1995 has revealed that biological activated carbon filtration has several benefits in integrated treatment processes. It is a very effective barrier for organics in general and for pesticides and organic micropollutants in particular. Due to the preceding ozonation both adsorption and biodegradation take place, resulting in a very long lifetime of the carbon filters (2 years). The ozonation significantly increases the disinfection capacity of the plant. Together with the other process steps, the disinfection capacity is at such a high level that, in combination with the biological stability of the finished water and good engineering practice in the distribution system, no chlorination has to be applied to guarantee hygienic quality. The process stability of the final treatment step, slow sand filtration, is, importantly, increased by the introduction of ozone-activated carbon filtration. Running times of the slow sand filters are longer than 2 - 3 years, while before the introduction of ozone-activated carbon filtration they never exceeded 1 year. In integrated membrane processes [...] which may be used in the treatment plant Leiduin in the future and therefore are being tested on pilot plant scale [...] ozone-activated carbon filtration also offers many advantages.
