5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Reubens {{decided to}} take a sabbatical from Pee-wee. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent {{exposure}} in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E

25|$|When S D Burman's {{assistant}} Jaidev <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> music independently, he got Asha to sing some of {{his songs}} as well. They worked in Hum Dono (1961), Mujhe Jeene Do (1963), Do Boond Pani (1971) and other movies. In 1971, the pair released an LP of eight non-film devotional songs and ghazals called An Unforgettable Treat. Asha considered Jaidev a close friend who stood by {{her when she was}} struggling personally and professionally. Upon his death in 1987, she released a compilation album of lesser-known songs he had composed for her, called Suranjali.|$|E
25|$|After the Sino-Indian War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India made {{considerable}} {{changes to}} its foreign policy. It developed {{a close relationship}} with the Soviet Union and started receiving massive military equipment and financial assistance from the USSR. This had an adverse effect on the Indo-US relationship. The United States saw Pakistan as a counterweight to pro-Soviet India and <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> the former military assistance. This created an atmosphere of suspicion between India and the US. The Indo-US relationship suffered a considerable setback when the Soviets took over Afghanistan when India overtly supported the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{increased}} success, and {{the release}} of a single, New Faces, Old Places, Shiels became concerned about Lynott's tendency to sing off-key. He then discovered that the problem was with Lynott's tonsils; he subsequently took a leave of absence from the band. By the time he had recovered, Shiels had decided to take over singing lead and reduce the band to a three piece. Feeling guility of having effectively sacked one of his best friends, he taught Lynott how to play bass, figuring {{it would be easier to}} learn than a six string guitar, and sold him a Fender Jazz Bass he had bought from Robert Ballagh for £36, and <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> him lessons.|$|E

25|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example of}} social transmission of a behaviour {{occurred in a}} group of macaques on Hachijojima Island, Japan. The macaques lived in the inland forest until the 1960s, when a group of researchers <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> them potatoes on the beach: soon, they started venturing onto the beach, picking the potatoes from the sand, and cleaning and eating them. About one year later, an individual was observed bringing a potato to the sea, putting it into the water with one hand, and cleaning it with the other. This behaviour was soon expressed by the individuals living in contact with her; when they gave birth, this behaviour was also expressed by their young - a form of social transmission.|$|E
25|$|Ibar {{fans are}} known as Gazije (Arabic: ghāzī or ghazah/gazi, from ghazw, pl. ghazawāt, armed {{incursion}} {{with the intention of}} conquering - Gazije were the defenders of Islam (Islamic fighters) in the period of the Ottoman Empire). The group's traditional colours are black and white, which are also the colours of the football club FK Ibar, where Gazije first <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> their support. After the football club failed to reach the First Montenegrin League in 2006, 2007, and 2008, the footballers lost the support of fans since they failed to win the away play-off match against FK Dečić for the First league placement. The volleyball team had its biggest support when the women's team played in the First division.|$|E
25|$|Rocker {{was opposed}} to the FVdG's {{alliance}} with the communists during and immediately after the November Revolution, as he rejected Marxism, especially {{the concept of the}} dictatorship of the proletariat. Soon after arriving in Germany, however, he once again became seriously ill. He <b>started</b> <b>giving</b> public speeches in March 1919, including one at a congress of munitions workers in Erfurt, where he urged them to stop producing war material. During this period the FVdG grew rapidly and the coalition with the communists soon began to crumble. Eventually all syndicalist members of the Communist Party were expelled. From December 27 to December 30, 1919, the twelfth national congress of the FVdG was held in Berlin.|$|E
