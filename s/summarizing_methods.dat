40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge in}} proteome informatics is accurate and concise reporting of protein identification data {{that result from}} mass spectrometry-based proteomic workflows. The Paris Guidelines (1, 2) represent the proteomics community’s efforts to devise a standard methodology for reporting protein identification data. Given these guidelines, the Proteome Informatics Research Group (iPRG) proposes to assess the consistency of protein identification analysis. The iPRG of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) invites you {{to participate in a}} collaborative study focusing on evaluating the ability of proteomics laboratories to determine the identities of a complex mixture of proteins present in a single mass spectral dataset. The primary goals of this study are to provide each participating laboratory an opportunity to evaluate its capabilities and approaches with regard to: • Bioinformatics tools used to make and consolidate protein identifications derived from a common data set and a common reference database • Report those identifications using common reporting criteria Laboratories requesting permission to participate will receive detailed instructions and passwords to access the mass spectral data, the reference database, and a template for reporting study results. The iPRG will also request that along with the final list of identified proteins, participants complete a web-based questionnaire <b>summarizing</b> <b>methods</b> used. This year’s study is open to both ABRF members and non-members. However, the total number of participants may be limited, and priority will be given to ABRF members.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is a review and <b>summarizing</b> <b>methods</b> of tariffs in housing and {{communal}} services in foreign countries, and also reasoning of opportunity to use of state marketing in the regulation of tariffs and the main directions of its usage, both in Russia and abroad. The result {{of this article is}} the formulation of conclusions and predictions for further development of tariff setting, as well as the social consequences of this policy in the sphere of housing and communal services. The institutional character of the social practices of HCS, according to the authors, is associated with the provision of living conditions for the population in the sphere of material practices and with the finding of ways to optimize the economy of the industrial and postindustrial societies. In the service social practices HCS special factor is the change of goal setting, re-orientation of social action for the client from the process that is not always connected with rational components of the social actions of individuals, and also with the operation of irrational components. Besides, {{there is a kind of}} "soft " technologization in the service social practices of HCS. Pricing policy in the sphere of housing and communal services detects a contradiction, on the one hand, between a wide range of services and agents that shows the democratization processes in the maintenance and strengthening of processes of self-administration, and on the other side of rising prices and low quality of services provided...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Comparative {{effectiveness}} research (CER) {{is designed to}} support informed decision making at both the individual, population, and policy levels. The American College of Sports Medicine and partners convened a conference with the focus of building an agenda for CER {{within the context of}} physical activity and nonpharmacological lifestyle approaches in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. This report summarizes the conference content and consensus recommendations that culminated in a CER roadmap for physical activity and lifestyle approaches to reducing the risk of chronic disease. Methods: This conference focused on presentations and discussion around the following topic areas: 1) defining CER, 2) identifying the current funding climate to support CER, 3) <b>summarizing</b> <b>methods</b> for conducting CER, and 4) identifying CER opportunities for physical activity. Results: This conference resulted in consensus recommendations to adopt a CER roadmap for physical activity and lifestyle approaches to reducing the risk of chronic disease. In general, this roadmap provides a systematic framework by which CER for physical activity can move from a planning phase to a phase of engagement in CER related to lifestyle factors with particular emphasis on physical activity to a societal change phase that results in changes in policy, practice, and health. Conclusions: It is recommended that physical activity researchers and health care providers use the roadmap developed from this conference as a method to systematically engage in and apply CER to the promotion of physical activity as a key lifestyle behavior that can be effective at making an impact on a variety of health-related outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of yeast growth. It builds upon a dataset consisting of growth curves of 576 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants in eight different environments. The data will {{be a part of a}} publicly available phenotypic library, PROPHECY, containing growth curves and characteristics of viable S. cerevisiae mutants in a wide variety of growth conditions. We compare the fits of modifications of logistic, Gompertz, and Chapman-Richards models for the growth curves. The comparisons indicate that the modified Chapman-Richards model describes our growth data best. Relevant information about the behavior of the mutants is obtained by estimating physiologically important growth parameters such as lag time (time to adapt to the environmental change), maximum relative growth rate, and efficiency of growth. We introduce an alternative parameterization of the modified Chapman-Richards model that uses these growth parameters and investigate its uniqueness and parameter restrictions. We also show convexity of its logarithmic parameter space. One of our findings is that the lag time and the growth rate depend strongly on the initial population size. However, in large-scale experiments with hundreds of strains, it is difficult to have the same constant initial population size. To address this problem and to enable easy visualization of the data, we develop a method to standardize growth curves with respect to the initial population size. The idea is to use a modified Chapman-Richards curve to predict what the behavior of a growth curve would have been, had the population had a fixed standard initial size. As a result, the initial population size correlation with lag time and growth rate reduces remarkably. We also introduce two ways to construct a summary curve from several standardized growth curves. We suggest a set of filtering methods, based on the standardized and summary curves, in order to detect experiments and individual curves that are atypical or spurious. Finally, we compare the variability of wild type normalized mutant growth parameters from the modified Chapman-Richards, standardized, and summary curves. The variances are typically slightly smaller with the standardizing and <b>summarizing</b> <b>methods</b> than with the direct Chapman-Richards approach. MSC 2000 classification: 62 P 1...|$|E
