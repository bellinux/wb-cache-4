He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no <b>surplus</b> <b>available</b> in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of its responsibilities in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E

But even if the {{rejoinder}} be made, {{that we have not}} yet allowed for the lowering of the standard of life and comfort in Germany which may reasonably be imposed on a defeated enemy,[133] there is still a fundamental fallacy in the method of calculation. An annual <b>surplus</b> <b>available</b> for home investment can only be converted into a <b>surplus</b> <b>available</b> for export abroad by a radical change in the kind of work performed. Labor, while it may be available and efficient for domestic services in Germany, may yet be able to find no outlet in foreign trade. We are back on the same question which faced us in our examination of the export trade--in what export trade is German labor going to find a greatly increased outlet? Labor can only he diverted into new channels with loss of efficiency, and a large expenditure of capital. The annual surplus which German labor can produce for capital improvements at home is no measure, either theoretically or practically, of the annual tribute which she can pay abroad.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the SWP system {{still had a}} lot of [...] "surplus" [...] - water supply {{developed}} through the construction of Oroville Dam, which was running unused to the Pacific Ocean because the water delivery infrastructure for Southern California had not yet been completed (and when it was, southern California was slow to use the water). The surplus water was given for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley instead. Because the water would only be a temporary supply, farmers were advised to use it for seasonal crops (such as alfalfa or hay) rather than permanent crops such as orchards. Nevertheless, many farmers used the water to develop new permanent crops, creating a dependency on SWP water that is technically part of Southern California's entitlement, This is now causing tensions as Southern California continues to increase its use of SWP water, decreasing the amount of <b>surplus</b> <b>available</b> to the system, especially in years of drought.|$|E

40|$|How does sorting {{affect the}} impact of {{non-standard}} preferences on economic outcomes? We analyze endogenous sorting both theoretically and experimentally {{in the context of}} preferences for sharing. We present a model that allows for heterogeneity in preferences for sharing: individuals with self-regarding preferences care only about their own payoff; individuals with other-regarding preferences also care about others ’ payoff; and individuals who feel “shame ” or “guilt ” care about others ’ payoff only if they are confronted with the reaction of the other person. We show that sorting induces sharers to opt out and reduces the total amount of sharing. Moreover, increasing the total <b>surplus</b> <b>available</b> for sharing while holding the outside option constant induces first those individuals who are least willing to share to sort back into the dictator game. We then conduct a dictator game experiment, where each dictator first plays a standard dictator game and then plays additional rounds of dictator games with the option not to play. We show that sorting reduces the frequency of sharing from 74 % to 30 % and the average percentage shared from 27 % to 12 %. Moreover, increases in the <b>surplus</b> <b>available</b> t...|$|E
