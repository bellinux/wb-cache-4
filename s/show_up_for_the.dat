5|$|The {{event is}} remembered for Scott Hall's failure to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> event and for Samoa Joe's unscripted rant against the promotion. It also {{marks the first}} time the Feast or Fired match was held. The {{professional}} wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event a six and a half out of ten, higher than the 2006 event's rating of six.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2013, Wizkid and his {{management}} were questioned by {{men from the}} Nigeria Police Force. Duping charges were leveled against them {{by a group of}} UNILAG students. The students claimed that Wizkid agreed to perform at the UNILAG Sports Centre on 21 May 2013 for a total sum of ₦500,000. They also claimed that he didn't <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show and didn't return their money. After conducting a thorough investigation, Police determined that Unilag students were bamboozled by con artists pretending to be affiliates of E.M.E. In the aforementioned interview with Showtime Celebrity, Wizkid commented on the events that transpired after the accusations. He told the media that the police were investigating the case. The masterminds behind the impersonation were later detained by law enforcement agents in Lagos. In addition to duping Unilag students, the culprits set up fake email and social media accounts. Wizkid also elaborated on how one can go about booking him.|$|E

50|$|The Rowdies made so {{much noise}} in the preseason that Rockets superstar Tracy McGrady decided to {{purchase}} twenty more tickets. Tryouts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second audition were held at Dave and Busters {{during the regular season}} opener against the Utah Jazz.

5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Glowery, {{a bitter}} New York City {{journalist}} and writer {{who believes that}} a rival author is sabotaging his literary career, arrives in Tyburn where he is to speak at a fiction workshop being held at the Admiral Benbow Inn. He is immediately tasered by one of Castro's detectives, who mistakenly confuses him for Picasso. Back at the Admiral Benbow Inn, the innkeeper, George Hawthorne, worries about Mr. Briscoe, a cross-dressing contract worker who is stranded in the abandoned lighthouse just off the coast because of the raging nor'easter, while his unhappy wife, Magdalene Hawthorne, threatens to leave him. The next morning, Mr. Glowery is stuck in a restaurant where he is being coerced by a psychotic cook to peddle his novel {{in order to pay}} off a debt he incurred during the night. When Professor Eggman, the director of the fiction workshop, comes across Mr. Glowery, he rescues him and brings him back to the inn. However, few people <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fiction workshop because of the storm. Hawthorne's wife returns from a spa with Picasso; Mr. Hawthorne informs her that he is trying to procure a prostitute for his new arrival, Jesus Castro, who has registered under the false name of Mr. Wassermann. Mr. Hawthorne asks Picasso if he has had sex with his wife and Picasso meekly admits to it.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2003 a {{championship}} match between champions La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Damián 666, and Halloween) and Los Nuevo Infernales (Sátanico, Averno, and Mephisto), ended with La Familia being disqualified. The disqualification {{meant that the}} titles would change hands, but Los Nuevo Infernales refused to win the championship in such a manner. A rematch was set up for June 20, but Nicho el Millonario did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> match. CMLL held an eight-team tournament to determine the next championship trio, ending with El Felino, Safari and Volador, Jr. become the 23rd Trios champions. In 2010 Máscara Dorada teamed up with Stuka Jr., and Metro to win the Trios championship, making Dorada a quadruple champion as he also held the CMLL World Super Lightweight Championship, CMLL World Trios Championship, and the CMLL World Welterweight Championship at the time. In November, 2010 Dorada suffered a knee injury and relinquished his portion of the Mexican National Trios Championship. Delta was selected as his replacement via a fan vote, but the team lost the trios championship in the first defense against the team of Ángel de Oro, Diamante (who were the other two options for Dorada's replacement) and Rush.|$|E
5|$|When Raghavan {{is about}} to leave his house for a {{marriage}} proposal, Sundaram comes there and describes the girl {{he was talking about}} to Raghavan. Raghavan realises that Radha, whom he intends to marry, is the same girl Sundaram is in love with. Raghavan, believing that Radha loves Sundaram, decides to help Sundaram attain his love and get a chance to act in films, which he does successfully. Sundaram becomes a star after his debut film Appavi Kanavan ("Innocent Husband") becomes a success and believes that his stardom and popularity will help him in attaining his love. When Radha comes to Sundaram's house to congratulate him, he introduces her to Raghavan, who is present at that time. As Sundaram goes to prepare snacks for the two, Radha asks Raghavan why he did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> marriage proposal. Raghavan states that he thought Radha loved Sundaram. Shocked, Radha informs Raghavan that she likes Sundaram for his innocence, although she does not love him. Raghavan is pleasantly surprised, but to ensure that Sundaram's film career does not suffer from discovering the truth, he asks Radha to keep it a secret.|$|E

Two weeks after the recording session, Gavin's girlfriend Jo Bench replaced Tweedy.|$|E

25|$|Coming off {{a regular}} season conference title, {{the team was}} {{obviously}} dejected in not going further, and this served {{as something of a}} chip of their shoulder heading into the next season. In the stands, the club experienced another solid but unspectacular year averaging 5,983 (announced), but dipped well below that during the post season, seeing only 4,638 <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conference final game versus St. Louis.|$|E

As the search for Kamal intensified, Sajal Barui, migrated to Jamboni, in West Midnapore district, to work for Rajeev Meti, a local criminal.|$|E
25|$|In January 1936, Echols telephoned Howard Hughes {{to say the}} Air Corps was {{interested}} in purchasing the record-breaking Hughes H-1 Racer as a pursuit plane—it was faster than anything they had. Hughes agreed to fly the aircraft to Wright Field for a demonstration, but he failed to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> appointment that Echols had set up with higher Air Corps brass. After that snub, Echols never again gave Hughes a chance to bid on Air Corps projects, not even in October 1941 when Hughes offered the twin-boom D-2 fighter-bomber design. Echols allowed Wright Field engineers to examine the D-2 but they concluded {{that it would be}} too heavy for its own engines after incorporating required military features such as armor plate, a bullet-resistant windshield and stronger landing gear.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} thirteen, Petrović {{started playing}} in the youth {{selections}} of the local club Šibenka; {{at the age of}} fifteen he had already made the first team, just as Šibenka earned a place in the Yugoslav national first division. With young Petrović as the star of the team, Šibenka reached the final of the FIBA Radivoj Korać Cup twice (1981–82 and 1982–83), losing to Limoges CSP both times. In 1983, the 18 year-old Petrović hit two free throws for Šibenka's victory over Bosna in the final playoff game of the Yugoslavian club championship, but the title was taken away from Šibenka the next day by the national basketball federation with irregularities in refereeing cited as the reason, and awarded to Bosna after Šibenka refused to <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> repeat match.|$|E

25|$|In early February 1972, guitarist O'List {{quit the}} group {{abruptly}} after an altercation with Paul Thompson, {{which took place}} at their audition for David Enthoven of EG Management. When O'List didn't <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived {{he was invited to}} play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst {{to the rest of the}} group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as David Gilmour, who was a friend of his older brother, and Soft Machine's Robert Wyatt.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} {{is the first}} with Frank Burns in charge, and he {{immediately}} starts using his [...] "gung-ho", militarily strict, and whistle-happy attitude to assemble the company.

As Blake leaves his tent for the last time, dressed in his new suit, he is greeted with {{a round of applause}} from the unit. Frank and Margaret give Blake a formal [...] "ten-hut" [...] salute.

500|$|Douglas {{was given}} an {{assignment}} in 1916 {{to write a story}} on the first woman to join the US Naval Reserve from Miami. When the woman did not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interview, Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, where she was stationed in Paris. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed, and she cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, [...] "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later".|$|E
