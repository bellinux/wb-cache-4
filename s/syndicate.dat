5|$|Inside the apartment, Mulder's {{search for}} clues is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} The Smoking Man, who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), who is actually his son. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that, many years ago, the <b>Syndicate</b> agreed by majority vote, against Bill Mulder's objections, to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization. The <b>Syndicate</b> was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the <b>Syndicate</b> {{in order for them to}} gain access to alien DNA. Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree, Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others. Using the fetus, the <b>Syndicate</b> worked on creating alien-human hybrids who could survive colonization. The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again, providing him with an address to the hangar where the <b>Syndicate</b> members will be meeting the colonists.|$|E
