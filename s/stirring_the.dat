5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E

After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell's offer to arrange a lecturing tour for her in the western states – considered then to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the New York Tribune said she was <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> West on women’s rights “as it is seldom stirred on any subject whatsoever.” After four lectures in Louisville, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there than she could have anywhere else. An Indianapolis newspaper reported that Stone “set about two-thirds {{of the women in the}} town crazy after women’s rights and placed half the men in a similar predicament.” St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled there, filling the city’s largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season, and said they were inspiring discussion and debate in the city’s homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home in January, 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ： Semi-solid {{magnesium}} alloy slurry {{was produced by}} a newly self-developed mechanical stirring machine in order to prepare continuous semi-solid slurry. The changing principle of semi-solid microstructure was studied under different conditions—the changing of temperature, stirring rate, cooling rate and stirring time. It was showed that the lower the temperature of slurry, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> rate, <b>the</b> longer <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> time and <b>the</b> faster the cooling rate, the grain will be smaller and more evenly rounded. When <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> speed and temperature are the same, better semi-solid spherical grains can be gained by increasing <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> time. At <b>the</b> same <b>stirring</b> temperature and higher stirring speed, semi-solid spherical particles are smaller, rounder and more evenly; at a low stirring speed, we can't get ideal semi-solid spherical grains even if we increase <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> time. <b>The</b> ideal technological parameters of semi-solid AZ 61 alloy produced with no-dendritic structure were recommended to be 600 ℃～ 605 ℃ (stirring end temperature) 、 3 min～ 5 min(stirring time) and 500 r/min(stirring rate). Compared with conventional casting alloy, semi-solid alloy mechanical properties were greatly improved. The non-dendrite semi-solid forming mechanism was studied; mechanical stirring semi-solid non-dendritic formation {{was the result of}} a variety of factors, the key cause is mechanical shear stress...|$|R
30|$|Thus, <b>stirring</b> of <b>the</b> {{reaction}} mixture {{at a rate}} of 250  rpm made it possible to obtain particles with an optimal size distribution and a nearly regular shape and prevented particle aggregations. Therefore, we estimated the effect of <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> duration on <b>the</b> microparticle size distribution at this stirring rate (Additional file  1 : Figure S 3). <b>Stirring</b> of <b>the</b> {{reaction mixture}} for 15  s yielded an increased number of larger particles compared to 30 -s stirring.

That is, <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> duration was insufficient in the former case (Additional file  1 : Figure S 3 a) and excessive in the latter case (Additional file  1 : Figure S 3 c). Thus, we considered the rate of 250  rpm and duration of 30  s to be optimal conditions of stirring.|$|R

25|$|The late 20th century saw {{a wave of}} {{winemaking}} {{innovation and}} the popularization of several winemaking techniques. The mid-1980s saw increased usage of oak barrels for fermentation over stainless steel fermenting tanks. The process of <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> lees (bâtonnage) also became more commonplace. By <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> lees, the dead yeast come into greater contact with the wood-based tannins and pigments that are usually extracted into the wine. The lees act {{as a sort of}} buffer between the wines and the oak elements, allowing the wine to maintain its color and not become too harsh and tannic. In the late 1990s, more Muscadet producers started extending {{the amount of time that}} the must spends in contact with the grape skins prior to fermentation. This extended maceration allowed the wine to leach more phenolic compounds from the skin which can add complexity to the wine.|$|E

This paper takes important steps towards a thorough investigation of <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> properties of thermally-driven rotating annulus flows, by demonstrating numerically the utility of two stirring measures for a parameter set yielding relatively simple flow conditions. The first measure is the finite scale Lyapunov exponent (FSLE), which has been successfully used to highlight <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> properties of various geophysical flows. The second measure is the Eulerian symmetry measure, which has been far less widely used: this second measure does not provide such a detailed view of <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> properties as <b>the</b> FSLE, but is far more efficient to calculate. Both measures are shown to have some success for the simple flow case studied, providing a strong foundation for further investigation into more complicated flows...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{the uniform}} {{distribution}} of reinforcement particles in MMCs {{is very important}} for <b>the</b> effect of <b>stirring</b> parameters and <b>the</b> flow action of the melt, which should be known. <b>The</b> effect of <b>stirring</b> parameters on <b>the</b> distribution of SiC particles in SiCp/A 356 composites was studied by the experimental and numerical methods in this paper. The experimental results show the SiC distribution with different stirring parameters. In addition, the effects of the fluid velocity and volume fraction of SiC particle at different position of crucible on the SiC distribution were analyzed by numerical simulation. The velocity magnitude, axial velocity, and radial velocity were analyzed to explain theoretically the particle distribution. The shearing force, moments, and <b>stirring</b> power of <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> rod were simulated based on CFD code. The numerical results show that <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> temperature is lower, the shearing force is greater, <b>the</b> <b>stirring</b> time is longer, and particle dispersion gets better.

25|$|The {{theory of}} Permanent Revolution {{considers}} {{that in many}} countries that are thought under Trotskyism to have not yet completed a bourgeois-democratic revolution, the capitalist class opposes the creation of any revolutionary situation. They fear <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> working class into fighting for its own revolutionary aspirations against their exploitation by capitalism. In Russia, the working class, although a small minority in a predominantly peasant based society, were organised in vast factories owned by the capitalist class, and into large working class districts. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the capitalist class {{found it necessary to}} ally with reactionary elements such as the essentially feudal landlords and ultimately the existing Czarist Russian state forces. This was to protect their ownership of their property—factories, banks, etc.—from expropriation by the revolutionary working class.|$|E
25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E

25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E
25|$|Scenes {{from the}} Odyssey are common on Greek pottery, the Circe episode among them. The two most common {{representations}} have Circe {{surrounded by the}} transformed sailors and Odysseus threatening the sorceress with his sword. In {{the case of the}} former, the animals are not always boars but also include, for instance, the ram, dog and lion on the 6th century BCE Boston kylix. Often the transformation is only partial, involving the head and perhaps a sprouting tail, {{while the rest of the}} body is human. In describing an otherwise obscure fifth-century Greek bronze in the Walters Art Museum that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig, the commentator asks in what other way could an artist depict someone bewitched other than as a man with an animal head. In these scenes Circe is shown almost invariably <b>stirring</b> <b>the</b> potion with her wand, although the incident as described in Homer has her use the wand only to bewitch the sailors after they have refreshed themselves. One exception is the Berlin amphora on which the seated Circe holds the wand towards a half transformed man.|$|E
