5|$|At Cape Canaveral, {{the space}} <b>shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> was {{considered}} to be safe on its launching pad after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> docked on 10 March 2001, {{bringing}} to the ISS the new long-duration three-person crew of Expedition 2, as well as four short-term crew members of STS-102. A few hours after docking, the hatch opened, and all ten astronauts greeted each other, setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the ISS. The day after docking, American astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long, and still holds {{the record for the}} longest spacewalk ever performed, as of August 2010. The length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes, including Voss accidentally releasing a small tool. Unable to retrieve it, NASA engineers tracked the tool, and decided to use Discoverys thrusters on 14 March to boost the station four kilometers higher, to ensure the ISS would not collide with the piece of space debris.|$|E

50|$|Colonel Benjamin Alvin Drew (born November 5, 1962) is a United States Air Force {{officer and}} a NASA astronaut.

Drew's second spaceflight took place in March 2011 on STS-133, another mission to the International Space Station. STS-133 was Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery's</b> final mission. Drew took part in two spacewalks while docked to the station. Drew was the final African-American to fly on board a Space Shuttle, as the final two Space Shuttle missions, STS-134 and STS-135, had no African-American crew members.|$|R

5000|$|The {{rendezvous}} pitch maneuver {{was developed}} by NASA engineers Steve Walker, Mark Schrock and Jessica LoPresti after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Columbia had sustained damage to its heat shield due to insulating foam breaking off the external tank and hitting the shield at liftoff. The damage was too great for the heat shield to protect the shuttle {{from the heat and}} structural strain of atmospheric reentry, causing it to break apart. For this reason, the integrity of the heat shield had been a critical concern of NASA ever since. The maneuver was first performed by Mission Commander Eileen Collins on STS-114, which was one of Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discoverys</b> two [...] "Return To Flight" [...] missions after the Columbia STS-107 disaster.|$|R
5000|$|STS-102 was a Space Shuttle {{mission to}} the International Space Station (ISS) flown by Space <b>Shuttle</b> [...] <b>Discovery</b> and {{launched}} from Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
