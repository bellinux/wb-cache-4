40|$|The {{combined}} use of orthogonal {{frequency-division multiplexing}} (OFDM) and wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links is becoming common. For many applications, such as ad hoc wireless networks, interference {{is a significant}} issue. MIMO links allow for the spatial mitigation of interference; however, spatial interference mitigation when using OFDM modulation performs somewhat poorly because of the relatively limited interference spectral confinement of the Discrete Fourier Transform. Traditional windowing approaches that minimize leakage of the interference into neighboring carriers induce intercarrier interference. In this paper, a technique is developed for determining optimal windows that trade off interference suppression with intercarrier and interframe interference. This technique assumes channel statistics are known. Optimized windows for various levels of interference, delay <b>spreads,</b> <b>frame</b> length, and cyclic prefix lengths can be produced.

This {{is due to the}} reduction in relative overhead for the channel division with a larger frame duration, as indicated in Eq. 6. We also show that 2.4 GHz has a larger appetite for more sub-channel divisions than 5 GHz, due to the larger multi-path effect from which it suffers. Similarly, with greater bandwidth, the SA-SIG-B field will have less symbols, reducing the impact of the channel division overhead. Therefore, the adaptation threshold also decreases, as shown in Figs.  11 f and 12 f.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Load-balanced {{switches}} {{have received}} much attention {{because they are}} more scalable than other switch architectures. However, a load-balanced switch has the problem of packet missequencing. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Mailbox Sharing (DMS) scheme to eliminate the mis-sequencing problem of load-balanced switches only at the cost of a very small increase of delay. The key idea is to keep packets of the same flow in order in the load-balanced switch. The DMS scheme is based on two statistical facts in operational networks: the number of simultaneous active flows in the router buffer is far less than that of in-progress flows, and most of the intra-flow packet intervals are longer than the packet delay in the high speed router. In DMS, the packet sequence of the same flow arrived in the input ports is recorded in the mailbox maintained in the output ports. Then, packets of the same flow are delivered according to the order of their arrivals. The mailbox becomes the bottleneck in order to accommodate a large number of flows. We thus propose a dynamic sharing scheme to alleviate the bottleneck and greatly enhance the scalability of the mailbox. By simulations using the real internet traffic traces, we show that with a simple flow splitter mechanism restraining mis-sequencing, the average packet delay using DMS is considerably lower than that of other schemes including Uniform <b>Frame</b> <b>Spreading,</b> Padded <b>Frame</b> and the CR switch, and it is close to the ideal case without resequencing even when the load is very high. The results also demonstrate that the size of mailbox is in the hundreds. Keywords- load-balanced switch; mailbox; dynamic sharing I...|$|R

Particularly, in this case, I confront the main conclusions of two different methodological approaches that analyze the emergence of the movement, focusing my interest in the ideological roots of its collective identity.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of network structure, brokerage, and framing in high-risk {{collective}} action. I use the protest movement that emerged in Russia following falsified national elections in 2011 and 2012 as an empirical case study. I draw on a unique dataset of nearly 30, 000 online documents and the linking structure of over 3, 500 Russian Web sites. I employ a range of computational social science methods, including Exponential Random Graph Modeling, an advanced statistical model for social networks, social network analysis, machine learning, and latent semantic analysis. I address three research questions in this thesis. The first asks if a protest network challenging a hybrid regime will have a polycentric or hierarchical structure, and if that structure changes over time. Polycentric networks are conducive to high-risk collective action and are robust to the targeted removal of key nodes, while hierarchical networks can more easily mobilize protesters and spread information. I find that the Russian protest network has a polycentric structure only {{at the beginning of}} the protests, and moves towards a less effective hierarchical structure as the movement loses popular support. The second research question seeks to understand if brokered text is actually novel, and if that text is more novel in polycentric networks than in hierarchical ones. Brokers are the individuals or nodes in a network that connect disparate groups through weak ties and close structural holes. Brokers are advantageous because they have access to and spread novel information. I find that the text among nodes in brokered relationships is indeed novel, but that information novelty decreases when networks have a hierarchical structure. The last research question asks if a protest movement in a high-risk political setting can be more successful than the government at <b>spreading</b> its preferred <b>frames,</b> and within such a movement, whether moderate or extremist framing is more prevalent. I find that the opposition is far more effective than the government in <b>spreading</b> its <b>frames,</b> even when the government organizes massive counter protests. Within the movement, moderates are more likely to have their framing adopted online than extremists, unless violence occurs at protests. The findings suggest that movements should build flatter, more diffuse networks by ensuring that brokers tie together diverse protest constituencies. The findings also provide evidence against those who claim that authoritarian governments are more effective in shaping online discourse than oppositional movements, and also suggest that movements should advance moderate framing in order to attract a wider base of support among the general population. </p...|$|R

This {{can be achieved by}} appending a guard interval with duration {{greater than or equal to}} the channel’s delay <b>spread</b> to each <b>frame</b> – an operation limiting the maximum achievable data rate. As a remedy, this Letter advocates block transmissions in conjunction with orthogonal spreading sequences to remove the introduced IPI. The resultant scheme requires no channel knowledge besides timing offset and incurs slightly more complexity than non-block alternatives, while it increases the data rate at no cost in error performance.
