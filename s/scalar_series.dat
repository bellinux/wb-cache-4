The Asymptotic Numerical Method (ANM) is a family of algorithms for path following problems, where each step is based on the computation of truncated vector series [1]. The Vector Padé approximants were introduced in the ANM to improve the domain of validity of vector series and {{to reduce the number of}} steps needed to ob-tain the entire solution path [1, 2]. In this paper and in the framework of the ANM, we define and build a new type of Vector Padé approximant from a truncated vector series by extending the definition of the Padé ap-proximant of a <b>scalar</b> <b>series</b> without any orthonormalization procedure. By this way, we define a new class of Vector Padé approximants which can be used to extend the domain of validity in the ANM algorithms. There is a connection between this type of Vector Padé approximant and Vector Padé type approximant introduced in [3, 4]. We show also that the Vector Padé approximants introduced in the previous works [1, 2], are special cases o...|$|E

Moreover, in real-life systems it is hardly true that all the state variables are available for analysis and modeling. Since the late 1980 s, techniques have been put forward for building mathematical models from a <b>scalar</b> time <b>series.</b> One of the objectives {{of this paper is}} to verify if it is possible to obtain global non-linear models (non-linear differential equations) from <b>scalar</b> time <b>series.</b> Such data are obtained using a model of biochemical reaction with aperiodic (chaotic) oscillations as recently observed in the case of a glycolytic reaction (Nielsen, K., Sorensen, P. G., Hynne, F., 1997. Chaos in glycolysis. J Theor. Biol. 186, 303 – 306.). The main objective, however, is to investigate which state variable is more convenient for the task in practice. It is shown that observability indices seem to quantify quite well which variable should be preferred as the observable. The validity of the results are established performing rigorous topological analysis on the original system and the obtained models.
