40|$|The {{utilization}} of rotor flapping in synthesizing an Individual Blade Control (IBC) system for gust alleviation is demonstrated. The {{objective is to}} illustrate and seek to improve Ham's IBC method. A sensor arrangement with two accelerometers mounted on the root and tip of a blade is proposed for estimating of flapping <b>states</b> for <b>feedback</b> control. Equivalent swash plate implementation of IBC is also deliberated. The study concludes by addressing the concept of general rotor <b>states</b> <b>feedback,</b> of which the IBC method is a special case. The blade flapping equation of motion is derived. Ham's original IBC method and a modified IBC scheme called Model Reference (MRIBC) are examined, followed by simulation study with ideal measurements and relative performances of the two methods. The practical aspects of IBC implementation are presented. Different configuration of sensors and their merits are considered. The realization of IBC using equivalent swash plate instead of direct actuator motion is discussed. It is shown that IBC is a particular case of rotor <b>states</b> <b>feedback.</b> The idea of general rotor <b>states</b> <b>feedback</b> is further elaborated.

50|$|Climate change {{feedback}} {{is important in}} the understanding of global warming because feedback processes may amplify or diminish the effect of each climate forcing, and so play an important part in determining the climate sensitivity and future climate <b>state.</b> <b>Feedback</b> in general is the process in which changing one quantity changes a second quantity, and the change in the second quantity in turn changes the first.

50|$|As {{an example}} of such a principle, it has been proved that if a stable {{observer}} and stable <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> are designed for a linear time-invariant system, then the combined observer and feedback will be stable. The separation principle does not hold in general (for example for non-linear systems). Another example is the separation of the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control solution into the Kalman filter and optimal controller for a linear-quadratic regulator. A separation principle also exists for the control of quantum systems.|$|E

Instead, indirect effects of the internal state are observed {{by way of the}} system outputs. A simple example is that of vehicles in a tunnel: the rates and velocities at which vehicles enter and leave the tunnel can be observed directly, but the exact state inside the tunnel can only be estimated. If a system is observable, it is possible to fully reconstruct the system state from its output measurements using the state observer.|$|E
