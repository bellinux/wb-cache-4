5000|$|Inside, {{the vehicle}} had a {{completely}} new interior, with headrests on all seats, a new polyurethane coated dashboard with integrated instrument clusters and <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> <b>controls</b> for windscreen wipers/washers and indicator/high beam lights, rear window heater and other features. Chassis-wise the vehicle featured a vacuum servo assisted split-contour braking system, front disc brakes, radial tyres and [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub caps. The prototypes were powered by a 2990 cc GAZ-24-14 V6 with a cast iron cylinder block originally developed for the GAZ-24, and the identical GAZ-24-18, with an aluminium block. Both engines produced 136 hp, but the latter was much lighter in weight. The shown GAZ-3101 prototypes also featured automatic transmission, power steering, electric windows and air conditioning. Like its predecessors, the prototypes took part in much publicised tours of the USSR, and GAZ was ready to begin its pre-conveyor batches in 1978.|$|E
5000|$|The KB Centuras {{sold and}} {{assembled}} in Australia {{not only had}} a 1,981 cc version of the 4-cylinder Simca engine but were also available with Australian-made 6-cylinder pushrod 3,523/4,014 cc hemi engines and BorgWarner 3-speed automatic and 3- or 4-speed manual gearboxes. The four offered 122 hp (SAE), the sixes 142/167 hp (SAE) respectively. The KB series was sold in XL and GL trims, the latter having more equipment, including tachometer, clock, low fuel light (rare for 1975), rear bumper overriders, console (no storage) and optional vinyl roofs. There were no rear demister fitted, although a Smiths unit was fitted by some dealers. The KB model's European pedigree was obvious, with instrumentation in the opposite order and <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> <b>controls</b> on opposite sides. All KB GL spec cars came equipped with a tachometer, however it was optional on XL spec cars (whereas later KC cars only gained a tachometer through special order, {{or as part of}} the Sports option package) Interior flow ventilation was improved over the larger Valiant models, as the Centura had two face-level ventilation outlets. Although the A55 6 cylinder Centura Sports Package was fitted to some vehicles ( [...] included body stripes, styled wheels, woodgrain instrument cluster with tachometer, clock and Boca Raton cloth trim), it was common to see dealer fitted options including the styled road wheel option, and stencilled side stripes and bonnet black outs. The sixes also came with larger brakes (60 mm ventilated front discs and 25.4 mm rear finned drums) and a tandem brake reservoir. The six-cylinder Hemi cars used a 5-stud wheel bolt pattern, and the early 4-cylinder cars used a 4-stud wheel bolt pattern and only featured solid unventilated brake discs. Later 4-cylinder cars shared the same brakes and stud pattern as the 6 cylinder cars, and thus the same wheels. All Centura models were factory fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, however there was no power steering option. Steering could be heavy, so correct tyre fitment and pressures were a must. Factory / dealer fitted air, with the unit located below the heater controls was available but seldom optioned. Very few Centura's left the dealership with e33 engine code although a few examples do exist. One owned by a previous valiant production worker who ordered the option from new, it is now a sought after collectors item.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the most}} basic sense, {{headlight}} flashing {{is a way of}} attracting attention, for any of a number of purposes. [...] In this way, it can be perceived as the visual equivalent of blowing the horn, again for any of a number of reasons. [...] This equivalency is underscored by some car owner's manuals, which identify the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> <b>control</b> lever which allows headlight flashing as the [...] "optical horn". Headlight flashing can be used simply to let other drivers know of one's presence, or as a response to acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers. Some drivers flash their headlights as a signal that they are yielding the right of way to another driver, for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs.|$|R

50|$|The Figo {{underwent}} a facelift in October 2012. The facelift had around 100 changes including some major cosmetic changes like new headlamps, new <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> mounted audio <b>controls,</b> new tail lamps, alloy wheels, new front bumper {{and a new}} seat fabric design. However, the car remains unchanged mechanically and uses the same 1.2 L Duratec petrol and 1.4 L Duratorq diesel engine.|$|R
50|$|When {{compared}} to the preceding V8, the design was fresh and more modern. It {{looked more like a}} Lagonda than the V8 it replaced. Indeed, the chassis was an evolution of the Lagonda's, with a de Dion tube rear suspension, located by triangulated radius rods and a Watts linkage, and a double wishbone unit at the front. To cut costs, many of the less-important pieces came from other companies, as had been the case for many an Aston past. The sleek headlights and taillights were Audi 200 and Volkswagen Scirocco units, respectively, while General Motors, Jaguar, and Ford provided the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> climate <b>control</b> panel, and dash switches. In fact, Ford had purchased Aston Martin and Jaguar shortly before the Virage debuted.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a steering assistance system {{that helps the}} driver to avoid unintended lane departure. Using a DC motor installed on the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> a <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> law takes action in situations of drifting off the lane. Furthermore, the steering control law provides lane keeping for straight {{as well as for}} curved roads until the driver recovers attention. In order to minimize a potential lane overshoot after the activation moment, and to reduce the curvature effect on the lane keeping performance, the reachability set of the vehicle, when the assistance is active, has been minimized during control design phase. This goal has been achieved by means of BMI optimization methods (Bilinear Matrix Inequalities) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Electric power {{steering}} (EPS) systems are rapidly replacing existing traditional hydraulic {{power steering}} systems due to their important advantages such as fuel and cost savings, environmental compatibility and flexibility. Many articles are available in this field in which EPS is viewed only from one specific aspect. Other aspects have been introduced only by brief equations neglecting some main details regarding the important effects of ignored parts. Therefore, it is quite necessary to make a complete analysis of every part of this system with a right combination between them. It makes a comprehensive simulation system for EPS. This matter needs sufficient knowledge in mechanical, electrical and control sciences and how to assemble them with each other properly. Therefore, Mechatronic is the most appropriate branch of science to achieve this goal. In this paper, a complete model of EPS is presented which includes a 7 -D. O. F mechanical model of steering system. A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) is used to supply the assist torque to <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> Vector <b>Control</b> Method is utilized for controlling the motor.

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering. Johannesburg, May 2014 Race vehicles depend mainly on passive safety systems, such as the steel collapsible <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> investigated in this report. There is no existing literature that investigates alternate impact testing methods that meet the F ed eration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) requirements. In this study, the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were statically crushed to determine the e ect of residual stresses. The <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> were observed to collapse on themselves, as the top surface deformed, the 90 bends unfolded, and the 50 bends folded further on the side supports. The reduced residual stresses in the 90 bends after stress relief annealing, resulted in a strengthening e ect and therefore a larger bending moment was required to unfold the bend. The residual stresses did not greatly a ect the overall strength and energy absorption characteristics of the <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> because the deformation of the 90 bends only contributed a small percentage towards the energy absorption ability of the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> In conclusion, zero residual stresses in cold bent steel plates are desired if the plate is being unfolded as the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> collapses, however residual stresses can be useful if the plate is being bent further. The quasi-static approximation {{has been reported to}} be suitable if the impact mass is much larger than the impact structure. The quasi-static approximation was used to calculate the acceleration-time history of each tested specimen from the static compression tests. Numerical simulation of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> impact test illustrated that the impact mass and <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> experienced a series of high frequency collisions. This phenomenon was due to the momentum transfer between the impact mass and <b>steering</b> <b>column,</b> i. e. the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> locally accelerated away from the impact mass, it then slowed down as the energy was absorbed which allowed the impact mass to again collide with the <b>steering</b> <b>column.</b> The numerical simulation and experimental results showed good correlation after having been digitally ltered using a low pass digital lter with a cuto frequency of 1000 Hz as per Le Mans regulations. The quasi-static approximation was found to give excellent agreement with the digitally ltered results, however due to its nature it could not replicate the high speed oscillatory behaviour. In conclusion, the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> under investigation was found to be inertia sensitive, and the quasi-static approximation may only be used to evaluate the energy absorption characteristics of the <b>steering</b> <b>column</b> on its own according to the FIA requirements...|$|R

40|$|Several {{parts of}} {{automotive}} <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> are fixed by both dimensional interference and mechanical-plastic sticking of one part to another. To determine {{the effect of}} these fixing procedures on the joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> pull-out tests were performed. Samples with and without sticking were tested. The influence of the sticking and interference procedures on the integrity of the <b>steering</b> <b>columns</b> was experimentally determined by force-distance curves. The results suggested that the sticking increases more than twice the pull-out force and augments about 24 % the absorbed energy in the whole pull-out process. Statistical fitting tests show that pull-out forces obey a log-normal distribution. From these data were possible to estimate the structural reliability of joints of <b>steering</b> <b>columns,</b> which results indicate that the fail probability is close to zero for a minimum pull-out force of 2000 N.
