5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> This {{was based on the}} principle of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Bruichladdich Radical {{competed in}} the entire LMS season. Having retired at the opening event, the 1000 km of Monza, the team took a ninth place overall finish and third in class at the 1000 km of Valencia; in the latter race, Greaves and Moseley were joined by Robin Liddell. Following this event, the team participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time, however, Tim Greaves crashed out after 90 minutes, forcing the team to withdraw. The {{following}} LMS race, which was the 1000km of Nürburgring, was little more successful; Greaves and Moseley finished 35th, and ninth in class, after a <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> problem had cost the team around 30 minutes. A retirement at the 1000 km of Spa followed, due to engine failure after 81 laps, before the season finale, the 1000 km of Silverstone saw the team take 14th overall and seventh in class; Jacob Greaves filling the third driver's slot for the team. The team finished joint-eighth in the LMP2 team's standings; level with Team LNT and Kruse Motorsport on eight points.|$|E
25|$|A {{method of}} {{reversing}} {{the car was}} offered on later models via a reversible Dynastart unit. The Dynastart unit, which doubled as both <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> and dynamo on these models incorporated a built-in reversing solenoid switch. After stopping the engine and operating this switch the Dynastart, and consequently the engine, would rotate in the opposite direction.|$|E

50|$|A {{sprag clutch}} {{is used in}} the {{electric}} <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> of modern motorcycle engines to replace the Bendix gear common to automobile starters.|$|R
25|$|If the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> or battery failed, the 2CV had {{the option}} of hand-cranking, the jack handle serving as {{starting}} handle through dogs {{on the front of the}} crankshaft at the centre of the fan. This feature, once universal on cars and still common in 1948 when the 2CV was introduced, was kept until the end of production in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 volts (DC) when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle engine <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that presses a friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.|$|E
25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted {{oil filter}} check valve was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their oil filters. The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> - a Ford V8 oil filter {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Cleveland-based VLN Corporation was {{merged into}} Sheller-Globe Corporation. VLN's Leece-Neville {{divisions}} supplied heavy-duty alternators, <b>starter</b> <b>motors,</b> and fractional horse power motors for automotive and industrial customers.|$|R
50|$|Each main {{generator}} powered two traction motors. Unlike No. 18000, {{there was no}} auxiliary diesel engine and the turbine was started by battery power, using the {{main generator}}s as <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{began to}} be {{equipped}} with electrical systems around 1930, powered by a battery and small wind-driven generator. The systems were initially not powerful enough to drive <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b> Introduction of engine-driven generators solved the problem.|$|R
25|$|After the 2005–06 A1 Grand Prix season, Yoong raced in the 2006 Le Mans Series {{as well as}} the 2006 Le Mans 24 Hrs for Jan Lammers, the A1 Team Netherlands seat holder {{with team}} Racing For Holland. Yoong was very competitive, holding third {{position}} in Lammers' Dome-Judd when the throttle stuck, sending the car into the wall at the first chicane on the Mulsanne Straight and breaking both steering arms. In the race at Istanbul, Yoong set the fastest lap 90 minutes into the race and retired after the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> failed during a pit stop. Lammers and Yoong elected not attend the Spa 1000km after a team decision to change of the engine from a Mugen to a Judd.|$|E
25|$|Mild hybrid, is {{a vehicle}} that cannot be driven solely on its {{electric}} motor, because the electric motor {{does not have enough}} power to propel the vehicle on its own. Mild hybrids only include some of the features found in hybrid technology, and usually achieve limited fuel consumption savings, up to 15 percent in urban driving and 8 to 10 percent overall cycle. A mild hybrid is essentially a conventional vehicle with oversize <b>starter</b> <b>motor,</b> allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly and cleanly. The motor is often mounted between the engine and transmission, taking the place of the torque converter, and is used to supply additional propulsion energy when accelerating. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the gasoline engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, the motor is used for regenerative braking to recapture energy. As compared to full hybrids, mild hybrids have smaller batteries and a smaller, weaker motor/generator, which allows manufacturers to reduce cost and weight.|$|E
25|$|Prodrive Racing Australia {{scored a}} one-two finish at the Wilson Security Sandown 500, with Mark Winterbottom and Steve Owen taking victory ahead of {{teammates}} Chaz Mostert and Cameron Waters. The Tekno Autosports pairing of Shane Van Gisbergen and Jonathon Webb finished in third place. Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell started from pole position and led {{for the majority}} of the race, but a puncture, caused by a bracket dislodged by a pit crew member during a pit stop, saw them finish in fifteenth place. Russell Ingall returned to the series to substitute for the injured James Courtney. Ingall partnered Jack Perkins, the pair finishing ninth after starting from twenty-fourth place on the grid. The pairings of Will and Alex Davison and Todd Kelly and Alex Buncombe both finished multiple laps down, the former pair due to a <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> problem at a pit stop and the latter due to Buncombe running off the track. The only retirement during the race was the car of Nick Percat and Oliver Gavin with steering failure. Winterbottom extended his championship lead over Mostert to 198 points, while David Reynolds, who finished fifth with Dean Canto, moved up to third place in the standings after Craig Lowndes and Steven Richards only managed to finish thirteenth. Winterbottom was fined $3000 for performing a celebratory burnout on the main straight after he finished the race.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} cold {{starting}} {{has been greatly}} reduced since the introduction of engine starters, which are now commonplace on all modern vehicles. The higher revs {{that can be achieved}} using electric <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> improves the chance of successful ignition.|$|R
50|$|Bosch's core {{products}} are automotive components (including brakes, controls, electrical drives, electronics, fuel systems, generators, <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> and steering systems), industrial products (including drives and controls, packaging technology and consumer goods) and building products (including household appliances, power tools, security systems and thermotechnology).|$|R
5000|$|The E6 and E7 powered Valueliners {{featured}} a flat bonnet and 2 piece mudguards while E9 V8 powered versions had a sloped bonnet and a raised cab. As with most Macks at the time, all valueliners {{came out of}} the factory with air <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
500|$|Commander Caractacus Pott is an {{inventor}} who buys and renovates an old car after gaining money from inventing and selling whistle-like sweets to Lord Skrumshus, the wealthy {{owner of a}} local confectionery factory. The car, a [...] "Paragon Panther", was the sole production of the Paragon motor-car company before it went bankrupt. [...] It is a four-seat touring car with an enormous bonnet, or hood. [...] After the restoration is complete, the car is named for the noises made by its <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> and the characteristic two loud backfires it makes when it starts.|$|E
500|$|By the 12 Hours of Sebring a {{few months}} later, the TX was able to improve its pace, this time {{qualifying}} third, only a second behind a Porsche 907 and a Ford GT40. [...] The turbine ran reliably at first but, as the race continued, debris damaged the turbine and caused it to shake loose from its mounts. The TX was eventually retired after six hours. [...] Following Sebring, the International Championship returned to Europe, and the Howmet team followed. They entered the BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch. Wastegate problems once again caused the car to wreck, this time after only seven laps. [...] Staying in Britain, the Howmet team entered a national sprint race at Oulton Park for British driver Hugh Dibley. The failure of a <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> during a pit stop, however, once again denied the TX the possibility of finishing the hour-long event.|$|E
500|$|Before a Hammond organ {{can produce}} sound, the motor {{that drives the}} tonewheels must come up to speed. On most models, {{starting}} a Hammond organ involves two switches. The [...] "Start" [...] switch turns a dedicated <b>starter</b> <b>motor,</b> which must run for about 12 seconds. Then, the [...] "Run" [...] switch is turned on for about four seconds. The [...] "Start" [...] switch is then released, whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound. The H-100 and E-series consoles and L-100 and T-100 spinet organs, however, had a self-starting motor that required only a single [...] "On" [...] switch. A pitch bend effect can be created on the Hammond organ by turning the [...] "Run" [...] switch off and on again. This briefly cuts power to the generators, causing them to run {{at a slower pace}} and generate a lower pitch for a short time. Hammond's New B3 contains similar switches to emulate this effect, though it is a digital instrument.|$|E
5|$|Magnets {{are made}} of heavy metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, bismuth, praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium, and dysprosium. Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of {{permanent}} magnet commercially available. They are key components of, for example, car door locks, <b>starter</b> <b>motors,</b> fuel pumps, and power windows.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines produce {{a lot of}} heat during their combustion cycle. This can have a negative effect when it reaches various heat-sensitive components such as sensors, batteries and <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b> As a result, thermal insulation is necessary to prevent the heat from the exhaust reaching these components.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{rotating}} {{machines with}} commutators almost exclusively use carbon brushes, {{which may have}} copper powder mixed in to improve conductivity. Metallic copper brushes {{can be found in}} toy or very small motors, such as the one illustrated above, and some motors which only operate very intermittently, such as automotive <b>starter</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
500|$|A serious {{incident}} occurred on 17 October 2004, when Wessex Trains [...] Pacer DMU 143613, forming the 20:06 2W63 service from [...] to [...] with 143621, caught fire between {{the site of}} the former station at [...] and Nailsea and Backwell. Fire services took two hours to get the blaze under control. None of the 23 passengers and crew were killed, but three were treated on-site for the effects of smoke inhalation. One carriage was completely burnt out, and the other was badly damaged, causing the train to be written off. The line through Nailsea was closed until 03:30 the following morning, when the train was hauled to St Philips Marsh Traction and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot for examination. The unit was later taken to Crewe Works, where it was stored, then to Cardiff Canton TMD where it was scrapped. The Rail Safety and Standards Board issued a report into the incident, concluding that the fire was caused by electrical arcing between the live <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> cable (which had damaged insulation) and the unit's underframe, causing accumulated oily residues to ignite.|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} {{hour of the}} race Gary Hirsch lost power in his Greaves Gibson-Nissan through the Esses {{and came to a}} halt; the car would later be {{abandoned}} after Hirsch was unable to repair a broken battery terminal. The No. 71 Ferrari was forced to the garage to fix <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> problems, bowing out of its battle with Corvette and Aston Martin in LMGTE Pro. As dusk settled on the circuit, the No. 18 Porsche of Dumas braked too late for Mulsanne Corner and hit a tyre barrier. The car was able to return to the pit lane, only requiring new front bodywork, but the car fell to fifth position. Not long after Paul-Loup Chatin crashed his Signatech Alpine at Mulsanne Corner, bringing the safety cars out for the third time of the race. During this slow period Rob Bell pulled the No. 97 Aston Martin off course and onto the inside run-off area at the Mulsanne Straight and retired. When racing resumed, Hülkenberg was able to attack the leaders, first overtaking Webber's Porsche around the outside on the opening lap then passing Rast when he made a scheduled pit stop. Webber was later given a one-minute stop and go penalty for passing in a yellow flag zone, dropping him to fourth place. Nissan lost one of their three LMP1 entries when Tsugio Matsuda's No. 21 car stopped at Arnage with a suspension failure that caused its front-left wheel to detach from the vehicle and was unable to continue. The No. 22 Nissan also suffered a setback when it hit a loose wheel out on the Mulsanne Straight at [...] and required a lengthy repair to its front-end.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regenerative}} brake concept was further {{developed in the}} early 1980s by David Arthurs, an electrical engineer, using [...] components, military surplus, and an Opel GT. The voltage controller to link the batteries, motor (a jet-engine <b>starter</b> <b>motor),</b> and DC generator was Arthurs'. The vehicle exhibited [...] fuel efficiency, and plans for it were marketed by Mother Earth News.|$|E
50|$|The CX {{eventually}} {{acquired a}} reputation for high running costs, which over time cut sales. Ironically, it was the components standard to any automobile (steel, door hinges, <b>starter</b> <b>motors,</b> electrical connections, etc.) that proved troublesome in service, not the advanced components. The quality of construction improved too slowly to eliminate this perception.|$|R
50|$|The 348 {{was fitted}} with dual-computer engine {{management}} using twin Bosch Motronic ECUs, double-redundant anti-lock brakes, and self-diagnosing {{air conditioning and}} heating systems. Late versions (1993 and beyond) have Japanese-made <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> and Nippondenso power generators to improve reliability, {{as well as the}} battery located within the front left fender for better weight distribution.|$|R

2500|$|Just {{like the}} {{agricultural}} machinery made by Laverda S.p.A., the other family business, Laverdas were built to be indestructible. [...] The parallel twin cylinder engine featured {{no less than}} five main bearings (four crankcase bearings and a needle-roller outrigger bearing in the primary chaincase cover), a duplex cam chain, and a <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> easily twice as powerful as needed. [...] Of course, this made the engine and subsequently the entire bike heavier than other bikes of the same vintage, such as the Ducati 750.|$|E
2500|$|Developed {{using two}} {{modified}} cylinder banks from the Siddeley Puma, the Tiger was a liquid-cooled 60 degree V12 engine with the advanced feature {{of an electric}} <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> protected by a friction clutch. A reduction gear arrangement was provided for the propeller drive with a ratio of 0.559:1. The company claimed a power output of 600hp (447kW) but this was regarded as optimistic. Flight testing by a Royal Aircraft Establishment test pilot, Frank Courtenay, revealed problems and his opinion of the engine was low as the following quote shows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{gasoline}} engine is a , 1.0 litre, ECA series 3-cylinder unit providing lean burn operation with an air-to-fuel ratio that can reach 25.8 to 1. The engine utilizes lightweight aluminum, magnesium, and plastic to minimize weight. The electrical motor assist adds another [...] {{and a maximum}} of 36 pound-feet (49 Nm) of torque when called on, with the aim to boost performance {{to the level of}} a typical 1.5 L petrol engine. It also acts as a generator during deceleration and braking to recharge the vehicle's batteries, and as the Insight's <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> (This improves fuel efficiency and extends the lifetime and fade resistance of the brakes, without adding unsprung weight). When the car is not moving, for example at a stop light, the engine shuts off. Power steering is electric, reducing accessory drag.|$|E
50|$|Diesel {{engines are}} more {{susceptible}} to hydrolock than gasoline engines. Due to their higher compression ratios, diesel engines have a much smaller final combustion chamber volume, requiring much less liquid to hydrolock. Diesel engines also tend to have higher torque, rotating inertia, and stronger <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> than gasoline engines. The result is that a diesel engine is more likely to suffer catastrophic damage.|$|R
50|$|The PicoScope Advanced Automotive Diagnostics Kit enables {{testing of}} ignition, {{injectors}} and fuel pumps, starter and charging circuits, batteries, alternators, <b>starter</b> <b>motors,</b> and timer relays. The Kit {{is compatible with}} any vehicle make or model, and can measure and test virtually all electrical and electronic components and circuits. Power comes from USB port of PC so no batteries or power leads are required.|$|R
50|$|Introduction of {{electric}} <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> for aero engines increased convenience {{at the expense}} of extra weight and complexity. They were a necessity for flying boats with high mounted, inaccessible engines. Powered by an onboard battery, ground electrical supply or both, the starter is operated by a key or switch in the cockpit. The key system usually facilitates switching of the magnetos.|$|R
