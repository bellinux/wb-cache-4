5|$|In September 1879 the Jeannette, an ex-Royal Navy gunboat {{converted}} by the US Navy for Arctic exploration, and {{commanded by}} George W. De Long, entered the pack ice {{north of the}} Bering Strait. She remained ice-bound for nearly two years, drifting {{to the area of}} the New Siberian Islands, before being crushed and sunk on 13 June 1881. Her crew escaped in boats and made for the Siberian coast; most, including De Long, subsequently perished either during the boat journey or in the wastelands of the Lena River delta. Three years later, relics from the Jeannette appeared on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> in the vicinity of Julianehaab on the southwest coast of Greenland. These items, frozen into the drifting ice, included clothing bearing crew members' names and documents signed by De Long; they were indisputably genuine.|$|E
5|$|Since Herrick and {{his brother}} began selling {{manipulated}} taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, {{can be found in}} many places beyond Douglas. The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called The Jackalope. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle, Australia, uses a leaping jackalope as its logo. In 1986, James Abdnor, a senator from South Dakota, gave U.S. President Ronald Reagan a stuffed jackalope (rabbit head with antlers) during a presidential campaign stop in Rapid City.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of observing cosmological factors is also {{seen on the}} other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The Forbidden City in Beijing is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: North, South, East, West and Centre. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing {{him in front of}} the circumpolar stars. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as feng shui.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled {{from the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and dismantled with it the raja, {{seen by many as}} obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

25|$|The Lapstone Zig Zag {{became a}} {{bottleneck}} because, among other reasons, {{the length of}} the top and bottom roads restricted train lengths. A single-track tunnel was built in 1892 to replace the zig zag. However, this tunnel was on a steep gradient, with a ruling grade of 1 in 33, which caused problems with the smoke from hard-working locomotives. These problems pre-dated the fume problems with the first Cascade Tunnel on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Operation Millpond B-26s {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to strike at Kong Le, but the strike was stayed by an event on the far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The Bay of Pigs Invasion failed, and that failure gave pause to U.S. actions in Laos. A ceasefire was sought. Simultaneously, the Programs Evaluation Office shed its civilian guise and went above ground to become a Military Advisory Assistance Group. Emblematic of the change, the Hotfoot teams donned their U.S. uniforms and became White Star Mobile Training Teams.|$|E
25|$|This novel {{references}} actual {{events with}} accurate historical detail, like {{all in this}} series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the fourth of eleven novels (beginning with The Surgeon's Mate) that might take {{five or six years}} to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O'Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (in the Author's Note for The Far <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World,</b> the tenth novel in this series). The events of The Yellow Admiral again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the end of}} the 16th century, the Portuguese {{merchant}} fleets {{had reached}} China (where they founded the commercial colony of Macau), as well as the island archipelagos of present-day Indonesia and Japan. They established the ports of call of the Eastern trade route and made commercial agreements with the chiefs and kings in Angola and Mozambique. A large colonial empire was consolidated by Afonso de Albuquerque, his armed forces securing those ports on the Indian Ocean in locations convenient for ships outbound from Lisbon against competition from the Turks and Arabs. Local territories were generally not seized, excepting the ports that carried on a profitable trade with the natives. Meanwhile, on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Pedro Álvares Cabral had arrived at Brazil in 1500.|$|E
25|$|In his Divina commedia ("Divine comedy"; set in {{the year}} 1300), Dante Alighieri {{employed}} the concept of taking Virgil as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of Purgatorio). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to Limbo just {{at the edge of}} Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, {{at the center of the}} world, Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of Cocytus. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.|$|E
25|$|On 6 March 1970, the Pathet Lao took {{advantage}} of the battlefield situation—which included the onset of nonflying weather—to offer the Royal Lao Government (RLG) a five-point peace plan to settle the war to their satisfaction. That same day, on the far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> President Nixon misinformed the American public by denying that any Americans had been killed in Laos. The next day, the RLG publicly countered the Pathet Lao with their own public three point proposal based on PAVN withdrawal from Laos. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, who was a Neutralist, used private channels to let it be known the RLG would halt their military operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail if the communists agreed to a ceasefire in northern Laos. However, no ceasefire eventuated.|$|E

25|$|The {{books in}} this series by Patrick O'Brian were re-issued in the US by W. W. Norton & Co. in 1992, after a re-discovery of the author and this series by Norton, finding a new {{audience}} for the entire series. Norton issued The Far <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> eight years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, J. B. Lippincott & Co., who asked O'Brian to write the first book in the series, Master and Commander published in 1969. Collins picked {{it up in the}} UK in 1970, and continued to publish each novel as O'Brian completed another story. Beginning with The Nutmeg of Consolation in 1991, the novels were released {{at about the same time}} in the USA (by W. W. Norton) and the UK (by HarperCollins, the name of Collins after a merger).|$|E
25|$|Although James II had {{permitted}} the Huguenots {{to settle in}} England, he had enjoyed an amicable relationship with his co-religionist Louis XIV, realising {{the importance of the}} friendship for his own Catholicising measures at home against the suspicions of his Protestant majority. But the Huguenot presence gave an immense boost to anti-French discourse, and they joined forces with elements in England already highly suspicious of James. However, conflicts between French and English commercial interests in North America had caused severe friction between the two governments: the French had grown antagonistic towards the Hudson's Bay Company and the New England colonies, while the English looked upon French pretensions in New France as encroaching upon their own possessions. This rivalry had spread to the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> where English and French East India companies had already embarked upon hostilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{multiplex}} {{consists of}} 10 cinema rooms with between 68 and 404 seats, spread over two levels {{with a total}} of 1580 seats opened in November 2013.

A fast food area as well as a night beerhouse are integrated {{within the confines of the}} cinema centre having also two other shops. This cinema complex with of entertainment and exhibition spaces has the distinction of offering, in all of its rooms, entirely to digital broadcasts and is equipped to watch movies in 3D. Cultural or sports broadcasts on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> are proposed. Finally, this complex has the distinction of being used for conferences or congresses through the audio-visual and videoconferencing facilities which it offers and the available gauge in terms of seating capacity. The creation of a new square in front of the multiplex highlighting the continuing interdependence of the festival hall, cinema complex and, in the wider spectrum, the amphitheatre will allow cultural or economic events.|$|E
