40|$|Like any Oracle {{scientist}} {{at some point}} in your optimizing endeavors you have probably stared at an extended SQL trace file and pondered the reason why Oracle calls a potentially sequential disk read a db file <b>scattered</b> <b>read</b> and a likely random disk read a db file sequential read. I have read accounts for this seeming discrepancy none more interesting than Jeff Holt’s assertion that these event names correspond to how blocks are stored in memory (Named Backwards, 1), i. e. blocks are either stored in memory in a scattered or contiguous manner. Irrespective of the inspiration for the event nomenclature this explanation requires further lucidity; especially when confronted with a system call that reads blocks into contiguous memory but is tagged a db file <b>scattered</b> <b>read</b> event. While the db file <b>scattered</b> <b>read</b> event name is intuitive in the context of how blocks are stored in memory, can the same be asserted for the db file sequential read event? If a db file sequential read is a single-block read isn’t it inherently self-contiguous once read into virtual memory? Is it that simple? It would appear tautological to tag db file sequential read to a notion that an Oracle block is stored in contiguous memory. If it is that simplistic why isn’t a db file <b>scattered</b> <b>read</b> called a db file multi-block sequential read? Is there another more subtle reason Oracle decided to call it a db file <b>scattered</b> <b>read?</b> How do contiguous memory read operations supporting db file <b>scattered</b> <b>read</b> events get scattered? Other potential interpretations of this contiguous notion for db file sequential read events are relegated to the frameworks of successive db file sequential read events for a single SQL statement or multi-block db file sequentia...|$|E

A big issue is the seek time for CD-ROM drives (~80 ms), which exceeds that of hard disks (~10 ms) by a large factor. On the other hand, because files are packed together, reading a compressed block may thus bring {{in more than one}} file into the cache. The effects of tail packing are known to improve seek times (cf. reiserfs, btrfs), especially for small files. Some performance tests related to cloop have been conducted.|$|R

For this anniversary, a short {{review of the}} main features of this picture will be presented with its evolution over the years. The future experiments at the LHC collider will provide decisive tests for the impact picture at high energy. In the year 1978, BSW proposed an impact parameter description of the high energy behavior of elastic p − p and ¯p−p scattering [1]. A main feature was the peculiar form of the energy dependence of the pomeron, {{based on the results}} of Cheng and Wu [2, 3] derived from the high-energy behavior of quantum field theory. Later, in 1984, with the advent of ¯p − p experiments, a more complete analysis was performed [4, 5]. I will present a recent update of the results which are focused on the LHC energy domain. An extension to the elastic processes π − p and K − p can be found in [6]. Moreover, we have also shown that under certain assumptions γ − p and γ − γ total cross sections can be predicted [7].

This region is the DY analog to small Bjorken-xBj DIS. In addition, coherence effects due to multiple scattering in proton-nucleus (pA) collisions can also be studied. We developed an approach [1, 2], in which the DY cross section is expressed in terms of the same color dipole cross section as DIS. Our approach is formulated in the rest frame of the target, where DY dilepton production looks like bremsstrahlung of massive photons, rather than parton annihilation, fig. 1.

The photon-quark transverse separation is denoted by ρ and α is the fraction of the light-cone momentum of the initial quark taken away by the photon. This approach is especially suitable to describe nuclear effects, since it allows one to apply Glauber multiple scattering theory. At very high energy, the transverse separation between γ ∗ and q in the |γ ∗ q 〉 state is frozen during propagation through the nucleus, due to Lorentz time dilatation. Therefore, partonic configurations with fixed separations in impact parameter space are eigenstates of the interaction and one can generalize (2) to nuclear targets by replacing σq¯q(αρ) with σ A ∫ q¯q(αρ) = 2 d 2 { (b 1 − exp − σq¯q(αρ...|$|R

We illustrate how the method successfully works in the 1 S 0 channel for the One Pion Exchange (OPE) and Two Pion Exchange (TPE) potentials. While it is widely accepted that the NN-interaction is not well known at short distances and different NN potentials 1 disagree most below 0. 5 fm, there is an unanimous agreement on the fact that pion exchanges 2 govern their long distance behaviour in the spirit of an Effective Field Theory 3.

Predictions for the LHC are also discussed At high energies, QCD scattering enters a novel regime governed by large gluon densities and coherent, non-linear phenomena, including saturation of the hadronic wave functions, known as the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) (see e. g., the review 1 and references therein). Nuclear collisions performed at RHIC provide a good opportunity to explore the CGC regime, since the gluon densities in a nucleus are already large even at moderate energies.

40|$|Metagenomics is {{the study}} of the genomic content of {{microbial}} communities, acquired through DNA sequencing technology. The main advantage of metagenomics is that it can overcome the limitations of individual genome sequencing, that can work only on the few culturable microbes. Unfortunately, the analysis of metagenomic data is challenging. Firstly, we do not know from which genome a DNA sequence of the data, called read, was sampled. In most of the cases, the full sequences of the source genomes are not available, and even their number is unknown. Secondly, the information contained in a metagenome is <b>scattered</b> among <b>reads</b> much shorter then their source genomes. The topic of this thesis is the computational analysis of metagenomic data in order to understand their content. We focus mainly on binning, that consists in clustering the reads according to the biological information they contain. Chapters 2 and 3 present two binning methods. The former clusters reads according to their similarity with proteins, using combinatorial optimization. The second performs taxonomic assignment of reads by clustering reads at multiple taxonomic ranks. Chapter 4 deals with genomic signatures, which are functions frequently adopted by binning methods to have a vector space representation of the reads. We compare experimentally the performances of different genomic signatures on metagenomic data; new signatures are also studied. A case study in metagenomics data annotation is described in Chapters 5 and 6. The related metagenomic project investigates the anammox bacteria Candidatus `Brocadia fulgida', sequencing the same microbial community with three different technologies. Anammox bacteria have been successfully employed to treat highly loaded wastewater in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment systems.

40|$|In a {{previous}} publication we have derived an expression {{for the full}} distorted spectrum arising when the photons of the cosmic background radiation are absorbed and emitted by an optically thin gas. The expression simply adds up {{the effects of the}} joint probability that an electron absorbs an incoming photon of frequency ¯ν and emits it with a frequency ν. We here show that such an expression is identical to the Kompaneets equation describing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect. This clearly shows that the two pictures, diffusion and absorption-emission are mathematically equivalent to first order in the Compton parameter. Other consequences of this result are also discussed. In a recent publication [1] we have given a detailed discussion of how the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect [2] [3] may be interpreted in terms of a rather simplified picture as an absorption-emission process. In fact, our view is that such an effect is indeed that of an absorption-emission process in which a few photons happen to be captured by electrons in the optically thin gas. An electron moving with a given thermal velocity emits (scatters) a photon with a certain incoming frequency ¯ν and outgoing frequency ν. The line breath of this process is readily calculated from kinetic theory taking into account that the media in which the process takes place has a small optical depth directly related to the Compton parameter y. When the resulting expression, which will be called structure factor, is convoluted with the incoming flux of photons obtained from Planck’s distribution, one easily obtains the disturbed spectra.

40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} Optical Fiber Sensors (OFS) {{utilizing}} Brillouin <b>scattering</b> {{effect for}} <b>reading</b> distributed measurements of temperature and strains has been addressed. Several authors have stressed the actual theoretical and practical difficulties connected to this new kind of measurement such as mechanical characterization of optical fibers, decaying of strains in the protective coatings, spatial resolution of the Brillouin scattering, brittleness of the glass core, elastic-plastic response of the coatings, end effects, and different effects of strain readings in dilatation or in contraction. Moreover for strain readings, a few technical devices have been proposed to connect the optical fiber sensor to the structure, {{in order to obtain}} better results in terms of accuracy of measurements. Recently, several authors have shown that, by means of distributed experimental strain readings, the safety monitoring and assessment of large structures as bridges, pipes, high rise buildings, dams, and tunnels is made easier. In spite of the above mentioned uncertainties, the greatest utility of these new sensors is demonstrated by the authors for detection of defects rising in large structures, and accuracy and reliability of measurements are discussed. A recent paper by some of these authors has provided for the mechanical response of optical fiber, when it is embedded in a bearing supported beam-like element, where OFSs are treated in the framework of elastic Functionally Graded Material Cylinders, under symmetrical load conditions. The achieved theoretical results characterize the complete set of the so-called no-decaying solutions, which present axial strain in the system core-jacket not varying with the radius, and hence equal to the value assumed in the supporting element. Those analytical solutions are particularly efficient for strain readings utilizing embedded sensors, because in this case the fiber core should exhibit an axial strain equal to the one on the structure to which the sensor is linked. Moreover, another set of so-called decaying solutions is obtained which was evaluated for the rate of decaying of the axial strain between the core and the support. In Part II of the current work laboratory tests will be shown, carried out on aluminium large rods in extension, equipped with embedded-type optic fiber sensors. Rods are commonly used in several structural systems, such as trusses, suspension, or cable-stayed bridges...|$|R
40|$|Exit Right: The Unravelling of John Howard Judith Brett Quarterly Essay, Black Inc, $ 14. 95 The Battle for Bennelong: The Adventures of Maxine McKew, Aged 50 Something Margot Saville Melbourne University Press, $ 24. 95 Reviewed by Brett Evans “THERE’S no {{such thing}} as {{changing}} the government without changing the [...] . country. ” So said John Howard during the final week of the 2007 federal election campaign, echoing a statement made by former prime minister Paul Keating during the 1996 campaign. “It’s not like a Christmas present you didn’t want and you can take it back at the Boxing Day Sale,” opined the doomed Howard. Desperate prime ministers of either stripe, it seems, will use this line. Translated it means: “My fellow Australians, I know what you’re intending to do, but have you really thought it through? The other guy might win and we’ll all be ruined - and I’ll be out of a job. ” For months in the lead up to the 2007 election, the opinion polls told the same story: Kevin Rudd’s Labor Party was comfortably ahead, and nothing John Howard said or did made any difference. The voters were quite relaxed and comfortable about their Christmas arrangements thank you very much. In retrospect it seems pretty obvious that many Australians had made up their minds, shifted their allegiance, and stopped listening months before polling day. It was as if voting out the Coalition after eleven years had been put on their “to do” lists - and they were just waiting for the chance to pop down the road, cast their ballot, and get it over and done with. No fuss or fanfare, just something to squeeze in between taking the kids to netball and doing the shopping. So how did the greatest Liberal leader since Menzies so badly botch it? Why did the voters turn on Howard at a time of economic prosperity? Probably because both Howard in 2007, and Keating in 1996, got it the wrong way round: it’s truer to say that when the country changes, the government changes. And according to political scientist Judith Brett in her thought-provoking essay, Exit Right: The Unravelling of John Howard, the country, and his relationship to it, had been shifting beneath Mr Howard’s feet for quite a while. Brett brings decades of studying the Liberal Party to bear in this relatively short work - and it shows. At the heart of her argument is a psychological explanation of Howard’s leadership. Drawing on the work of the late Graham Little, she describes Howard as a typical Strong Leader. Strong Leaders thrive on the politics of division because then “you can have a contest, show your strength and win. ” You’re either with a Strong Leader or against him. In the right hands it can be a very effective style of leadership, but it has its limits; as Brett points out: “Strong Leaders can’t last forever; they can’t admit their mistakes; and they’re not very good at policy. ” And this, says Brett, is exactly what happened to Howard’s leadership. He stayed on too long, his age became an issue with the voters, the war in Iraq saw his natural advantages on national security dissipate, he stubbornly refused to ratify Kyoto, he couldn’t quite bring himself to apologize to mortgage holders for rising interest rates, and during his last year in office many of the government’s big policy announcements - like those on water and the Indigenous Intervention - looked to be ill thought out and hurriedly cobbled together. And then there was Work Choices. There is an old adage, “Be careful what you wish for. ” When the Coalition gained control of the Senate in 2004 they promptly used this increased power to sign their own death warrant by bringing in an industrial relations policy that was seen to be just too radical by mainstream Australia. But not only the nation was changing; Howard’s own electorate was also undergoing a fundamental shift. A series of redistributions had made Bennelong increasingly marginal and its growing Asian population meant a clever campaign and a good Labor candidate could have an impact. And then along came every Strong Leader’s worst nightmare: Labor pre-selected a smart, capable, high profile woman. At first Maxine McKew wasn’t given much hope of dislodging John Howard, but her arrival certainly flummoxed him. As Brett comments: “unable to fight her in his usual forthright way, Howard chose to pretend that she didn’t exist. ” How this neophyte politician - a “blow in” as Tony Abbott characterized her - defeated an incumbent PM is the story told in Margot Saville’s quickie, The Battle for Bennelong: The Adventures of Maxine McKew, aged 50 something. Saville’s slight volume doesn’t have the depth of Brett’s essay, but it will be sure to find its way onto the bookshelves of the True Believers - if only as a memento of an historic Labor victory. For all time, thanks to McKew’s outstanding campaign, John Winston Howard will be forever linked to the name of Melbourne Stanley Bruce, the only other Australian prime minister to lose his own seat. Like the popstar Madonna, the former ABC and Bulletin journalist is now a one name brand - utter the name “Maxine” in Australia today and most people will know who you mean. How she brought down the man who dominated Australian politics for over a decade was, in the end, surprisingly simple: she sought out Liberal voters and tried to convince them to change over to Labor. On the Friday night of the campaign’s fifth week Saville travelled to the Eastwood Rugby Club for a fundraiser. Guest of honour: Prime Minister Howard. “I look around the room,” she writes, “at a sea of middle-aged, white upper-middle class conservatives, for whom rugby is not just a sport, but a signifier of class. ” Saville notes - probably correctly - that “there are no extra votes in the room. ” Why is Howard wasting his time here? Meanwhile on the same night, {{in another part of the}} electorate, his opponent is attending Diwali, a major Hindu festival. The Indian-born make up just over two per cent of the Bennelong electorate. In the main they are successful immigrants - business owners and professionals - who venerate education. Potential Liberal voters you would think. But many are not happy about the federal government’s treatment of Indian doctor Mohammed Haneef. There are votes to be gathered in such circumstances and McKew was in attendance: shaking hands, listening, empathising; doing, in fact, what good politicians do. Much has been made of McKew’s courting of the Asian vote in Bennelong, but really this was just a logical extension of her overall strategy: get people who had voted Liberal in the past to take a chance on change. It must be said, of course, that she had the good fortune to have a Mandarin-speaking leader, while her opponent struggled with a personal legacy on the issue of immigration stretching back to comments he made in 1988. In the end, McKew won because middle Australia was turning against the Coalition, and Bennelong is the middle of middle Australia. It was the government’s sixteenth most marginal seat and Labor needed a minimum of sixteen seats to get over the line. In retrospect it’s easy to appreciate that this underlying seismic shift, in conjunction with the “Maxine Factor,” meant Howard was always in serious trouble. Saville obviously had some access to the inner workings of Labor’s Bennelong campaign, but not as much as she would have liked, or probably needed to, to create a work with a shelf life longer than Christmas. But she’s crafted a lively <b>read,</b> <b>scattered</b> with interesting facts and insights. For example, McKew’s campaign manager organized for her office phone number to end in three eights because eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture. Four pensioners donated the $ 500 they received from the Howard government’s May budget to McKew’s campaign. Labor’s team in Bennelong door knocked 26, 000 households - a third of the electorate. When Rudd noticed that McKew didn’t know the second verse of the national anthem, he found the time to text the lines to her. As first drafts of history these two works offer something of use to the student of Australian politics. Brett’s book goes further, and will last. But for a broader audience, it’s the books that are yet to be published that will be really fascinating: the Howard memoirs, the Costello Diaries, and, of course, the Collected Text Messages of Kevin Rudd. • Brett Evans is a producer at ABC TV’s Lateline.
