40|$|While {{working in}} the inner city, I became {{interested}} in the process of Los Angeles Graffitti [...] walls with layer upon layer of "placas," spray painted in a variety of colors. Indicating the urgency of individual gang members to mark territory by their "placas," an urgency made apparent by the boldness with which they handle their consistently stylized gothic letters, a continuous process of one member making his mark, crossing it out and another "placa" being <b>sparyed</b> over it, and a risk being taken each time a change is made, and by this continuing independent process of replacement, a group piece is created. The color, linear quality, and depth perception changed by this process of layering intrigued me. Graffitti, although it is expressionistic and seemingly random, is actually a selective communication based on a rigid traditional structure. The "placas" are a formalized learned style and do not vary except by an individual gang member's ability to handle the spray paint. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary test on {{the effect}} of water extract from plants on rust {{incidence}} on coffee leaf disks at the latroratory. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of several water extract from plants on rust incidence on coffee leaf disk a laboratory condition. The study was done from March to June 2003. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications, One experimental unit consisted of eight leaf disks with 2 cm in diameter. To prepare water extract, 1 00 g of plant or its part was homogenized with 100 ml sterilized distilled water. After being passed through four layers of sterilized cheesecloth, the mixture was defined as the aliquot. Ten percent of the aliquot was <b>sparyed</b> on leaf disks before inoculation. As inoculum, uredospores developed on leaves under field condition were taken with sterilized scalpel and placed in sterilized distilled water and counted with hemacyometer to get suspension (4 x 105 uredospores per ml) spores per ml). Data on disease incidence were analyzed with ANOVA and Duncan test. The results showed that disease incidence was significantly reduced by water extract processed from the leaves of Piper betle, Azadirachta indica, and Eugeni aromatica, the rhizomes of Zingiber afficinale and Curcumq longa, stem of Cymbopogon citratus, Allium ascalonium, A. sativa, and copper fungicide. Disease was not significantly reduced in leaf disks sprayed with extract prepares from the leaves of Piper retrofractum, P. nigrum, the rhizomes of Imperata cylindrica and Alpina galanga, A. cepa,Ageratum comysoides, and Elephantopus scaber...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{chemicals}} {{are commonly used}} in controlling plant diseases. However, the fungicide resistance, residue and its environmental impact are serious problems of agriculture. Previous studies demonstrated that the nanomaterials with special {{physical and chemical properties}} showed activity against microbes and used to control plant diseases. In this study, eleven nanomaterials, including nanosilicate platelets (4), nano-silvers (3) and carbon nanotubes (5), were tested for their ability on the inhibition of the growth of plant pathogens. Results demonstrated that the nanosilicate platelets NSS 1450 and NSS 3150 were found most effective in inhibiting the growth of plant pathogens. The inhibition in spore germination was 99. 2 % to 100. 0 % for Botrytis cinerea and 84. 0 % to 100. 0 % for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in the treatment of NSS 1450 for 1 hr at ≧ 50 mg/L and the efficacy increased following the treatment time. The NSS 3150 treatment was lower inhibitory effect on spore germination than tested with NSS 1450. For mycelial growth inhibition test, the NSS 1450 showed 60. 2 % to 100. 0 % inhibition in B. cinerea and 26. 2 % to 89. 3 % in C. gloeosporioides at ≧ 500 mg/L, respectively. The NSS 3150 had the inhibition of 43. 0 % to 100. 0 % in B. cinerea and 49. 9 % to 80. 8 % in C. gloeosporioides at ≧ 500 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the surfactant of NSS 1450 had no inhibitory effect against mycelial growth of B. cinerea and C. gloeosporioides; however, the surfactant of NSS 3150 showed good efficacy at ≧ 250 mg/L. In this study, themix of azoxystrobin or carbendazim and NSS 1450 (100, 500 and 1, 000 mg/L) could increase the inhibition activity on mycelial growth of azoxystrobin- or carbendazim-resistant isolates which is of 39. 8 % to 100. 0 % or 2. 9 % to 45. 4 %, respectively. On the other side, the azoxystrobin or carbendazim mixed with NSS 3150 (100, 500 and 1, 000 mg/L) could increase the inhibition activity on mycelial growth of azoxystrobin- or carbendazim-resistant isolates which is of 1. 4 % to 100. 0 % or 4. 9 % to 78. 4 %, respectively. The inoculation test on detached strawberry leaves showed that the NSS 1450 alone or mixed with azoxystrobin or carbendazim were efficacy in reducing the disease severitites caused by B. cinerea or C. gloeosporioides. Moreover, the inoculation test also indicated that <b>sparyed</b> with NSS 1450 after inocualtion has higher efficacy on decreasing the disease severities. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) observation showed that the spores and hyphae of B. cinerea and C. gloeosporioides had shrinkage and distortion after treatment with 100 mg/L NSS 1450, and the cytoplasm and organelles also showed severely depredation after treatment with 100 and 1, 000 mg/L NSS 1450. The zeta potential values revealed that B. cinerea and C. gloeosporioides showed negative from - 14. 4 to - 30. 7 mv. The electrolyte leakage test further demonstrated that the spores and hyphae of B. cinerea and C. gloeosporioides were leakage after treatment with 1, 000 mg/L either NSS 1450 or NSS 3150. These results indicated that positive zeta potential of NSS 1450 might easily be adsorbed by the spores and hyphae with negative zeta potential resulting in damage in spores and hyphae, leakage or interrupted cellular processes such as metabolism or respiration. It is necessary to carry out the mechanisms of the nanosilicate platelets on damaging the pathogens in the future. Moreover, the application method should be examined more times in greenhouse and field conditions. 目前化學農藥為主要防治植物病害策略之一，然而農藥抗藥性、殘留及對環境造成危害是現今農業的嚴重問題。由於奈米材料 (nanomaterials) 具特殊的物理與化學性質，前人研究證實多種常見的奈米材料具有抑制微生物生長效果。本研究初步篩選 11 種奈米材料，包括 4 種奈米矽片 (nanosilicate platelets) 、 3 種奈米銀 (nanosized silica-silver) 及 5 種奈米碳管 (nanosized carbon nanotubes) 於抑制植物病原菌生長能力，結果顯示奈米矽片NSS 1450 與NSS 3150 抑制病原菌生長能力最佳。於評估抑制孢子發芽測試中得知，處理≧ 50 mg/L之NSS 1450 1 小時後，可分別抑制草莓灰黴病菌 (Botrytis cinerea) 與炭疽病菌 (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) 的孢子發芽達 99. 2 - 100. 0 %與 84. 0 - 100. 0 %，且隨處理時間增長，抑制孢子發芽效果越明顯。當處理NSS 3150 濃度增高時，抑制部分灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌孢子發芽效果越明顯，然而隨處理時間增長，無明顯增加抑制孢子發芽效果。於抑制菌絲生長測試中，添加≧ 500 mg/L之NSS 1450 於馬鈴薯葡萄糖瓊脂培養基時，可分別抑制灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌菌絲生長達 60. 2 - 100 %與 26. 2 - 89. 3 %；而處理≧ 500 mg/L之NSS 3150 後，可分別抑制灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌菌絲生長達 43. 0 - 100. 0 %與 49. 9 - 80. 8 %。奈米矽片之界面活性劑對抑制兩菌菌絲生長測試，處理≧ 1, 000 mg/L之NSS 1450 的界面活性劑後，無法明顯抑制灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌菌絲生長；而≧ 250 mg/L之NSS 3150 之界面活性劑，則可有效抑制此兩病菌菌絲生長。評估奈米矽片混合殺菌劑抑制兩菌菌絲生長測試中指出，將≧ 100 mg/L之NSS 1450 添加於含不同有效濃度之亞托敏培養基時，可提升抗亞托敏灰黴病菌株菌絲生長抑制率達 39. 8 - 100. 0 %；而添加≧ 100 mg/L之NSS 1450 於含不同有效濃度之貝芬替培養基時，可提升抗貝芬替炭疽病菌株菌絲生長抑制率達 2. 9 - 45. 4 %。另添加NSS 3150 部分，將≧ 100 mg/L之NSS 3150 添加於含不同有效濃度之亞托敏培養基時，可提升抗亞托敏灰黴病菌株菌絲生長抑制率達 1. 4 - 100. 0 %；而添加≧ 100 mg/L之NSS 3150 於含不同有效濃度之貝芬替培養基時，則可提升抗貝芬替炭疽病菌株菌絲生長抑制率達 4. 9 - 78. 4 %。以離葉接種法評估奈米矽片NSS 1450 與殺菌劑添加NSS 1450 防治草莓灰黴病與炭疽病之結果，顯示處理 100 mg/L之NSS 1450 或殺菌劑添加NSS 1450 後，可有效降低抗藥性病原菌的罹病度，達延緩病害的效果，且以接種病原菌後再施用NSS 1450 具有較佳防治效果。利用掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察處理 12 小時 100 mg/L與 1, 000 mg/L之NSS 1450 後的草莓灰黴菌與炭疽菌孢子與菌絲，得知兩菌之分生孢子外觀產生皺縮凹陷現象，菌絲則外觀變形，嚴重時縊縮扭曲。而穿透式電子顯微鏡觀察結果更指出，GBS 1 - 104 與CSG 7 - 3 菌株之分生孢子處理 24 小時 100 、 1, 000 mg/L之NSS 1450 後，內部細胞質濃縮現象明顯，且細胞質與胞器皆無法辨認，甚至部分孢子呈現液胞化 (vacuolation) ，而菌絲內部細胞質與胞器亦明顯遭受到破壞且無法辨認。此外以動態光散射儀 (dynamic light scattering) 測定草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌之界面電位結果顯示，所測試之菌株病原菌的界面電位值為- 14. 4 ~- 30. 7 mv。電解質滲漏測試的結果顯示，草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌孢子與菌絲處理 1, 000 mg/L之NSS 1450 與NSS 3150 後，孢子或菌絲皆可能產生滲漏現象。由上述結果推測，界面電位帶正電之奈米矽片NSS 1450 可能較易被吸附而累積在帶負電位的孢子或菌絲的表面，導致细胞内活性氧 (reactive oxygen species, ROS) 反應，破壞孢子或菌絲內外的完整性或改變孢子或菌絲內部之滲透壓，造成細胞的滲漏，而干擾孢子與菌絲內部的代謝或呼吸作用。然奈米矽片對植物病原真菌詳細之抑菌機制，未來須進一步的探討。另施用奈米矽片的時機與方法，需於溫室或田間條件進行更多次的實驗。中文摘要…………………………………………………………………………… [...] ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………………………… [...] ⅲ 目錄………………………………………………………………………………… [...] ⅴ 表次目錄…………………………………………………………………………… [...] ⅷ 圖次目錄…………………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅹ 前言…………………………………………………………………………………… 1 材料與方法…………………………………………………………………………… 6 一、供試奈米材料………………………………………………………………… 6 二、供試菌株……………………………………………………………………… 6 三、奈米材料抑制微生物生長之初步篩選……………………………………… 6 四、評估奈米材料抑制草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌之能力……………………… 7 (一) 孢子發芽測試…………………………………………………………… [...] . 7 (二) 菌絲生長測試…………………………………………………………… [...] . 8 五、評估奈米材料所使用界面活性劑 (surfactant) 抑制草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌之能力…………………………………………………………………………… 8 六、評估殺菌劑添加奈米材料抑制抗藥性草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌之能力… 9 七、以離葉接種法評估奈米矽片NSS 1450 與殺菌劑添加奈米矽片NSS 1450 防治草莓灰黴病與炭疽病之效果………………………………………………… [...] 10 (一) 評估防治草莓灰黴病效果………………………………………………. 10 (二) 評估防治草莓炭疽病效果………………………………………………. 11 八、處理奈米材料對草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌之孢子與菌絲內外部的影響 [...] 12 (一) 掃描式電子顯微鏡 (scanning electron microscope, SEM) 觀察……… 12 (二) 穿透式電子顯微鏡 (Transmission electron microscopy, TEM) 觀察…. 12 九、界面電位 (zeta potential, ZP) 測定……………………………………… [...] . 13 十、電解質滲漏 (lectrolyte leakage) 測定………………………………… [...] . 14 (一) 孢子電解質滲漏測定………………………………………………… [...] . 14 (二) 菌絲電解質滲漏測定………………………………………………… [...] . 14 結果………………………………………………………………………………… [...] 15 一、奈米材料抑制微生物生長之初步篩選…………………………………… [...] 15 二、評估奈米材料抑制植物病原真菌之能力………………………………… [...] 15 (一) 孢子發芽測試……………………………………………………………. 15 (二) 菌絲生長測試……………………………………………………………. 16 三、評估奈米材料所使用界面活性劑 (surfactant) 抑制植物病原真菌之能力. 17 四、評估殺菌劑添加奈米材料抑制抗藥性植物病原真菌之能力…………… [...] 18 (一) 測試殺菌劑添加NSS 1450 後之抑制效果……………………………… 19 (二) 測試殺菌劑添加NSS 3150 後之抑制效果……………………………… 20 五、以離葉接種法評估奈米矽片NSS 1450 與殺菌劑添加奈米矽片防治草莓灰 黴病與炭疽病之效果…………………………………………………………… [...] 21 (一) 草莓灰黴病之防治效果………………………………………………… [...] . 21 1. 抗亞托敏藥劑之草莓灰黴病菌GBS 1 - 104 菌株的防治效果………… 21 2. 對亞托敏藥劑感性之草莓灰黴病菌GBS 0 - 15 菌株的防治效果…… [...] 22 (二) 草莓炭疽病之防治效果…………………………………………………. 23 1. 抗貝芬替藥劑之草莓炭疽病菌CSG 7 - 3 菌株的防治效果…………… 24 2. 對貝芬替藥劑感性之草莓炭疽病菌CSG 8 - 2 菌株的防治效果……… 25 六、奈米材料對草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌孢子與菌絲內外部的影響……… [...] 26 (一) 掃描式電子顯微鏡 (Scanning electron microscope, SEM) 觀察……… 26 1. 草莓灰黴病菌分生孢子觀察………………………………………… [...] . 26 2. 草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌菌絲觀察………………………………… [...] . 26 (二) 穿透式電子顯微鏡 (Transmission electron microscopy, TEM) 觀察……… 27 1. 草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌分生孢子觀察…………………………… [...] . 27 2. 草莓灰黴病菌與炭疽病菌菌絲觀察………………………………… [...] . 27 七、界面電位 (zeta potential, ZP) 測定…………………………………… [...] . 28 八、電解質滲漏 (lectrolyte leakage) 測定………………………………… [...] . 28 (一) 孢子電解質滲漏測定……………………………………………………… [...] . 28 (二) 菌絲電解質滲漏測定……………………………………………………… [...] . 30 討論……………………………………………………………………………… [...] 31 參考文獻………………………………………………………………………… [...] 39 圖表……………………………………………………………………………… [...] 4...|$|R

5000|$|The target {{audience}} {{of natural history}} was French polite society, evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works. Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition - many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. However, natural history was often a political affair. As E. C. <b>Spary</b> writes, the classifications used by naturalists [...] "slipped between the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural, but also {{the dominance of the}} natural over the social". The idea of taste (le goût) was a social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class. From this basis, naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works.|$|E

The treatments including VAM showed better vegetative and reproductive growth than non-VAM plants. The plants which were subjected to foliar application of GA and ABA in combination with VAM (VAM + ABA and VAM+GA) gave better yield than VAM alone. The vegetative and reproductive growth was decreased in drought stressed, non-VAM plants as a result of which, shoot and root dry weights and yield were reduced. However, VAM+Drought+ABA increased the weight of pods/plant and shoot dry weight/plant. The VAM and foliar application of ABA, helped the plants to increase the yield insignificantly in VAM+ABA+Drought and significantly in VAM+ABA.

40|$|Periodontal probing is {{commonly}} used for assessing both the status of gingival health and the connective tissue attachment level around teeth. The role of probing around endosseous implants still remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the histological level of probe penetration in healthy and inflamed mucosal tissues around implants. Five beagle dogs were used and a total of 30 one-stage, Titanium Plasma <b>Spary</b> (TPS) -coated implants of the ITI type were placed in the mandibles. After the healing period with meticulous oral hygiene, the dogs were divided into 3 groups: 1) clinical healthy mucosal tissues; 2) experimental mucositis (3 dogs); and 3) experimental ligature-induced peri-implantitis (2 dogs). Four months after implant placement, respectively 6 months in the third group, 60 probes were placed with a standardized force of 0. 2 N and fixed at the mesial and distal aspects of the implants. Probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL), Plaque Index (PlI) and Gingival Index (GI) were assessed throughout the study. Tissue sections were obtained for histometrical analysis. In the healthy group, the mean PII was 0. 47, the GI 0. 06 and the clinical probing depth (CPD) 2. 12 mm. In the mucositis group the PlI was 1. 61, the GI 1. 61 and the CPD 1. 87 mm. In the peri-implantitis group the PlI was 1. 96, the GI 2. 05 and the CPD 3. 73 mm. The histologic results show that the probes were able to identify the connective tissue adhesion level in the healthy group with a mean error of - 0. 05 mm (mean histologic probing depth (HPD) : 1. 75 mm) and, in the mucositis group, with - 0. 02 mm (mean HPD: 1. 62 mm). Probe penetration increased with the degree of inflammation and in the peri-implantitis group the probe exceeded the connective tissue level by a mean 0. 52 mm (mean HPD: 3. 8 mm). Therefore, probing around implants represents a good technique for assessing the status of peri-implant mucosal health or disease. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
