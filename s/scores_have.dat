5|$|Although not rivalling the LSO's {{total of}} more than 200 film score recordings, the LPO has played for a number of soundtracks, {{starting}} in 1936 with Whom the Gods Love. The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Later <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> included those for Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), In the Name of the Father (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the three films derived from The Hobbit (2012–14).|$|E
5|$|Many soundtracks and {{arranged}} albums of Uematsu's game <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> been released. Pieces from his video game works {{have been performed}} in various Final Fantasy concerts, where he has worked with Grammy Award-winning conductor Arnie Roth on several of these performances. From 2002 to 2010, {{he was in a}} hard rock band with Square Enix colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito called The Black Mages, in which he played electronic organ and other keyboards. The band played various arranged rock versions of Uematsu's Final Fantasy compositions. He has since performed with Earthbound Papas, which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Credit {{scores are}} often used in {{determining}} prices for auto and homeowner's insurance. Starting in the 1990s, the national credit reporting agencies that generate credit <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> also been generating more specialized insurance scores, which insurance companies then use to rate the insurance risk of potential customers. Studies indicate {{that the majority of}} those who are insured pay less in insurance through the use of scores. These studies point out that people with higher <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> fewer claims.|$|E

25|$|In 1744, Slindon {{were back}} and in June they beat London by 55 {{runs in a}} match whose <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> been {{preserved}} by the earliest known cricket scorecard. Slindon beat London again in September and proceeded to issue their audacious challenge to play against any parish in England. London did not take up the challenge: only Addington and Bromley felt able to respond.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground is}} on the small side, so that some high <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> been made there. The highest {{individual}} innings played {{on the ground in}} first-class matches is Justin Langer's 342 for Somerset in 2006. Somerset made 688-8 declared in their first innings in this match, but Surrey responded with 717 - the highest total made on the ground - and the match was drawn.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{versions}} available: a parent form that contains 55 questions, {{and a teacher}} form that contains 43 questions. Shorter follow-up versions of the VADRS are also available for parents and teachers and consists of 26 questions with an additional 12 side effect measures. Comparing scores from the {{different versions of the}} VADRS with other psychological measures have suggested the <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> good but limited reliability and validity across multiple samples. The VADRS has only been recently developed, however, so clinical application of the measure is limited.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{misconception}} about scoring and judging. In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.|$|E
25|$|Timed Up and Go test (TUG) <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> {{been seen}} to improve after having engaged in gaming rehabilitation. Several studies have {{produced}} output {{that suggests that}} Wii games are able to effectively increase patients' scores after {{a certain period of}} rehabilitation through them. Stroke recovery patients and patients with an Acquired brain injury are two such examples of this output. Both patient classes have been shown to display slightly better improvements when using the Wii game or Wii balance board than when engaging in regular therapeutic methodologies. Continuing past these classes, studies are continually proving that these scores can be increased in a variety of patients with a variety of physical disabilities and from a variety of backgrounds.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have {{increased}} {{in most parts of}} the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100. The phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test-takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule, IQ test <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> been rising at an average rate of around three IQ points per decade. This phenomenon was named the Flynn effect in the book The Bell Curve after James R. Flynn, the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists.|$|E
25|$|According to Cloninger’s model, {{the early}} life onset of neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} lead to personality disorders, with individuals having low RD scores. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is characterized in behavioral terms by childhood or adolescent onset of recurrent antisocial behavior. Cloninger had predicted from his biosocial theory that individuals {{most at risk}} of aggressive, antisocial behavior, will be those with lower RD scores and these individuals are equated with the primary psychopaths who show aloofness and social detachment. Particular research conducted on childhood behavior has tested this theory and researchers have shown that children with lower RD <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> more of an anti-social profile as defined in the DSM, and are at highest risk for early onset of frequent delinquent behavior.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from getting}} {{favourable}} reviews, several of Rahman's background <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> earned him many prestigious awards ranging from Academy awards to Filmfare awards. Some {{of the films}} which fetched him appreciations for background scores include Roja, Bombay, Iruvar, Minsara Kanavu, Dil Se.., Taal, Lagaan, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, Swades, Rang De Basanti, , Guru, Jodhaa Akbar, Raavanan, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, Rockstar, Enthiran ,Kadal, Kochadaiiyaan and I. Among his Hollywood scores, Warriors of Heaven and Earth, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Million Dollar Arm and The Hundred-Foot Journey received rave reviews. A. R. Rahman received two Academy Awards for Slumdog Millionaire and two Academy Award nominations for 127 Hours.

25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} {{in every single}} innings, then their total number of runs scored divided {{by the number of}} times they have been out gives exactly the average number of runs they score per innings. However, for a batsman with innings which have finished not out, this statistic is only an estimate of the average number of runs they score per innings – the true average number of runs they score per innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs they would have scored if they could have completed all their not out innings. If their <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> a geometric distribution then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the PCL, the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) was {{developed}} to comprehensively index personality traits without explicitly referring to antisocial or criminal behaviors themselves. It is a self-report scale that {{was developed}} originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales. The item <b>scores</b> <b>have</b> been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two. Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{error model}} is to {{introduce}} a small error to the data probability term in the homozygous cases, allowing a small constant probability that nucleotides which don't match the A allele are observed in the AA case, and respectively a small constant probability that nucleotides not matching the B allele are observed in the BB case. However more sophisticated procedures are available which attempt to more realistically replicate the actual error patterns observed in real data in calculating the conditional data probabilities. For instance, estimations of read quality (measured as Phred quality <b>scores)</b> <b>have</b> been incorporated in these calculations, {{taking into account the}} expected error rate in each individual read at a locus. Another technique that has successfully been incorporated into error models is base quality recalibration, where separate error rates are calculated - based on prior known information about error patterns - for each possible nucleotide substitution. Research shows that each possible nucleotide substitution is not equally likely to show up as an error in sequencing data, and so base quality recalibration has been applied to improve error probability estimates.|$|E
