50|$|Already {{since the}} 1950s SAT had {{negotiated}} with the authorities for allowing four-axle lorries with two <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> in road transportation. Such layout had already been used in mobile cranes since the late 1960s. At the end of 1978 the Ministry of Transport finally allowed also such lorries. The first homologated four-axle lorry in Finland was Sisu M-168 of which second <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> {{was the same as}} used in Sisu T-108 mobile crane.|$|R
50|$|The driven truck axles {{are with}} {{planetary}} reduction, single axle capacity being 10-14 tonnes for steering and 10-20.5 tonnes for non-steering axles; the tandem configurations for the <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are rated to 20-28 tonnes and non-steering 20-41 tonnes. The non-steering axles {{are also available}} as tridem configurations with 39-61.5 tonnes. The capacities of <b>steering,</b> non driven <b>axles</b> are between 8 and 12 tonnes. Some non-driven, non-steering axles with a capacity of 13 tonnes {{are also in the}} selection. The non-steering axles are with S-cam drum brakes, whereas some of the <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are equipped with disc or wedge brakes.|$|R
50|$|In the United States most {{standard}} dump trucks have one front <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> and one (4x2 4-wheeler)) or two (6x4 6-wheeler) rear axles which typically have dual wheels on each side. Tandem rear axles {{are almost always}} powered, front <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are also sometimes powered (4x4, 6x6). Unpowered axles are sometimes used to support extra weight. Most unpowered rear axles can be raised off the ground to minimize wear when the truck is empty or lightly loaded, and are commonly called “lift axles”.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} tractor-cab layout has a forward engine, one <b>steering</b> <b>axle,</b> and two drive axles. The fifth-wheel trailer {{coupling}} on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft, to allow adjustment {{in the weight}} distribution over its rear axle(s).|$|R
50|$|In both {{road and}} rail vehicles, the {{wheelbase}} is {{the distance between}} the centers of the front and rear wheels. For road vehicles with more than two axles (e.g. some trucks), the wheelbase is defined as {{the distance between the}} <b>steering</b> (front) <b>axle</b> and the centerpoint of the driving axle group. In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> and a point midway between the two rear axles.|$|R

50|$|The {{driven axles}} for the {{container}} handling equipment are with planetary reduction. The single non-steering axle capacity is 30-32 tonnes; the tandem applications are rated to 26-41 tonnes. The driven <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are with 12-18 tonnes capacity and the non-driven option is only available with 10 tonnes capacity. S-cam and disc brakes are applied on both <b>steering</b> and non-steering <b>axles,</b> the heavier <b>steering</b> driven option being fitted with wedge brakes.|$|R
50|$|Sisu Axles' core {{business}} are planetary reduction axles but also non-driven <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are produced.

50|$|Road {{damage and}} wear {{increase}} very rapidly with the axle weight. The number of <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> and the suspension type also influence {{the amount of}} the road wear. In many countries with good roads a six-axle truck may have a maximum weight of 44 t or more.|$|R

Axle models include the planetary hub-reduction axles HL-7/HD-7, and the <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> VL-4.

50|$|In 1956, the International Harvester company {{introduced}} the Payhauler line of heavy duty off-highway rear-dump trucks, initially {{available as a}} 25-ton (23t) capacity rear-wheel-drive model. Unlike other haul trucks it had dual tires on the front (<b>steering)</b> <b>axle</b> and carried the load with the same weight on both axles. Early models had a Detroit Diesel 16V71 engine, later Cummins engines were used.|$|R
40|$|A {{recurring}} question is: "What effects will art {{increase in}} the sizes of tires and axleloads have on pavements? " Concern has mounted {{in regard to the}} so-called "drop-axle " not having dual wheels or proportioned loading. Presently, {{there seems to be a}} trend toward wide tires in lieu of dual wheels. The wide tires first appeared on the front (<b>steering)</b> <b>axle.</b> This trend seemingly represents an attempt to respect the statutory limit of 600 pounds of load per inch of tire width but to violate the axleload or wheel-load limits (KRS 189. 222). Whereas a dual-wheeled, single, rear axle having 10 -inch wide tires would be limited to a gross load of 20, 000 pounds, 600 pounds per inch of tire width would be 24, 000 pounds. A tandem set of axles (8 tires) is limited to a gross of 34, 000 pounds; 600 pounds would be 48, 000 pounds. An advantage is demonstrated clearly when it is shown that a 34, 000 -pound, tandem axle is not any more damaging than a 18, 000 -pound, single axle having dual wheels. A great disadvantage arises when a single axle without duals (such as the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> or "drop-axle") is loaded heavily without increasing the width of the tires. In the report enclosed herewith we have analyzed data from the AASHO Road Test to better defme the damage factors assignable to tandem axles. Several influences have been considered and documented. The effects of <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> at the Test Road are somewhat confounded with the load axles. Separat...|$|R
50|$|Although capable for its day, the Hathi was {{a complex}} and {{expensive}} vehicle that required regular maintenance if the front axle was to remain reliable. For most purposes it was soon replaced by 6×4 lorries with just as many driven wheels, but {{without the need for}} the complex combined driving and <b>steering</b> <b>axle.</b> Even half-tracks, particularly the Kégresse system, were more popular in this period.|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of vehicle dynamics, {{commercial}} software can aid the designer during the conceptual and detailed design phases. Simulations using these tools can quickly provide specific design metrics, such as yaw and lateral velocity, for standard maneuvers. However, it remains challenging to correlate these metrics with empirical quantities that depend on many external parameters and design specifications. This scenario {{is the case with}} tire wear, which depends on the frictional work developed by the tire-road contact. In this study, an approach is proposed to estimate the tire-road friction during steady-state longitudinal and cornering maneuvers. Using this approach, a qualitative formula for tire wear evaluation is developed, and conceptual design analyses of cornering maneuvers are performed using simplified vehicle models. The influence of some design parameters such as cornering stiffness, the distance between the axles, and the steer angle ratio between the <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> for vehicles with two <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> is evaluated. The proposed methodology allows the designer to predict tire wear using simplified vehicle models during the conceptual design phase...|$|R

40|$|The SAFETRUCK program {{focuses on}} {{preventing}} accidents on rural highways, especially {{those associated with}} run-off-the-road incidents and driver fatigue, by giving the vehicle the ability to steer {{to the side of}} the road and come to a safe stop if the driver falls asleep or is otherwise incapacitated. Researchers have equipped a Navistar 9400 series class 8 truck tractor with the sensors and control computers necessary to perform this task. Designing the controller that will steer the truck requires a mathematical model of the lateral response of the truck to steering inputs. In this project, researchers developed a lateral dynamic model by incorporating second order dynamics into the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> tires. Simulation of the resulting models indicated dynamic behavior that was close to the experimental data for speeds between 15 and 30 miles per hour. This is the first time that a lateral dynamic model of a truck has been experimentally verified. Both models, however, resulted in experimentally determined values for <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> cornering stiffness that were considerably smaller than published values for the Goodyear G 159 tires on the truck. 17.

This paper presents an idea of how to determine maneuverability of motor vehicles with two <b>steering</b> <b>axles.</b> The concept makes use of elements of kinematic analysis as well as of a 3 D model of the steering system. It is based on the theoretical analysis {{of the most}} unfavorable situations, such as parallel and perpendicular parking techniques, on the basis of which wheel-steering angles are specified. As a result, it was possible to create a 3 D model to simulate the actual operation of the steering system.
