It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a <b>sticky</b> <b>end.</b> This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
500|$|Two-dimensional arrays {{can be made}} {{to exhibit}} {{aperiodic}} structures whose assembly implements a specific algorithm, exhibiting one form of DNA computing. The DX tiles can have their <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> sequences chosen so that they act as Wang tiles, allowing them to perform computation. A DX array whose assembly encodes an XOR operation has been demonstrated; this allows the DNA array to implement a cellular automaton that generates a fractal known as the Sierpinski gasket. [...] The third image at right shows this type of array. Another system has the function of a binary counter, displaying a representation of increasing binary numbers as it grows. These results show that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays.|$|E
500|$|Spores are {{dispersed}} when a peridiole is dislodged by raindrops {{or water}} dripping off an over-hanging leaf. The smooth inner {{walls of the}} fruiting body consistently form an angle of 70–75° with the horizontal; it has been demonstrated experimentally that the combined effect of the crucible shape and internal wall angle produce a good splash action. [...] The force of the falling water splashes out the peridiole, uncoiling and snapping the funiculus, the cord that connects it to the fruiting body. As the peridiole continues its flight, the funiculus extends to its full length. The <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> of the funiculus may adhere to a leaf or a twig some distance away, and the peridiole may end up being wrapped around or hanging down the object to which the funiculus is stuck. The spores can germinate when the thick outer wall of the peridiole wears away, or the peridiole may be eaten by a herbivorous animal, and ultimately passed through its digestive system. This method of spore dispersal, first suggested by John Ray in the late 17th century, was tested experimentally by Martin (1927), and more thoroughly by Buller and Brodie in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|The digest products, now {{containing}} compatible <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> {{with each}} other (but incompatible <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> with themselves) are subjected to ligation, creating a new plasmid which contains the background elements of the original plasmid with a different insert.|$|R
30|$|Described {{here is a}} {{simplified}} method for fabrication of DNA nanotubes using a minimum numbers of staple oligomers for DNA origami. For this purpose, the cylindrical nanotemplates with two <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> have been designed using caDNAno software. Then, the nanostructures were shaped in an optimized experimental condition via an origami-based self-assembly reaction. Finally, the produced nanostructures were joined together through their <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> using a ligase enzyme. Transmission electron microscope confirmed fabrication of these elongated nanotubes. In addition, high-resolution microscopy of DNA nanotubes by scanning tunnelling microscope indicated efficient attachments of the primarily DNA nanostructures via their <b>sticky</b> <b>ends.</b> The results demonstrated that a ligase treatment of cylindrical DNA nanostructures with the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> made DNA nanotubes with standard shapes using minimum numbers of staples.|$|R
5000|$|DNA ends {{refer to}} the {{properties}} of the end of DNA molecules, which may be <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> (cohesive ends), blunt ends or in other forms. The concept is used in molecular biology, especially in cloning or when subcloning inserts DNA into vector DNA. Such ends may be generated by restriction enzymes that cut the DNA - a staggered cut generates two <b>sticky</b> <b>ends,</b> while a straight cut generate blunt ends.|$|R

50|$|In {{recombinant}} DNA technology specific restriction endonucleases {{are used}} that will isolate a particular gene and cleave the sugar phosphate backbones {{at different points}} (retaining symmetry), so that the double stranded restriction fragments have single stranded ends. These short extensions, called <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> can form hydrogen bonded base pairs with complementary <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> on any other DNA cut with the same enzyme (such as a bacterial plasmid).|$|R
50|$|Blunt-end ligation, however, is {{much less}} {{efficient}} than <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation, typically the reaction is 100X slower than sticky-end ligation. Since blunt-end does not have protruding ends, the ligation reaction depends on random collisions between the blunt-ends and is consequently much less efficient. To compensate for the lower efficiency, the concentration of ligase used is higher than <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation (10x or more). The concentration of DNA used in blunt-end ligation is also higher to {{increase the likelihood of}} collisions between ends, and longer incubation time may also be used for blunt-end ligations.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} creating recombinant DNA typically {{involves the use}} of plasmids in the host bacteria. The plasmid contains a genetic sequence corresponding to the recognition site of a restriction endonuclease, such as EcoR1. After foreign DNA fragments, which have also been cut with the same restriction endonuclease, have been inserted into host cell, the restriction endonuclease gene is expressed by applying heat, or by introducing a biomolecule, such as arabinose. Upon expression, the enzyme will cleave the plasmid at its corresponding recognition site creating <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> on the plasmid. Ligases then joins the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> to the corresponding <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> of the foreign DNA fragments creating a recombinant DNA plasmid.|$|R
5000|$|Controlling {{the optimal}} {{temperature}} {{is a vital}} aspect of performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments. Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from bacteriophage T4), which is most active at 37 °C. [...] However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments ("sticky ends"), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the melting temperature Tm of the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> being ligated, the homologous pairing of the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> will not be stable because the high temperature disrupts hydrogen bonding. A ligation reaction is most efficient when the <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> are already stably annealed, and disruption of the annealing ends would therefore result in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the overhang, the lower the Tm.|$|R

50|$|The {{higher the}} ligase concentration, {{the faster the}} rate of {{ligation}}. Blunt-end ligation is much less efficient than <b>sticky</b> <b>end</b> ligation, so a higher concentration of ligase is used in blunt-end ligations.

40|$|Rothemund and Winfree, 2000) {{showed in}} theory that any computable {{function}} can be imple-mented via {{a set of}} tiles with carefully designed <b>sticky</b> <b>ends.</b> Unfortunately experimental demon-stration of complex tilings have been limited by significant assembly errors. A major source of errors are co-operative binding errors which occur when a tile partially satisfies the programming at a lattice point, i. e. its <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> match with only some of its neighbors but that is sufficient {{for it to be}} wrongly incorporated into the assembly. (Majumder et al., 2007) described a novel protec-tion/deprotection strategy, termed an activatable tiling scheme, to strictly enforce the direction of tiling assembly growth to ensure the robustness of the assembly process. In their system tiles are initially inactive, meaning that each tiles output <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> are protected and cannot bind with other tiles. Only after other tiles bind to the tiles input <b>sticky</b> <b>ends,</b> the tile transitions to an active state and its output <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> are exposed, allowing further growth. Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of the activatable tiling scheme. Our system consists of two tiles that form a linear co-polymer. These tiles are initially protected such that they do not react with each other. Then via the use of a strand displacing polymerase (BST), we activate the tiles which leads to the formation of the linear co-polymer. The 2 tiles, Tile A an...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: DNA is {{a useful}} {{material}} for nanoscale construction. Due to highly specific Watson-Crick base pairing, the DNA sequences can be designed to form small tiles or origami. Adjacent helices in such nanostructures are connected via Holliday junction-like crossovers. DNA tiles can have <b>sticky</b> <b>ends</b> which can then be programmed to form large one-dimensional and two-dimensional periodic lattices. Recently, a three-dimensional DNA lattice has also been constructed. Here we report the design and construction of a novel DNA cross tile, called the double-decker tile. Its arms are symmetric and have four double helices each. Using its <b>sticky</b> <b>ends,</b> large two-dimensional square lattices have been constructed which are {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers.
