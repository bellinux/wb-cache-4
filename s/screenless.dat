2500|$|The first {{generation}} of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8" [...] hard drive compared to the 2.5" [...] drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the {{first generation}} iPod ranged from 5GB to 10GB. The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming {{a major player in the}} music industry. Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone. After the 1st generation of iPod, Apple released the hard drive-based iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, video-capable iPod Nano, <b>screenless</b> iPod Shuffle in the following years.|$|E
2500|$|The Sansa Shaker is a <b>screenless</b> {{digital audio}} player {{and comes in}} colors of blue, red, white, and pink with an SD card slot. One 512MB or 1GB card is included, and cards up to 4GB (non-SDHC) can be used. The tubular design is {{intended}} to be kid-friendly, and the player resembles a saltshaker, as it will randomly skip one, two or three songs when shaken. The Shaker plays up to 10 hours of continuous audio with a AAA battery, and has twin headphone jacks and a built-in speaker. The upper controller band adjusts volume and the lower controller band skips to next/previous song or fast forwards/rewinds the current song when held. Unlike other players, the only supported audio file format is MP3. When the memory card is removed during playback, the player emits an [...] "uh-oh" [...] sound. When the player's memory card is put back in, it emits a popping sound.|$|E

Arguably, virtual reality goggles (which consist of two small screens but are nonetheless sufficiently different from traditional computer screens to be considered <b>screenless)</b> and heads-up display in airplanes (which display images on the clear cockpit window) also are included in Visual Image category. In all of these cases, light is reflected off some intermediate object (hologram, LCD panel, or cockpit window) before it reaches the retina. In the case of LCD panels the light is refracted {{from the back of}} the panel, but is nonetheless a reflected source. Google has proposed a similar system to replace the screens of tablet computers and smartphones.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Screenless</b> {{lithography}} is a reprographic {{technique for}} halftoning dating to 1855, when the French chemist and civil engineer Alphonse Poitevin discovered the light-sensitive properties of bichromated gelatin and invented both the photolithography and collotype processes.

Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: albumin plates and deep-etch plates.

50|$|Only {{recently}} {{a number of}} developments have made a true VRD system practical. In particular the development of high-brightness LEDs have made the displays bright enough to be used during the day, and adaptive optics have allowed systems to dynamically correct for irregularities in the eye (although {{this is not always}} needed).

50|$|Synaptic Interface <b>screenless</b> video {{does not}} use light at all. Visual {{information}} completely bypasses the eye and is transmitted directly to the brain. While such systems have only been implemented in humans in rudimentary form - for example, displaying single Braille characters to blind people - success has been achieved in sampling usable video signals from the biological eyes of a living horseshoe crab through their optic nerves, and in sending video signals from electronic cameras into the creatures' brains using the same method.|$|E

Commercial use of this plate has not flourished; today it is still in limited use, primarily because the continuous-tone printing plate technology is expensive and necessitates stringent quality control.|$|E

40|$|Printing {{without the}} use of a {{halftone}} screen pattern offers many advantages, although most processes utilized are impractical for long run commercial printing. <b>Screenless</b> lithography provides a practical means of making unscreened reproductions. While <b>screenless</b> lithography has been in use for many years, its working mechanisms have only recently been explained. Past studies have investigated many of the factors which contribute to the continuous tone effect of <b>screenless</b> printing, but none have scientifically determined if ink film thickness variation is a contributing factor. Positive working lithographic plates were exposed to control scales, processed, inked, and allowed to dry. These plates were then cross-sectioned and observed under a high magnification microscope to determine if variations in ink film thickness exist. Results showed that variations did indeed exist. These variations were shown to occur not only between areas of different density, but also within areas of uniform density. The different ink film thicknesses that exist on <b>screenless</b> lithographic plates affect their tone reproduction characteristics and contribute to their continuous tone capabilities...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} lithography, a {{halftone screen}} {{is used to}} photographically convert the continuous- tone image of the original into a grid of very small, closely spaced dots of constant density but varying areas. <b>Screenless</b> or continuous-tone lithography is a printing process capable of reproducing images with gradated tones {{without the use of}} a halftone screen. <b>Screenless</b> lithography has a high quality potential because it has few of the inherent problems that limit the quality of the halftone process. This thesis investigates the image mechanisms in <b>screenless</b> lithography and in particular the role of variable water receptivity. It was hypothesized that in <b>screenless</b> lithography which uses a particular image carrier known as the Association Products plate, the continuous-tone image is due to selective emulsification of the ink resulting in a varying ink layer thickness and therefore varying densities. It was theorized that the plate has a water receptivity which varies with exposure to light and that this results in varying degrees of water-in-ink emulsification when the plate is dampened and inked. When transferred to paper and dried this results in an ink layer of varying thickness, which in turn causes a variation in optical density. A mathematical relationship was developed relating optical density, percentage of emulsified water, and ink layer thickness. This relationship allowed prediction of the amount of water-in-ink emulsification necessary to produce a given density range and a prediction of the amount of emulsification expected on a given plate area associated with a particular printed density. Testing proved that these predicted values were not present in actual printing from the plates. It was concluded that the hypothesis is invalid...|$|E
