50|$|The {{geological}} {{structures and}} geomorphology of Iceland are {{strongly influenced by}} the <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundary and the Iceland hotspot. The buoyancy of the deep-seated mantle plume underneath has uplifted the Iceland Basalt Plateau to as high as 3000 meters. The hot spot also produces high volcanic activity on the plate boundary.|$|E
50|$|Many {{ophiolite}} complexes were emplaced as thin hot obducted {{sheets of}} oceanic lithosphere shortly after their generation by plate accretion. The {{change from a}} <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundary to a subduction plate boundary may result from rapid rearrangement of relative plate motion. A transform fault may also become a subduction zone, with the side with the higher, hotter, thinner lithosphere riding over the lower, colder lithosphere. This mechanism would lead to obduction of ophiolite complex if it occurred near a continental margin.|$|E
50|$|This theory views {{volcanism}} as {{the resultant}} of lithospheric processes rather than {{heat from the}} mantle rising up. Instead of heat coming up from deep in the mantle, volcanic anomalies come from a shallow source. Volcanism thus occurs where the crust is easier to break up {{because it has been}} stretched by lithospheric extension, allowing melt to reach the surface. Volcanic anomalies are created by plate tectonics such as <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries or subduction zones. The location of the volcanism is governed by the stress field in the plate and the amount of melt is governed by the fusibility of the mantle beneath. Plate tectonics can explain most of the volcanism on Earth.|$|E

Higher counts were observed on <b>spread</b> <b>plates</b> (P less than 0. 05) for Thermoactinomyces candidus, Micropolyspora faeni, and Saccharomonospora viridis. M. faeni and S. viridis were less efficient than T. candidus in breaking through the agar of pour plates to form colonies which could be identified. Coefficients of variability were less than 10 % for the two methods.

50|$|The {{origin and}} age of the hemispheric {{dichotomy}} are still debated. Hypotheses of origin generally fall into two categories: one, the dichotomy was produced by a mega-impact event or several large impacts early in the planet’s history (exogenic theories) or two, the dichotomy was produced by crustal thinning in the northern hemisphere by mantle convection, overturning, or other chemical and thermal processes in the planet’s interior (endogenic theories). One endogenic model proposes an early episode of plate tectonics producing a thinner crust in the north, similar to what is occurring at <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries on Earth. Whatever its origin, the Martian dichotomy appears to be extremely old. A new theory based on the Southern Polar Giant Impact and validated by the discovery of twelve hemispherical alignments shows that exogenic theories appear to be stronger than endogenic theories and that Mars never had plate tectonics that could modify the dichotomy. Laser altimeter and radar sounding data from orbiting spacecraft have identified {{a large number of}} basin-sized structures previously hidden in visual images. Called quasi-circular depressions (QCDs), these features likely represent derelict impact craters from the period of heavy bombardment that are now covered by a veneer of younger deposits. Crater counting studies of QCDs suggest that the underlying surface in the northern hemisphere is at least as old as the oldest exposed crust in the southern highlands. The ancient age of the dichotomy places a significant constraint on theories of its origin.|$|E

The objective {{of this research was}} to compare the accuracy and fidelity of drop <b>plate</b> method vs. <b>spread</b> <b>plate</b> method by parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. For bacterial enumeration by drop and <b>spread</b> <b>plate</b> methods, successive dilutions of second subculture of Lactobacillus casei and Salmonella Typhimurium were transferred to selective agar. The correlation of agreement between both methods was evaluated by using statistical proofs. Results showed that mean value (parametric unpaired t-test) comparison at 95 percent confidence level did not reject null hypothesis, which it meant that the equality of the mean data could not be ruled out. Nonparametric method was used because of approximately Gaussian pattern of data distribution. For this purpose, Mann-Whitney test (equivalent nonparametric t- test) was used. It meant that the equality of medians obtained from two methods were similar. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient (r) via both methods due to data distribution patterns for enumeration of S.

Both regions have high heat flow, and presumably thin magnetic crust. This indicates that Iceland is quite anomalous in its magnetic character, and possible similarities with the Alpha Ridge are suggested. Interesting correlations exist between MAGSAT anomalies around the North Atlantic, after reconstructing the fit of continents into a prerifting configuration. These correlations suggest that several orogenies in that region have not completely destroyed an ancient magnetization formed in high grade Precambrian rocks...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{of rocks}} from four known or {{suspected}} ophiolite complexes {{were compared with}} five groups of Cenozoic volcanic rocks using their contents of Ti, Zr and Y. Triangular plots of Ti-Zr-Y and plots of Ti-Zr were constructed, and the problem was also approached using discriminant analysis. The elements Ti, Zr and Y were chosen because of their apparent invariance with respect to such secondary processes as weathering and metamorphism which have often affected ophiolitic rocks. The five groups of volcanic rocks nominated as standards were a group of ocean-floor basalts, one of Hawaiian tholeiites, one of alkali olivine basalts from Flores, Azores, one of island-arc andesites, and one of island-arc tholeiites from Japan. These could all be well discriminated using the three elements chosen. The four ophiolites selected included two, Troodos and Oman, which have been postulated on structural grounds to be fragments of ocean crust, and two others, from the Grossglockner region, Austria, and from the Othrys region, Greece, which were less well-defined. Most of the samples from all four ophiolites showed the greatest affinity with the ocean-floor basalt group, except for seven andesites from Greece.

40|$|We use {{multichannel}} seismic data, gravity, and subsidence modeling, {{in conjunction}} with plate reconstructions, to evaluate the crustal origin and composition of the Kerguelen Plateau. Predominantly oceanic crust of the southern {{and parts of the}} central Kerguelen Plateau appears to include continental fragments related to the breakup of India and Antarctica; these fragments may have been metamorphosed during emplacement of the main plateau. The upper crust is basaltic, the middle crust is intrusive mafic rock and intruded continental crust, and the lower crust is a plagioclase-rich metamorphic rock. The Labuan Basin crust is predominantly oceanic with stranded Kerguelen Plateau fault blocks. High-density lower crust in the Labuan Basin is probably composed of serpentinized peridotites formed during slow rifting and <b>spreading.</b> <b>Plate</b> reconstruction models indicate opening between eastern Broken Ridge and southern Kerguelen Plateau at ? 90 Ma, heralding the formation of the Labuan Basin and Diamantina Zone; crustal attenuation and slow accretion of oceanic crust continued until the Australian and Antarctic plates separated at CI 8 time (? 40 Ma). Plate reconstructions of the free-air gravity field indicate that the Naturaliste Plateau fits against Antarctica and that Elan Bank and India were juxtaposed until ? 110 Ma. Both Naturaliste Plateau and Elan Bank are probable microcontinents. A ? 1 km positive residual depth anomaly in the oceanic basins adjacent to the plateau, along with the positive geoid anomaly centered beneath the northern Kerguelen Plateau, imply that the lithosphere is partially dynamically supported by an upwelling hot asthenosphere of the Kerguelen hot spot. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Melt fragmentation, {{quenching}} {{and long}} term coolability in a deep pool of water under reactor vessel is employed as a severe accident (SA) mitigation strategy in several designs of light water reactors (LWR). Geometrical configuration of the debris bed {{is one of the}} factors which define if the decay heat can be removed from the debris bed by natural circulation. Boiling and two-phase flow inside the bed also serves as a source of mechanical energy which can reduce the height of the debris bed by so called “self-leveling” phenomenon. However, to be effective in providing a coolable geometrical configuration, self-leveling time scale has to be smaller than the time scale for drying out and onset of re-melting of the bed. This paper presents results of experimental and analytical studies concerning the self-leveling phenomenon. The goal of this work is to assess characteristic time scale of particulate debris spreading. In the experiments on the particulate debris spreading air injection {{at the bottom of the}} bed is used to simulate steam flow through the porous debris bed. A series of test have been carried out to study the influence of particles size and density, roughness of the <b>spreading</b> <b>plate,</b> gas flow rate etc. on particulate spreading. A semi-empirical model for predicting the spreading of particulate debris has been developed using experimental closures for debris mass flow rate as a function of local (i) angle of the bed and (ii) gas flux.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Macmillan Publishers Limited {{and can be}} found at: [URL] To the best of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal employees when contributing to this work. Axial Seamount is an active submarine volcano located at the intersection between the Cobb hotspot and the Juan de Fuca spreading centre in the northeast Pacific Ocean 1, 2. The volcano has been closely monitored since it erupted in 1998 (refs 3, 4). Since then, Axial Seamount seemed to exhibit a similar inflation–deflation cycle to basaltic volcanoes on land and, on that basis, was expected to erupt again sometime before 2014 or 2020 (refs 5, 6). In April 2011 Axial Seamount erupted. Here we report continuous measurements of ocean bottom pressure that document the deflation–inflation cycle of Axial Seamount between 1998 and 2011. We find that the volcano inflation rate, caused by the intrusion of magma, gradually increased {{in the months leading up}} to the 2011 eruption. Sudden uplift occurred 40 – 55 [*]min before the eruption onset, which we interpret as a precursor event. Based on our measurements of ground deformation through the entire eruption cycle at Axial Seamount, we suggest that another eruption could occur as early as 2018. We propose that the long-term eruptive cycle of Axial Seamount could be more predictable compared with its subaerial counterparts because the volcano receives a relatively steady supply of magma through the Cobb hotspot and because it is located on thin oceanic crust at a <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundary...|$|E
40|$|Given {{a uniform}} {{lithology}} and strain rate {{and a full}} seismic data set, the maximum depth of earthquakes may be viewed to a first order as an isotherm. These conditions are approached atthe Hengill geothermal rea, S. Iceland, a dominantly basaltic area. The likely strain rate calculated from thermal and tectonic onsiderations is 1 O- I 5 s- ‘, and temperature measurements from four drill sites within the area indicate average, near-surface geothermal gradients of up to 150 °C km- ’ throughout the upper 2 km. The temperature at which seismic failure ceases for the strain rates likely at the Hengill geothermal rea is determined by analogy with oceanic rust, and is about 650 f 50 °C. The topographies ofthe {{top and bottom of}} the seismogenic layer were mapped using 617 earthquakes located highly accurately by performing asimultaneous inversion for three-dimensional structure and hypocen-tral parameters. The thickness of the seismogenic layer is roughly constant and about 3 km. A shallow, aseismic, low-velocity volume within the <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundary that crosses the area occurs above the top of the seismogenic layer and is interpreted as an isolated body of partial melt. The base of the seismogenic layer has a maximum depth of about 6. 5 km beneath the spreading axis and deepens to about 7 km beneath a transform zone in the south of the area. Beneath the high-temperature part of the geothermal area, the maximum depth of earthquakes may be as shallow as 4 km. The geothermal gradient below drilling depths {{in various parts of the}} area ranges from 84 + 9 ”C km- ’ within the low-temperature geothermal area of the transform zone to 138 + 15 °C km- ’ below the centre of the high-temperature g othenal area.

40|$|Several {{workers have}} {{suggested}} that the locations of melting anomalies (hotspots) and the original locations of large igneous provinces (LIPs) and kimberlite pipes lie preferentially above the margins of two large low-shear-velocity provinces, or LLSVPs, {{near the bottom of the}} mantle, and that the geographical correlations have high confidence levels (> 99. 9999 %). They conclude that the LLSVP margins are “plume-generation zones”, and that deep-mantle plumes cause hotspots, LIPs, and kimberlites. This conclusion raises questions about what physical processes could be responsible, because, for example, the LLSVPs are apparently dense and not abnormally hot. The supposed LIP-hotspot-LLSVP correlations probably are examples of the “hindsight heresy”, of performing a statistical test using the same data sample that led to the initial formulation of a hypothesis. In this process, an analyst will consider and reject many competing hypotheses, but will not adjust statistical assessments correspondingly. Furthermore, an analyst will test extreme deviations of the data, but not take this fact into account. “Hindsight heresy” errors are particularly problematical in Earth science, where it commonly is impossible to conduct controlled experiments. For random locations on the globe, the number of points within a specified distance of a given curve follows a cumulative binomial distribution. We use this fact to test the statistical significance of the observed hotspot-LLSVP correlation using several hotspot catalogs and mantle models. The results indicate that the actual confidence levels of the correlations are two or three orders of magnitude smaller than claimed. The tests also show that hotspots correlate well with presumably shallowly rooted features such as <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries. Nevertheless, the correlations are significant at confidence levels in excess of 99 %. But this is confidence that the null hypothesis of random coincidence is wrong. It is not confidence about what hypothesis is correct. The correlations probably are symptoms of as-yet-unidentified processes. These observations emphasize the importance of the distinction between correlation and causation, and underline the necessity of taking geological factors into account. Consideration of the kimberlite data set in the context of geological setting, for example, suggests that the apparent association with the LLSVP margins results from the fact that the Kaapvaal craton, the site of most of the kimberlites considered, lies in southern Africa, and that kimberlite eruptions are sensitive primarily to stress in the lithosphere...|$|E
40|$|Rifting of the Paleozoic Gondwana supercontinent during Mesozoic time ended {{eventually}} {{with the}} breakup of Africa and South America, leading to passive margin formation and {{to the creation of}} the South Atlantic Ocean (e. g. Karner & Driscoll, 1999; Mohriak et al., 2002). Rifting began in the south and propagated towards the north, accompanied by lithosphere stretching that finally culminated in breakup and the onset of sea floor <b>spreading.</b> <b>Plate</b> motion reconstruction in the South Atlantic is controversial due to a magnetic quiet zone lasting from early Aptian to Campanian times. End of rifting and onset of seafloor spreading is by many studies estimated to range from 137 to 130 Ma in the southern part of the South Atlantic (Austin & Uchupi, 1982; Nürnberg & Müller, 1991; Gladczenko et al., 1997; Mohriak et al., 2002). The oldest magnetic seafloor-spreading anomalies recognized off Namibia are 130 Ma, and breakup is therefore considered to have occurred there in Early Cretaceous time (Rabinowitz and LaBrecque, 1979). The South Atlantic rift system created two different passive margin settings offshore Namibia, namely non-volcanic and volcanic, situated north and south of the bathymetric feature Walvis Ridge offshore North Namibia (Fig. 1. 1) (Gladczenko et al., 1999). On the conjugate South America margin, the Rio Grande Rise (Fig. 1. 1) represents the conjugate prominent bathymetric feature, which is related to the Tristan hot-spot plume trail (e. g. Storey, 1995; Eldholm et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 2001). North of Walvis Ridge the margin shows more similarities with the Angola margin, but without the prominent salt structures (e. g. Marton et al., 2000; Nurullina, 2006). This part has got no/little evidence of extrusive magmatic material and underplating compared to the margin south of the Walvis Ridge, which exhibits large volumes of extrusive material both offshore and onshore, and evidence of underplating (e. g. Gladczenko et al., 1997; Gladczenko et al., 1999). As petroleum exploration advances into frontier regions it is important to understand the crustal architecture of continental margins. Since most seismic surveys do not extend seaward beyond the continental shelf and slope, integration and modelling of potential field data helps to gain more information and to reduce costs and interpretation risks. In this study, the North Namibian margin is studied based on an integrated analysis of seismic reflection, potential field data and modelling. The aim is to study and model the crustal structure and to refine the continent-ocean boundary/transition. Through this analysis, the main tectonic events shaping the margin are discussed and the margin segmentation due to a number of transfer systems is refined. Finally, the architecture and development of the North Namibia margin is viewed and discussed in a South Atlantic conjugate margin-setting framework...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of the highest-resolution teleseismic {{tomography}} study yet performed of the upper mantle beneath Iceland. The experiment used data gathered by the Iceland Hotspot Project, which operated a 35 -station network of continuously recording, digital, broad-band seismometers over all of Iceland 1996 – 1998. The structure of the upper mantle was determined using the ACH damped least-squares method and involved 42 stations, 3159 P-wave, and 1338 S-wave arrival times, including the phases P, pP, sP, PP, SP, PcP, PKIKP, pPKIKP, S, sS, SS, SKS and Sdiff. Artefacts, both perceptual and parametric, were minimized by well-tested smoothing techniques involving layer thinning and offset-and-averaging. Resolution is good beneath most of Iceland from 60 km depth to a maximum of 450 km depth and beneath the Tjornes Fracture Zone and near-shore parts of the Reykjanes ridge. The results reveal a coherent, negative wave-speed anomaly with a diameter of 200 – 250 km and anomalies in P-wave speed, VP, as strong as - 2. 7 per cent and in S-wave speed, VS, as strong as - 4. 9 per cent. The anomaly extends from the surface to the limit of good resolution at 450 km depth. In the upper 250 km it is centred beneath {{the eastern part of the}} Middle Volcanic Zone, coincident with the centre of the 100 mGal Bouguer gravity low over Iceland, and a lower crustal low-velocity zone identified by receiver functions. This is probably the true centre of the Iceland hotspot. In the upper 200 km, the low-wave-speed body extends along the Reykjanes ridge but is sharply truncated beneath the Tjornes Fracture Zone. This suggests that material may flow unimpeded along the Reykjanes ridge from beneath Iceland but is blocked beneath the Tjornes Fracture Zone. The magnitudes of the VP, VS and VP/VS anomalies cannot be explained by elevated temperature alone, but favour a model of maximum temperature anomalies < 200 K, along with up to 2 per cent of partial melt in the depth range 100 – 300 km beneath east-central Iceland. The anomalous body is approximately cylindrical in the top 250 km but tabular in shape at greater depth, elongated north–south and generally underlying the <b>spreading</b> <b>plate</b> boundary. Such a morphological change and its relationship to surface rift zones are predicted to occur in convective upwellings driven by basal heating, passive upwelling in response to plate separation and lateral temperature gradients. Although we cannot resolve structure deeper than 450 km, and do not detect a bottom to the anomaly, these models suggest that it extends no deeper than the mantle transition zone. Such models thus suggest a shallow origin for the Iceland hotspot rather than a deep mantle plume, and imply that the hotspot has been located on the spreading ridge in the centre of the north Atlantic for its entire history, and is not fixed relative to other Atlantic hotspots. The results are consistent with recent, regional full-thickness mantle tomography and whole-mantle tomography images that show a strong, low-wave-speed anomaly beneath the Iceland region that is confined to the upper mantle and thus do not require a plume in the lower mantle. Seismic and geochemical observations that are interpreted as indicating a lower mantle, or core–mantle boundary origin for the North Atlantic Igneous Province and the Iceland hotspot should be re-examined to consider whether they are consistent with upper mantle processes...|$|E
40|$|The xylanase-producing {{bacterial}} strains {{were isolated}} from drain water. The strains were isolated on xylan-agar media and screening {{was carried out}} by β-xylanolysis method. The strains were further confirmed by DNS-method. The isolated strains were identified as Aeromonas on the basis of catalase, oxidase, gram staining and morphological cultural characteristics as well as by different biochemical tests. Multi-drug resistant of these strains were confirmed by antibiotic <b>spread</b> <b>plate</b> method. Disc diffusion method and antibiotic <b>spread</b> <b>plate</b> method showed the same multi-drug resistant pattern. Plasmid DNA was isolated from maximum xylanase-producing strain. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the isolated plasmid DNA in 0. 8 % agarose showed the presence of only one 30 kb plasmid. The plasmid DNA was transformed into nonxylanase-producing sensitive E. coli LE 392. The transformants showed xylanase activity as well as multi-drug resistance. Xylanase activity and multi-drug resistance in Aeromonas strain was proposed to be plasmid mediated...|$|R
