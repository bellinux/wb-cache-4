50|$|B16.38- Large Metallic Valves for Gas Distribution (Manually Operated, NPS 2 ½ (DN 65) to 12 (DN 300), 125 psig (8.6 bar) Maximum. This Standard covers {{requirements}} for manually operated metallic valves in nominal sizes 2 ½ (DN 65) through 12 (DN 300) having the inlet and outlet {{on a common}} centerline. These valves are intended for controlling the flow of gas from open to fully closed positions, for use in distribution and service lines where the maximum gage pressure does not exceed 125 psig (8.6 bar). Valve seats, seals, and <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> may be nonmetallic. This Standard sets forth the minimum capabilities, characteristics, and properties that a newly manufactured metallic valve must possess {{in order to be}} considered suitable for use in the piping systems indicated above, carrying natural gas, manufactured gas synthetic natural gas (SNG), and liquefied petroleum gases (distributed as a vapor, with or without the admixture of air) or mixtures thereof.|$|E

40|$|The E 1 {{envelope}} protein of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is a class II fusion protein that mediates low pH-triggered membrane fusion during virus infection. Like other class I and class II fusion proteins, during fusion E 1 inserts into the target membrane and rearranges {{to form a}} trimeric hairpin structure. The postfusion structures of the alphavirus and flavivirus fusion proteins suggest that the “stem” region connecting the fusion protein domain III to the transmembrane domain interacts along the trimer core during the low pH-induced conformational change. However, {{the location of the}} E 1 stem in the SFV particle and its rearrangement and functional importance during fusion are not known. We developed site-directed polyclonal antibodies to the N- or C-terminal regions of the SFV E 1 stem and used them to study the stem during fusion. The E 1 stem was hidden on neutral pH virus but became accessible after low pH-triggered dissociation of the E 2 /E 1 heterodimer. The stem packed onto the trimer core in the postfusion conformation and became inaccessible to antibody binding. Generation of the E 1 homotrimer on fusion-incompetent membranes identified an intermediate conformation in which domain III had folded back but <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> was incomplete. Our data suggest that E 1 hairpin formation occurs by the sequential packing of domain III and the stem onto the trimer core and indicate a tight correlation between <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> and membrane merger...|$|E

Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the seat ring sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The seat ring is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the seat ring contracts more than the seat ring. This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|E

We have reviewed the licensee event reports to identify the events that took place during 1985 to the third quarter of 1996, and reviewed related technical literature and visited PWR plants to analyze these events. Our assessment shows that USNRC licensees have taken effective actions {{to reduce the number of}} leak events. One main reason for this decreasing trend was the elimination or reportable leakages from valve <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> after 1991. Our review of leak events related to vibratory fatigue reveals a statistically significant decreasing trend with age (years of operation), but not in calendar time. Our assessment of worldwide data on leakage caused by thermal fatigue cracking is that the fatigue of aging piping is a safety significant issue. Our review of leak events has identified several susceptible sites in piping having high safety significance; but the inspection of some of these sites is not required by the ASME Code. These sites may be included in the risk-informed inspection programs...|$|E
40|$|Butterfly valves {{are mostly}} used in various {{industries}} such as oil and gas plant. This valve operates with rotating motion using pneumatic system. Rotating actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows free passage of the fluid and when fully closed, the disc rotated a quarter turns to block the fluid. The primary failure modes for valves are the valve leaks to environment through flanges, seals on the valve body, valve <b>stem</b> <b>packing</b> not properly protected, over tightened packing nuts, the valve cracks and leaks over the seat. To identify the failure of valve Failure Mode and Effects Analysis has been chosen. FMEA is the one of technique to perform failure analysis. It involves reviewing as many components to identify failure modes, and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects {{on the rest of}} the system are recorded in a specific FMEA form. Risk priority number, severity, detection, occurrence are the factor determined in this studies.

40|$|A {{negative}} relationship between stand biomass and the density of stems is expected to develop during the self-thinning process in resource-limited forests; {{this leads to a}} large proportion of the total biomass occurring in large trees. Nevertheless, frequent disturbance regimes can reduce self-thinning and the accumulation of large trees. We investigated size-density relationships and the contribution of large trees (dbh ≥ 70 cm) to stand biomass in 55 1 -ha plots along a 600 km transect in central-southern Amazonia. The effects of natural-disturbance gradients (frequency of storms and soil characteristics) and seasonality on forest-structure components (density of stems and mean individual mass) and stand biomass were examined. Contrary to self-thinning predictions, stand biomass increased in forests with higher stem densities. Large trees contained only an average of 5 % of stand biomass, and half of the stand biomass was represented by small trees with diameters < 27 cm. These findings indicate that persistent or strong disturbance plays a critical role in forest structure and biomass in the central-southern Amazon. Frequent storms were identified as an important source of disturbance in the region. Forests under higher frequency of storms had trees with lower individual mass and higher <b>stem</b> <b>packing.</b> More physically restrictive soils seem to magnify the effects of exogenous disturbances limiting individual tree size. Forests in areas with longer dry seasons had lower stem densities; however, individual mass was higher in these areas. These structural components of biomass seem to counterbalance each other in generating total stand biomass. Seasonality affected forest structural components but not stand biomass. Synthesis. Forests of central-southern Amazonia are not resource limited and accumulate most part of their biomass in small- to mid-sized trees. The effects of environmental gradients on specific structural components of stand biomass differ such that strong positive effects on one component can mitigate strong negative effects on other component. Future work on the determinants of stand biomass should investigate forest structure and the contributions of individual components to stand biomass. </p...|$|E
