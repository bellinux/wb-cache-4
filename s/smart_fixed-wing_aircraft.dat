50|$|During the six-week Falklands War British carrier-based British Aerospace Sea Harrier and Hawker Siddeley Harrier {{flew over}} 1500 sorties and Avro Vulcans flew {{long-range}} bombing missions. 21 Argentine fixed-aircraft were {{destroyed in the}} air by British Harriers and Sea Harriers. A further 18 Argentine <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> were destroyed by British Surface to Air Missiles. 15 Argentine <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> were destroyed {{on the ground and}} 14 were captured. Sixty eight Argentine <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> were captured or destroyed by British Forces, representing 28% of the 240 <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> the Argentinians had {{at the start of the}} war. When accidents and friendly fire are included, 31% of the total 240 <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> were lost.|$|R
50|$|The first police {{aviation}} {{department was}} established in New York City in 1919 with two <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> have generally been replaced by more versatile rotary-wing aircraft since the late 1940s. However, <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are still used in some missions, such as border patrol, as their higher speed and greater operating altitude allow larger areas to be covered.|$|R
5000|$|Some police air units {{also use}} <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which allow higher and quieter surveillance, making it {{less likely that}} {{suspects}} will become aware they are being watched. A few police air units, such as the Northern Territory Police in Australia, use only <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The use of <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> also allows for longer flying times and incurs lower running costs. [...] <b>Fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are also used to transport prisoners, with the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (nicknamed [...] "Con Air") perhaps being the largest example of this use. <b>Fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are also used to provide regular police patrols in remote communities and to transport investigators to remote crime scenes. [...] Light-sport aircraft and powered parachutes can sometimes be used to provide a cost-effective replacement for helicopters in the observation platform role.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to land-based ambulances, AHS contracts 12 <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> to provide 24-hour air ambulance services throughout the province. 5,500 patients were transferred by <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> via contracted air ambulance providers in Alberta in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Practical, powered, <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> (the {{aeroplane}} or airplane) {{were invented}} by Wilbur and Orville Wright. Besides {{the method of}} propulsion, <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are in general characterized by their wing configuration. The most important wing characteristics are: ...|$|R
50|$|Glider <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{including}} free-flying gliders {{of various}} kinds and tethered kites, can use moving air to gain height.Powered <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> that gain forward thrust from an engine (aeroplanes) include powered paragliders, powered hang gliders and some ground effect vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{that are}} used for firebombing tend {{to be of the}} larger agricultural-style, {{specially}} modified for firebombing. These aircraft are sometimes referred to as SEATs (Single-Engined Air Tankers). This type of aircraft particularly suits the conditions most often encountered in Australia where there are relatively few long paved runways, but plenty of agricultural airstrips. Larger <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> have been used where appropriate and cost-effective. Light <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are also regularly used for fire detection, reconnaissance, command and control.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are not {{necessarily}} rigid; kites, hang-gliders, variable-sweep wing aircraft and aeroplanes using wing-warping are all <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft.Most <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some {{are designed to be}} remotely or computer-controlled.|$|R

5000|$|Dihedral {{angle is}} the upward angle from {{horizontal}} of the wings or tail-plane of a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> [...] "Anhedral angle" [...] {{is the name}} given to negative dihedral angle, that is, {{when there is a}} downward angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Forecast International {{reported}} that some design features {{were intended to}} support fixed wing aircraft such as the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II; although neither the Ministry of Defense nor the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force have mentioned the possibility of introducing <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The ship has neither a [...] "ski-jump" [...] nor a catapult, typical features for launching <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> If Izumo-class ships were to operate <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> it {{would be limited to}} STOVL (short take-off, vertical landing) aircraft, such as the F-35B.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{increases}} or {{decreases the}} lift {{generated by the}} wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the angle of attack (AOA). The roll angle {{is also known as}} bank angle on a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which usually [...] "banks" [...] to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce drag making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately [...] "sideslipped" [...] for example a slip in a <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
