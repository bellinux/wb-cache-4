Antibiotic concentrations measured in tissues was then be compared to concentrations required to kill bacteria to serve as foundation of anti-infective therapies. Based on these studies Dr. Wittmann habilitated for Professor of Surgery at University of Hamburg defending his thesis about the concentration dynamics of antimicrobials intra-abdominal infections.In 1972 Dr. Wittmann had the opportunity to work in Annaba, Algeria, and took his young family to Algeria for an anticipated two year commitment. After a year political unrest forced the Wittmanns to return to Germany but by then he had seen many diseases in their advanced stages including abdominal infections. The culmination of experiences led Dr. Wittmann to begin to develop a means to keep the abdominal wall safely open for serial intra-operative treatment and control of healing processes. Early attempts used a variety of temporary closure devices such des retention sutures, zippers and <b>slide</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Ultimately he discovered the method of hook and loop fasteners to be optimal for closing the abdomen temporarily. In 1988 he joined the faculty Robert E. Condon and Dr. Charles Aprahamian at the Medical College of Wisconsin and became a full Professor of Surgery. He developed one of the first US surgical critical care fellowship programs at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1990 and became its first director. In 2000 Dr. Wittmann retired from the medical college but continued his work on staged abdominal repair and the hook and loop fastener temporary fascia prosthesis. He remained active providing advice to surgeons worldwide using his website www.openabdomen.org and continued to lecture about the fundamental benefits of planned open abdomen.|$|E

Much {{of the collection}} consists of family photographs, but also includes various identification, official and educational documentation as well as statements from employers, family correspondence, notes and an essay. Grace Polk Family Collection, AR 25104 Harry Polk (originally Hans Günther Pollak) was born on May 3, 1894 in Vienna, Austria. His parents were Hugo Pollak (1866 - 1935) and Thekla Pollak (née Lichtenstadt; 1871 - 1939). During World War I, Harry served in the Austrian Army and was held as a Prisoner of War in Siberia until 1921. After his release, {{he worked for the}} Ephrussi Bank in the Stocks and Bonds Division. In 1936, he married Elizabeth Sofer. The couple left Austria in 1938 for London and then for New York. While in the United States, Harry worked for the Waldes Company in Long Island City, a manufacturer of <b>slide</b> <b>fasteners</b> with branches in Vienna and Prague, until his retirement in 1964. He separated from his wife the same year and began to travel, finally settling in Austria. Harry Polk died in Vienna on August 24, 1983. Elizabeth Sofer was born in Vienna on March 23, 1902 to parents Julius Sofer (1871 - 1957) and Katharina Skalla Sofer (1864 - 1944). She worked for her father at the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company in Vienna. Elizabeth was a dancer and a member of several modern dance companies. Like her husband, she first worked for the Waldes branch in New York. In 1957, she began to work as a dance therapist at the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York City, and in 1958 co-founded the National Dance Teacher's Guild. From 1960 to 1982, she was a staff member at the Children's Center for Creative Arts at Adelphi University. She specialized in working with handicapped and emotionally disturbed children. In 1966, she co-founded the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). In 1995, Elizabeth was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the ADTA and noted as a chief pioneer in the field of dance and movement therapy. She died on October 29, 2001 in New York. Julius Sofer (Elizabeth Polk's father) was a manufacturers' representative at the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company in Vienna. His connections to the American branch of the Waldes Company helped him to obtain affidavits and visas for the Polks and other members of their family. In 1938, Julius Sofer transferred to the export department of Waldes in Prague and then immigrated to Cuba in 1941. His wife Katharina Sofer stayed behind in Vienna and died there in 1944. Julius finally arrived in the United States in 1943 and lived with the Polk family until his death in 1957. Processeddigitize...|$|E

Fecha de lectura: 25 - 11 - 2016 Esta tesis tiene embargado el acceso al texto completo hasta el 25 - 05 - 2018 Arthropods cuticle {{constitutes}} an external skeleton or exoskeleton. It has a protective function, such as support or defense against predator, {{but also has}} a physiologic role by preventing from desiccation or by sensing its environment among others. Arthropods suffer various molting throughout their lifetime. Their cuticle is highly rigid {{and has to be}} periodically shed to allow the animal to grow or to change its form. This process highly stereotyped, referred as ecdysis, is followed by a postecdysis period which permits the cuticle to become mature. Drosophila melanogaster is a holometabolous insect. Its life cycle starts with the fecundated egg. At the end of the embryogenesis, the embryo hatches to give rise to a small size larva. Two molts are necessary to obtain the grown larva, which then stop moving. The cuticle of the larvae is then shed and used as a cocoon, called pupal case, where a complete metamorphosis (from the Greek meta “change” and morphe “form”) occurs. At the final ecdysis (eclosion), the adult fly emerges. During the post-eclosion behavioral sequence the newly formed and soft cuticle get tanned, that is to say get hardened and darken, and the wings extend. Adult thorax derives from a couple of larval structures, which are of ectodermal origin, called wing imaginal discs. During the metamorphosis, they migrate dorsally and fuse at the midline in a two <b>slide</b> <b>fasteners</b> manner similar to a wound healing. During this Thesis, we studied the implication of the Hox gene Antennapedia (Antp) during thorax closure. We found that Antp expression is restricted to the cells that initiate this morphogenetic event and alteration of its expression leads to a split thorax. Our results indicate that this phenotype is associated to a missregulation of JNK signaling which in turn affects actin cytoskeleton organization and filopodia formation needed in the leading edge cells for tissue migration. We also focus our interest on a later Drosophila developmental stage, the post-eclosion. The mechanism underlying the post-eclosion sequence is known to be controlled by the neuropeptide Bursicon, which is synthesized by a subset of neurons called CCAP. We found that the transcription factor Opa is expressed in the CCAP cells and that downregulation of opa expression mimics the phenotype of alteration in Bursicon expression. Our data point to a requirement of Opa expression in the CCAP cell to prevent them from apoptosis. Besides, we identified Opa as the first uncovered positive regulator of Bursicon expression.

40|$|Breeding {{behaviors}} of Microchiroptera, particularly {{the mechanism of}} fertilization and development {{are different from those}} of the other mammals. Namely, most of the vespertilionid bats of the temperate zones (e. g., Pipistrellus abramus etc. from Japan) copulate during the autumn, and the spermatozoa are stored in the uterus until the next spring, when ovulation and fertilization occur. On the other hand, in Miniopterus schreibersi fuliginosus from Japan, ovulation and fertilization take place soon after copulation. Therefore, the spermatozoa of this species are not stored for a long time in the uterus, but a single fertilized egg in free blastocyst stage is recognized in the uterus during the winter. The aim of our study attempts to examine the mechanism of fertilization and development, particularly, of capacitation of the spermatozoa during their passage through the genital tracts in the two species, P. abramus and M. s. fuliginosus, the breeding {{behaviors of}} which are different. Mossman (1953) has shown that the characters of the genitalia and foetal membranes are far more conservative, and hence, can be better utilized for determining the phylogenetic relationships of the mammals than other characters. Sperm morphology as a criterion of phylotaxonomic relationships among animals belongs to a relatively recent innovation. The present work is to make use of the fine structure of sperm as a criterion of phylotaxonomic relationships among bats. In order to provide a logical solution for these problems, it is necessary to pursue the process of spermiogenesis at electron microscopic level. Testes and epididymides of the following six species of bats belonging to two families and four genera, i. e., Rhinolophus cornutus cornutus, R. ferrumequinum nippon (Rhinolophidae), Myotis nattereri bombinus, My. macrodactylus, Pipistrellus abramus (Vespertilioninae of Vespertilionidae) and Miniopterus schreibersi fuliginosus (Miniopterinae of the same family) were examined in the present study. The spermatids and spermatozoa of each species were observed and compared morphologically with Hitachi HU- 11 A electron microscope, but the descriptions were based chiefly on M. s. fuliginosus. /I. The late maturation phase in spermiogenesis/ The spermatids continue to undergo alterations from the Golgi phase to the maturation phase of the spermatid and consequently take on the shape characteristic of the species (Fig. 1). In the Golgi phase of the spermatid of M. s. fuliginosus, a large Golgi complex is visible, and a acrosomal granule is fixed to the limiting membrane of the vacuole where the latter is adherent to the nuclear envelope (Figs. 2 and 3). In the acrosomal phase, the acrosomal vacuole has begun to spread laterally over the anterior pole of the nucleus, and the space in the acrosomal vacuole is filled with a homogeneous material that is continuous with the acrosomal granule. In the space between the inner acrosomal membrane and outer leaf of the nuclear envelope, a little cytoplasm is visible, and in this space of the spermatid in the maturation phase an electron dense material of the apical body is observed (Fig. 4 a and b). The nucleus of the spermatid is in progress at a pole of the spermatid. The outer acrosomal membrane becomes adherent to the plasma membrane of the spermatid (Fig. 5). In this stage, the caudal sheath extends backwards from a nuclear ring at the posterior margin of the acrosomal cap, and continuously the spermatid nucleus becomes elongated and flattend during this period, and the chromatin becomes coarser and larger (Fig. 6 a and b, Fig. 7 a and b). In the late maturation phase of spermatid, the nucleus takes on the shape characteristic of the species, and the nucleus is transformed into a homogeneous dense mass. The post-nuclear cap is gradually formed while the nuclear ring migrates backwards between the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope of the spermatid. It seems to us that the functional morphology of the topographical relationship between the nuclear ring and two membranes is similar to the structure and function of the <b>slide</b> <b>fastener.</b> Thus, posterior to the nuclear ring, the posterior portion of the sperm head remains incomplete. The nucleoplasm is often left between the nuclear envelope and the chromatin (Fig. 8). In the next stage, the nuclear ring and caudal sheath become extinct. Each of them is generally regarded as a transient structure. By this time, the sperm head is completed and a redundant portion of the nuclear envelope is reflected from the surface of the nucleus, and forms a membranous scroll around the neck. When the connecting piece reached to its completion, the middle piece is not yet completed in this stage. Just behind the connecting piece the annulus is still present, and posterior to the annulus, the base of the flagellum devoid of the mitochondria is observed (Fig. 9). The fibrous sheath is already formed before the annulus has migrated. When the annulus migrates from the posterior part of the connecting piece to the boundary part between the middle piece and principal piece, the mitochondria arrange in a helix around the base of the flagellum to form the mitochondrial sheath (Figs. 10 and 11). In the tail of the mature sperm, nine outer dense fibers are seen in the cross section of the middle piece, and four of them are unusually larger than the others (Fig. 12). Fig. 13 shows semischematically a series of the changes in the late spermiogenesis stated above. /II. Phylogenetic considerations of the bats based upon the fine structure of the spermatozoa/ The fine structure of the spermatozoa is distinctive at the familial, subfamilial, generic and specific levels. In the spermatozoa of bats belonging to Rhinolophidae, the shape of the nucleus in frontal view is broader at the anterior portion than at the posterior portion, and the acrosome is larger than in Vespertilioninae of Vespertilionidae; the total number of mitochondria in the spermatozoon is large in number (i. e., in R. cornutus 130, R. ferrumequinum 160), but the size of each mitochondrion is small. On the other hand, in the sperm of bats belonging to Vespertilioninae of Vespertilionidae, the shape of the nucleus is tapering anteriorly, and the acrosome is smaller than in Rhinolophidae, but the large mitochondria are generally large in number (i. e., in My. nattereri 135, My. macrodactylus 117, P. abramus 138). In the spermatozoa of M. s. fuliginosus belonging to Miniopterinae of the same family, the acrosome is larger than in both of Rhinolophidae and Vespertilioninae, and its anterior portion swells out; the total number of mitochondria in the spermatozoon is a comparatively small numerical value (78), and the size of each mitochondrion is small. Between R. cornutus and R. ferrumequinum, or between My. nattereri and My. macrodactylus, belonging to the same genus, the fine structure of sperm is distinctive at specific level (Table 1). When considered from the viewpoint of fertilization physiology, the spermatozoa of bats belonging to Vespertilioninae of Vespertilionidae are stored in the uterus from the autumn to the following spring when ovulation and fertilization occur. In these species, large mitochondria are generally large in number. However, in M. s. fuliginosus ovulation and fertilization occur soon after the autumn copulation. Therefore, the spermatozoa of this species are not stored for a long time in the uterus. In this connection, it is worthy to note that in this species the total number of mitochondria of the spermatozoon is small and each mitochondrion is small in size. Based upon these data, we believe that the fine structure of the spermatozoon may be reasonably utilized as a criterion for determining the phylogenetic relationships of bats. 日本産コウモリ類の Rhinolophus cornutus cornutus コキクガシラコウモリ,Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon キクガシラコウモリ(以上 Rhinolophidae キクガシラコウモリ科),Myotis nattereri bombinus ノレンコウモリ, Myotis macrodactylus モモジロコウモリ, Pipistrellus abramus イエコウモリ(以上 Vespertilionidae ヒナコウモリ科, Vespertilioninae ヒナコウモリ亜科), Miniopterus schreibersi fuliginosus ユビナガコウモリ(同科 Milliopterinae ユビナガコウモリ亜科) の 2 科 4 属 6 種が本研究に供試された. 1) Spermiogenesisについては各種で観察したが,記載は主としてM. s. fuliginosusを中心に行ない,次の点が明らかになつた. 核の変形と共に精子細胞核のchromatinの凝縮が進むが,chromatinが凝縮を完了し均質化すると共に,acrosome後端のnuclear ringが後方へ移動を始め,これに伴つて次第にpost-nuclear capが形成され,nuclear ringはpost-nuclear capの形態形成に大きな役割を果たしている. Nuclear ringおよびcaudal sheathがspermatidの核後端にまで移行し,消失する頃には精子頭部は形態学的に完成する. このstageになつて初めて,annulusの移動が起こりconnecting pieceにつづくmiddle pieceが分化形成される. この時すでにprincipal pieceのfibrous sheathは完成しており,connecting pieceに接していたannulusはfibrous sheathの前端,すなわち将来のmiddle pieceとprincipal pieceの境界域まで移動する. 将来のmiddle pieceの所定の空間が確保されると,ここに半ドーナツ型のmitochondriaがラセン状に巻くようになる. このstageにはsperm head後方に多くのcytoplasmが残つているが,精子の基本構造は完成したことになる. 2) 各種コウモリ類の成熟精子を電顕的に調べた結果,科,亜科,属,種によつて精子はそれぞれ特徴的な微細構造を有していることが明らかになつた. Rhinolophidaeのものは核の形が水平断面で先端がやや広くなつていること,acrosomeが大きいこと,mitochondriaの数は多いが小さいことによつて特徴づけられている. VespertilionidaeのVespertilioninaeは核の形が先端でやや細くなつていること,acrosomeが小さいこと,mitochondriaが数・大きさ共に優つていることによつて,同科Miniopterinaeはacrosomeが大きく,しかも矢状断面でその先端が球状に膨らんでいること,mitochondriaは数・大きさ共に劣つていることによつて特徴づけられている. 同属別種のR. cornutusとR. ferrumequinum,My. nattereriとMy. macrodactylusのそれぞれの間でもacrosomeの大きさ,mitochondriaの数に種的特徴がみられた. 受精生理学的な側面から系統分類学的に考察を加えるならば,精子が長期生存するMy. nattereri,My. macrodactylus,P. abramusではmitochondriaの数・大きさとも最も優つている. 反対に精子が長期間生きる必要のないM. s. fuliginosusではmitochondriaは数・大きさとも最も劣つている. Rhinolophidaeのコウモリも精子が長期生存するが,これではmitochondriaの小さいことをその数でカバーしていると思われ,前二者の中間値を示す. 以上のように,供試材料の種類数が今のところ少なく,系統分類学的な観点から多くを論議することはできなかつたが,おおまかにいつて,亜科を異にする精子の形態には相違点が多く,属レベルではそれらの精子間に類似性が強くなる傾向がみられた. しかし,種間においても精子の微細構造面からみれば,多くの種的特徴が観察された. 今後,筆者らは系統分類の基準として精子の微細構造を用いるために広範な研究を進めたい...|$|R
