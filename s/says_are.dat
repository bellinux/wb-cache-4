It has extensive data on various Orthodox Churches in the United States, including both Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox groups (as well as groups considered uncanonical by those two groups). The publication is endorsed by the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops and is being used by various Assembly committees {{as part of their}} research and planning. The Atlas lists the United States membership of the OCA as 84,900, 33,800 of which it <b>says</b> <b>are</b> regular church attendees. It lists the OCA as having 551 parishes and 19 monasteries in the United States. It also indicates the states with the heaviest concentration of OCA parishes are, in order: Alaska (with 86), Pennsylvania (with 83), California (with 43) and New York (with 41).|$|E

25|$|In Why F A Hayek is a Conservative, British {{policy analyst}} Madsen Pirie claims Hayek {{mistakes}} {{the nature of}} the conservative outlook.

They wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop. It is an outlook, says Pirie, that Hayek and conservatives both share.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{rejects the}} {{dichotomy}} between religious spirituality {{on the one}} hand and scientific rationality on the other, and favors a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion. He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like neuroscience and psychology. Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he <b>says</b> <b>are</b> discoverable directly through our experience. His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle criticises the Spartans in his Politics: the helots keep rebelling; the Spartan {{women are}} luxurious; the magistrates (and {{especially}} the ephors) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the apella is silly; {{the wealth of}} the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the resources necessary to be a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he <b>says,</b> <b>are</b> even worse.|$|E

25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he <b>says</b> <b>are</b> the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
