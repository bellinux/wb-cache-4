5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> follows: Seth {{has a clear}} and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E

25|$|Seurat's {{theories}} can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> follows: The {{emotion of}} gaiety {{can be achieved}} by the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm colors, and by the use of lines directed upward.

Sadness is achieved by using dark and cold colors and by lines pointing downward.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{ordinary}} mechanics only {{considers the}} behaviour {{of a single}} state, statistical mechanics introduces the statistical ensemble, which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a probability distribution over all possible states of the system. In classical statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a phase space with canonical coordinates. In quantum statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states, and can be compactly <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> a density matrix.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{syllable}}s {{is defined by}} the number of vowels (i.e., every syllable must contain one and only one vowel) and the main rule can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> follows: a syllable can begin with at most one consonant (except for the first syllable of a word, which may contain up to three initial consonants). It means that a syllable can only begin without a consonant if there is no consonant after the preceding vowel (e.g. di-ó-nyi ‘nut-sized’), and if there are multiple consonants between vowels, only one can go to the next syllable (e.g. lajst-rom ‘list’).|$|E
25|$|The {{promotions}} can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> {{series of}} promotion chains, as follows. Within each block below, a piece (except the kings) promotes to the piece above it. Pieces {{at the top}} of each block do not promote (and if in italics, and with an *asterisk, as stated before, these appear only upon promotion). Note that pieces may only promote once. For example, a gold general promotes to a rook, and a rook promotes to a dragon king, but a gold general promoted to a rook cannot promote a second time to a dragon king. This is clear from the equipment, for each piece only has two sides.|$|E

25|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience, spatial memory {{is the part}} of memory responsible for recording information about one's environment and spatial orientation. For example, a person's spatial memory is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's spatial memory is needed to learn the location of food {{at the end of a}} maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> a cognitive map. Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with spatial memory. Many methods are used for measuring spatial memory in children, adults, and animals.|$|E
25|$|Cretan hieroglyphs {{are found}} on {{artifacts}} of Crete (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). Linear B, the writing {{system of the}} Mycenaean Greeks, has been deciphered while Linear A {{has yet to be}} deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> follows: Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the Aegean Islands (Kea, Kythera, Melos, Thera), and the Greek mainland (Laconia) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete (Knossos), and mainland (Pylos, Mycenae, Thebes, Tiryns) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{examples}} such as {{the case}} of Kennewick Man have illustrated the tensions between Native Americans and archaeologists, which can be <b>summarized</b> <b>as</b> a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often {{differ from those of}} tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.|$|E
