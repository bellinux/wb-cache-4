40|$|A {{knowledge}} {{of the behavior of}} chondrocytes in culture is relevant for tissue engineering. Chondrocytes dedifferentiate to a fibroblast-like phenotype <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> surfaces. Dedifferentiation is reversible if these cells are then cultured in suspension. In this report a description is given of how when chondrocyte aggregates formed in suspension are next seeded <b>on</b> <b>plastic,</b> most of them attach as round or polygonal cells. This morphological differentiation, with synthesis of type II collagen, is stable for long culture periods. This simple method can be of use as a model for studies of chondrocyte behavior <b>on</b> <b>plastic.</b> The results indicate that in addition to culture conditions, such as cell isolation method or cell density, chondrocyte behavior <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> depends <b>on</b> the presence of aggregates. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{growth and}} {{collagen}} biosynthesis were compared in dermal calf fibroblasts cultured <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> or <b>on</b> a reconstituted basement membrane gel, termed matrigel. This matrix, extracted from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumors, consists mainly of laminin, entactin, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The multiplication rate of fibroblasts grown on matrigel was stimulated {{compared to that}} of monolayered cells cultured <b>on</b> <b>plastic,</b> and these cells formed multilayers after 4 days. Protein and collagen biosynthesis was reduced in fibroblasts cultured on matrigel. A higher proportion of the newly synthesized collagen (40 %) was incorporated to the extracellular matrix in cultures grown on matrigel than in those grown <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> (14 %). Type III collagen was the preferential collagen type deposited on matrigel, and the ratio of type III:type I collagens secreted in the medium was also slightly higher in cultures grown on matrigel. Partially processed collagen was more abundant in fibroblasts grown on matrigel than in cells cultured <b>on</b> <b>plastic.</b> Finally, cells grown on matrigel exhibited a higher catabolic activity than cells grown <b>on</b> <b>plastic.</b> In this experimental model, the reconstituted basement-membrane matrix seems to influence the activities of fibroblasts significantly.
