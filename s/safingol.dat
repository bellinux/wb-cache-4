5000|$|<b>Safingol</b> is a lyso-sphingolipid {{protein kinase}} inhibitor. It has the {{molecular}} formula C18H39NO2 {{and is a}} colorless solid. Medicinally, <b>safingol</b> has demonstrated promising anticancer potential as a modulator of multi-drug resistance and as an inducer of necrosis. The administration of <b>safingol</b> alone has not been shown to exert {{a significant effect on}} tumor cell growth. [...] However, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that combining <b>safingol</b> with conventional chemotherapy agents such as fenretinide, vinblastine, irinotecan and mitomycin C can dramatically potentiate their antitumor effects. Currently in Phase I clinical trials, it is believed to be safe to co-administer with cisplatin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safingol</b> {{competitively}} {{competes with}} phorbol dibutyrate at regulatory domains of the protein kinase C family, inhibiting the activation of such enzymes as PKCβ-I, PKCδ, and PKCε. <b>Safingol</b> can also inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k), {{which is a}} critical component of the mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, <b>safingol,</b> like other sphingolipids, has been found to inhibit glucose uptake. This results in oxidative stress, leading to the generation of ROS that are both time and concentration-dependent. Together, the inhibitory signaling effects (particularly of PKCε and PI3k) and the presence of ROS synergize to induce autophagy.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism by}} which <b>safingol</b> induces cell death is poorly understood. It is believed to exert a variety of inhibitory effects, resulting {{in a series of}} cascades that result in accidental necrotic cell death brought about by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediated by autophagy. Increased autophagic activity has been associated with increased cellular death, although it is unclear if there is any causative relationship between the two. Because autophagy normally plays a pro-survival role by impeding apoptosis, it is curious that it {{may play a role in}} cell death following <b>safingol</b> exposure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safingol</b> {{is also a}} {{putative}} inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK), which catalyzes {{the production}} of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), an important mediator of cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. This ability further contributes to its anticancer potential. It can also affect the balance of other endogenous sphingolipids, particularly ceramide and dihydroceramide, which have been implicated in autophagic induction and ROS production.|$|E
50|$|One {{potential}} {{explanation for}} safingol’s cytotoxicity is that high concentrations result in ROS-related molecular and cellular damage {{that is beyond}} repair. Therefore, autophagy does not directly contribute to death, but is rather a failed attempt to preserve cell viability. However, {{not only does this}} hypothesis warrants further testing, but <b>safingol</b> has demonstrated unusual regulatory effects on other pathways capable of regulating autophagy.|$|E
50|$|As expected, a {{decrease}} in glucose heightens AMPK phosphorylation. However, an initial increase in phosphorylated mTOR is also observed, which eventually reduces after several hours. The mTOR pathway normally inhibits autophagy, as is induced by heightened glucose uptake. Therefore, decreasing glucose levels should suppress the mTOR pathway, allowing for autophagy. While autophagy is indeed observed following exposure of <b>safingol,</b> it is intriguing that mTOR is activated initially. Modulations in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and endonuclease G from mitochondria are also thought {{to play a role}} in safingol-induced cellular death by regulating autophagy.|$|E

Upstream mediators remain largely unknown. The levels of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in cultured oral SCC cells were measured. Treatment with <b>safingol</b> increased intracellular H 2 O 2 levels but not extracellular H 2 O 2 levels, indicating the production of H 2 O 2. The cell killing effect of <b>safingol</b> and H 2 O 2 was diminished {{in the presence of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).

40|$|<b>Safingol,</b> L- threo-dihydrosphingosine, induces {{cell death}} in human oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) cells through an endonuclease G (endoG) -mediated pathway. We herein determined whether <b>safingol</b> induced apoptosis and autophagy in oral SCC cells. <b>Safingol</b> induced apoptotic cell death in oral SCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. In safingol-treated cells, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC 3) -I was changed to LC 3 -II and the cytoplasmic expression of LC 3, amount of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) stained by acridine orange and autophagic vacuoles were increased, indicating the occurrence of autophagy. An inhibitor of autophagy, 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA), enhanced the suppressive effects of <b>safingol</b> on cell viability, and this was accompanied {{by an increase in}} the number of apoptotic cells and extent of nuclear fragmentation. The nuclear translocation of endoG was minimal at a low concentration of <b>safingol,</b> but markedly increased when combined with 3 -MA. The suppressive effects of <b>safingol</b> and 3 -MA on cell viability were reduced in endoG siRNA- transfected cells. The scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevented cell death induced by the combinational treatment, whereas a pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not. These results indicated that <b>safingol</b> induced apoptosis and autophagy in SCC cells and that the suppression of autophagy by 3 -MA enhanced apoptosis.

40|$|<b>Safingol</b> is a {{sphingolipid}} with promising anticancer potential, {{which is}} currently in phase I clinical trial. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of its action remain largely unknown. We reported here that safingol-induced primarily accidental necrotic cell death in MDA-MB- 231 and HT- 29 cells, {{as shown by the}} increase in the percentage of cells stained positive for 7 -aminoactinomycin, collapse of mitochondria membrane potential and depletion of intracellular ATP. Importantly, <b>safingol</b> treatment produced time- and concentration-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Autophagy was triggered following <b>safingol</b> treatment, as reflected by the formation of autophagosomes, acidic vacuoles, increased light chain 3 -II and Atg biomarkers expression. Interestingly, scavenging ROS with N-acetyl [...] cysteine could prevent the autophagic features and reverse safingol-induced necrosis. Our data also suggested that autophagy was a cell repair mechanism, as suppression of autophagy by 3 -methyladenine or bafilomycin A 1 significantly augmented cell death on 2 - 5 [*]μ <b>safingol</b> treatment. In addition, Bcl-xL and Bax might be involved in the regulation of safingol-induced autophagy. Finally, glucose uptake was shown to be inhibited by <b>safingol</b> treatment, which was associated with an increase in p-AMPK expression. Taken together, our data suggested that ROS was the mediator of safingol-induced cancer cell death, and autophagy {{is likely to be a}} mechanism triggered to repair damages from ROS generation on <b>safingol</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{studied the}} {{metabolism}} of radioactively labeled <b>safingol</b> (L-threo-dihydrosphingosine) in primary cultured neurons, B 104 neuroblastoma cells, and Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts, and {{compared it to}} that of its natural stereoisomer D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine. Both sphingoid bases are used as biosynthetic precursors for complex sphingolipids, albeit to different rates. Whereas {{a considerable amount of}} the natural sphingoid base is also directed to the catabolic pathway (20 – 66 %, cell type dependent), only a minor amount of the nonnatural <b>safingol</b> is subjected to catabolic cleavage, most of it being N-acylated to the respective stereochemical variant of dihydroceramide. Interestingly, N-acylation of <b>safingol</b> to L-threo-dihydroceramide is less sensitive to fumonisin B 1 than the formation of the natural D-erythro-dihydroceramide.

40|$|Endovesiculation {{by large}} unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) induced by {{cationic}} amphiphiles {{is described in}} this work. A recent procedure to monitor phagocytosis of vesicles by macrophages by determining {{the amount of the}} simultaneously internalized water-soluble fluorescent dye HPTS with external quencher was adapted to LUVs (Daleke, D. L.; Hong, K.; Papahadjopoulos, D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1990, 1024, 352). Compared to dibucaine and <b>safingol,</b> the local anesthetic chlorpromazine (CPZ) was found to be the most efficient inducer of HPTS-internalization by LUVs. Control experiments using LUVs with entrapped HPTS indicated that the observed dye-internalization does not originate from transient lysis. A strong increase in activity above the critical micelle concentration of CPZ implies the importance of CPZ-micelles for endovesiculation. The significantly less efficient CPZ-induced HPTS-internalization by LUVs with 68 nm compared to 176 nm diameter further diminishes the likelihood of a micelle/bilayer fusion mechanism and supports the presence of ‘zipper-type' endovesiculation by LUVs with diameters as small as 68 nm...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{resistance}} to chemotherapy {{is common in}} gastroesophageal cancer. Mechanisms of resistance are incompletely characterised {{and there are no}} predictive biomarkers in clinical practice for cytotoxic drugs. We used new cell line models to characterise novel chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and validated them in tumour specimens to identify new targets and biomarkers for gastroesophageal cancer. Methods: cell lines were selected for {{resistance to}} oxaliplatin, cisplatin and docetaxel and gene expression examined using Affymetrix Exon 1. 0 ST arrays. Leads were validated by qRT-PCR and HPLC of tumour metabolites. Protein expression and pharmacological inhibition of lead target SPHK 1 was evaluated in independent cell lines, and by immunohistochemistry in gastroesophageal cancer patients. Results: genes with differential expression in drug resistant cell lines compared to the parental cell line they were derived from, were identified for each drug resistant cell line. Biological pathway analysis of these gene lists, identified over-represented pathways, and only 3 pathways - lysosome, sphingolipid metabolism and p 53 signalling- were identified as over-represented in these lists for all three cytotoxic drugs investigated. The majority of genes differentially expressed in chemoresistant cell lines from these pathways, were involved in metabolism of glycosphingolipids and sphingolipids in lysosomal compartments suggesting that sphingolipids might be important mediators of cytotoxic drug resistance in gastroeosphageal cancers. On further investigation, we found that drug resistance (IC 50) was correlated with increased sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK 1) mRNA and also with decreased sphingosine- 1 -phosphate lysase 1 (SGPL 1) mRNA. SPHK 1 and SGPL 1 gene expression were inversely correlated. SPHK 1 :SGPL 1 ratio correlated with increased cellular sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), and S 1 P correlated with drug resistance (IC 50). High SPHK 1 protein correlated with resistance to cisplatin (IC 50) in an independent gastric cancer cell line panel and with survival of patients treated with chemotherapy prior to surgery but not in patients treated with surgery alone. <b>Safingol</b> a SPHK 1 inhibitor, was cytotoxic as a single agent and acted synergistically with cisplatin in gastric cancer cell lines. Conclusion: agents that inhibit SPHK 1 or S 1 P could overcome cytotoxic drug resistance in gastroesophageal cancer. There are several agents in early phase human trials including <b>Safingol</b> that could be combined with chemotherapy or used in patients progressing after chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) {{is a family}} of serine/threonine kinases that are key {{regulatory}} enzymes involved in growth, differentiation, cytoskeletal reorganization, tumor promotion, and migration. We investigated the functional involvement of PKC isotypes and of E-cadherin in the regulation of the locomotion of six human colon-adenocarcinoma cell lines. The different levels of the PKC α and the E-cadherin expression have predictable implications in the spontaneous locomotory activity. With the use of PKC α–specific inhibitors (<b>safingol,</b> Go 6976) {{as well as the}} PKC δ–specific inhibitor rottlerin, we showed that only PKC α {{plays a major role in}} the regulation of tumor cell migration. The results were verified by knocking out the translation of PKC isozymes with the use of an antisense oligonucleotide strategy. After stimulation with phorbol ester we observed a translocation and a colocalization of the activated PKC α at the plasma membrane to the surrounding extracellular matrix. Furthermore, we investigated the functional involvement of E-cadherin in the locomotion with the use of a blocking antibody. A high level of PKC α expression together with a low E-cadherin expression was strongly related to a high migratory activity of the colon carcinoma cells. This correlation was independent of the differentiation grade of the tumor cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Background—We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the contractile response of human peripheral microvasculature to endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), examined the role of specific ET receptors and protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-), and analyzed ET- 1 –related gene/protein expression in this response. Methods and Results—Human skeletal muscle arterioles (90 to 180 m in diameter) were dissected from tissue harvested before and after CPB from 30 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In vitro contractile response to ET- 1 was assessed by videomicroscopy, with and without an endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor antagonist, an endothelin-B (ET-B) antagonist, or a PKC- inhibitor. The post-CPB contractile response of peripheral arterioles to ET- 1 was significantly decreased compared with pre-CPB response. The response to ET- 1 was significantly inhibited {{in the presence of}} the ET-A antagonist BQ 123 but unchanged {{in the presence of the}} ET-B receptor antagonist BQ 788. Pretreatment with the PKC- inhibitor <b>safingol</b> reversed ET- 1 –induced response from contraction to relaxation. The total protein levels of ET-A and ET-B receptors were not altered after CPB. Microarray analysis showed no significant changes in the gene expression of ET receptors, ET- 1 –related proteins, and protein kinases after CPB. Conclusions—CPB decreases myogenic contractile function of human peripheral arterioles in response to ET- 1. The contractile response to ET- 1 is through activation of ET-A receptors and PKC-. CPB has no effects on ET- 1 –related gene/protein expression. These results provide novel mechanisms of ET- 1 –induced contraction in the setting o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPKC-δ is {{important}} in cell growth, apoptosis, and secretion. Recent studies show its stability is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (TYR-P), which can be stimulated {{by a number of}} agents. Many of these stimuli also activate phospholipase C (PLC) cascades and {{little is known about the}} relationship between these cascades and PKC-δ TYR-P. Cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates PKCs but it is unknown if it causes PKC-δ TYR-P and if so, the relationship between these cascades is unknown. In rat pancreatic acini, CCK- 8 stimulated rapid PKC-δ TYR-P by activation of the low affinity CCKA receptor state. TPA had a similar effect. BAPTA did not decrease CCK-stimulated PKC-δ TYR-P but instead, increased it. A 23187 did not stimulate PKC-δ TYR-P. Wortmannin and LY 294002 did not alter CCK-stimulated PKC-δ TYR-P. GF 109203 X, at low concentrations, increased PKC-δ TYR-P stimulated by CCK or TPA and at higher concentrations, inhibited it. The cPKC inhibitors, Gö 6976 and <b>safingol,</b> caused a similar increase in TPA- and CCK-stimulated PKC-δ TYR-P. These results demonstrate that CCKA receptor activation causes PKC-δ TYR-P through activation of only one of its two receptor affinity states. This PKC-δ TYR-P is not directly influenced by changes in [Ca 2 +]i; however, the resultant activation of PKC-α has an inhibitory effect. Therefore, CCK activates both stimulatory and inhibitory PKC cascades regulating PKC-δ TYR-P and, hence, likely plays an important role in regulating PKC-δ degradation and cellular abundance...|$|E
40|$|Background. Little {{information}} is available regarding the mechanisms involved in cytokine-induced type 1 inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R 1) expression in human mesangial cells (HMCs) in the occurrence of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Over-expression of IP 3 R 1 would enhance both IP 3 -binding activity and sensitivity. We hypothesize {{that it is possible}} that increased IP 3 R 1, induced by TNFα, would lead to increased IP 3 sensitivity in response to a var-iety of vasoconstrictors, and promote HMC contraction and thus lead to reduced GFP, promoting HRS occurrence and development. Methods. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot assay were used {{to examine the effects of}} TNFα on IP 3 R 1 mRNA and protein expression. Several in-hibitors of kinases, depletion PKC, over-expression of dom-inant-negative mutant of PKC and non-radioactive PKC assay were used to examine the mechanism of signal trans-duction of TNFα-regulated IP 3 R 1 in HMCs. Results. TNFα increased IP 3 R 1 mRNA and protein expres-sion in HMCs, an effect that was blocked by prolonged incubated chronic PMA, D 609, <b>safingol</b> and also by trans-fection with domain-negative PKCα construct. TNFα acti-vated and promoted autophosphorylation of the PKCα. In addition, both anti-TNFR 1 and anti-TNFR 2 antibodies blocked TNFα-induced IP 3 R 1 protein expression, while only anti-TNFR 1 antibodies but not anti-TNFR 2 antibodies attenuated TNFα-induced PKCα activity. Conclusions. TNFα increased the expression of IP 3 R 1, and this was mediated, at least in part, through the TNFR 1 /PC-PLC/PKCα and TNFR 2 signalling pathways in HMCs...|$|E
40|$|Patients with disseminated Ewing’s {{family of}} tumors (ESFT) often {{experience}} drug-resistant relapse. We hypothesize that targeting {{minimal residual disease}} with the cytotoxic retinoid N-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4 -HPR; fenretinide) may decrease relapse. We determined the following: (a) 4 -HPR cytotoxicity against 12 ESFT cell lines in vitro; (b) whether 4 -HPR increased ceramide species (saturated and desaturated ceramides); (c) whether physiological hypoxia (2 % O 2) affected cytotoxicity, mitochondrial membrane potential (� � m) change, or ceramide species or reactive oxygen species levels; (d) whether cytotoxicity was enhanced by L-threo-dihydrosphingosine (safingol); (e) whether physiological hypoxia increased acid ceramidase (AC) expression; and (f) {{the effect of the}} AC inhibitor N-oleoyl-ethanolamine (NOE) on cytotoxicity and ceramide species. Ceramide species were quantified by thin-layer chromatography and scintillography. Cytotoxicity was measured by a fluorescence-based assay using digital imaging microscopy (DIMSCAN). Gene expression profiling was performed by oligonucleotide array analysis. We observed, in 12 cell lines tested in normoxia (20 % O 2), that the mean 4 -HPR LC 99 (the drug concentration lethal to 99 % of cells) � 6. 1 � 5. 4 �M (range, 1. 7 – 21. 8 �M); <b>safingol</b> (1 – 3 �M) synergistically increased 4 -HPR cytotoxicity and reduced the mean 4 -HPR LC 99 to 3. 2 � 1. 7 �M (range, 2. 0 – 8. 0 �M; combination index < 1). 4 -HPR increased ceramide species in the three cell lines tested (up to 9 -fold; P < 0. 05).

40|$|Dihydrodiol {{dehydrogenase}} (DDH) is {{a member}} or the aldo-keto reductases superfamily (AKR 1 C 1 -AKR 1 C 4), which plays central roles in the metabolism of steroid hormone, prostaglandin and xenobiotics. We have previously detected overexpression of DDH {{as an indicator of}} poor prognosis and chemoresistance in human non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). We also found DDH expression to be closely related to chronic inflammatory conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the links between inflammation, DDH expression and drug resistance in NSCLC cells. We showed that pro-inflammatory mediators including interieukin- 6 (IL- 6) could induce AKR 1 C 1 / 1 C 2 expression in NSCLC cells and increase cellular resistance to cisplatin and adriamycin. This effect was nullified by <b>Safingol,</b> a protein kinase C inhibitor. Moreover, the expression of AKR 1 C 1 / 1 C 2 was inversely correlated to NBS 1 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). We also showed that IL- 6 -induced AKR 1 C 1 / 1 C 2 expression and drug resistance were inhibited by wogonin and chrysin, which are major flavonoids in Scutellaria baicalensis, a widely used traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. In conclusion, this study demonstrated novel links or pro-inflammatory signals, AKR 1 C 1 / 1 C 2 expression and drug resistance in NSCLC. The protein kinase C pathway may play an important role in this process. Overexpression of AKR 1 C 1 / 1 C 2 may serve as a marker or chemoresistance. Further studies are warranted to evaluate wogonin and chrysin as a potential adjuvant therapy for drug-resistant NSCLC, especially for those with AKR 1 C 1 / 1 C 2 overexpression.
