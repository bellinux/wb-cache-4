5|$|On January 28, 2011, DelDOT filed {{a lawsuit}} against bridge design firm Figg Bridge Engineers and subconsultant MACTEC Engineering and Consulting for {{geotechnical}} errors. In February 2011, DelDOT awarded George & Lynch an $11.6 million contract to build the approach roads to the new Indian River Inlet Bridge as well as to demolish the old bridge. A minor fire occurred on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> construction site; no damage was reported to the bridge structure. The north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was finished in August 2011 when the form travelers were removed. Over 250 people were employed {{in the construction of the}} bridge.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> at the {{southern}} end a major new residential development of 600 homes called Chelsea Bridge Wharf has been built, as part of long term plans to regenerate the long-derelict former industrial sites around Battersea Power Station.|$|E
5|$|A {{sport for}} two players or more, in the {{traditional}} version of poohsticks the participants must drop a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge and run to the other side. The winner is the player whose stick first appears on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Alternatively, players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a finish line farther downstream. The winner is the player whose stick first passes the finishing point.|$|E

50|$|In the {{northern}} and southern <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> there are brick buttresses on some break waters, and between every two buttresses on the supports there is a nine-meter vestibule with a ribbed arch extending nine meters. These vestibules and circular buttresses on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> have made <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most beautiful <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Safavid Period.|$|R
50|$|In June 2014 {{work began}} {{to widen the}} {{sidewalks}} on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> That work included <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> 'safety railings'. <b>The</b> 'railing' is composed of closely spaced vertical steel bars approximately ten feet high. The visual effect is a corridor-like narrowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> There is a loss of direct light, and a complete loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> views on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|Strengthening {{works were}} carried out on the bridge by Structural Systems Ltd in 1996. Also in 1996, {{decorative}} night lighting was installed on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The bridge was entered on the state's heritage register on 8 January 1999, and was named a national engineering landmark by the Institution of Engineers, Australia, in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} a few road {{modifications}} on the Sheet Harbour <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{as a result of}} the new bridge. Trunk 7 was aligned with what was Riverside Drive, which is now nonexistent. Church Point Road and Pool Road were slightly modified. The access road to Sheet Harbour Consolidated School and Duncan MacMillan High School was slightly modified. Sprott Lane, a minor loop, was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households.|$|E
5|$|With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men, {{armed with}} Winchester rifles, moved toward Chinatown in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by {{crossing}} separate bridges. The larger group entered {{by way of}} the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered {{by way of the}} town's plank bridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{same thing}} happens as the player goes up <b>the</b> treble <b>bridge</b> – after getting to La (B in this case), one has to go to <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treble <b>bridge.</b> Moving from <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bass <b>bridge</b> to <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treble <b>bridge</b> is {{analogous}} to moving from <b>the</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treble <b>bridge</b> to <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treble <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|MD7 crosses North East Creek {{and enters}} the town of North East, where the highway is known as Cecil Avenue. The highway intersects MD272, which follows a one-way pair, Main Street {{southbound}} and Mauldin Avenue northbound. MD7 leaves the town and passes through a forested area with scattered residences. The route passes through an S-curve during which it crosses to {{the north side of}} the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. On the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> is a stub of old alignment, MD7H. MD7 continues east, passing Old Elk Neck Road before turning north and reaching its eastern terminus at US40. The roadway continues beyond the intersection as MD279 (Elkton Road).|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{in the town}} of Webster, NY104 has exits leading to Bay Road, Five Mile Line Road, Hard Road, and Holt Road prior to {{entering}} the village of Webster. Within the village, NY104 meets NY250 (North Avenue) and Phillips Road by way of interchanges before exiting the village. The expressway loosely parallels the southern edge of the primary Xerox campus to an exit with Salt Road, where it downgrades to a divided highway as it continues east to Basket Road and the Monroe–Wayne county line, partially delimited by NY404.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks {{was invented}} by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne. The sport first came to {{prominence}} when it was described in the author's book The House at Pooh Corner {{as well as in}} the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> devises the rules for Poohsticks. Pooh continues to play the sport with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger and Eeyore.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{adorned with}} {{non-traditional}} wooden sculptures carved by prominent Māori artist Paratene Matchitt, some <b>of</b> which form <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bridge</b> {{has become a}} tourist attraction in its own right.|$|R
50|$|The {{pavement}} widths on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> are {{narrow and}} so give <b>the</b> uncomfortable situation <b>of</b> traffic passing nearby.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are usually}} {{four to five}} bridges on a yangqin. From right to left, they are: bass bridge, [...] "right bridge", tenor bridge, [...] "left bridge", and <b>the</b> {{chromatic}} <b>bridge.</b> During playing, one is supposed to strike the strings on <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> However, <b>the</b> strings on the [...] "chromatic bridge" [...] are struck on the right, and strings on the [...] "left bridge" [...] can be struck on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Indian River Inlet Bridge {{crosses the}} Indian River Inlet {{connecting}} the Atlantic Ocean {{to the east}} and the Indian River Bay to the west. The bridge is located within Delaware Seashore State Park and carries DE 1 between Dewey Beach to the north and Bethany Beach to the south. It carries four 12-foot (3.7-meter) lanes of traffic (two northbound and two southbound), a 4-foot (1.2-meter) interior and 10-foot (3-meter) exterior shoulder in each direction, and a 12-foot (3.7-meter)-wide sidewalk on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> for pedestrians and bicycles.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{situated}} in a historically significant area. The northern end of the bridge covers part of the Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite, which is commemorated by a National Historic plaque in Pioneer Court. The southern half of the bridge passes over the site of Fort Dearborn, which was constructed in 1803. The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above {{the entrance of the}} London Guarantee Building, and brass markers positioned in the sidewalks on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> delineate the posited outline of the original blockhouse.|$|E
5|$|The only {{significant}} alteration {{to the structure}} of the bridge itself since the addition of the sculptures in 1907 came in 1973, when the Greater London Council (GLC) decided to add an extra traffic lane by reducing the width of the pavements. To counter the increased load of extra traffic, the council announced the replacement of the cast-iron balustrades with low box-girder structures. Despite formal objections from both Lambeth and Westminster Councils, the GLC ignored the objections. In 2015, the extra lane of motor traffic was removed in favour of a kerb-protected two-way cycle track, on the north-east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> This forms part of Cycle Superhighway 5.|$|E
25|$|Vehicular {{access to}} <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> is {{provided}} by a complex series of ramps on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{historical}} monument <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century {{is located on}} the Alahi river flowing by <b>the</b> west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bist village. There is also information about <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> Shah Abbas I. Width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-arched <b>bridge,</b> built with stone and brick is 3.8 m, length is 21 m and height is 10 m. <b>Sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> which served to the trade caravans, moving with branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Silk Road, were covered with iron. Previously, <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was reinforced with the local reddish stones.|$|R
50|$|In February 2017, it was {{announced}} that Candaba Viaduct will be expanded and will be having new expressway lanes on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|The present {{bridge of}} seven arches was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The {{engineer}} was Thomas Rhodes, {{one of the}} commissioners of the Shannon Navigation, whose name {{can be seen on}} many of the bridges over the Shannon and on surviving lock mechanisms, notably at Victoria and Athlone locks. This bridge was reconstructed and widened jointly by Offaly County Council and Galway County Council in 1971. Their work included replacing massive stone parapets on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> with aluminium railings, and the removal of a swivel arch which had allowed passage for masted boats.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{rehabilitation}} <b>of</b> {{access roads}} on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is to be}} started. A second smaller bridge Unity 2 was completed in 2007.|$|R

5|$|Hichens {{was next}} {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 8th MGB Flotilla. These new boats were armed with a twin Oerlikon mount aft, a QF 2-pounder Mark XIV forward, twin Lewis or later twin Vickers machine guns either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and depth charges. The flotilla was moved to Dartmouth, Devon in July 1942. The first action {{they were involved in}} was during the night of 14/15 July. Ordered to engage E Boats using Cherbourg as a base they found a convoy of naval trawlers escorting a small tanker. The flotilla engaged the two rear escort trawlers and carried out a depth charge attack. The tanker was last seen to be on fire as the flotilla reformed off Alderney. After this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSO. Both the DSO and the Bar were presented during the same investiture at Buckingham Palace on 22 September 1942, while other members of the flotilla were awarded a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and four MIDs for the action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 29 November 1877, heavy rain caused the dam of the Rhodgeidio mill near Llanerchymedd to breach, and the surge of water washed away the wooden Caemawr bridge over the Afon Alaw. The first train {{of the day was}} driven by William Taylor, with fireman John Saunders and railway {{inspector}} John Davies also on the footplate. The train also included two coal trucks, a passenger coach, and a guard's van, with Edward Hughes serving as the guard. The whole train went over the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> into the river. Edward Hughes dragged himself out, and was taken to the nearest farm. John Davies was scalded to death, and Taylor and Saunders were found injured, and could not be freed until mid-day. John Saunders later died from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 676 (abbreviated I-676) is an Interstate Highway {{that serves}} as a major {{thoroughfare}} through Center City Philadelphia, where it is known as the Vine Street Expressway, and Camden, New Jersey, where it is known as the northern segment of the North–South Freeway, as well as the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Highway. Its western terminus is at I-76 in Philadelphia near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Fairmount Park. From there it heads east and is then routed on surface streets near Franklin Square and Independence Mall, home of the Liberty Bell, before crossing the Ben Franklin Bridge. On the New Jersey <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> the highway heads south to its southern terminus at I-76 in Gloucester City near the Walt Whitman Bridge. Between the western terminus and downtown Camden, I-676 is concurrent with U.S. Route 30 (US 30).|$|E
