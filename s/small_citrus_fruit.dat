50|$|It is a spiny {{evergreen}} shrub (rarely a small tree) {{growing to}} 3 m tall. The leaves are trifoliate, glossy dark green, each leaflet 2-4 cm long and 1.5-2 cm broad. The flowers are white, with three petals 10-13 mm long and 4 mm broad.The fruit is a red, edible hesperidium 10-15 mm diameter, {{similar to a}} <b>small</b> <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruit.</b> The fruit flesh is pulpy, with a flavor reminiscent of a slightly sweet lime.|$|E
50|$|The fruits are {{sometimes}} sour and are primarily used for cooking.The calamondin bears a <b>small</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> {{that is used}} to flavor foods and drinks. Despite its outer appearance and its aroma, the taste of the fruit itself is quite sour, although the peel is sweet. Eating a whole fruit has a surprise with the combination of sweet and sour. Calamondin marmalade can be made {{in the same way as}} orange marmalade. Like other citrus fruits, the calamondin is high in vitamin C.|$|E

40|$|Visible light imaging of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> from Mie Prefecture of Japan was {{performed}} to determine whether an algorithm could be developed to predict the sugar content.

50|$|Alternative {{treatments}} include alpha hydroxy acids (naturally {{available in}} <b>small</b> amounts in <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits),</b> Azelaic acid, and zinc. It is not {{thought that they}} are as effective as standard medical treatment {{but they tend to}} have less side effects. Some suggest tea tree oil and a specific strain of brewer's yeast, called CBS 5926. However, the former can cause contact dermatitis for some as well as breast development in teenage boys and should not be used if one suffers from rosacea as well due to it making the symptoms of that strand of acne worse; the latter (CBS 5962) can cause migraines and intestinal issues for some. None of these have been formally tested by the FDA so beware the risk you take when you forgo traditional Western medicine for herbal supplements.|$|R

40|$|Xcc) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial diseases of citrus. Because citrus canker is not found in many countries including European Union and Australia, Xcc is strictly regulated in order to prevent its spread. In this study, the effects of X-irradiation on Xcc growth either in the suspension or on the surface of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were investigated. The suspension containing 1 × 107 cfu/ml of Xcc was irradiated with different absorbed doses of X-irradiation ranging from 50 to 400 Gy. The results showed that Xcc was fully dead at 400 Gy of X-irradiation. To determine the effect of X-irradiation on quarantine, the Xcc-inoculated <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were irradiated with different X-ray doses at which Xcc was completely inhibited by an irradiation dose of 250 Gy. The D 10 value for Xcc on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> was found to be 97 Gy, indicating the possibility of direct application on citrus quarantine without any side sterilizer. Beside, presence of Xcc on the surface of asymptomatic <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> obtained from <b>citrus</b> canker-infected orchards was noted. It indicated that the exporting <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> need any treatment so that Xcc on the <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> should be completely eliminated.

40|$|Abstract — Main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity using electrical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the measurements of electrical properties of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were conducted at various levels of pH and frequencies. This is done as a first step in order to evaluate the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity that does not damage it. The electrical parameters have significant response to acidity of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> The changes of acidity lead to changes in electrical properties of fruits. Resistance per weight, reactance per weight, inductance per weight, and impedance per weight of Garut citrus fuits declined when the pH is increased. While the capacitance per weight of the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> increases as pH increases. The correlations between pH and electrical parameters are estimated by using multiple regressions equation. Their correlation was highly linear at frequency of 1 MHz. Those estimation equations are the primary basis in nondestructive determining of Garut citrus acidity with electrical impedance measurements...|$|R
