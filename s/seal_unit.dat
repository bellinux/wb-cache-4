50|$|A {{hydraulically}} activated pig {{consists of}} three units (Fig. 3): a brake unit, a <b>seal</b> <b>unit</b> and the cleaning head.|$|E
50|$|All {{units have}} {{openings}} {{that allow the}} entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The brake unit ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following <b>seal</b> <b>unit,</b> which channels it into the openings of the cleaning head. The <b>seal</b> <b>unit</b> and cleaning head restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the cleaning head's nozzles, creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Experimental {{research}} of technical state change in metal-metal <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> of pneumatic valve with two-positioned polarized electromagnetic drive. Design/methodology/approach. It {{has been shown}} that the work peculiarity of pneumatic valves with two-positioned electromagnetic drive and with metal-metal sealing is shock loads during its closure and opening. Such loads lead to intensive wearing process and increasing of gas leakage through the <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> of different design and made of different materials. It has been experimentally confirmed, that the effective way of wear intensiveness decreasing in metal-metal <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> is the use of special damping units in the valve Findings. As a result of experimental research it was concluded that including in the valve design of special damping device reduces the stress in the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> elements, which occurs in the <b>sealing</b> <b>units</b> elements during the valve closing, and, as a result, the wear intensiveness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> decreases. Usage of less wear-resisting, comparatively to the stainless steel 08 ? 18 ? 10 ? materials leads to the increase of wear intensiveness of the <b>sealing</b> <b>unit</b> contact surfaces. Originality/value. Comparative analysis of the obtained experimental dependencies shows, that including of the damping device decreases the intensiveness of gas leakage increase through the closed valve, which occurs with the increase of the operational cycles. Damping element provides the kinetic energy dissipation that decreases the wear speed of the sealing surfaces of the valve slide and the saddle. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ????????. ????????????, ??? ???????????? ???????????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ????????, ??? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????. ???????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????...|$|R

50|$|Coalition {{military}} planners {{were concerned that}} retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, {{in an attempt to}} slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by 6 US Air Force MH-53J Pave Lows, the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw the SEALs found their DPVs (the <b>SEAL</b> <b>unit</b> at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when the were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and {{with the exception of a}} GROM soldier who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for 5 days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.|$|E

40|$|Re-entry {{vehicles}} generally require {{control surfaces}} (e. g., rudders, body flaps) to steer them during flight. Control surface seals are installed along hinge lines and where control surface edges move {{close to the}} vehicle body. These seals must operate at high temperatures and limit heat transfer to underlying structures {{to prevent them from}} overheating and causing possible loss of vehicle structural integrity. This paper presents results for thermal analyses and mechanical testing conducted on the baseline rudder/fin seal design for the X- 38 re-entry vehicle. Exposure of the seals in a compressed state at the predicted peak seal temperature of 1900 F resulted in loss of seal resiliency. The vertical Inconel rudder/fin rub surface was re-designed to account for this loss of resiliency. Room temperature compression tests revealed that <b>seal</b> <b>unit</b> loads and contact pressures were below limits set to protect Shuttle thermal tiles on the horizontal sealing surface. The seals survived an ambient temperature 1000 cycle scrub test over sanded Shuttle tiles and were able to disengage and re-engage the tile edges during testing.
