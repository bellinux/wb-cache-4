500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "This was a {{confusing}} episode of Glee. For a while, it <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> unremarkable—a standard installment, meandering along enjoyably enough. But then, {{in the last}} few minutes, it suddenly got really rather dark indeed. I'm intrigued about what happens next." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Mash Off" [...] a [...] "C" [...] grade, and felt that the episode did not reach its full potential. He wrote, [...] "The gut-punch moment is sufficiently gut-punchy, and we'll {{get to that in a}} bit. But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made me angry. There's something about this show that leads to messy tonal mash-ups. But where the show's musical mash-ups are usually pretty harmonious, the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle." [...] James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode, with many more [...] "forgettable scenes and stories".|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Rascals", Ro, Picard, Guinan and Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) are {{transformed}} into adolescent versions of themselves while retaining their adult intelligence. As children, they foil a Ferengi plot {{to steal the}} Enterprise and sell the crew as slave labor. In her final episode, [...] "Preemptive Strike", Ro returns to the Enterprise as a Lieutenant after spending a year at Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training. During {{the course of the}} training, her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Chakotay, resigned from Starfleet to join the Maquis when his father is killed by the Cardassians. She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis, who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia. During the mission, she finds her loyalties in conflict with her duties as she becomes increasingly sympathetic to the plight of the Maquis. Despite Picard's effort to force her to do her duty, she joins the rebel group. Riker says she <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> sure she was doing the right thing, though she regretted disappointing Picard.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} of the show {{saw some of the}} biggest changes; in {{addition}} to Richie's superhero powers and a new opening, Static changed his costume. Cowan stated that the change was done to give his clothes a [...] "feel of the comic book", while McDuffie said it represented a growth that Virgil was passing through. This maturation made possible to [...] "explore some of the darker places in his world," [...] to have more varied conflicts, as the villains have also become more mature. He described it is as [...] "a natural outgrowth of all that, as is the new, more naturalistic look of the show." [...] This change was followed by the second season premiere—"The Big Leagues"—when Static meets Batman and Robin. Burnett said, [...] "after that show, everybody went, 'Let's go in that direction.'" [...] Writer John Semper, Jr. commented, [...] "of course, I always lean toward the dramatic ... But the same old light-hearted Static spirit is still there." [...] Richie gains superhero powers because it was becoming hard to fit him into the story and the producers wanted to keep the [...] "chemistry" [...] between voice actors LaMarr and Marsden. There was also a positive response from children in focus groups so [...] "he answer <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> obvious." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E
6000|$|The colonel asked {{a number}} of {{cautious}} and well-considered questions-- questions which <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> odd and flighty to Tracy--but the answers conveyed the information desired, apparently, for the colonel said to himself, with mixed pride and gratification: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{get to see}} 'em, as I {{only put}} up my hoss there," [...] he replied. [...] "But I know the stage took some away this mornin': it <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> well loaded up when I passed it." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame {{effected}} {{the reunion}} of her troupe, and all <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> much as before. She {{had decided to}} dance the next night, the Saturday night. On Sunday the party would leave for Warsall, about thirty miles away, to fulfil their next engagement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} that I did," [...] answered Ned Lowe. [...] "I {{was in such}} a hurry to get the instrument that I didn't pay much attention. And, besides that, it <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> dark in here after coming away from that big bonfire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Amos; [...] "the ground <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> well covered. If {{there is}} enough to make sledding, you are going after wood to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> cock-sure," [...] {{returned}} Pat, {{who was in}} a contradictory {{mood that}} day; [...] "but you know scholards sometimes differ in their opinions about books." ...|$|R

60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say I had {{expected}} to see Cyril showing a few more traces of last night's battle. I {{was looking for a}} bit of the overwrought soul and the quivering ganglions, if you know what I mean. He <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> ordinary and quite fairly cheerful.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, you see, sir,' he replied, 'if he hadn't come in, {{the first}} time, and I {{had not been}} quite sure he was the thief, and would return, the time would have seemed long. But, as it was, I being dead certain of my man, the time <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> short.' ...|$|E
60|$|Hastening to his assistance, I {{found that}} he had {{received}} a severe flesh wound in the thigh. I carried him into a house that <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> well protected from the fire, dressed his wound, and left him {{in charge of the}} inmates, who, although terribly frightened, were kind and sympathetic.|$|E
6000|$|... "All ready, I see, Massan," [...] said Stanley, {{as he came}} up, [...] "and the ice <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> open. How say you? {{shall we}} make a good day of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed! He {{does not}} seem to me a fit subject for pity. Young, strong, handsome, intelligent, he <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> well {{furnished}} to begin the battle of life--especially in the army." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{loved you}} first, Paula, and, though you did respond, {{it was not}} in the same way. I never took you off your feet. It <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> clear that Evan has." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No?" [...] Gulston said in surprise. [...] "Why {{it seems}} to me as clear as the sun at noon-day. What I heard <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> conclusive. Now there is the {{confirmation}} of the finding of the glove, and this cock and bull story of his riding about for hours and not knowing where he was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course," [...] the Major answered. Sir Francis Clavering was, in the meanwhile, endeavouring to make {{an excuse}} to his brother-guest for the new-comer's condition, and muttered {{something}} regarding Altamont, {{that he was an}} extraordinary character, very eccentric, very--had Indian habits--didn't understand the rules of English society--to which old Welbore, a shrewd old gentleman, who drank his wine with great regularity, said, [...] "that <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> clear." ...|$|E
60|$|So that {{question}} was answered. Here were leagues of shore changing shape. My spirits were {{down in the}} mud again. Two things <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> apparent to me. One was, {{that in order to}} be a pilot a man had got to learn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other was, that he must learn it all over again in a different way every twenty-four hours.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{all things}} considered,' said Mrs Gamp sharply, 'she might have know'd {{better than to}} go a-tirin herself out, by doin' anythink of the sort. Did they <b>seem</b> <b>pretty</b> {{pleasant}} together, sir?' ...|$|R

5000|$|However, {{he later}} told The New York Times [...] "I {{guess it is}} sort of a storybook ending. When you think about where I was and where I am now, it <b>seems</b> <b>pretty</b> incredible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Frank, [...] "I don't {{want to be}} inquisitive, mate, or to {{interfere}} in other people's affairs, but I noticed your mate looked an elderly man, and that you <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> much alone. I am only just out here myself, and I and the party I am working with are doing fairly; so I {{thought it would be}} only neighbourly to come over and see if I could be of use in any way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't reckon we ever can; but it's {{got to be}} done. I'd be 'shamed {{enough to}} die if Dan should settle hisself down here, after we've brought the princess. That would make four of us for aunt Dorcas to feed, an' we know she has 'bout all she can do to pay her own bills. It <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> tough when you an' I come; but I said to myself it was only {{for two or three}} weeks, an' we could patch it up somehow, after we got back to town." ...|$|E
60|$|Just what {{occurred}} then I couldn't exactly say, {{but the next}} few minutes were a bit exciting. I take it that Cyril must have made a dive for the infant. Anyway, the air <b>seemed</b> <b>pretty</b> well congested with arms and legs and things. Something bumped into the Wooster waistcoat just around the third button, and I collapsed on to the settee and rather lost interest in things for the moment. When I had unscrambled myself, I found that Jeeves and the child had retired and Cyril was {{standing in the middle of}} the room snorting a bit.|$|E
