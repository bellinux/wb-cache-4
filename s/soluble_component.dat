50|$|If one {{material}} is more soluble in the solvent than the other, it will deposit first {{on top of}} the substrate, causing a concentration gradient through the film. This has been demonstrated for poly-3-hexyl thiophene (P3HT), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) devices where the PCBM tends to accumulate towards the device's bottom upon spin coating from ODCB solutions. This effect is seen because the more <b>soluble</b> <b>component</b> tends to migrate towards the “solvent rich” phase during the coating procedure, accumulating the more <b>soluble</b> <b>component</b> towards the film's bottom, where the solvent remains longer. The thickness of the generated film affects the phases segregation because the dynamics of crystallization and precipitation are different for more concentrated solutions or faster evaporation rates (needed to build thicker devices). Crystalline P3HT enrichment closer to the hole-collecting electrode can only be achieved for relatively thin (100 nm) P3HT/PCBM layers.|$|E

External flagellar proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and exported by the flagellar type III secretion system. <b>Soluble</b> <b>components</b> of the flagellar export apparatus, FliI, FliH, and FliJ, have been implicated to carry late export substrates in complex with their cognate chaperones from the cytoplasm to the export gate. The importance of the <b>soluble</b> <b>components</b> {{in the delivery of}} the three minor late substrates FlgK, FlgL (hook–filament junction) and FliD (filament-cap) has been convincingly demonstrated, but their role in the transport of the major filament component flagellin (FliC) is still unclear. We have used continuous ATPase activity measurements and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies to characterize interactions between the <b>soluble</b> export <b>components</b> and flagellin or the FliC:FliS substrate–chaperone complex. As controls, interactions between <b>soluble</b> export <b>component</b> pairs were characterized providing Kd values. FliC or FliC:FliS did not influence the ATPase activity of FliI alone or in complex with FliH and/or FliJ suggesting lack of interaction in solution.

The lack of interaction in the fluid phase between FliC or FliC:FliS and the <b>soluble</b> export <b>components,</b> in particular with the ATPase FliI, suggests that cells use different mechanisms for the export of late minor substrates, and the major substrate, FliC.

40|$|The initial {{reactions}} {{involved in}} the catabolism of fructose in Pseudomonas aeruginosa include the participation of a phosphoenolpyruvate:fructose 1 -phosphotransferase system (F-PTS). Fractionation of crude extracts of fructose-grown cells revealed that both membrane-associated and <b>soluble</b> <b>components</b> were essential for F-PTS activity. Further resolution of the soluble fraction by both size exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography revealed the presence of only one component, functionally analogous to enzyme I. Enzyme I exhibited a relative molecular weight of 72, 000, catalyzed the pyruvate-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and mediated the phosphorylation of fructose when combined with a source of enzyme II (washed membranes). No evidence for the requirement of a phosphate carrier protein, such as HPr, could be demonstrated. Thus, the F-PTS requires {{a minimum of two}} <b>components,</b> a <b>soluble</b> enzyme I and a membrane-associated enzyme II complex, and both were shown to be inducible.

Lithium, at a concentration of 10 mM, gives the best precision of measurement and has no effect on the results of the immunoassays.

Numerous parameters must be controlled {{for the development of}} new technologies in designing inventive nanosilica structures, which are able to challenge the biological templates. A long neglected requirement that came into focus in the recent years are the cellular techniques of preventing unintentional lithification of cellular structures since numerous cellular components such as membranes, DNA, and proteins are known to precipitate nanosilica. The diatom metabolism makes use of techniques that restrict silicification to an armor of silica around the cell wall while avoiding the petrifying gaze of Medusa, which turns the whole cell into stone.

The discrimination between different <b>soluble</b> <b>components</b> in the silicification process (chemoselective silicification) is not only vitally important for the diatom but poses an interesting challenge for in vitro experiments.

Solubility studies were performed by measuring DBSO solubility {{as a function of}} BA concentration, and a ternary phase diagram was constructed. Dissolution was examined through intrinsic dissolution studies. Solid-state characterisation was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX), infra-red spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and thermal analysis. DBSO solubility was increased by means of complexation with BA. For the cocrystal, the solubility of both components was decreased in comparison to pure components. The cocrystal was identified as metastable and incongruently saturating. Dissolution studies revealed that dissolution of DBSO from the cocrystal was not enhanced in comparison to the pure compound or a physical mix, while BA release was retarded and followed square root of time kinetics. At the disk surface a layer of DBSO was found. The extent of complexation in solution can change the stability of the complex substantially.

" Each fraction alone was almost inactive, but enzymatic activity could be reconstituted by mixing the two fractions and adding GTP {{or one of}} its analogs. Based on their lability to heat and to incubation with trypsin, the activity in both fractions is proteinaceous. The active component in the soluble fraction appears to bind guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]), since it was specifically protected by this nucleotide against heat inactivation and against inactivation {{in the presence of}} EDTA. Furthermore, precipitation of the <b>soluble</b> <b>component</b> with ammonium sulfate in the presence of GTP[gamma S] gave rise to a fraction that was highly active in the absence of added nucleotide, indicating either tight binding or covalent interaction between GTP[gamma S] and the <b>soluble</b> <b>component.</b> The membrane fraction probably contains the catalytic moiety, because it was partially protected against heat inactivation by the substrate, UDP-glucose.
