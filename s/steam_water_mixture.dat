Microfuel particle is a millimeter size grain containing fission material core in a protecting coverage. The coverage protects fuel contact with coolant and provides isolation of fission products inside. Well thermophysical properties of microfuel bed in a direct contact with water coolant excludes fuel overheating when accidents. Microfuel use was suggested for a VVER, а direct flow reactor for superheat steam generation, a reactor with neutron spectra adjustment by the steam partial content varying in the coolant. Nonuniformities of two-phase coolant distribution in a heat generating particles bed are predicted by calculations in this text. The one is due to multiple-valuedness of pressure drop across the bed on the steam quality dependency. The nonuniformity decreases with flow rate and particle size growths absolute pressure diminishing while porosity effect is weak. The worse case is for pressure quality of order of one. Some pure steam filled pores appears parallel to <b>steam</b> <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> filled pores, latter steam quality {{is less than the}} mean of the bed. Considering this regime for the direct flow reactor for superheat steam generation we predict some water drops at the exit flow.

A Fortran program for an IBM- 704 digital computer, {{for the application of}} this model to predict void fraction, slip ratio, and critical flow rates to the flashing flow for various liquid-vapor metal systems inpipes when the conditions are such that critical flow may be experienced, was developed. Calculations were made for the following liquid- metal systems: mercury (temperature range, 450 to 1600 deg F), cesium (temperature range, 500 to 2300 deg F), rubidium (temperature range, 500 to 2300 deg F), potassium (temperature range, 900 to 2500 deg F), sodium (temperature range, 950 to 2500 deg F), and lithium (temperature range, 2000 to 3500 deg F).

5000|$|... ==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== Water has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing <b>steam.</b> Boiler <b>water</b> is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the <b>steam</b> and <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> are separated.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{methods such as}} steam {{injection}} process are the best heavy oil recovery methods. Improvement of mobility ratio in the reservoir and economic recovery from heavy oil reservoirs depend mainly on reduction of heavy oil viscosity. Design and modeling of a {{steam injection}} process requires heat and mass transfer. So, in this study, a numerical non-isothermal two-phase wellbore model is developed to simulate downward flow of <b>steam</b> and <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> in the wellbore during steam injection. This model entails simultaneous solution of coupled mass and momentum conservation equations inside the wellbore with an energy conservation equation for the fluids within the wellbore and surrounding medium. A drift-flux model is employed to represent slip between fluid phases. The model predictions are validated against real field data and other available models. So, by using data of steam injection wells for two oil fields of Martha Bigpond and Sallie Lee in our computer program, variations of steam pressure, temperature, and quality are predicted along the well depth. Then, the obtained results are compared {{with the results of}} some available models. This comparison proves the accuracy of our model. Finally, after certainty of the model's accuracy, variations of steam pressure, temperature, and quality at one of Iranian heavy oil reservoirs were predicted along the well depth. The model is useful for designing well completion and accurately computing pressure drop and steam quality along the wellbore, which is very important for estimating oil recovery by steam injection method...|$|R
