500|$|Section 4 {{covers the}} {{liability}} of landlords to visitors injured by the breach of his obligation to repair {{and maintain the}} property. Under common law, the landlord was not liable; the Act changes this. Section 4(1) provides that, when a tenant is occupying the premises {{in such a way}} as to impose an obligation on the landlord to maintain the property, the same duty that the landlord owes to the tenant is extended to anybody whose goods may be on the property [...] "from time to time". Where premises are occupied under a <b>sub-tenancy</b> agreement, the same obligation extends to the tenant leasing the property. Section 4 was repealed by Section 6(4) of the Defective Premises Act 1972.|$|E
500|$|After {{a season}} and a half ground-sharing at Hampton F.C.'s Beveree ground, Kingstonian opened their [...] new Kingsmeadow Stadium (on {{the site of the}} old Norbiton Sports Ground owned by Kingston Council) in August 1989. After over-spending, Kingstonian entered {{administration}} and lost the Kingsmeadow lease in October 2001. It was assigned in April 2002 by the administrators to property developers. AFC Wimbledon were Kingsmeadow sub-tenants before buying the lease in June 2003, making it their “home” until their move to Wimbledon was feasible. Kingstonian secured a 25-year <b>sub-tenancy</b> agreement, with customary break clauses. The clubs operated a ground-sharing arrangement, with Kingstonian receiving cheap rental terms. In 2015 AFC Wimbledon agreed plans to sell Kingsmeadow to Chelsea in order to help finance their plans to move back to a new stadium in Wimbledon. Chelsea have stated that they wish to use the ground for their own youth and ladies' teams and are unwilling to accommodate Kingstonian at Kingsmeadow. On 22 February 2017, Kingstonian announced that they will be sharing Leatherhead F.C.'s ground at Fetcham Grove for the 2017–18 season.|$|E
50|$|The Saxon lord Wulwin/Ulwin was lord in 1066; by 1086 {{the estate}} was in {{possession}} of Aubrey de Vere I and remained part of the barony of his descendants the Earls of Oxford until the 16th century. It formed part of the dowry of Juliana de Vere when she married Hugh Bigod in the mid-12th century, and the <b>sub-tenancy</b> passed to the Bigod earls of Norfolk who held it as one knight's fee of the Veres. Countess Juliana's son Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk founded a chapel at Harwich and granted it to Colne Priory, Essex, a Vere foundation.|$|E
25|$|The other marriage, {{which also}} {{occurred}} before 1130, was to Agnes {{daughter of the}} constable of Chester William fitz Nigel, and this eventually brought Eustace more land in Yorkshire at Bridlington {{as well as in}} Northamptonshire at Loddington. Both landholdings were held from the earl of Chester. Eustace would gain control of many other <b>sub-tenancies,</b> held from a number of lords, including the Archbishop of York, Bishop of Durham, Nigel d'Aubigny, and the count of Aumale, and in Henry's reign he held lands at Aldborough, Tickhill and Knaresborough from the king as a tenant-in-chief.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{important}} functions of the Lands Tribunal is to adjudicate claims by landlords for possession of premises, the tenancies or <b>sub-tenancies</b> of which are under the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7). Starting from 9 July 2004, the Tribunal also has power to adjudicate claims for possession of premises, the tenancies or <b>sub-tenancies</b> of which have expired by effluxion of time {{even when they are}} outside the said Ordinance. The Tribunal also has power to grant consequential relief. Another widely used jurisdiction of this Tribunal is to determine building management disputes. Such disputes arise from, among others, the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) and deeds of mutual covenant, the appointment or dissolution of management committees, requisitions for owners' meetings and appointment of building management agent. The Tribunal also has unlimited jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation payable by the Government to a person whose land has been compulsorily resumed or has suffered a reduction in value because of public developments. The Tribunal can also order the sale of land for redevelopment purpose under the Land (Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment) Ordinance (Cap. 545). The Tribunal also exercises appellate jurisdiction over (i) determinations by the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation under the Rating Ordinance (Cap. 116); (ii) determinations by the Director of Lands under the Government Rent (Assessment and Collection) Ordinance (Cap. 515); and (iii) determinations by the Director of Housing under the Housing Ordinance (Cap. 283). In exercising its jurisdiction, the Tribunal has the same powers to grant remedies and relief, legal or equitable, as the Court of First Instance of the High Court. Parties may appoint counsel or solicitors to appear before the Tribunal or, as is often the case, they may appear in person. The tribunal has a President who is a Judge of the Court of First Instance. There are currently two Presiding Officers who are District Judges, and three members.|$|R

5000|$|A large awning {{projects}} {{from the}} surface of the facade, supported by iron tie-backs. The horizontal awning features a centrally located shallow arch which defines the entrance. Raised lettering on the front of the awning spelling [...] "PARAGON" [...] is located on the arch. The entrance is via concrete steps to four pairs of folding glass and timber doors. Tapered pylons abutting the wall surface flank the entrance doors and support another arch over the doorway. The pylons, archway and trim on the awning are all painted in bright red with the remainder of the lower facade painted in dark green. Two shop fronts are situated at the corners of the front facade. The entry area has also been sub- divided with a lightweight partition in order to create a <b>sub-tenancy.</b> These three shopfront areas are currently unoccupied. The original ticket office and small foyer area are located to the eastern side of the entry.|$|E

5000|$|Shophouses in Hong Kong and {{southern}} China are {{commonly known as}} tong-lau (...) or kee-lau (...) [...] They were usually built in contiguous blocks and range from three to five storeys in height with verandahs or balconies facing the street. Shophouses were used for both commercial and residential purposes. This is an important symbolisation of the livelihood of local hongkongers in the old days. While people nowadays tend to step out far away from home to earn a living like travel to work everyday by MTR or even travel to mainland China everyday to work there, old Hong Kong people tend to make the best use of the place they live to earn a living, making them a very active member of their own residential community. The ground floor was usually devoted to family businesses like small stores and clothes selling while the upper floors were for residential purpose with <b>sub-tenancy</b> and renting of beds. In Hong Kong, this kind of building is being replaced by high-rise buildings and the number of shophouses has declined sharply in recent years.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMulti-tenancy {{architecture}} (MTA) {{is often}} used in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the central idea is that multiple tenant applications can be developed using components stored in the SaaS infrastructure. Recently, MTA has been extended to allow a tenant application {{to have its own}} sub-tenants, where the tenant application acts like a SaaS infrastructure. In other words, MTA is extended to STA (<b>Sub-Tenancy</b> Architecture). In STA, each tenant application needs not only to develop its own functionalities, but also to prepare an infrastructure to allow its sub-tenants to develop customized applications. This paper applies Crowdsourcing as the core to STA component in the development life cycle. In addition, to discovering adequate fit tenant developers or components to help build and compose new components, dynamic and static ranking models are proposed. Furthermore, rank computation architecture is presented to deal with the case when the number of tenants and components becomes huge. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate that the ranking models and the rank computation architecture work as design...|$|E
