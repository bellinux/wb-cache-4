40|$|Nowadays by {{increasing}} of demand what extend industrial production volumes, most serious companies more frequently choose excelsior, technologically fashionable, cost effective and safe equipment. In general {{a very important}} catch is machine tool lifetime, and more customers ask for better and outstanding quality products. They pay large attention on lifetime of the machinery, machine tools and also other complete parts, including rotors of <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> compressor. It costs less than frequent repair and tool change. Generally screw compressor is rotary positive displacement machine, which have very compact design and have just few moving parts. These type machines have very successful design for production of the compressed air for heavy duty applications. Screw compressor is very efficient {{over a wide range}} of speeds and pressure differences [2]. Already half of century engineers challenge problems, which relate to change of mechanical properties of rotors surface of <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> compressors. Another challenge is to increase lifetime of rotors without diminishing its efficiency in action. The rotors of <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> compressors are the most important details, which makes large influence on machine efficiency [1]. During exploitation time, <b>screw</b> <b>type</b> compressors operate at various dynamic loads, different moment of rotations, what increase wear out of them and change its mechanical properties. It reduces compressor running efficiency and their cost effective lifetime also. Using of various material verification types, analysis of surface topography, macro and microstructure and mechanical properties, gives to us ability to make analysis of structures and mechanical properties of rotors. Furthermore it gives to us recommendations for saving of efficient compressor rotor running for all lifetime. Mechanical properties (strength, hardness, plasticity, and roughness of surface) of materials substantially influences on lifetime of rotors.
