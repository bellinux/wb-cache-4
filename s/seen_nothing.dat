In 1920, he published the satire Literatur oder Man wird doch da sehn (Literature, or You Ain't <b>Seen</b> <b>Nothing</b> Yet) as a reply to Franz Werfel's Spiegelmensch (Mirror Man), an attack against Kraus.|$|E
25|$|James Mahon, an apothecary, gave {{evidence}} that he lived {{at the corner of}} Bow Street. Coming through the piazzas in Covent-Garden, he heard two pistols go off. Going back, he saw a gentleman lying on the ground, with a pistol in his left hand, beating himself violently and bleeding copiously. The prisoner was the gentleman. Mahon had taken the pistol away from him and given it to the constable, asking him to take the prisoner to his house for the wound to be dressed. He had <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> of the lady until two or three minutes later he saw her lying at the bar, with a mortal wound, and said he could not help her.|$|E

25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E

500|$|Marianne Foyster, {{later in}} her life, {{admitted}} {{she had seen}} no apparitions and that the alleged ghostly noises were caused by the wind, friends she invited {{to the house and}} in other cases by herself playing practical jokes on her husband. Many of the legends about the rectory had been invented. The children of the Rev. Harry Bull who lived in the house before Lionel Foyster claimed to have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> and were surprised they had been living in what was described as England's most haunted house.|$|E

500|$|The chords in {{the song}} were {{inspired}} by the seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies. The chord sequences cite from Bachman-Turner Overdrive's song [...] "You Ain't <b>Seen</b> <b>Nothing</b> Yet", while the synth phases display Madonna's typical musical style. The song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Madonna's vocal range spanning from F3 to B4. The song follows in the chord progression of D–C–G in the first verse to Bm–Em–A–F in the pre-chorus, and changes to A–F–Bm–A–E and G–D–A in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{noted the}} song as a track on My World 2.0 {{and said it}} [...] "lets Justin Bieber sway and croon. It is {{guaranteed}} to generate warm and fuzzy emotions in millions of young fans" [...] and that it [...] "should not disappoint adults either". Monica Herrera of Billboard commended the song and said that it [...] "should appeal to some older listeners." [...] For Billboard 's cover story on Bieber, Herrera said, [...] "Bieber croons, his voice straining as much from puberty as emotion. It's the closest he's come to fulfilling Braun's wish, by sounding like a certain young Motown star. [...] "This is as unconditional as it'll ever get/You ain't <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> yet".|$|E
500|$|In early 1975, Thin Lizzy {{toured the}} United States {{for the first}} time, in support of Bob Seger and Bachman–Turner Overdrive. When BTO toured Europe {{later in the year}} to support their hit single [...] "You Ain't <b>Seen</b> <b>Nothing</b> Yet", Thin Lizzy again {{accompanied}} them on what was a very high-profile tour. They then recorded the Fighting album, which became the first Thin Lizzy album to chart in the UK, reaching no. 60, although the singles still did not chart. Opening with Seger's [...] "Rosalie", the album showed the first real evidence of the twin guitar sound that would lead the band towards their greatest successes, particularly with the dual harmonies of [...] "Wild One" [...] and both guitarists' soloing on [...] "Suicide".|$|E

Although she [...] "gave {{the most important part of}} her evidence with clarity and conviction", and had impressed the public and press, according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, she provided a different series of events to those outlined by other witnesses, although she stated that she thought she had seen Gordon-Cumming illicitly add to his stake.|$|E
500|$|When Goebel's son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford's Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford {{returned}} to Grand Rapids {{to campaign for}} Goebel's son. Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids {{the week before the}} election in which he said: [...] "Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High—an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are {{the kind of people who}} are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. And I have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever <b>seen!</b> <b>Nothing</b> has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the French Directory sank in {{popularity}} after military defeats and mismanagement. Back in Paris, Sérurier {{became part of}} the Bonaparte faction, having <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> but disaster since serving under the military genius. Bonaparte launched the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799 during which Sérurier led a reserve detachment of soldiers at the Pont-du-Jour. The next day, the coup almost collapsed when Bonaparte had to be rescued from the Council of Five Hundred. However, Lucien Bonaparte convinced the Council's own guard battalion that only a minority of members opposed his brother. These soldiers soon evicted the lawmakers from their own hall. During these events, Sérurier's troops arrived at Saint-Cloud and the general was heard addressing them, [...] "The wretches! They wished to kill General Bonaparte. Do not stir soldiers; wait until you get orders". In the aftermath of the coup, Sérurier was put on a commission to determine how to use auxiliary battalions on 15 November 1799. He {{became a member of the}} Sénat conservateur (Senate) on 27 December.|$|E
500|$|The love {{triangle}} involving Lori, Rick, and Shane {{was cited}} as an episode highlight. Meslow {{felt that the}} interactions between Lori and Rick possessed [...] "as much rawness and honesty as could be hoped for." [...] Kine criticized the emotion during the interactions between Shane and Rick, and summated {{that it was a}} [...] "standard Walking Dead attempt at trying to convince us that Grimes and Shane are friends by way of showing us their casual, good-old-boy-tinged banter." [...] Ritkoff expressed that the episode's conclusion was a rational and level-headed resolution to the storyline; [...] "Whatever jealousy he might feel, it would have been absurd for Rick to punish the woman he loves most in the world for post-apocalyptic infidelity under these circumstances." [...] Sepinwall commended Rick's reaction to Lori's confessions, and Goldman felt that their interaction was well acted and perfectly scripted. Venable appraised the segment as [...] "very engaging", and applauded Lincoln's performance. He wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln delivered these lines of pitiable understanding as well as anyone could." [...] CNN's Henry Hanks opined: [...] "If you thought Rick and Shane had blow-ups before, you ain't <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> yet." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Borderline" [...] is {{a sentimental}} track, {{talking about a}} love that is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández and his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the lyrics of the song like [...] "Something {{in the way you}} love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your {{prisoner}} so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentation. It opens with a keyboard rich intro and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture. The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies. The chord sequences cite from Bachman–Turner Overdrive's song [...] "You Ain't <b>Seen</b> <b>Nothing</b> Yet" [...] while the synth phases display her typical musical style. The third track [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, single guitar and Linn drum machine. The drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 March 1981 Powell gave {{a speech}} to Ashton-under-Lyne Young Conservatives where he {{attacked}} the [...] "conspiracy of silence" [...] {{between the government and}} the opposition over the prospective growth through births of the immigration population and added, [...] "'We have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> yet' is a phrase that we could with advantage repeat to ourselves whenever we try to form a picture of that future". He also criticised those who believed it was [...] "too late to do anything" [...] and that [...] "there lies the certainty of violence on a scale which can only adequately be described as civil war". He also said that the solution was [...] "a reduction in prospective numbers as would represent re-emigration hardly less massive than the immigration which occurred in the first place". The Shadow Home Secretary, Labour MP Roy Hattersley, criticised Powell for using [...] "Munich beer-hall language". On 11 April, there was a riot in Brixton and when on 13 April an interviewer quoted to Thatcher Powell's remark that [...] "We have <b>seen</b> <b>nothing</b> yet," [...] she replied: [...] "I heard him say that and I thought it was a very very alarming remark.
