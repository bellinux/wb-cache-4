40|$|The {{fabrication}} and {{characterization of}} surface-attached PEG-diacrylate hydrogel structures and their application as <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms</b> {{for the detection}} of specific target sequences are reported. Hydrogel structures were formed by a photopolymerization process, using substrate-bound Eosin Y molecules for the production of free radicals. We have demonstrated that this fabrication process allows for control over hydrogel growth down to the micrometer scale. Confocal imaging revealed relatively large pore structures for 25 % (v/v) PEG-diacrylate hydrogels, which appear to lie in tightly packed layers. Our data suggest that these pore structures decrease in size for hydrogels with increasing levels of PEG-diacrylate. Surface coverage values calculated for hydrogels immobilized with 21 -mer DNA probe sequences were significantly higher compared to those previously reported for 2 - and 3 -dimensional <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms,</b> on the order of 10 (16) molecules cm(- 2). Used as <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms</b> in DNA hybridization assays, a detection limit of 3. 9 nM was achieved for hybridization reactions between 21 -mer probe and target sequences.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of relative localization within a robot network possessing relative measurements between robots. The problem of correspondence is inherent to most multi-robot relative sensing methods, such as LiDAR, RADAR and vision based solutions. Multi-sensor multi-target tracking approaches addresses {{the problem of}} correspondence, when good prioris for initial poses of the <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms</b> are assumed. However the multi-robot relative localization problem differs from the classical multi-target tracking scenario due to; a) the unavailability of initial poses of <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms,</b> b) the existence of mutual measurements between the <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms,</b> and c) the measurement set being mixed with both known and unknown correspondences. To address these specific characteristics of multi-robot systems, this study proposes a distributed data correspondence architecture which performs multi-hypothesis estimation of the robot states. The proposed architecture is implemented on a multi-robot relative sensor configuration which possess range measurements with known data correspondence and bearing measurements with unknown data correspondence. The proposed distributed multi-robot localization method is capable of addressing measurement correspondence, noise, and measurement clutter effectively, while possessing inherent initialization and recovery capability from unknown poses.

To this end, two types of NAA photonic structures featuring different pore geometries (i. e., pore lengths and diameters) and shapes (i. e., straight and modulated pores) were produced, and their optical characteristics were assessed systematically by reflectometric interference spectroscopy. The geometric features (i. e., pore lengths, diameters, and shapes) were systematically modified {{in order to establish}} the optimization paths for the sensitivity, low limit of detection, and linearity of these optical <b>sensing</b> <b>platforms.</b> The obtained results reveal that an optimal design of these nanoporous photonic structures can enhance their sensitivity, achieve a lower limit of detection, and improve their linearity for both nonspecific and specific detection of analytes.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityWith the {{ever-increasing}} {{abundance of}} sensing and computing devices embedded into our environments {{we have the}} opportunity to create personalized activity recognition ecosystems. Two key challenges must first be overcome, the new environment problem and the new <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> problem. The new environment problem is encountered every time a <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> is deployed to a new environment. The new <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> problem is encountered every time a new <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> is deployed into an environment with an existing <b>sensing</b> <b>platform.</b> We approach these problems as transfer learning problems with heterogeneous feature-spaces, referred to as heterogeneous transfer learning. We propose several novel algorithms for each setting. Additionally, some theoretical work on the accuracy bounds and the run-time of the algorithms is also presented. Feature-Space Remapping (FSR) is proposed as a novel class of heterogeneous transfer learning algorithms which {{can be applied to the}} new environment problem. These algorithms are the first to perform heterogeneous transfer learning without requiring explicit linkage data. We show how these algorithms are able to outperform learning a model generalized across different environments using relations between features as specified by a domain expert. We also show how FSR can be used in conjunction with ensemble learning to combine information from multiple datasets. This method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 10 % to 20 %. Multi-view Transfer Learning is proposed as a solution to the new <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> problem. In multi-view transfer learning the same instance can be seen from multiple views or feature-spaces which facilitates transferring knowledge from one view to another. We develop several new multi-view learning algorithms for this problem. Using a well-trained view as a teacher, we show that the performance of new sensing platforms can be increased by as much as 20 % through multi-view learning. The teacher can also be used to bootstrap a set of labeled training data for the new <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> which removes the need to manually annotate data when introducing new sensing platforms. We also provide bounds and an estimation of the learner's accuracy when the ground truth labeled data cannot be used to directly estimate the accuracy.

We propose a design of a <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> for tracking objects using a UHF RFID system with passive tags that provides continuous signal reception over the coverage area.

30|$|The Lu group {{developed}} an effective fluorescent <b>sensing</b> <b>platform</b> for phosphate detection based on MOF and ZnO quantum dot (QD) conjugates [55]. The MOF material (MOF- 5) {{was used as}} the substrate, and positively charged ZnO QDs capped by (3 -aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS–ZnO QDs) were attached to the negatively charged MOFs via amine–Zn interaction and electrostatic interaction. This interaction resulted in the ZnO QD fluorescence quenching owing to the electron transfer process. After introducing phosphate into the QD–MOF system, the presence of phosphate could inhibit the quenching effect and recover the fluorescence of ZnO QDs. The fluorescence intensity depended on the phosphate concentration and was not affected by other interfering species.
