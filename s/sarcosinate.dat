Outer membrane protein P 6, with a molecular mass of 16 kDa (determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]-PAGE) was purified by both native PAGE and SDS-PAGE from three strains of nontypeable H. influenzae and one strain of type b H. influenzae. The same conditions were required for purification from each strain. The suitability of proteins isolated by these methods was assessed by studying the immune response of rats immunized with P 6 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant into the Peyer's patches. P 6 purified by either native PAGE or SDS-PAGE {{did not differ significantly}} from P 6 purified by gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography in the ability to enhance pulmonary clearance of live bacteria. This study also investigated the effects of SDS on P 2 immunological responses in vivo and the effects of the reagents Zwittergent and sodium lauryl <b>sarcosinate</b> on outer membrane protein lymphocyte-proliferative responses in vitro. It was found that the presence of SDS in the immunization emulsion enhanced the antigen-specific cell- mediated response but suppressed the antigen-specific antibody responses. The presence of residual traces of Zwittergent in an outer membrane protein preparation inhibited antigen-specific cell-mediated proliferation, whereas extraction of outer membrane proteins with sodium lauryl <b>sarcosinate</b> did not inhibit antigen-specific proliferation.

All surfactants ruptured the phospholipid vesicle at around each critical micelle concentration by mixed micelle formation with phospholipid.

Four protein species with apparent molecular weights of 26, 000 (26 K), 36. 5 K, 41 K, and 48. 5 K were readily observed as components of the vesicles.

40|$|Finding {{alternative}} {{reaction media}} to replace polluting organic solvents is one aim of green chemistry. The ultimate green solvent, water, is the cheapest, non-toxic and most readily available reaction medium: three properties which {{make it an}} environmentally and economically attractive solvent. However, a fundamental problem in performing reactions in water is that many organic substrates are hydrophobic and not soluble in water. Several approaches are possible in solubilizing these compounds in aqueous media, {{one of which is}} carrying out reactions in aqueous solutions of surfactants at concentrations above their critical micellar concentration (cmc). Reactions of iodine with cyclohexene, 1 -octene and styrene in water or in the presence of cationic surfactants do not give useful amounts of iodohydrins, but reactions in anionic surfactants give good yields. Iodohydrins are important functionalizable compounds and are readily prepared in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or sodium N-dodecanoyl <b>sarcosinate</b> (SANa). The critical conditions for these reactions were optimized with a rigorous statistical approach, the experimental design method.

40|$|In part project 1 it transpired that oleyl <b>sarcosinate</b> {{stands out}} among the fatty amide {{carboxylic}} acids as a surfactant with excellent surface-active properties. A technical process was developed which involves transesterification of biodiesel by means of sodium <b>sarcosinate.</b> However, according to a rough cost estimate it is only at very large plant capacities that the process begins to become economically more efficient than the current state-of-the-art process, the Schotten-Baumann reaction with oleyl chloride. Moreover, the commercialisation of the developed manufacturing process may be frustrated by a patent that was filed by the Procter and Gamble company while the present project was still running. For these reasons the present studies on fatty amide carbonic acids were discontinued. Fatty amides with centrally located hydrophilic groups {{can be obtained by}} a reaction between epoxidised biodiesel or other epoxidised oils with any of various amines or amino acids. The product is a new type of surfactant including ones with excellent surface-active properties. Unfortunately the best-performing products are only ''moderately'' degradable and have a relatively high ecotoxicity. Biodiesel (rape oil methyl ester) can be epoxidised in a two-phase system with hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. Triglycerides can be epoxidised analogously. After separation of the aqueous phase the epoxidised biodiesel is ready for surfactant synthesis without the need for further purification. In part project 2 a method was successfully elaborated for synthesising oleic acid alkanolamine directly from the triglyceride and alkanolamine without using solvents. Various ethoxilated rape oil ethanolamides have very good colloidochemical and application-relevant properties, comparable with those of the best nonionic standard surfactants based on ethoxilated oxo alcohols.

Aminosaeuren herstellen. Es handelt sich um neuartige Tenside mit zum Teil herausragenden grenzflaechenaktiven Eigenschaften. Allerdings sind die besten Produkte nur 'maessig' biologisch abbaubar oder weisen eine relativ hohe Oekotoxizitaet auf. Die Epoxidierung des Biodiesels (Rapsoelmethylester) gelingt mit Wasserstoffperoxid und Ameisensaeure im Zweiphasensystem. Analog lassen sich auch die Triglyceride epoxidieren. Nach Abtrennung der waessrigen Phasen kann der epoxidierte Biodiesel ohne weitere Aufreinigung fuer die Tensidsynthese verwendet werden. Im Teilprojekt II gelang die Ausarbeitung eines Verfahrens zur Herstellung von Oelsaeurealkanolamiden direkt und loesungsmittelfrei aus dem Triglycerid und dem Alkanolamin.

40|$|Outer {{membrane}} protein profiles of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and outer membrane-enriched fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation and selective solubilization {{of the inner}} membrane with sodium N-lauroyl <b>sarcosinate.</b> Colony type, growth medium, time of harvest, and in vitro or in vivo passage had no appreciable effect on the protein profiles of the strains examined. Seven patterns were distinguished among the reference strains of the nine capsular serotypes. These patterns {{were based on the}} mobility of the major outer {{membrane protein}}s migrating in the 39, 000 - to 44, 000 -molecular-weight region of the gel, a 16 K to 16. 5 K protein, and a heat-modifiable 29 K protein. Strains of serotypes 1 and 9 had identical outer membrane protein profiles, as did strains of serotypes 2 and 6. The reference strains of the remaining five serotypes each had a distinct pattern. The outer membrane protein profiles of 95 field isolates belonging to serotypes 1, 5, 7, and 9 from swine in the midwestern United States were determined and compared with the reference patterns. The results indicate that the population of H. pleuropneumoniae is clonal, with three predominant clones distinguished by both serotype and outer membrane protein profile responsible for the majority of H. pleuropneumoniae disease occurring in swine in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Amino acid salts {{have greater}} {{potential}} for CO₂ capture at high temperatures than typical amine-based absorbents {{because of their}} low volatility, high absorption rate, and high oxidative stability. The protonation constant (pKₐ) of an amino acid salt is crucial for CO₂ capture, as it decreases with increasing absorption temperature. However, published pKₐ values of amino acid salts have usually been determined at ambient temperatures. In this study, the pKₐ values of 11 amino acid salts were determined in the temperature range of 298 - 353 K using a potentiometric titration method. The standard-state molar enthalpies (ΔH⁰ m) and entropies (ΔS⁰ m) of the protonation reactions were also determined by the van't Hoff equation. It was found that sarcosine can maintain a higher pKₐ than the other amino acids studied at high temperatures. We {{also found that the}} CO₂ solubilities and overall mass-transfer coefficients of 5 m' <b>sarcosinate</b> (moles of sarcosine per kilogram of solution) at 333 - 353 K are higher than those of 30 % MEA at 313 - 353 K. These results show that some possible benefits can be produced from the use of sarcosine as a fast solvent for CO₂ absorption at high temperatures. However, the pronotation reaction of sarcosine is the least exothermic among those of all amino acids studied. This could lead to a high regeneration energy consumption in the sarcosinate-based CO 2 capture process...|$|E
