40|$|AbstractExisting model-plant {{mismatch}} {{detection and}} isolation methods mainly employ correlation analysis approaches {{to detect the}} sub-model that have statistically significant mismatch from the plant. However, statistical significance does not ensure that any control performance deterioration {{is due to the}} detected mismatch. A small but statistically significant mismatch may not have any impact on the performance of the controller. This paper presents the effect of model plant mismatch (MPM) on the performance of model predictive controller (MPC) and a systematic approach to determine the thresholds of mismatches above which the performance deterioration can be considered significant. A simulation case study of the Wood and Berry distillation model with MPC is used as a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. For the <b>stated</b> <b>case</b> study, a 70 % increase in the overall integral error (OIE) for set-point tracking problem is found to be an acceptable limit for the MPC performance deterioration. The thresholds of gain, time delay and time constant MPM for 70 % increase in OIE for Wood and Berry simulation case study are found to be {(- 20 % + 40 %) (- 13 % + 7 %); (- 40 % + 31 %) (- 7 % + 27 %) }, {(- 40 % + 40 %) (- 40 % + 22 %); (- 20 % + 17 %) (- 29 % + 27 %) } and {(- 40 % + 15 %) (- 20 % + 40 %); (- 23 % + 40 %) (- 28 % + 36 %) }, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This {{practicum}} report {{discusses the}} adaptability of problem oriented case planning to casework which is {{practiced in the}} Northeast Multnomah County District Office of the Children’s Services Division. Problem oriented case planning is an approach designed to make casework more explicit by specifying the target problem(s), goals(s), tasks and an evaluation scheme which are agreed to and stated in a written contract developed by the participants. Such explicitness is essential to permit agency collection of useful information about its casework and casework programs needed to respond to today’s accountability demands, i. e., demonstration that the agency operates at a reasonable level of problem solving effectiveness and efficiency based {{on the level of}} effectiveness. Two instruments were developed to be used in this exploratory study: 1.) the “Service Contract” which embodies the <b>stated</b> <b>case</b> plan and a means to develop it, and 2.) the Caseworker Questionnaire which solicits caseworker reactions to the Service Contract’s use. Caseworkers are asked to voluntarily use the Service Contract during a nine week trial-use period and report their reactions to its use. Data obtained in the study is incomplete because of very limited Service Contract use. The focus of discussion is on caseworker reasons for non-use. This discussion remains somewhat speculative because there is little agreement among caseworkers relative to reasons for non-use. Flaws in the research design e. g., insufficient formal training in Service Contract use and compensation for its use may have significantly impeded additional utilization. Because the data does not support any serious problem with Service Contract use in most caseloads, by most caseworkers, with most clients a more systematic study of the Service Contract using an experimental design is recommended...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the recontextualising of the NISTCOL environmental education curriculum module for the Primary Teachers’ Diploma by Distance Learning (PTDDL) in Zambia. It focused on three case sites, the NISTCOL EE curriculum module for PTDDL and the University of Zambia, the National In-Service Teacher’s College (NISTCOL) and four basic schools: chalimbana, Bimbe, Chongwe and Silver Rest. The study looked at teacher professional development in environmental education in Zambia. The aims and goals were to investigate the NISTCOL EE curriculum and identifying issues that were associated with lecturers in the recontextualising process and further examine what issues were associated with curriculum recontextualisation in Zambian schools. For the conceptual constructs, the research drew on Bernstein’s (1990) framework of pedagogic discourse, it traced how the pedagogic discourse was de-located {{from the field of}} production and re-located into the pedagogic practice of each <b>stated</b> <b>case</b> above. It further examined the continuities, discontinuities and changes in the official environmental discourse as it was recontextualised. The study particularly focused on Bernstein’s conceptual constructs of selective appropriation and ideological transformation. In each case the Bernstein framework is used to analyze the process to identify recontextualising issues influencing pedagogical practice in the Zambian schools and college. The study revealed that each case under focus was unique but through examining the environmental discourse and pedagogical discourse in each case recontextalising issues were identified. Each case was influenced by different factors, such as lack of policy synergy, lack of EE vision at national level in Zambia, experience and knowledge, ideologies and emphasis, and depth of engagement. These factors provided me with a deeper insight into the curriculum recontextualising processes in Zambian schools...|$|E
40|$|The High Court, in the 1995 {{landmark}} case of Bryan v Maloney, held {{a builder}} of a residential house liable to a subsequent owner for economic loss suffered {{by way of}} the reduction in value of the house caused by its defective foundations. Since that decision, several cases in state courts have indicated that any extension of the principle in Bryan to commercial properties is a matter for the High Court. This year, Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd provided the vehicle for the High Court to revisit the Bryan principle in a commercial context. Faced with the question 2 ̆ 7 can a subsequent owner of a commercial property who discovers faulty foundations sue the builder for the costs of fixing the problem before it causes any physical damage to person or property? 2 ̆ 7, the resounding response from the High Court has been 2 ̆ 7 no 2 ̆ 7. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ in a joint judgment and McHugh J and Callinan J in separate judgements rejected any 2 ̆ 7 extension 2 ̆ 7 of the Bryan principle to commercial premises. Much to the relief of the construction industry, the Court made it clear that it will be difficult for a subsequent owner to make out a case in negligence against the original builder unless it can show special vulnerability to the risk of injury. Kirby J, in a dissenting judgment, suggested that the extension of liability to commercial builders fits quite comfortably with general principles and lamented the 2 ̆ 7 incremental 2 ̆ 7 approach to liability presently favoured by the Court. Consequent upon the retirement of Gaudron J, Kirby J appears to be a lonely light on the hill, shining a solitary beacon on matters of principle. The revisitation of Bryan has long been anticipated. However, Woolcock does not provide the solid bricks and mortar craved by the construction industry. Close examination of the reasoning of the Court suggests that it may itself rest on faulty foundations. In his dissenting judgment, Kirby J questions some of the assumptions made by the majority and highlights the deficiencies of the 2 ̆ 7 <b>stated</b> <b>case</b> 2 ̆ 7 procedure for a re-examination of this particular area of law, thus suggesting that Woolcock may not be completely sound. <br /...|$|E
