2500|$|Shortis {{observes that}} ROFL {{is a means}} of [...] "annotating text with stage directions". Hershock, in {{discussing}} these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: [...] "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor." ...|$|E

You can now take advantage of this additional information. Your choice of door A has a chance of 1 in 3 of being the winner. I have not changed that. But by eliminating door C, I have shown you that the probability that door B hides the prize is 2 in 3.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Nehemiah {{cited the}} use of the words [...] "will bring you out" [...] in [...] to {{demonstrate}} that using the word hamotzi in the blessing over bread would mean that God [...] "will bring forth" [...] bread from the land – not that God [...] "has brought forth" [...] bread from the land. Rabbi Nehemiah thus read [...] to mean: [...] "I am the Lord, the One Who will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." [...] The Gemara reported that the Rabbis of a Baraita, however, read [...] to mean: [...] "When I shall bring you out, I will do for you something that will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I am the One Who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." ...|$|E
2500|$|After having reluctantly {{given up}} the chase, the Essex and the St Louis {{returned}} to Cairo to replenish and begin ammunition runs, and were relieved by two other vessels which took up guarding Fort Holt. In the days following, Porter used a buoy to float towards the Confederate positions a challenge: [...] "Hollins: Why don't you accursed, cowardly rebels bring out your gunboats and fight us. Porter." [...] Confederate Captain Miller sent his reply in the same medium: [...] "Sir: The ironclad steamer Grampus will meet the Essex at any point and time your Honor may appoint and <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the power is in our hands. An early reply will be agreeable." [...] The ships would meet in the coming weeks, however the Confederate vessels proved speedier than the Union ironclads. Porter's later account of the engagement was syndicated in the New York Times, where it was well received for their [...] "lucid and graphic manner".|$|E
2500|$|Deputy District Attorney Stirling Norris, {{acting as}} prosecutor, sought {{the death penalty}} for each count of murder for which Bonin was tried, stating in his opening speech to the jury: [...] "We will prove he is the Freeway Killer, as he has bragged to a number of witnesses. We will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he enjoyed the killings. Not only did he enjoy it, and plan to enjoy it, he had an insatiable demand, an insatiable {{appetite}} - not only for sodomy, but for killing." [...] Norris further elaborated that Bonin had followed a depressingly familiar routine in his murders of luring or forcing his victim into the van, before overpowering and binding his victim. He would then repeatedly rape his captive between and throughout instances of torture, before finally reaching the [...] "climax of the orgy" [...] by killing his victim. Norris further asserted that Bonin considered murder a group sport, and would typically groom people of a low mentality to participate in many of his murders.|$|E

2500|$|While on {{tour with}} the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins {{went on a}} four-day {{drinking}} binge. With the urging of Cash, he opened a show in San Diego, California, by playing four songs after seeing [...] "four or five of me in the mirror" [...] and while {{being able to see}} [...] "nothin' but a blur". After drinking yet another pint of whiskey, he passed out on the tour bus. By morning he started hallucinating [...] "big spiders, and dinosaurs, huge, and they were gonna step on me". The bus was parked on a beach at the ocean. He was tempted by yet another pint of whiskey that he had hidden. He took the bottle with him onto the beach and fell on his knees and said, [...] "Lord,... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna <b>show</b> <b>You</b> <b>that</b> I believe in you. I sailed it into the Pacific... I got up, I knew I had done the right thing." [...] Perkins and Cash, who had his own problems with drugs, then gave each other support to stay sober.|$|E
