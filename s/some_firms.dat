Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. <b>Some</b> <b>firms</b> lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} found ways of bypassing the boycott and managed to trade with both Israel and the Arab world. For example, <b>some</b> <b>firms</b> that did business with Arab countries officially complied with the boycott, but in practice subcontracted their trade with Israel to companies already blacklisted by the Arab states, while others did business with Israel through divisions or affiliates whose links to the company were disguised. Others strove to cultivate good personal relationships with Arab leaders, who {{would allow them to}} trade with Israel without economic repercussions in their own countries as a favor. <b>Some</b> <b>firms</b> placed on the blacklist managed to lobby or buy their way off it.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, the {{industry}} came under financial stress {{due to that}} year's economic crisis. Motorists drove less and gasoline prices dropped sharply, while bank financing shrank. As a result, some plants operated below capacity, several firms closed plants, others laid off staff, <b>some</b> <b>firms</b> went bankrupt, plant projects were suspended and market prices declined. The Energy Information Administration raised concerns that the industry would not meet the legislated targets.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{finished}} transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply {{do not have the}} requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation-specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English are not familiar with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, certainly, is then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work for a fraction of what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting lower and lower rates. However, <b>some</b> <b>firms</b> choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.|$|E
25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars in}} taxes with these arrangements. <b>Some</b> <b>firms</b> paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you want to change the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E
25|$|The narcissistic manager {{will have}} two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate – status symbols like company cars, company-issued {{smartphone}} or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates. Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries. The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for the manager themself. Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism. He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as Al Dunlap and Robert Allen) who, he suggests, literally have only one thing on their minds: profits. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and <b>some</b> <b>firms</b> now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia.|$|E

25|$|Despite slowing of the economy, as of June 2015 the Chinese stock index, the CSI 300 Index, {{which is}} based on 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, had risen nearly 150% over the past 12 months. In an effort to {{forestall}} damage from collapse of a possible economic bubble fueled by margin trading the central government raised requirements for margin lending. Economic damage from a crash in 2007-2008 was limited due to margin lending being highly restricted. In early July, after a fall in the markets of nearly 30% from their 12 June highs, there were efforts by blue-chip, often state-owned, firms, the Chinese securities industry, and the central government to stabilize the market by buying back stock and increasing purchases of the stock of established firms; however, much of the volatility has been in smaller, less-established firms that had been heavily invested in by unsophisticated, often working class, investors who had purchased stock based solely on its rapid increase in valuation. 80% of Chinese stocks are owned by individual investors, many novices. As of 10 July 2015 efforts by the China Securities Finance Corporation, CFS, a firm created by China's commodities and stock exchanges to finance trades, had apparently stabilized the market. Major Chinese securities firms were required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to buy, and hold, a substantial amount of securities affected by the downturn. Using funds supplied by the central bank and commercial banks the China Securities Finance Corporation purchased enough stocks to halt the slide acquiring as much as 5% of the stock in <b>some</b> <b>firms.</b> Lines of credit were extended by CFS to 21 securities firms, some of which also purchased up to 5% of some companies stocks. Some of the small cap stocks acquired may be overvalued.|$|E
500|$|Annie Lowrey, {{writing in}} Slate, compares Cowen's {{treatment}} of the internet to the [...] "productivity paradox" [...] first postulated by economists in the 1980s. She quoted Robert Solow, a growth theorist, who wrote in 1987 [...] "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." [...] To explain why growth had not picked up strongly after the boom in computing products from the 1970s onwards, they suggested that the changes advantaged <b>some</b> <b>firms</b> and disadvantaged others leaving little net gain. The problem also may be partly because of deficiencies in the measurement of income and well-being. The internet promotes more free culture, the consumption of which provides utility and happiness to people but cannot be captured through GDP figures that measure revenue.|$|E
