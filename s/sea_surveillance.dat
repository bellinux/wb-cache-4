40|$|The {{application}} of {{aircraft and spacecraft}} remote sensing techniques to <b>sea</b> ice <b>surveillance</b> is evaluated. The effects of ice in the air-sea-ice system are examined. The measurement principles and characteristics of remote sensing methods for aircraft and spacecraft <b>surveillance</b> of <b>sea</b> ice are described. Consideration is given to ambient visible light, IR, passive microwave, active microwave, and laser altimeter and sonar systems. The applications of these systems to <b>sea</b> ice <b>surveillance</b> are discussed and examples are provided. Particular attention {{is placed on the}} use of microwave data and the relation between ice thickness and sea ice interactions. It is noted that spacecraft and aircraft sensing techniques can successfully measure snow cover; ice thickness; ice type; ice concentration; ice velocity field; ocean temperature; surface wind vector field; and air, snow, and ice surface temperatures...|$|R
2500|$|... 1983 saw {{the wing}} {{become the first}} to be {{equipped}} with Boeing AGM-84 Harpoon missiles for anti-shipping operations. [...] The 69th Bombardment Squadron in particular was assigned the minelaying, <b>sea</b> <b>surveillance</b> and anti-shipping mission. [...] On 31 January 1984, the Air Force combined the 42d Bombardment Wing with the old 42d Bombardment Group. The newly consolidated organization retained the 42d Bombardment Wing designation.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy conducts several naval {{warfare and}} patrol {{exercises}} per year despite its budget {{problems such as}} Exercise Red Lion. It regularly [...] participates in exercises with other national navies such as the United States Navy (Exercise Shared Accord/Southern Accord), NATO naval battlegroups (Exercise Amazolo), German Navy (the biennial Exercise Good Hope), Royal Navy (several ad hoc exercises when ships visit South African waters), Indian Navy (the biennial Exercise Ibsamar), National Navy of Uruguay and the Brazilian Navy (Exercises Atlasur and Ibsamar). At least one or two Valour-class frigates and one Heroine-class submarine takes part in these multinational exercises, usually along with aircraft support from the South African Air Force. The Navy has also provided security for the 2010 FIFA World Cup by deploying three frigates to the coastal waters off the cities of Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. The frigates' sophisticated air and <b>sea</b> <b>surveillance</b> radars allowed them to provide security for the events taking place along the coast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974 the Combat Talon {{program was}} nearly {{dismantled}} as the Air Force sought to reverse its Vietnam emphasis on special operations. The 1st Special Operations Wing was redesignated the 834th Tactical Composite Wing and its Combat Talons of the 8th SOS became a TAC asset. However {{the use of}} 1st SOS [...] "Yank" [...] Talons in a <b>sea</b> <b>surveillance</b> role off North Korea in 1975 revived interest in the Combat Talon, as did the Israeli hostage rescue at Entebbe Airport. [...] The same year, a Combat Talon of the 1st Special Operations Wing was deployed in support of US Marines forces on Koh Tang island during the Mayaguez incident, dropping a single BLU-82 15,000lb bomb to enable their extraction. [...] However, as late as 1978-1979, Air Force Special Operations Forces was still disregarded by many staff planners, who {{saw it as a}} drain on resources and not a force enabler, and wanted the entire Talon force transferred to the Air National Guard. In early 1977 the Combat Talon was redesignated MC-130E by Headquarters Air Force for all three variants of the aircraft.|$|E

The Navy uses patrol ships for coastal surveillance.|$|R
5000|$|The Samuel Beckett-class {{ships are}} {{designed}} to carry remotely operated submersibles and a decompression chamber for divers. This is intended to add enhanced capabilities to undertake search and rescue, search and recovery, under-sea exploration and increased <b>sea</b> area <b>surveillance.</b> The expanded deck area would also allow the Naval Service to potentially deploy unmanned aerial vehicles for the first time. Features also include Dynamic Positioning systems and [...] "Power Take In Systems" [...] to enable fuel savings, as the main engines can be shut-down and power sourced from battery storage or a smaller more economical engine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s {{the need for}} a {{military}} presence in the north was recognised, with an integrated land, <b>sea</b> and air <b>surveillance</b> network developed in response. Part of this involved the raising of reserve infantry units that would act as [...] "eyes and ears" [...] in the north.|$|R

50|$|The radar {{provides}} 300 degree {{coverage and}} has an instrumental range of 450 km and detection range of 350 km in a dense hostile electronic warfare environment—in heavy radar clutter and at low target altitudes. In addition to this, the radar is also capable of identifying friends or foes, and has a <b>sea</b> <b>surveillance</b> mode.|$|E
50|$|VMS {{obviously}} {{is part of}} fisheries enforcement, but, along with other systems, it {{can be part of}} overall <b>sea</b> <b>surveillance.</b> When a radar or other sensor detects a given vessel, VMS can tell the center that monitors the radar whether the radar target is a known fishing vessel.There may be correlation between AIS/VTS and VMS.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the firing}} range is used mostly for MIM-104 Patriot and MIM-23 Hawk launches, {{although}} {{a wide range}} of surface to air and air to surface missiles are fired occasionally. As the trajectories of the missiles cross busy air and sea areas, an Air and <b>Sea</b> <b>surveillance</b> radar system is used to resolve possible conflicts.|$|E
50|$|On 8 June 2015 at 9:23PM, a Dornier 228 with 3 crew on board, {{operated}} by the Indian Coast Guard went missing over <b>sea</b> during a <b>surveillance</b> mission.

40|$|Contemporary {{satellite}} {{technologies in}} the fields of Earth Observation (EO), communications and navigation, augmented with terrestrial sensor networks, provide an invaluable toolbox for the development and deployment of integrated platforms for wide-area surveillance. The applicable use cases span across a wide range of application domains, from maritime and <b>sea</b> border <b>surveillance</b> to agricultural and environmental monitoring. This paper presents the design and development of a multi-mission service platform based on a generic core, able to aggregate data collected from multiple sensors and route monitoring information among processing modules and decision support systems. As the central point of a modular architecture, this service platform can be easily and quickly customized to serve multiple heterogeneous application domains. Its application for maritime surveillance is presented as an indicative use case...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} key {{developments in}} the field of European border surveillance in the Mediterranean. By asking, ‘Whose Mare?’, we focus on rule of law challenges stemming from these developments in a post-Lisbon EU. The developments examined are the Italian Navy-led Mare Nostrum operation, the debates over European ‘exit strategies’ for this operation and the ensuing launch of the Frontex Triton joint operation (JO). The recently adopted Regulation on Frontex <b>sea</b> border <b>surveillance</b> operations is also presented as a key development to understand the rule of law challenges. Moreover, the adoption of the European Union Maritime Security Strategy (MSS) and the development of several maritime surveillance systems in the EU highlight that a wide range of actors seeks authority over this field...|$|R
