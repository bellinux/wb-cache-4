500|$|The largest {{event of}} Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's {{confrontation}} with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War.

This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the Račak massacre. Then U.S. <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> <b>Albright</b> tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him [...] "there's an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good." [...] Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against Albanians and said that they'd been [...] "handled" [...] in the 1940s by ethnic cleansing.|$|E

500|$|National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his [...] "Small Group" [...] of {{national}} security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director George Tenet, <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> <b>Albright,</b> Attorney General Janet Reno, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{started the}} bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on March 24, 1999, on orders {{to try to}} enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 {{following}} Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action. Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House, such as President Clinton and <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Madeleine</b> <b>Albright,</b> who allowed him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, {{that he was not}} being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading him to describe himself as [...] "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States". This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.|$|E
