5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a {{descriptive}} {{case study of}} a social entrepreneurial firm is used to demonstrate stakeholder salience and stakeholder <b>social</b> <b>issue</b> management valence. The methodology {{is to use a}} semi structured interview with a social entrepreneur to identify and map the firm’s stakeholders’ salience and stakeholders’ <b>social</b> <b>issue</b> management valence. The resulting map uses spheres, sized proportionally to <b>social</b> <b>issue</b> management valence, to represent the various stakeholder groups. Each map shows the positioning of stakeholders according to their salience at critical points {{in the life of the}} social entrepreneurship. This paper contributes to stakeholder theory through its use of an innovative methodology to combine and view the stakeholders and their importance to the social entrepreneur on a single map. This map incorporates the elements of stakeholder salience with stakeholder <b>social</b> <b>issue</b> management valence. This mapping approach enables us to visualize how salience and valence positions change at critical times. Social entrepreneurs applying this mapping method can balance the allocation of their time and attention to stakeholders while simultaneously keeping with their social mission.|$|R
