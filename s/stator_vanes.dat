40|$|To meet market {{demands and}} yet fulfil {{legislation}} engines are now {{required to maintain}} current power levels but be more efficient at part load. Operating in this region means the turbine will be operating at low velocity ratios. This work aimed at targeting key automotive objectives which included; improving off-design performance, increasing MFR and reducing inertia, using non-conventional designs. A detailed numerical and experimental investigation of a scaled automotive VGT was carried out {{to better understand the}} flow characteristics in the blade passage. An initial study was performed at three different <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> MFR positions {{to assess the impact of}} <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> tip clearance location on radial turbine performance. Following this two rotor designs, one back swept, the other a splitter blade design, were simulated and tested at different <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> positions, to ascertain their suitability at meeting automotive requirements. It was found that operating with hub side <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> tip clearance improved efficiency by 4. 5 % points at the minimum MFR <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> position. The study showed that the <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> tip Jeak. e. ge produced a vortex which augmented the flow and improved incidence and flow development in the rotor passage. The back swept rotor design reduced the incidence angle allow values of VIC and improved efficiency by 1. 3 % and 2. 0 % points at the minimum and 25 % MFR <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> positions respectively. However, at the design point efficiency dropped by 4. 4 % points and MFR was reduced by 4. 7 %. A 5 + 5 splitter design improved efficiency by 1. 0 % point at the minimum MFR <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> position. At the design MFR also increased by 5 %. However, efficiency was seen to drop between 0. 5 % to 3 % points at the maximum MFR <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> position. An additional benefit of the splitter design was reduced inertia.

50|$|The use of CMCs in gas {{turbines}} would permit higher turbine inlet temperatures, which would improve turbine efficiency. Because {{of the complex}} shape of <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> and turbine blades, the development was first focused on the combustion chamber. In the US, a combustor made of SiC/SiC with a special SiC fiber of enhanced high-temperature stability was successfully tested for 15,000 hours. SiC oxidation was substantially reduced {{by the use of}} an oxidation protection coating consisting of several layers of oxides.The engine collaboration between General Electric and Rolls-Royce is studying the use of CMC <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> in the hot section of the F136 turbofan engine, an engine which failed to beat the Pratt and Whitney F-135 for use in the Joint Strike Fighter.The engine joint venture, CFM International is also considering the use of CMC parts to reduce weight in its Leap-X demonstrator engine program, which is aimed at providing next-generation turbine engines for narrow-body airliners. CMC parts are also being studied for stationary applications in both the cold and hot sections of the engines, since stresses imposed on rotating parts would require further development effort. Generally, a successful application in turbines still needs a lot of technical and cost reduction work for all high-temperature components to justify the efficiency gain. Furthermore, cost reduction for fibers, manufacturing processes and protective coatings is essential.|$|E

Using a five element torque converter, (pump, individual turbines for low, intermediate and direct ranges, and a switch pitch stator) the Turboglide offered the smoothest operation of any automatic in the industry, as no shift occurred between ranges and hence there was no potential to create a disruption in the perfectly smooth flow of power. For extra getaway power at any road speed, the converter <b>stator</b> <b>vanes</b> could be directed to a steeper angle which raised the stall speed of the torque converter and increased torque multiplication, as well as directing the oil flow at the turbine for the next lowest range.

40|$|The {{leading edge}} region {{of a first}} stage <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> {{experiences}} high heat transfer rates especially near the endwall making it very important {{to get a better}} understanding of the formation of the leading edge vortex. In order to improve numerical predictions of the complex endwall flow, benchmark quality experimental data are required. To this purpose, this study documents the endwall heat transfer and static pressure coefficient distribution of a modern <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> for two different exit Reynolds num-bers (Re ex = 6 x 105 and 1. 2 x 106). In addition, laser Doppler velocime-ter measurements of all three components of the mean and fluctuating velocities are presented for the stagnation plane in the leading edge re-gion. Results indicate that the endwall heat transfer, pressure distribu-tion and flowfield characteristics change with Reynolds number. The endwall pressure distributions show that lower pressure coefficients oc-cur at the higher Reynolds number due to secondary flows. The stronger secondary flows cause enhanced heat transfer near the trailing edge of the vane at the higher Reynolds number. On the other hand the mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and vorticity results indicate that lead-ing edge vortex is stronger and more turbulent at the lower Reynolds number. The Reynolds number also has an effect on the location of the separation point which moves closer to the <b>stator</b> <b>vane</b> at the lower Reynolds number...|$|R

It is shown that this time scale bound is inconsistent in farfield regions and it is argued that the bound should not be used in the equation for the relaxation parameter,.
