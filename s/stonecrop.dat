5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf <b>stonecrop,</b> Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves of}} most <b>stonecrops</b> are edible, {{excepting}} Sedum rubrotinctum, although toxicity {{has also been}} reported in some other species.|$|R
50|$|Rhodiola is a genus of {{perennial}} {{plants in the}} family Crassulaceae that resemble Sedum {{and other members of}} the family. Like sedums, Rhodiola species are often called <b>stonecrops.</b> Some authors merge Rhodiola into Sedum.|$|R
50|$|European ivy (Hedera helix) {{is found}} in the nature as creeper plant. On the hillsides, {{flowering}} plants such as <b>stonecrops</b> (Sedum hispanicum) and (Sedum spurium), oleander (Nerium oleander), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and nandina (Nandina domestica)).|$|R
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting <b>stonecrop,</b> sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{major threat}} for crested and marbled newts is habitat loss. This {{concerns}} especially breeding sites, which are lost through the upscaling and intensification of agriculture, drainage, urban sprawl, and artificial flooding regimes (affecting {{in particular the}} Danube crested newt). Especially in the southern ranges, exploitation of groundwater and decreasing spring rain, possibly caused by global warming, threaten breeding ponds. Aquatic habitats are also degraded through pollution with agricultural pesticides and fertiliser. Introduction of crayfish and predatory fish threatens larval development; the Chinese sleeper {{has been a major}} concern in Eastern Europe. Exotic plants can also degrade habitats: the swamp <b>stonecrop</b> replaces natural vegetation and overshadows waterbodies in the United Kingdom, and its hard leaves are unsuitable for egg-laying to crested newts.|$|E
5|$|The shingle ridge {{that protects}} the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting <b>stonecrop,</b> sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea wormwood, sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other saltmarsh specialists. The upper saltmarsh {{has a number of}} scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other. It is a perennial herb growing from a taproot, reaching only a short stature. The leaves are linear in shape and succulent in texture, resembling those of <b>stonecrops</b> (Sedum), giving the species its name. The inflorescence is a spikelike cluster of blue-purple flowers. The seeds are winged. Blooming occurs in July and August, and possibly September.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} parasitic, feeding off of other plants' root systems, {{often on the}} {{flowering}} plant genus Sedum which are also known as <b>stonecrops.</b> It does not produce chlorophyll, rather gaining its nutrients, such as carbohydrates, from other plant species. Due to not producing chlorophyll, the plant does not produce any green portions. It is not agreed upon by botanists whether the plant's flowers are pollinated by insects or if they are pollinated by the plant itself. The life expectancy of the species is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Sedum {{is a large}} genus of {{flowering}} plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which {{are commonly known as}} <b>stonecrops.</b> The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species updated to 470. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals.|$|R

25|$|A {{plant with}} deep red flowers that grew upon {{the summit of}} the hill of Amon Rûdh in Beleriand, with the result that the hill looked as if dripped with blood. The name can be {{translated}} from Sindarin as 'blood of stone'. Christopher Tolkien also stated that it resembled the real-world plant <b>stonecrop.</b>|$|E
50|$|Adults of this {{butterfly}} {{emerge in}} February and March, when nectar providing flowers open. After mating, the female locates host plants {{on which to}} deposit her eggs, which hatch within a week. The tiny larvae first feed on the plant's vegetative structures; however, when the <b>stonecrop's</b> flowers begin to open, the larvae migrate upward and feed on the flowers themselves. By June most have completed their larval development at which time they evacuate from the host plant to pupate in ground litter. They lie dormant as pupae until the following spring, when the life cycle begins anew.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} in the period 2013 – 2015 in Krakow. Its objective was to assess the usefulness of multispecies and multi-cultivars mixture for sodding for extensive green roofs. The blend of scattered <b>stonecrops</b> shoots comprised of 13 species of the genus Sedum were evaluated in terms of selected biometric features Two of them, Sedum album and Sedum spurium, were represented by four varieties each while others – by a single variety. In terms of rooting and wintering, most suitable for multi-species blend used in the early autumn were: Sedum acre, Sedum album Coral Carpet, Laconicum, Micranthum Chloroticum, Murals, Sedum cyaneum, Sedum oreganum, Sedum rupestre, Sedum sexangulare and Sedum spurium Fuldaglut, Roseum. After the first year of research: Sedum ewersii, Sedum floriferum Weihenstephaner Gold, Sedum hispanicum and Sedum lydium disappeared from the mixture. Species with greater mass of the plant, i. e. : Sedum hybridum, Sedum kamtschaticum Variegatum and Sedum spurium Album Superbum and Variegatum Tricolor had difficulties with rooting. Furthermore, their condition in the spring of the second year of the study was defined as very bad, bad, or bad to average and significantly worse in comparison to species with a smaller mass...|$|R
40|$|Glomus intraradices and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are two commercially used {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} micro-organisms. They associate with plant roots to facilitate host plants to absorb nutrients, induce resistance against pathogens and pests, and regulate growth through phytohormones. Growth conditions for plants on green roofs are often unfavorable. In order {{to test whether}} growth and development of green roof plants could be enhanced via improving the microbial interface, G. intraradices and B. amyloliquefaciens were inoculated on experimental plots on a green roof {{in the summer of}} 2012. The experimental plots were marked as R (inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens from Rhizocell), M (inoculated with G. intraradices from MYC 4000), and C (control). The green roof was made of sedum-herb-grass mats. The plants included e. g. <b>stonecrops,</b> bluegrasses, yellow rockets, white clover, mullein, pennycress, and moss. The survival and development of G. intraradices and B. amyloliquefaciens were studied respectively from Poa alpina roots and soils in the summers of 2012 and 2013. G. intraradices was not detected in P alpina roots according to root staining and microscopy. Probable reasons for the lacking of G. intraradices include high phosphorus content in the soils, high soil temperature, and low soil moisture. PCR and qPCR were used to detect Bacillus content in green roof soils. The abundance of B. amyloliquefaciens was related to soil water content and soil temperature. During the last two measurements in 2012, 4 weeks of high moisture content in the soil resulted in large increase of B. amyloliquefaciens content in both M and R groups, but then decreased substantially due to drought and heat in 2013. In 2013, Only R group increased from the third to the last measurement, indicating probable resistance of the B. amyloliquefaciens strain from Rhizocell additive. The synergistic effect of B. amyloliquefaciens and G. intraradices might be responsible for the thousand-fold increase of Bacillus content in M group in 2012...|$|R
25|$|This {{species has}} a single brood. Adult Apollo {{butterflies}} are seen on the wing from May to September, feeding on nectar produced by flowers. During mating males deposit on the female's abdomen a gelatinous secretion called sphragis, that prevents the female mating a second time. The females lay eggs, which over-winter and hatch in spring the following year. The Apollo caterpillar a velvety blue black with small orange spots. These caterpillars feed on <b>stonecrop</b> (Sedum species, mainly Sedum telephium, Sedum album, Sedum rupestre and Sedum ropsea), Hylotelephium caucasicum and houseleek (Sempervivum species). When the caterpillar is fully grown it will pupate on the ground, forming a loose cocoon from which the adult butterfly emerges following metamorphosis.|$|E
