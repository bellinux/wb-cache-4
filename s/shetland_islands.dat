5|$|Einarr was the {{youngest}} son of Rognvald Eysteinsson, Earl of Møre, Norway, by a concubine. According to the sagas and the Historia Norvegiae Rognvald's family conquered the Orkney and <b>Shetland</b> <b>islands</b> in the late ninth century. Rognvald's brother, Sigurd Eysteinsson, was made Earl of Orkney and after his death on campaign he was succeeded by his son, Guthorm, who died shortly afterward. Rognvald then sent {{one of his own}} sons, Hallad, to govern the islands.|$|E
5|$|Gale-force winds {{covered the}} far {{northern}} Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, {{due to the}} intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. This storm caused blizzards across much of Scotland {{and led to the}} final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, which had been stranded in rocks off the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand.|$|E
5|$|In the Antarctic, {{species were}} found in the South <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands,</b> South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula. Species from the Antarctic or subantarctic regions are rarer than {{specimens}} in the Arctic regions, although lack of access may be a factor. Until 1983, only five records were made, with only individual finds since then. According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more species were discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E

5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the passage of Igor, a weather buoy from St. John's was spotted near the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> north of Scotland on September12, 2011. In early October, Newfoundland was again struck by a {{tropical}} cyclone– Hurricane Ophelia. Though a weaker storm, Ophelia caused more damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of Igor. The mayor of Marystown criticized government officials for not increasing the size of repairs, especially to culverts, to account for flooding.|$|E
5|$|The Scalloway Islands {{are a small}} {{archipelago}} at {{the entrance}} to Weisdale Voe in the South West. The North Isles is the name given to the group including Yell, Unst and Fetlar. There are also numerous islands in Yell Sound between the Mainland and Yell and in St. Magnus Bay to the west, especially near the strait of Swarbacks Minn, but the number and diverse locations of the <b>Shetland</b> <b>islands</b> makes further classification difficult.|$|E
5|$|The town of Momchilgrad and {{the village}} of Momchilovtsi in {{southern}} Bulgaria, as well as Momchil Peak on Greenwich Island of the South <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> in Antarctica are named after Momchil.

Momchil's biography also inspired a 1988 children's comic book, The Lord of Merope, which tells a largely fictionalised version of his story.|$|E

50|$|From 1931, whilst {{he was in}} London, until 1943, {{after he}} had left the <b>Shetland</b> <b>island</b> of Whalsay, MacDiarmid was watched by the British Intelligence Services.

5|$|Transport between islands is {{primarily}} by ferry, and <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> Council operates various inter-island services. Shetland is also {{served by a}} domestic connection from Lerwick to Aberdeen on mainland Scotland. This service, which takes about 12 hours, is operated by NorthLink Ferries. Some services also call at Kirkwall, Orkney, which increases the journey time between Aberdeen and Lerwick by 2 hours. There are plans for road tunnels {{to some of the}} islands, especially Bressay and Whalsay, however it is hard to convince the mainland government to finance them.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War began, Macaulay {{joined the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) Volunteer Reserve in 1940 as a Pilot Officer, and was {{stationed}} at Church Fenton, close to Barkston Ash {{where he lived}} with his wife Edith. Later in the year, he was stationed in the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands,</b> where he was bothered by the cold. Six days after his 43rd birthday, he died of pneumonia at the Sullom Voe RAF station on 13 December 1940. He was buried in Lerwick Cemetery on Shetland.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> Council {{signed a}} {{partnership}} agreement with Scottish and Southern Energy for the Viking Wind Farm, a 200-turbine wind farm and subsea cable. This renewable energy project would produce about 600 megawatts and contribute about £20 {{million to the}} Shetland economy per year. The plan met with significant opposition within the islands, primarily resulting from the anticipated visual impact of the development. The PURE project on Unst is a research centre which uses a combination of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system. The project {{is run by the}} Unst Partnership, the local community's development trust.|$|E
50|$|Moving to the <b>Shetland</b> <b>island</b> of Whalsay in 1933 {{with his}} son Michael and second wife, Valda Trevlyn, MacDiarmid {{continued}} to write essays and poetry despite being cut off from mainland cultural developments {{for much of the}} 1930s.

50|$|During the Bølling-Allerød Period, {{known in}} Britain as the Windermere interstadial, the {{northern}} coast of Doggerland began to recede as global sea levels rose.

5|$|In the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands,</b> sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Oil and gas {{were first}} landed in 1978 at Sullom Voe, which has {{subsequently}} {{become one of}} the largest terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three quarters of the islands' workforce is employed in the service sector, and the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003. Shetland's access to oil revenues has funded the Shetland Charitable Trust, which in turn funds a wide variety of local programmes. The balance of the fund in 2011 was £217 million, i.e., about £9,500 per head.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour {{is one of}} the <b>Shetland</b> <b>Islands</b> in Scotland, with a {{population}} of under twenty people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828hectares (3.2square miles), Papa Stour is the eighth largest island in Shetland. Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation.|$|E

The couple had ten other children including Thomas, a botanist. By her own admission, Saxby received little formal education.|$|R
50|$|The Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney {{is one of}} {{the seven}} dioceses of the Scottish Episcopal Church. The diocese covers the {{historic}} county of Aberdeenshire, and the Orkney and <b>Shetland</b> <b>island</b> groups.

50|$|With {{this object}} in view, a larger vessel, the Imogen, was purchased, and a request was {{forwarded}} to Nisbet to take {{command of the}} new vessel. It was a new venture, and the promoters thought that, with one in command possessed of the energy and ability of Nisbet, it would prove a success; and it did. The Imogen traded to Uyeasound, Baltasound and Haroldswick on the <b>Shetland</b> <b>island</b> of Unst.|$|R
