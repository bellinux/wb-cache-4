5000|$|... 12 October 1997 - Singer John Denver {{died when}} his newly-bought Rutan Long-EZ home-built {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Pacific Ocean off Pacific Grove, California. The NTSB indicated that Denver {{lost control of the}} aircraft while attempting to manipulate the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>handle,</b> which had been placed in a hard-to-reach position by the aircraft's builder. The NTSB cited Denver's unfamiliarity with the aircraft's design as a cause of the crash.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control, {{while attempting to}} switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined there were other key factors {{that led to the}} accident. Foremost among these was Denver's inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft, and the builder's decision to locate the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>handle</b> in a difficult-to-reach location. The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating experimental aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Post-accident {{investigation}} by the NTSB showed that {{the leading cause of}} the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's transfer to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel <b>selector</b> valve <b>handle</b> configuration. Intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs, the builder instead had placed the fuel selector behind the pilot's left shoulder, with the fuel gauge also behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls. An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel <b>selector</b> valve <b>handle</b> and its resistance to being turned.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is rather}} {{challenging}} for current variable <b>selectors</b> to <b>handle</b> {{situations where the}} number of covariates under consideration is ultra-high. Consider a motivating clinical trial of the drug bortezomib {{for the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, where overall survival and expression levels of 44760 probesets were measured for each of 80 patients with the goal of identifying genes that predict survival after treatment. This dataset defies analysis even with regularized regression. Some remedies have been proposed for the linear model and for generalized linear models, but there are few solutions in the survival setting and, to our knowledge, no theoretical support. Furthermore, existing strategies often involve tuning parameters that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose and theoretically justify a principled method for reducing dimensionality in the analysis of censored data by selecting only the important covariates. Our procedure involves a tuning parameter that has a simple interpretation as the desired false positive rate of this selection. We present simulation results and apply the proposed procedure to analyze the aforementioned myeloma study...|$|R

50|$|Assistance Dogs {{may also}} wear {{different}} harnesses, although not {{required by the}} Americans with Disabilities Act. A Mobility assistance dog may wear a special, custom designed harnesses {{that allow them to}} bear a small portion of their handlers weight so that the dog may offer balance assistance, counterbalance, bracing, and stability. These harnesses generally include a rigid metal bracing handle. Other assistance harnesses include light weight soft handles to allow for minor support. Guide Dogs work in a specially designed guide harness which allows the dog to communicate properly with the handler while leading. A <b>guide</b> <b>handle</b> is different than a rigid mobility handle- generally a <b>guide</b> <b>handle</b> is slanted at an angle to allow for a more natural and comfortable hand position for the handler, and are not intended to bear weight. Custom harnesses for Assistance Dogs are generally (but not always) made of high quality leather and can range in price from $100-$600.|$|R

This final project {{report is}} written {{based on the}} job {{training}} which I undertook from 9 January until 10 February, 2012 at Mangkunegaran Palace, one of the palaces in Surakarta. The objectives of this final report are to explain the activities of job trainee as a tourist guide in Mangkunegaran Palace, to describe the roles of tourist guide in Mangkunegaran Palace, and to report {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} tourist guide in Mangkunegaran Palace. I focus this report on the roles of local tourist guide and their strengths and weaknesses. I expect this report can give clear understanding about the roles of local tourist guide in Mangkunegaran Palace. I conclude that local tourist guide has several roles that must be full-filled in <b>handling</b> tourists. Tourist <b>guides</b> have to know how to serve tourist to make them enjoy the tour.

The machine performed well in the field conditions with a field capacity of 0. 51 ha day - 1 consuming 0. 25 L of fuel in an hour. It was 7. 8 times faster than manual harvesting though the field loss was around 2. 3 % as against 1 % in manual harvesting. The break-even area was 1 ha and the payback period for the investment was one year.

40|$|Tubular hollow light guides {{are found}} in many {{lighting}} and daylighting systems to transport collected light into deep spaces of building interiors. Linear straight guides are popularly used due to their high optical efficiency, but non-linear guides with bent sections are sometimes required to fulfill some installation restrictions. The optical performance of such bent guides is, however, unknown. This article presents the development, validation, and application of an optical model to compute the transmittance of light guides with and without bends. The model {{is based on the}} ray-tracing technique and can <b>handle</b> segmented <b>guides</b> with connection elbows. Measurement of the light transmittance of a light guide with two connection elbows is conducted using an outdoor large integrating box to benchmark the model. The model predictions are in good agreement with the measurement and public data for vertical light guides without bends. The model predictions for bent light guides installed in a northern mid-latitude location show that orienting the middle pipe section of the guide toward the northern direction results in better control of sunlight and solar heat gains than other orientations.

40|$|Work toward {{developing}} a diffraction limited, single frequency, modulated transmitter suitable for coherent optical communication or direct detection communication is discussed. Diode pumped, monolithic Nd:YAG nonplanar ring oscillators {{were used as}} the carrier beam. An external modulation technique which can handle high optical powers, has moderate modulation voltage, and which can reach modulation rates of 1 GHz was invented. Semiconductor laser pumped solid-state lasers which have high output power (0. 5 Watt) and which oscillate at a single frequency, in a diffraction limited beam, at the wavelength of 1. 06 microns were built. A technique for phase modulating the laser output by 180 degrees with a 40 -volt peak to peak driving voltage is demonstrated. This technique can be adapted for amplitude modulation of 100 percent with the same voltage.

40|$|Eyelets, {{capstans}} and cylindrical {{surfaces are}} often used in thread, fiber and paper <b>handling</b> machinery to <b>guide</b> the axially moving element. In addition to providing positional control, these "guides" introduce dry friction forces that alter the vibration and stability characteristics of the system. This paper examines the lateral response of a string that slides through an elastically supported, dry friction guide. Exact expressions are derived for the linear response under free and forced conditions. Solutions for the eigenvalue spectrum exhibit unusual features including multiple divergence instabilities, regions of flutter instability, and regions of curve veering associated with mode localization. A second order perturbation solution is derived to examine {{the behavior of the}} eigenvalue spectrum in regions of flutter instability and curve veering. The analysis highlights the common features of these two phenomena and suggests ways to minimize vibration by adjusting various design variables.
