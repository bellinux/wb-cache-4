40|$|Abstract. Before {{concrete}} {{structures are}} subjected to dynamic loadings such as earthquake, usually they have already withstood <b>static</b> <b>loads.</b> Accordingly, the study on the strain-rate sensitivity of concrete should also be {{closely related to the}} initial <b>static</b> <b>loads</b> that concrete structures experience. But majority of the available documents concerning the dynamic properties of concrete do not take initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> into consideration. In this study, experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> on the dynamic strength and deformation characteristics of concrete in compression. A load was initially applied on the specimen at a very low speed to a specified value and then the dynamic load was applied at a high strain rate up to the failure of the specimen. From the test results it was revealed that the initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> had significant influence on the dynamic strength. The dynamic strength tended to decrease as initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> increased. An exponential function was proposed to formulate the relationship between the initial <b>static</b> <b>load</b> and the dynamic strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of bridge lifetime load {{effect is a}} complex problem. Usually, statistical extrapolation of simulated <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect is used to derive a lifetime characteristic <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect. In reality, when a vehicle crosses a bridge, dynamic interaction occurs which often causes a greater total load effect. This total load effect {{is related to the}} <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect through a dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Often the worst estimated DAF is applied to the lifetime <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect to obtain a total lifetime characteristic load effect. This does not allow for the reduced probabilities of both high <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and high dynamic interaction. The authors present an approach that accounts for this reduced probability by using multivariate extreme value theory, in conjunction with extensive static simulations and 3 -D finite element bridge-truck dynamic interaction models. It is found that the DAF that should be applied to the characteristic <b>static</b> <b>load</b> effect is significantly less than originally thought. This has significant implications for the type of traffic (free-flowing or congested) thought to govern short- to medium-length bridges...|$|R

This smaller dynamic load together with the practical vibration amplitude define a practical upper bound to the dynamic stiffness. This paper also presents approximate design formulas and curves for this stiffness capacity {{as a function of}} the ratio of dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, it indicates that vibrations larger than a certain gap fraction can destabilize the magnetic bearing. This gap fraction, called the critical gap fraction, depends on the dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>load</b> ratio.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most <b>static</b> <b>load</b> tests are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic load testing or the rapid load testing may not be necessarily inferior to the <b>static</b> <b>load</b> test, considering cost and time performance of the dynamic load test as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>load</b> tests on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A set {{of stress}} state {{dependent}} failure loci of a talc-filled Polypropylene material under <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and dynamic loading {{was obtained by}} using a combined experimental-numerical approach. Uniaxial tension, simple shear, notched tension and punching tests were carried out to identify fracture locus under nonnegative stress triaxiality. Corresponding finite element analysis was performed to obtain the evolution of stress triaxiality of each failure element in each type of test. Different fracture prediction techniques were applied in <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and dynamic loading, respectively. Under dynamic loading, an average value of the stress triaxiality was identified to determine stress triaxiality of critical point during the whole loading process in each type of test. By comparing force-displacement curves from both test and modeling, equivalent plastic strain in identified stress triaxiality can be obtained. Under <b>static</b> <b>loading,</b> damage evolution rule was utilized to optimize failure locus, and quadratic function was selected to optimize fracture locus. Significant difference of fracture locus between <b>static</b> <b>loading</b> and dynamic loading was observed...|$|R
