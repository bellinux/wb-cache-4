40|$|A two-parameter {{extension}} of the density-scaled double hybrid approach of <b>Sharkas</b> et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 064113 (2011) ] is presented. It {{is based on the}} explicit treatment of a fraction of multideterminantal exact exchange. The connection with conventional double hybrids is made when neglecting density scaling in the correlation functional as well as second-order corrections to the density. In this context, the fraction ac of second-order Møller-Plesset (MP 2) correlation energy is not necessarily equal to the square of the fraction ax of Hartree-Fock exchange. More specifically, it is shown that ac ≤ ax 2, a condition that conventional semi-empirical double hybrids actually fulfill. In addition, a new procedure for calculating the orbitals, which has a better justification than the one routinely used, is proposed. Referred to as λ 1 variant, the corresponding double hybrid approximation has been tested on a small set consisting of H 2, N 2, Be 2, Mg 2, and Ar 2. Three conventional double hybrids (B 2 -PLYP, B 2 GP-PLYP, and PBE 0 -DH) have been considered. Potential curves obtained with λ 1 - and regular double hybrids can, in some cases, differ significantly. In particular, for the weakly bound dimers, the λ 1 variants bind systematically more than the regular ones, which is an improvement in many but not all cases. Including density scaling in the correlation functionals may of course change the results significantly. Moreover, optimized effective potentials based on a partially-interacting system could also be used to generate proper orbitals. Work is currently in progress in those directions...|$|R

40|$|BGPI : équipe 6 Strategies {{for disease}} control are often based on expert {{opinions}} {{rather than on the}} formal demonstration that they are, at least in theory, effective. An alternative and promising approach consists in modeling both the epidemic processes and control measures in order to optimize disease management. In this way, the most influential parameters can be identified, and alternative control strategies can be proposed and tested in silico in order to assess their potential efficiency. To this end, we developed a spatially-realistic stochastic model simulating disease dynamics and management. We used this model to carry out generic sensitivity analyses with parameter ranges large enough to encompass values that are typical of many perennial plant diseases and of their management.

40|$|Differences in gene {{expression}} were studied after Plum pox virus (PPV, <b>sharka</b> disease) infection in peach GF 305 leaves {{with and without}} <b>sharka</b> symptoms using RNA-Seq. For each sample, more than 80 % of 100 -nucleotide paired-end (PE) Illumina reads were aligned on the peach reference genome. In the symptomatic sample, {{a significant proportion of}} reads were mapped to PPV reference genomes (1. 04 % compared with 0. 00002 % in non-symptomatic leaves), allowing for the ultra-deep assembly of the complete genome of the PPV isolate used (9775 nucleotides, missing only 11 nucleotides at the 5 ' genome end). In addition, significant alternative splicing events were detected in 359 genes and 12990 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, 425 of which could be annotated. Gene ontology annotation revealed that the high-ranking mRNA target genes associated with the expression of <b>sharka</b> symptoms are mainly related to the response to biotic stimuli, to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and to the negative regulation of catalytic activity. A greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed in the early asymptomatic phase of PPV infection in comparison with the symptomatic phase. These early infection events were associated with the induction of genes related to pathogen resistance, such as jasmonic acid, chitinases, cytokinin glucosyl transferases and Lys-M proteins. Once the virus had accumulated, the overexpression of Dicer protein 2 a genes suggested a gene silencing plant response that was suppressed by the virus HCPro and P 1 proteins.

40|$|<b>Sharka</b> is {{a severe}} apricot viral disease {{caused by the}} plum pox virus (PPV) and is {{responsible}} for large crop losses in many countries. Among the known PPV strains, both PPV-D (Dideron) and PPV-M (Marcus) are virulent in apricot, the latter being the most threatening. An F 1 apricot progeny derived from Lito, described in the literature as resistant, crossed to the susceptible selection BO 81604311 (San Castrese 9 Reale di Imola) was used to study the genetic control of resistance to PPV. A population of 118 individuals was phenotyped by inoculating both PPV-D and PPV-M strains in replicated seedlings and scored for 3 years. An additional set of 231 seedlings from the same cross was also phenotyped for 2 years. SSRbased linkage maps were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. A major QTL of resistance to both PPV-M and PPV-D strains {{was found in the}} top half of the Lito linkage group 1, where a QTL was previously described in Stark Earli-Orange, the donor of Lito resistance.

The occurrence of <b>sharka</b> {{was determined by the}} visual observation of symptoms on leaves and fruits during the ripening stage, when symptoms are most visible. To ascertain PPV in doubtful samples, an ELISA-DASI assay was applied to the leaves. All trees infected the previous year were pulled up and were not replanted. Results showed that the virus was introduced to the farm by natural vectors (aphids) from a neighbouring sharka-infected plum orchard. It was then transmitted from these infected trees mainly to nearby trees by the same vectors, although also often to trees standing quite a distance away. The long interval between infection and symptom appearance makes eradication of the disease more difficult. Pulling up infected trees as a control method reduced the percentage of trees ultimately lost, and over the long term could stop the further spread of the disease...|$|E

40|$|Plum pox (PP) or <b>sharka</b> {{disease was}} {{introduced}} {{more than ten}} years ago into the Sarca Valley (Trento province), an area where the well known Dro Plum cultivar has been cultivated for a long time. The old plum variety is quite sensitive to PP and yield of the trees is negatively influenced, too. A systematic survey carried out during 1984 and 1985 in the Sarca Valley, with the purpose of setting up a plan of eradication, established that 34 442 trees out of the 261 772 checked (about 13 %) were showing PP symptoms. After transferring the data acquired onto a map of the Valley, using different colours for each class of incidence, it was possible to distinguish 11 plum zones isolated by natural barriers having different incidences of the disease. On such a basis a work plan distinguishing three criteria of intervention was started in 1985 / 86. In the zones with a rather modest incidence of the disease, extirpation of the symptom showing trees and of part of the symptomless ones was carried out each year by the growers, and a reduction in the percentage of affected trees was noticed in the systematic check carried out in 1986 and 1987. In the two zones with an average incidence of PP above 20 %, it was impossible to extirpate all the stonefruit trees susceptible to <b>sharka</b> as would be necessary for the replanting of Dro Plum, and consequently the eradication program was suspended. An isolation band specifically created would prevent spreading of <b>sharka</b> in the contiguous plum areas. Although up to now results have been only partial, the plan of intervention is continuing in the seven zones with an average incidence of the disease below 5 % and in the two zones where it is now around 7 %.
