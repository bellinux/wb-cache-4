5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He {{also noted that the}} characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E
5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is {{a popular}} science book. Homer-Dixon takes an inter-disciplinary {{approach}} connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, biology, and ecology. The narrative is structured as a travelogue as the author travels to meet experts and construct his theory. His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research. Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and <b>social</b> <b>commentary.</b>|$|E
5|$|The album's {{development}} was impeded by a dispute between Big Boi {{and his former}} label, Jive Records, over creative and commercial differences. Rooted in Southern hip hop, Sir Lucious Left Foot has been noted by music writers for its bounce and bass-heavy sound, layered production, and assorted musical elements. Its lyrics deal with boasting, sex, <b>social</b> <b>commentary,</b> and club themes, featuring Big Boi's clever wordplay and versatile flow.|$|E
50|$|Roger Brown (1941-1997) was an American {{artist and}} painter. Often {{associated}} with the Chicago Imagist school, he was internationally known for his distinctive painting style and shrewd <b>social</b> <b>commentaries</b> on politics, religion, and art.|$|R

5|$|The {{character}} has been well-received by critics, with Ellie's relationship with Joel most frequently {{the subject of}} praise. The strength and complexity of her character, and its subversion of the damsel in distress stereotype, have also been commended. Ellie's role in Left Behinds plot has prompted some <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> within the industry, with coverage focusing on a scene depicting LGBT themes. Both the character and Johnson's performance received numerous awards and nominations, and have regularly been placed favorably in polls and lists.|$|E
5|$|Vocalist Andrew Schwab has {{remained}} the band's lead lyricist. Schwab has said most lyrics are based on his emotions. He also tries to incorporate <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> from literature. Prominent influences include comic book artist Chris Ware and writers Chris Bachelder, Don DeLillo, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and T. S. Eliot. He has written lyrics around {{a variety of topics}} that include alcohol abuse ("One-Armed Man"), conformity ("S.M.C."), emptiness ("Evil (A Chorus of Resistance)"), greed ("Cold and Calculated"), nightlife ("Molotov"),, spirituality ("Chapter 2"), pornography ("P.S."), and child molestation ("Sioux Lane Spirits").|$|E
5|$|Writing for The Escapist, Allen Varney {{felt that}} the {{political}} awareness was overstated because the percentage of The Movies films that offered <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> remained small and because the machinima and political communities were mostly separate. He argued that machinima's outstanding copyright issues and possible marginalization constrained potential for expression. Marino and others added concerns that, although game developers had condoned machinima, a controversial film could prompt them to control machinima content by enforcing their copyrights.|$|E

5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel. Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides' depiction of his hometown of Detroit—praising him for his <b>social</b> <b>commentary.</b> Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E

50|$|Crashdog {{were known}} for their very direct lyrics, which they used to make <b>social</b> <b>commentaries</b> and discuss {{political}} issues of their day. Their albums included both strongly Christian songs and overtly political songs, often with a liberal bent.

5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its <b>social</b> <b>commentary.</b> Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting <b>social</b> <b>commentary.</b> Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk. Funk was typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, The Meters, and James Brown himself, while more versatile groups like War, The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire also became popular. During the 1970s, some highly slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success, {{as well as a}} new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul groups like The Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

5|$|<b>Social</b> <b>commentary</b> was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a {{sympathetic}} light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes were}} made in the second edition. Some of the <b>social</b> <b>commentary</b> {{regarding}} the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government was toned down. The name of the Native tribe was changed from the Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had diminished in the intervening years, Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E
