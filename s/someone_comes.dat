25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{aspect of}} the Mami Wata deities is their connection to healing. If <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata has taken {{an interest in the}} afflicted person and that only she can cure him or her. Similarly, several other ailments may be attributed to the water spirit. In Nigeria, for example, she takes the blame for everything from headaches to sterility.|$|E

25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|I {{think that}} Amphiaraos {{most of all}} {{dedicated}} himself to interpreting dreams: it is clear that, when he was considered a god, he set up an oracle of dreams. And {{the first thing is}} to purify oneself, when <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> to consult Amphiaraos, and the purification ritual is to sacrifice to the god, and people sacrifice to him and to all those whose names are on (the altar), and - when these things are finished – they sacrifice a ram and spread out its skin under themselves, lie down waiting for the revelation of a dream.|$|E

Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the confusion <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> to the children's rescue.

500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E

[...] Human beings entrust to God a drop of fluid in privacy, and God openly returns to them completed and perfected human beings. [...] Rabbi Levi said a second thing: [...] It is natural that, {{if a person is}} confined without attention to a chamber, and <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> and kindles a light for the person there, the former should feel gratitude towards the latter. [...] So too is it with God. [...] When the embryo is in its mother’s womb, God causes a light to shine for it there with which it can see {{from one end of the}} world to the other. [...] Rabbi Levi said a third thing: [...] It is natural that, if a person is confined without attention to a chamber, and <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> and releases the person and takes the person out from there, the former should feel gratitude to the latter.

2500|$|Mayhew {{learned of}} a casting call for Star Wars, which was filming in London, {{and decided to}} audition.

2500|$|Davis, on his {{commentary}} in Billboard magazine {{the issue}} of January 18, 1986, pointed out the misapplication of the literal meaning or the board of trustees' rules, stating that [...] " [...] is often a matter of opinion. , {{it became obvious that}} this NARAS rule had been interpreted very liberally in the past." [...] According to his review of each past winner and nominee, some artists such as Cyndi Lauper, Luther Vandross, the Power Station, Carly Simon, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, had already received credits on other albums or been previously very well known as a member of other acts prior to their Grammy nominations. He added that [...] "it is a conspicuous injustice that Whitney will not be getting her shot.

2500|$|The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, {{follows the}} {{traditional}} Tibetan Buddhist assertion that inappropriate sexual behaviour includes {{lesbian and gay}} sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse with one's own monogamous partner, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation. In a 1994 interview, he stated: [...] "If <b>someone</b> <b>comes</b> to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say 'if two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay'." [...] However, in his 1996 book Beyond Dogma, he states, [...] "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else... homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper {{is the use of}} organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact." ...|$|E
