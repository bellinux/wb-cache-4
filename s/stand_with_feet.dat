2500|$|Snowboards are boards {{where both}} feet are secured {{to the same}} board, which are wider than skis, {{with the ability to}} glide on snow. Snowboards widths are between 6 to 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters. Snowboards are {{differentiated}} from monoskis by the stance of the user. [...] In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board. [...] Users of such equipment may be referred to as snowboarders. Commercial snowboards generally require extra equipment such as bindings and special boots which help secure both feet of a snowboarder, who generally rides in an upright position. These types of boards are commonly used by people at ski hills or resorts for leisure, entertainment, and competitive purposes in the activity called snowboarding.|$|E

When standing easy, squad members may, with permission, move all but their feet and adjust clothing and equipment, but they shall not smoke or talk.|$|E

The subject should be relaxed, and the measurements should be taken {{at the end of}} a normal respiration. Each measurement should be repeated twice; if the measurements are within 1 cm of one another, the average should be calculated. If the difference between the two measurements exceeds 1 cm, the two measurements should be repeated.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the differences between gender, physical activity level, and balance in an older adult population. A secondary purpose was {{to examine the relationship between}} pedometer-determined ambulatory activity and balance. Forty-six older adults aged 73. 7 Â± 6. 2 years participated in the study. Participants completed the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) Scale and completed a 2 -week daily step recording to determine average steps taken per day. Low-level activity participants (7, 500 steps/day) in weight, age, and the number of medications reported. Males performed better than females on the two-footed jump test and reactive postural test FAB assessments. High-level activity participants performed significantly better than low-level activity participants on all FAB assessments except <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> together and eyes closed, reach forward to object, and walk with head turns...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} a sudden {{addition}} of a large quantity of readily fermentable carbohydrate to the feed ration of pregnant heifers are described. Clinical and pathological changes caused by the resulting disease were confined to the digits and skin. The 4 acutely affected heifers were reluctant to get up or move (group II). They tended to lie down or <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> bunched together and the back arched, often shifting weight from limb to limb. They walked stiffly with great tenderness and pain in the digits. Extreme pain was noticed when the digits were examined. In 4 of 8 heifers, separation of the sole at the heel, with leakage of exudate, and under-running of the sole were observed. Necrotic dermatitis of the legs, alopecia and hyperkeratosis of the tail were noticed in all 8 heifers. Skin lesions appeared simultaneously. Four of the heifers (group I) recovered, and the other 4 (group II) were sent to slaughter. No post mortem examination was performed. The biochemical findings revealed a significantly higher concentration of total serum globulins and sodium, and increased activity, in CK, LDH and AST. A significantly decreasing pattern was noted in blood urea concentration, cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin and calcium. No significant differences among the various groups {{were found in the}} activities of amylase, GGT, and concentration of creatinine, total bilirubin, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium and potassium...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the pattern of}} activity of the tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL) and peroneus longus (PER) muscles of both legs during tandem stance, in order to highlight their respective role in maintaining balance. METHODS: Twelve young healthy {{subjects were asked to}} <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> in line for successive 15 s-epochs, on a dynamometric platform with (EO) and without (EC) vision. EMG was recorded from the six muscles simultaneously. Collected signals were displacement of the centre of feet pressure (CoP) and EMG. Variables calculated for each recorded epoch were mean level, variability and distribution between legs of EMG, and cross-correlation between EMG and CoP traces and between EMG of homonymous muscles. RESULTS: CoP motion was larger along the medio-lateral (M-L) than antero-posterior (A-P) axis, and larger with EC than EO particularly in the M-L axis. Muscle activity was larger in the rear than in the front leg, as expected, except for PER. Activity increased with the increase in M-L CoP oscillations, except for SOL, which was tonically active, both legs, regardless of the amplitude of the oscillations. Manipulating vision had no effect on the variability of the EMG for equal mean levels of activity, for any muscle. Cross-correlation between EMG of rear leg muscles and M-L CoP sway gave higher coefficients for TA and PER than SOL, and appropriate time-delays between TA or PER and CoP motion, indicating a role of these muscles in the control of M-L sway. Except for the tonically active SOL, the homonymous muscles of the two legs were active out-of-phase, indicating a mutual push-pull action of the pairs. This was confirmed by the reciprocal activation of TA and PER of the same leg. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in spite of a large inter-trial and inter-subject variability, the neural command to the leg muscles during tandem stance implies a task-sharing rule, whereby SOL keeps the body upright while the reciprocal PER and TA activities produce the alternate impulses necessary for body stabilization in the frontal plane. SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge of the normal mode of control of balance in frontal plane can foster new investigation in both posture and gait control, in addition to offering tools for understanding balance problems of elderly persons and patients at risk of fall...|$|E
