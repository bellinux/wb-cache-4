40|$|The {{decision}} for an M. A. thesis-project in directing {{was made in}} October, 1976. Because directing {{is an integral part}} of my professional objectives, I desired the academic sanction of my directing skills through my M. A. program at California State University at Northridge. I wanted to make my course work applicable to the project but at the same time attempt a directing approach I had never taken before. I was a member of Dr. James Brock???s seminar on Tennessee Williams in 1976 and thus satisfied my first intention by selecting A <b>Streetcar</b> <b>Names</b> <b>Desire.</b> I deemed it mere exciting if staged arena or in-the-round style than the ???fourth-wall??? staging for which it was written and thereby satisfied my second intention. By December l, the thesis committee was formed, a thesis-project proposal formulated, a production staff organized, successful screening by the Acting-Directing Area Committee attained, and a LAB Theatre slot for May 11 - 15, 1977, awarded. The thesis-project proposal contains a brief statement of my general directorial approach as well as an initial production concept. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze women stereotypes and Blanche Dubois in Tennessee William’s play, A <b>Streetcar</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Desire.</b> Data for this study were collected through the writer by close reading on the text of play. Data cards were used to record materials relevant to the data analyses. A library research was conducted to support the data collection. The data analyses produce five women stereotypes, (1) “Invalid” woman can be trusted (the society tends to give different treatments to man and woman concerning human defeats) (2) Women tends to interfere other women’s marriages (in the play pictured through Blanche’s coming into Stella and Stanley’s marriage life) (3) A man is naturally promiscuous and therefore must be forgiven, whereas a woman who “falls” destroys herself (4) When rape occurs, it is the woman that is blamed not the man, as represented by the rape incident in the play, and (5) Even when such female characters are presented sympathetically as the victims of an unfeeling social world, once their sexual innocence is lost their path leads inevitably to death as what has happened to Blanche in the play...|$|R
