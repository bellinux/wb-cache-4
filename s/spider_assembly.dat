50|$|The {{biggest change}} to the LU3 and LG3 was the fuel-injection system. These engines used a {{multipoint}} fuel-injection system, with six Multec II fuel injectors mounted at each intake port on the manifold. GM recommends the Multec II <b>spider</b> <b>assembly</b> (which is also available for the L30 and L31 small block V8 motors) {{as a replacement for}} the 1996-01 CPI injector/spider assembly since the poppet valves have been known to stick open. The sticking poppet valves have been attributed to ethanol fuel blends sold in the State of California. The composite upper intake manifold and cast aluminum lower intake from the L35 engine is also used on the LU3. The LG3 uses a cast aluminum upper intake and a cast iron lower intake. The lower intake eliminated the EGR valve.|$|E
5000|$|Maksutov {{noted in}} his designs that instead of using a full-aperture {{corrector}}, a small sub-aperture corrector could {{be placed in the}} converging light cone of the primary mirror and achieve the same effect. In the 1980s Dave Shafer and Ralph W. Field came out with sub-aperture Cassegrain designs based on this idea. The design reduces the mass and [...] "cool-down time" [...] of a full aperture corrector. It has the drawbacks of an open, unsealed tube and requires a <b>spider</b> <b>assembly</b> to hold the secondary mirror and corrector, which inevitably affects image quality through diffraction artifacts. Also since the light passes through the corrector twice, the number of surfaces involved is increased, making it difficult to achieve good aberration correction. Sub-aperture corrector Maksutovs are currently manufactured by Vixen telescopes, their VMC (Vixen Maksutov Cassegrain) models.|$|E
40|$|A graphite/epoxy {{metering}} truss {{as applied}} to the large space telescope was investigated. A full-scale truss was designed, fabricated and tested. Tests included static limit loadings, a modal survey and thermal-vacuum distortion evaluation. The most critical requirement was the demonstration of the dimensional stability provided by the graphite/epoxy truss concept. Crucial to the attainment of this objective was {{the ability to make}} very sophisticated thermal growth measurements which was provided by a seven beam laser interferometer. The design of the basic truss elements were tuned to provide the high degree of dimensional stability and stiffness required by the truss. The struts and <b>spider</b> <b>assembly</b> were fabricated with Fiberite's AS/ 934 and HMS/ 934 broadgoods. The rings utilized T 300 graphite fabricate with the same materials. The predicted performance of the truss was developed using the NASTRAN program. These results showed conformance with the critical stiffness and thermal distortion requirements and correlated well with the test results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Spider {{dragline}} silk possesses impressive me-chanical and biochemical properties. It is synthesized by {{a couple}} of major ampullate glands in spiders and comprises of two major structural proteins—spidroins 1 and 2. The relationship between structure and mechanical properties of spider silk is not well understood. Here, we modeled the complete process of the <b>spider</b> silk <b>assembly</b> using two new recombinant analogs of spidroins 1 and 2. The artificial genes sequence of the hydrophobic core regions of spidroin 1 and 2 have been designed using computer analysis of existing databases and mathematical modeling. Both pro-teins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using a cation exchange chromatography. Despite the absence of hydrophilic N- and C-termini, both purified proteins spontaneously formed the nanofibrils and round micelle...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} primary designs for a drum magazine. The most common is the {{cylinder}} type, {{that has a}} <b>spider</b> gear <b>assembly</b> that has an opening in each gear {{for two to three}} rounds of ammunition and can be loaded from the rear, used primarily in the AK-47. Another common design is the double-stack dual-horn drum, which operates like a standard stick magazine, but diverges the ammo into two separate feed chutes that run on a single cog. Rimmed ammunition including shotgun ammunition operated drums primarily run off a cogged (gear shaped) design which feeds each individual round of the ammo from the outermost edge of the drum. Recently a single-stack compact design has been released, which uses most of the interior capacity of the drum. It is driven by a single hub and telescopic shaft.|$|R
40|$|Spider silks are spun from {{concentrated}} solutions of spidroin proteins. The appropriate {{timing of}} spidroin assembly into organized fibers must be highly regulated to avoid premature fiber formation. Chemical and physical signals {{presented to the}} silk proteins as they pass from the ampulle and through the tapered duct include changes in ionic environment and pH {{as well as the}} introduction of shear forces. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of spidroins from the major ampullate gland (MaSp-NTDs) for both Nephila and Latrodectus spiders associate noncovalently as homodimers. The MaSp-NTDs are highly pH-responsive and undergo a structural transition in the physiological pH range of the spider duct. Tryptophan fluorescence of the MaSp-NTDs reveals a change in conformation when pH is decreased, and the pH at which the transition occurs is determined by the amount and type of salt present. Size exclusion chromatography and pulldown assays both indicate that the lower pH conformation is associated with a significantly increased MaSp-NTD homodimer stability. By transducing the duct pH signal into specific protein-protein interactions, this conserved spidroin domain likely contributes significantly to the silk-spinning process. Based on these results, we propose a model of <b>spider</b> silk <b>assembly</b> dynamics as mediated through the MaSp-NTD...|$|R
40|$|Development of the 1 -meter {{aperture}} Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) {{telescope is}} underway at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) {{which is expected}} to achieve sub-centimeter range precision and accuracy to the Moon, for enhanced tests of Earth-Moon system dynamics. Key to the operational performance of the telescope is thermal analysis of the telescope composite structure including the optical mirrors. This study presents a thermal analysis on the integrated component materials comprising the LLR telescope in ANSYS, with the aim of simulating its thermal behaviour in response to site-based ambient air temperature (TA). Results show that for a full day TA profile spanning the time period 00 : 00 to 23 : 59 the resulting range of simulated thermal variations measured at 12 : 00 midday and 23 : 59 nighttime across the telescope composite structure was found to be 9. 11 ºC to 10. 03 ºC and 9. 12 ºC to 9. 86 ºC respectively. In particular, the <b>spider</b> <b>assembly</b> and outer tube surface had the largest range of thermal variations i. e. greater than absolute 1 ºC and thus, could be the main areas on the telescope where most thermal variations would occur. Furthermore, validation of the outer tube thermal variations using the 64 Resistant Temperature Detector (RTD) sensors mounted onto the test tube, showed relatable overall thermal variations of about 2 ºC, at wind speeds of 0 to 0. 4 km/h. In overall, these findings provide a typical expectation of the LLR telescope thermal behavior in response to TA at the site; and thus {{could be used as a}} guide to develop an RTD-based thermal monitoring system for the HartRAO LLR optical telescope.

40|$|Global {{production}} sharing {{is determined}} by international cost differences and frictions related to the costs of unbundling stages spatially. The interaction between these forces depends on engineering details of the production process with two extremes being ‘snakes’ and ‘spiders’. Snakes are processes whose sequencing is dictated by engineering; <b>spiders</b> involve the <b>assembly</b> of parts in no particular order. This paper studies spatial unbundling as frictions fall, showing that outcomes are very different for snakes and spiders, even if they share some features. Both snakes and spiders have in common a property that lower frictions produce discontinuous location changes and ‘overshooting’. Parts may move against their comparative costs because of proximity benefits, and further reductions in frictions lead these parts to be ‘reshored’. Predictions for trade volumes {{and the number of}} fragmented stages are quite different in the two cases. For spiders, a part crosses borders at most twice; the value of trade increases monotonically as frictions fall, except when the assembler relocates and the direction of parts trade is reversed. For snakes the volume of trade and number of endogenously determined stages is bounded only by the fragmentation of the underlying engineering process, and lower frictions monotonically increase trade volumes. ...|$|R
