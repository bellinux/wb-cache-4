The bamboo paper was cut into strips of 14 in long and 1/3 in wide, laid on a table; a string of gunpowder was placed at the center with a hollow tube, then twisted up to make a piece of fuse. The firecracker tubes were made from pieces of <b>straw</b> <b>paper</b> wrapped around iron rods of various diameters and then tightened with a special tool. 200 to 300 firecrackers were tied up in a bunch, then red clay was spread at the bottom of the bunch and forced into each end of the firecracker with a punch; gunpowder was poured in, then the other end was sealed with an awl by turning the tube inward, and a fuse inserted.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Alcove {{is a history}} of the mills {{established}} along the Hannacroix (Haanacrois) Creek. In 1790 an early settler by the name of Casperus Ackerman established the first mill in the area. In 1844 Ephraim Andrews established the Valley Mill for carding of wool and cloth manufacturing along the Hannacroix Creek at the corners of what is now New York State Route 143 and Albany County Route 111. It would be expanded in 1848 and converted to the manufacturing of <b>straw</b> <b>paper</b> by John E. Andrews, and in 1854 in partnership with WS Briggs improvements such as steam power were introduced. WS Briggs and Sons was formed as a partnership in control of the mills in 1871 with Briggs' son Amos D. Briggs as proprietor. This partnership would buy other local mills as well, including Ephraim Andrews'. An early name for Alcove was Stephensville, named for Archibald Stephens who at one time owned the Andrews' mill prior to selling it to WS Briggs and Sons. When the post office was established in the hamlet in 1881 it took the name Alcove. The Valley Mill was destroyed by fire in 1892 leaving the 110 ft chimney as the only remnant. The chimney is on the National Register of Historic Places and along with 140 acre of the hamlet it {{is a part of the}} Alcove Historic District. The district was created in 1980 and has eight contributing properties. The Alcove Preservation Association has been attempting to restore the chimney with hopes of creating a pocket park and interpretive historical center.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the humanitarian design movement’s {{efforts to address}} the crushing need, social precarity, and ecological frailty that defi ne global megacities. The aims and character of the humanitarian design movement have been shaped by both the ethical demands of antiglobalization struggles {{and the rise of}} nongovernmental organizations as a principal means of social service–delivery in the Global South. The emergent humanitarian design movement offers a compelling critique of the failure of mainstream architectural and industrial design practices to address profound human suffering. Champions of humanitarian design, however, offer a technological fi x (e. g., life <b>straws,</b> <b>paper</b> log houses, and hippo rollers) for problems rooted in imperial histories and neoliberal restructuring. In failing to address the dynamics of structural underdevelopment, do-good design performs the grassroots ideological work of neoliberalism by promoting market values and autoregulation. Within the humanitarian–corporate complexes, the global poor are construed as objects of elite benevolence and non-profi t largesse, rather than as historical subjects possessing their own unique worldviews, interests, and notions of progress. This essay concludes by briefl y sketching an alternative approach to self-determination for the poor where technological development is grounded in egalitarian cultures of anticapitalist social movements...|$|R
