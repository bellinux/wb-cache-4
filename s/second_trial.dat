5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} his {{prosecution}} violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal {{on the third}} count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the <b>second</b> <b>trial.</b> The Court rejected this argument. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{consistency}} of response in repeated measurements of isoinertial trunk performance among patients with low back pain. An underlying assumption was that inconsistency can detect lack of effort. Ninety-two patients, 53 men and 39 women, were evaluated using a multiaxis isoinertial dynamometer. The patients were asked to perform with maximum effort against 25 and 50 % maximum isometric torque in each plane of motion. Torque, velocity, and range of motion were measured in repeated trials. Correlations between first and <b>second</b> <b>trials</b> were extremely high in all cases even through the range of performance was diverse. Percentage differences between first and <b>second</b> <b>trials</b> were found to be approximately normally (Gaussian) distributed. On the basis of normality, we calculated limits for the percentage difference between first and <b>second</b> <b>trials,</b> within which patients with low back pain would be expected to fall 95 % of the time. These limits, presented separately for men and women, are given for each combination of measurements of torque, velocity, and range of motion; plane of motion; and two levels of resistance. Resistance was measured at 25 and 50 % of maximum isometric. The limits may be used as guidelines to assess maximum performance for patients with low back pain.

By contrast, the event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event that the sum of the numbers seen on the first and <b>second</b> <b>trials</b> is 8 are not independent.|$|R
5|$|Judge Duff {{ordered a}} retrial for Burge, former Police Supt. Richard Brzeczek, and the City of Chicago on two other {{outstanding}} charges (conspiracy {{and whether the}} City of Chicago's policy toward police brutality contributed to Wilson's injuries). Burge was acquitted of these charges in a <b>second</b> <b>trial,</b> which began on June 9, 1989, and lasted nine weeks.|$|E
5|$|The second {{conviction}} left Knight {{even worse}} off than before. The company {{he was working for}} before his <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> refused to re-employ him. Jobless, he engaged himself in community work in his church, Covenant Community Methodist Church, and often visited a pub in Boat Quay of which his wife was a partner. He faded quietly from public life.|$|E
5|$|While the {{indictment}} was pending, Burton was robbed in Chicago and his wallet was recovered in a mail box by postal employees. Before Burton's <b>second</b> <b>trial,</b> the Department of Justice learned that Burton had also collected $14,000 for representing the Chickasaw before the Interior Department: $5,000 {{of which was}} paid directly to him, and $9,000 of which was paid to his brother Z.R. Burton.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} days before the Varsity Match, talk in the press had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for the third and final trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>second</b> <b>trial,</b> {{a further}} 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Kinne went {{to trial}} {{for the murder of}} Patricia Jones in June 1961 and was acquitted. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in {{conviction}} and a sentence of life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a <b>second</b> <b>trial,</b> which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E
50|$|The {{amplitude}} of the CNV changes when one changes the foreperiod, or interstimulus interval (ISI). The most frequent ISI used is between 1.0-1.5 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Trials</b> with an ISI between 0.5-1.5 elicit a robust CNV wave. When the ISI {{is reduced to}} 0.125 or 0.25 seconds, the CNV becomes suppressed. On the other hand, trials with an ISI of 4.8 seconds show reduced CNV amplitude.|$|R

The <b>second</b> <b>trials</b> resulted in a life sentence for Adkins and the acquittal of Jesse Fields. Adkins however, had been a free man again, lo-these many years. A life sentence in Kentucky is not what it seems.|$|R

5|$|Lee Woods {{was tried}} twice, {{after his first}} trial ended in a mistrial due to a juror in her 20s falling ill. Wood's attorney, Samuel J. Karlin, told the judge his client wanted to {{continue}} with the ill juror, instead of using an alternate. At his <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods was found guilty of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and 3 charges of gun possession. He was also {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was acquitted}} {{on all four}} counts brought against him. Celestin, who shares a story credit on The Birth of a Nation, was convicted of sexual assault and {{received}} a six-month to one-year prison sentence in 2001, later raised to {{two to four years}} per state sentencing guidelines. Appealing the case on grounds of ineffective counsel at the first trial, Celestin's initial conviction was overturned in 2005 and he was granted a new trial to rehear the charges. Despite the accuser's willingness to testify at a <b>second</b> <b>trial,</b> prosecutors declined because other witnesses had scattered all over the world.|$|E
5|$|Rakočević, Sabolović, Radojčić and {{two other}} former KOS agents were tried in Belgrade in 1993. The five were charged with {{instigation}} of terrorism and other crimes, but all were acquitted. Radojčić was arrested again in Zagreb in late 1993. The <b>second</b> <b>Trial</b> of Radojčić and eight other suspects charged in connection with Operations Labrador and Opera, held in Zagreb, ended with the acquittal of Radojčić and Ratomir Mažibrada, who were in custody, and the convictions of the other defendants who were all tried in absentia.|$|E

5|$|Six months later, a <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> {{took place}} in Orlando for the {{abduction}} and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to the lower court for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, the jury was unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} a life sentence, did not appeal, but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's <b>second</b> <b>trial,</b> Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E

50|$|The {{charges that}} Taylor was an {{accessory}} {{to the murder of}} Berriman were withdrawn; however, he still faced charges of conspiring to rescue Murray from prison, harboring Murray, and of occupying a house frequented by thieves. Taylor was found not guilty of the conspiracy charge. Three trials were held on the charge of harbouring Murray; at the first and <b>second</b> <b>trials,</b> the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict and at the third trial he was acquitted.|$|R
5|$|Allen played less {{frequently}} in 1932, {{even though he}} wanted to secure {{a place in the}} MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932–33 season. He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games, but did not play in the season's only Test match. His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, in which many of those involved were potential selections for the touring team; he took eight wickets in the game, and after the <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> was named in the MCC team. The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed, and there were several who criticised the selectors. He was low in the national batting and bowling averages; critics pointed out his infrequent appearances in first-class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour. Having been named in the team, Allen did not play again in the season. In eight first-class matches, he scored 113 runs at 11.30 and took 25 wickets at 25.36.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's <b>second</b> <b>trial</b> for {{the murder}} of James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his <b>second</b> <b>trial.</b> Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E

The Supreme People's Court reviewed the case and upheld the death sentence, concluded that the first and <b>second</b> <b>trials</b> were without error. 'The motive was extremely despicable, the measures extremely cruel and the consequences extremely serious,' said the SPC. Yao was executed on June 7, 2011.|$|R
