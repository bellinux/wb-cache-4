The Sinulog is a dance ritual of pre-Hispanic {{indigenous}} origin. The dancer moves two steps forward and one <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles the current (sulog) of what was then known Cebu's Pahina River. Thus the name Sinulog.|$|E

In the same year, the first Avante! Festival took place, and the eighth congress was held in Lisbon from 1114 November. The congress mainly stated the need to continue the quest for socialism in Portugal and the need to defend the achievements of the revolution against what the party considered to be a political <b>step</b> <b>backward,</b> led by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the right-wing Centro Democrático Social, who opposed the agrarian reform process.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Japanese magazine S Cawaii, Hamasaki said about the sound of Rock 'n' Roll Circus; [...] "... basically has a feeling of [...] "back-to-basics." [...] A feeling of Ayumi Hamasaki, and less of adventure. More digging down into the foundation. Which isn't to say I'm taking a <b>step</b> <b>backward.</b> It's about expressing my feelings on things I've always liked, but as the person I am now." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode got {{overwhelmingly}} positive reviews. Phoebe Reilly of Vulture wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "the best of the season so far." [...] James Poniewoznik of Time compared the episode and the season at large to the later work of The Beatles; he noted that, [...] "after becoming known for a string of ambitious" [...] entries, they both [...] "decide to take a <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> stylistically". For this reason, he enjoyed [...] "China", and opined that [...] "The China plot, which thankfully focused less on Michael's craziness than his (and his coworkers') relationship with Oscar, demonstrated how well-drawn the show has been even {{when it comes to}} its more peripheral characters." [...] He also said the episode was [...] "vintage Office." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy of Den of Geek stated [...] "After the {{excellent}} pilot episode, 'Day One' {{is both a}} step forward and a <b>step</b> <b>backward.</b> As silly as {{the idea of a}} nymphomaniac extra-terrestrial gas is, the cast throw themselves into it with aplomb, quipping their way to the relatively gripping conclusion." [...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing to get excited about, but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E

500|$|Until the Whole World Hears {{met with}} an overall mixed to {{positive}} response from critics. Several critics regarded the musical aspects of the album as mediocre or sub-par, while others praised the album's lyrical content. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and described it as a [...] "powerful worship experience", but also stated that [...] "some might wonder how a little more variety would sound from such experienced professionals... the band's core sound continues to land in the AC cross hairs". Andrew Greer of CCM Magazine commented that the album [...] "ups the musical ante a bit, with some borderline poetic verses and interesting musical riffs", but also commented that [...] "many of these tracks still suffer from the 'Crowns Cliché Syndrome,' using lyrical Christian-ese to produce trite rhymes that seem hard-pressed to energize a ready-to-worship crowd". Robert Ham of Christianity Today criticized the album for using what he deemed as a repetitive musical formula, but also praised the song [...] "Joyful, Joyful", which he compared to Coldplay's song [...] "Viva la Vida", as well as Megan's Garrett's vocals on [...] "Mercy". He concluded that Until the Whole World Hears [...] "feels like a <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> creatively". At Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings rated the album seven out of ten squares, saying [...] "this album is a little disappointing considering some of the glories that preceeded [...] it." ...|$|E

The Smithsonian's new Secretary, Ira Michael Heyman, openly questioned the need for [...] "ethnic" [...] museums on the National Mall. Many, including Mary Campbell Schmidt, saw this as a <b>step</b> <b>backward,</b> a characterization Smithsonian officials strongly disputed.

2500|$|La mer (1903–1905) essays a more symphonic form, with a finale {{that works}} themes {{from the first}} movement, {{although}} the middle movement, Jeux de vagues, proceeds much less directly and with more variety of colour. The reviews were once again sharply divided. Some critics thought the treatment to be less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works, and even a <b>step</b> <b>backward,</b> with Pierre Lalo complaining [...] "I neither hear, nor see, nor feel the sea." [...] Others extolled its [...] "power and charm", its [...] "extraordinary verve and brilliant fantasy", and its strong colors and definite lines.|$|E

[...] "This kind of design makes Halo 5s campaign ripe for replaying, and well suited for the [...] co-op it's clearly made for", he wrote.|$|E

He says that such e-books present a big <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> with respect to paper books by being less easy to use, copy, lend to others or sell, also mentioning that Amazon e-books cannot be bought anonymously. His short story [...] "The Right to Read" [...] provides a picture of a dystopian future if the right to share books is impeded. He objects to many of the terms within typical end-user license agreements that accompany e-books.|$|E

After four {{consecutive}} 20-plus win seasons at Ohio State, the Cardinal finished under [...]500 {{in her first}} year, with a 13–15 record, and barely improved that the following year, reaching 14–14. [...] By her third year, when she was playing her own recruits, and the team was now following her coaching philosophy, the record jumped to 27–5. Stanford did not earn a [...] bid to the NCAA tournament in either of her first two years, and had not attended since 1982, but earned a bid in 1988, reaching the Sweet Sixteen, and has earned {{an invitation to the}} tournament in every subsequent year.|$|E
2500|$|Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne (23 April 17563 June 1819), {{also known}} as Jean Nicolas, was a French {{personality}} of the Revolutionary period. Though {{not one of the}} most well known figures of the French Revolution, Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne was an instrumental figure of the period known as the Reign of Terror. Billaud-Varenne climbed his way up the ladder of power during the period of The Terror, becoming one of the most militant members of the Committee of Public Safety. He was recognized and worked with French Revolution figures Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre, and is often considered one of the key architects of the period known as The Terror.

2500|$|The {{influx of}} missionaries {{over the past}} several years has led to {{pressure}} by groups in Russia, specifically nationalists and the Russian Orthodox Church, to limit the activities of these [...] "nontraditional" [...] religious groups. In response, the Duma passed a new, restrictive, and potentially discriminatory law in October 1997. The law is very complex, with many ambiguous and contradictory provisions. The law's most controversial provisions separates religious [...] "groups" [...] and [...] "organizations" [...] and introduces a 15-year rule, which allows groups that have existed for 15 years or longer to obtain accredited status. According to Russian priest and dissident Gleb Yakunin, new religion law [...] "heavily favors the Russian Orthodox Church at the expense of all other religions, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.", and it is [...] "a <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> in Russia's process of democratization".|$|E
2500|$|More recent reviews have {{generally}} found fault with Little Games. AllMusic's Bruce Eder gave it {{three out of}} five stars and wrote [...] "If almost any group other than the Yardbirds had released Little Games, it {{would be considered a}} flawed but prime late-'60s psychedelic/hard rock artifact instead of a serious <b>step</b> <b>backward,</b> and even a disappointment". An AllMusic review by Dave Thompson of the expanded edition Little Games Sessions & More began [...] "the day producer Mickie Most moved in on the Yardbirds was the day the Yardbirds' own values moved out. The union was a lousy idea from the start". The New Rolling Stone Album Guide writer also gave the album three out of five stars, calling it [...] "a disastrous attempt at conventional pop". The Yardbirds themselves were just as critical – Page reportedly regarded Little Games as [...] "horrible" [...] and Jim McCarty described Mickie Most as [...] "a protagonist in our downfall".|$|E
2500|$|Here he, {{like many}} other writers, notes the {{elements}} of musical form (then often described as [...] "closed forms") which characterize the opera and make it appear {{to be something of}} a return to the language of earlier times, [...] "the veritable apotheosis of bel canto with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range," [...] notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: [...] "the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do," [...] he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on Il trovatore is that [...] "it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a <b>step</b> <b>backward</b> after Rigoletto".|$|E
