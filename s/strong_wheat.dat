When inquired about the wheat industry’s failure to mature, the interviewees did not mention lack of government intervention. Of the three main reasons cited, one was precisely excessive intervention {{in other areas of the}} economy, such as transportation and interstate taxes.

The wheat flour enriched with gluten protein obtained via the shear-induced separation process (SCG) showed comparable to improved gluten functionality relative to commercial available vital wheat gluten protein (CVWG).

50|$|While rye {{and wheat}} are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as triticale), their biochemistries differ {{enough that they}} affect the {{breadmaking}} process. The key issue is differing amylases, the enzyme which breaks starch down into sugar. While wheat amylases are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect <b>stronger</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (secalin) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including rye starch and pentosans. As a result, amylases in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising.|$|R

40|$|Bakery {{products}} with desirable texture possess the proper balance between elasticity and viscosity. These two rheological properties are generally contributed by the polymeric glutens formed by glutenins and gliadins {{with the addition}} of water. However, the native glutenins and gliadins in wheat flour might not possess the chemistry that could contribute to the desirable rheological properties. Therefore, an additive should be used to modify the flour. In this study, addition of L-cysteine, a reducing agent, caused flour dough to be less elastic or more extensible. The extent of this effect is more profound in the <b>strong</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars (Hollis (HRS), Norpro (HRS) and Trego (HW)) than in weaker wheat cultivar (Stephens (SW)) and commercial bread flour.

Rheological tests are usually performed to predict breadmaking potential. The aim here was to investigate the ability of ultrasound to discriminate wheat doughs based on breadmaking qualities. The ultimate goal is the development of an on-line quality control system currently unavailable in the baked goods industry, rendering this work innovative. Samples were prepared from a <b>strong</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, with one control sample and one added with inulin and distilled monoglycerides, producing doughs of distinct breadmaking quality. Doughs were subjected to density determination, elongation tests, and ultrasound analysis. The ultrasound tests were performed in the frequency range of 300 kHz- 6 MHz. Ultrasonic phase velocity increased with increasing frequency to about 2 MHz, becoming constant and then decreasing from 3 MHz for the control sample. Distinct differences in attenuation coefficient between the fibre-enriched and control doughs were observed.

30|$|Introduction of the PVP Law was {{the main}} driving force behind spurring private {{investment}} in wheat R&D and establishment of a <b>strong</b> <b>wheat</b> breeding private sector. National private breeding companies emerged as researchers were leaving the public sector to {{set up their own}} companies. For instance, the two biggest private companies in Brazil, OR Seeds and Biotrigo, were founded by ex-EMBRAPA researchers who left the public sector once the market was liberalized: one interviewee estimates that together OR Seeds and Biotrigo account for up to 70  % of the seed market now. While ex-public sector researchers took advantage of their vast experience in wheat to start their own breeding programs, multinational corporations have not formally entered the Brazilian wheat market, although interviewees indicated that it is known that Nidera, Syngenta, Bayer, and Dow work with wheat improvement. According to one interviewee, two main reasons explain the absence of major multinationals in the wheat market. The first is that the area devoted to wheat is still too small to spark the interest of multinationals. Royalties are collected on around 5.8 million bushels of wheat per year, while another 2.5 million are sold in the brown bagged market. This amounts to about US$ 4.4 million in royalties – a small amount in comparison to major crop markets, such as soybean and corn. The second reason is that Brazilian soil, which is rich in aluminum, and the country’s climatic conditions make it difficult for multinationals to use the seeds developed elsewhere in Brazil. These peculiarities act as a barrier to multinational companies, restricting the Brazilian wheat market mainly to domestic companies, such as Biotrigo, OR Seeds, COODETEC, and EMBRAPA.|$|E

40|$|Plantain (Banana-Musa AAB) is {{a widely}} growing but commercially underexploited {{tropical}} fruit. This study demonstrates the processing of plantain to flour and extends its use and convenience as a constituent of bread, cake and biscuit. Plantain was peeled, dried and milled to produce flour. Proximate analysis was carried out on the flour to determine the food composition. Drying at temperatures below 70 ºC produced light coloured plantain flour. Experiments were carried out to determine the mechanism of drying, the heat and mass transfer coefficients, effect of air velocity, temperature and cube size on the rate of drying of plantain cubes. The drying was diffusion controlled. Pilot scale drying of plantain cubes in a cabinet dryer showed no significant increase of drying rate above 70 ºC. In the temperature range found most suitable for plantain drying (ie 60 to 70 ºC) the total drying time was adequately predicted using a modified equation based on Fick's Law provided the cube temperature was taken to be about 5 ºC below the actual drying air temperature. Studies of baking properties of plantain flour revealed that plantain flour can be substituted for <b>strong</b> <b>wheat</b> flour up to 15 % for bread making and up to 50 % for madeira cake. A shortcake biscuit was produced using 100 % plantain flour and test-marketed. Detailed economic studies showed that the production of plantain fruit and its processing into flour would be economically viable in Nigeria when the flour is sold at the wholesale price of NO. 65 per kilogram provided a minimum sale of 25 % plantain suckers. There is need for government subsidy if plantain flour is to compete with imported wheat flour.

40|$|The only {{treatment}} for coeliac disease, a common autoimmune disorder, is life-long {{adherence to a}} gluten-free diet. However, the replacement of wheat gluten, a key structural and functional component in bread, poses a major technological challenge for food scientists. The use of non-wheat cereal proteins, as alternatives to gluten, shows much promise in gluten-free bread making. Literature has shown that when zein, the maize prolamin protein, is subjected to wet heat above its glass transition temperature (Tg), the protein becomes viscoelastic, rubbery and dough-like. Gluten-like fibrils are visible, which form complex protein networks {{similar to those found}} in wheat dough. The resulting zein dough has viscoelastic characteristics and can be successfully used with hydrocolloids to produce gluten-free bread. This project examined the influence of wet heat treatment and dilute organic acids (lactic acid and acetic acid) on the dough-making quality of non-wheat cereal proteins, such as kafirin and zein. Zein was the only non-wheat cereal protein to show any physical change when it was subjected to wet heat treatments, forming a dough-like substance. Acidification of the zein dough prepared at 40 °C with concentrations of 0. 7, 1. 3 and 5. 4 % (v/v) organic acid in distilled water solutions, showed that the higher the concentration of acid used, the greater its effect on the dough's rheological properties. Tensile tests using a Keifer rig on zein dough showed that as the concentration of organic acid was increased from 0. 7 to 1. 3 and to 5. 4 % (v/v) the dough become softer and increasingly more extensible. The dough also exhibited less resistance to extension and reduced elasticity. CLSM revealed that the zein doughs contained a protein network, made up of fine protein fibrils, which became smoother and more homogenous as the concentration of acid was increased. Although SDS-PAGE revealed that no oligomerization took place with acid addition, iv FTIR showed that zein dough prepared with distilled water at 40 °C had elevated levels of β-sheets. When organic acids were added in increasing levels, corresponding increases in the quantities of α-helices in the protein were observed. Alveography showed that zein-based doughs prepared with dilute organic acids retained gases well and that the concentration of dilute organic acids influenced dough distensibility (biaxial extensibility) and stability (the ability of the dough to retain gas). Low concentration of acids (0. 7 and 1. 3 %) increased dough stability to levels similar to that of <b>strong</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, 103 mm H 2 O, but higher concentrations of acids (5. 4 %) led to a marked reduction in dough stability. Thus, by increasing zein dough functionality to such an extent, the apparent usefulness of the doughs and their ability to retain gases produced during fermentation is reduced. Simple distensibility tests on zein doughs showed that added organic acids promoted ‘clumping’ of the fine protein fibrils in the dough network into pronounced fibres. This would account for the decreased dough stability when high levels (5. 4 %) of organic acids were used. Baking trials with zein doughs were not successful as adequate leavening was impossible without an acid-tolerant leavening agent. It is believed that dilute organic acids influence the rheological properties of zein dough by creating a positively charged environment, in which the protein is partially solubilized. The higher the level of organic acid used, the greater the positive net charge and the more pronounced the effect on the protein network structure. Organic acids could also improve fluidity of the zein dough by acting as plasticizers. From this work {{it can be seen that}} although a protein network is present in all zein-based doughs, the ability of this network to retain gases is dependant on the level of organic acids present. The functional properties of zein-doughs made with low levels of organic acids (0. 7 and 1. 3 %) shows potential in the production of gluten-free bread for individuals suffering from coeliac disease.

In traditional and common methods of dough preparation, poor to <b>strong</b> <b>wheats</b> can’t be used for baking good bread while application of some methods of dough preparation can solve this problem. In the present study, methods of liquid sourdough whit different concentrations of yeast and different times of fermentation (1, 3 and 12 hours) were used for preparation of Iranian Lavash bread. In order to investigate the effects of studied methods on produced Iranian Lavash bread quality, some parameters such as pH, acidity, dough yield, bread yield, dough weight loss during fermentation, bread weight loss and sensory properties were evaluated. Results showed that all methods of liquid sourdough led to more dough and bread yields compared with control treatments. Also, analysis of variance of sensory properties of produced breads showed that there was a significant difference between tested treatments (p < 0. 01). Finally in order to determine the effects of tested treatments on sensory properties of produced breads, Dunca s multiple range test was used and it was showed that breads prepared by short time method of liquid sourdough (1 hour fermentation) had better sensory properties and end quality compared with other breads...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that {{macronutrient}} concentration in wheat is crucial for micronutrient balance, transport and bioavailability and their correlation should be considered. In our study, grain zinc was positively correlated with phosphorus. Co-localization of QTLs for grain Zn content with the QTLs for P content can be responsible for directing the positive association and will assist maintaining the wheat grain Zn and Phosphorus content simultaneously (Shi et al. 2008). Due to the accumulation of a major part of total P in the form of phytic acid, consequently phytate, Zn bioavailability is supposed to be affected (Stangoulis et al. 2007). Accumulation of grain Zn in aleurone layer and embryo, where phytate resides seems to contribute towards <b>strong</b> correlation between <b>wheat</b> grain Zn and Phosphorus content.

The addition of chromosome 2 of barley to wheat (Chinese Spring addition line 2 H) resulted in an apparent increase in the molecular weight of the a-amylase produced during germination. This was probably due to the formation of a complex between the inhibitor encoded by the asi gene on chromosome 2 of barley and wheat a-amylase 2.

We used factorial combinations of two photoperiods (16 H, 12 H) and three temperature levels (11, 18 and 25 °C) to study the temperature responses of 19 wheat cultivars with established genetic relationships. Temperature produced more significant effects on plant development than photoperiod, with <b>strong</b> genotypic components. <b>Wheat</b> genotypes with PPD‐D 1 photoperiod sensitive allele were sensitive to temperature; their development was delayed by higher temperature, which intensified under non‐inductive conditions.

Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the zearalenone concentration in wheat flour. Materials and Methods: After extraction of zearalenone from wheat flour samples with extraction solvent acetonitrile - water, toxin purification step was conducted using immunoaffinity columns. Samples were analyzed by HPLC using C 18 column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm ID, 5 µm) with a fluorescence detector, mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (3 : 2 v/v) at flow rate of 1 ml/min. Results: Results of the study showed that the level of found zearalenone in 5 % of the samples was higher than maximum level of 200 μg/kg. The mean concentration of zearalenone in samples was 54 µg/kg. LOD and LOQ of this method were 3. 5 and 10 ng/g respectively.
