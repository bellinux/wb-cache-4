5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the <b>slack</b> on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of <b>slack.</b>|$|E

40|$|Employees {{spend time}} during work hours on non – work related {{activities}} including visiting e - commerce Websites, managing personal email accounts, {{and engaging in}} e - banking. These types of actions in the workplace are known as cyber <b>slacking.</b> Cyber <b>slacking</b> affects employees’ productivity, presents legal concerns, and undermines {{the security of the}} employer’s network. This research study addressed the problem of cyber <b>slacking</b> in the public sector, by assessing the ethical severity of cyber <b>slacking</b> activities, as well as how employees perceived that the frequency of such activities occurred by their co - workers. Participants from public sector agencies were asked to report about their amount of time spent and frequency of cyber <b>slacking,</b> what they report about their co - workers’ amount of time spent and frequency of cyber <b>slacking,</b> as well as their perceived ethical severity of cyber <b>slacking</b> in the workplace. Comparisons of the measures were also conducted. Results from 183 participants indicate that employees report their co – workers to engage in cyber <b>slacking</b> significantly higher than what they reported about themselves, while ethical severity of cyber <b>slacking</b> was not considered to be high. Discussions and implications for future research are provided...|$|R
5|$|The actual {{process of}} {{analysis}} can vary between investigations, but common methodologies include conducting keyword searches across the digital media (within files {{as well as}} unallocated and <b>slack</b> space), recovering deleted files and extraction of registry information (for example to list user accounts, or attached USB devices).|$|E
5|$|To further aid {{athletes in}} gliding as aerodynamically as possible, they wear a {{one-piece}} fabric bodysuit {{more similar to}} a wingsuit than a ski suit. It is composed of five layers and is both loose-fitting and porous enough to allow up to 52litres of air to enter and 40litres to pass through. This generates yet more lift, but the amount of <b>slack</b> is stringently regulated by the FIS so as to not allow for excessive bagginess and thereby reducing its wingsuit-, sail- or parachute-like properties. In the early 2000s, bodysuits had reached exceptionally baggy proportions, resulting in humorous comparisons to flying squirrels. A ban on these baggy suits came into effect soon after, and today the level of <b>slack</b> for bodysuits is measured by FIS scrutineers before and after each jump: if the amount is exceeded, that athlete is disqualified due to an 'equipment violation'.|$|E

5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of <b>slack</b> activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
50|$|Young dunes {{are called}} yellow dunes and dunes which have high humus content are called grey dunes. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the <b>slacks,</b> and the <b>slacks</b> {{may be much}} more {{developed}} than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the <b>slacks</b> that more rare species are developed {{and there is a}} tendency for the dune <b>slacks</b> soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. These plants would include: creeping willow, cotton grass, yellow iris, reeds, and rushes. As for the species, there is a tendency for natterjack toads to breed here.|$|R

He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss, but his tendency to take it easy when business was <b>slack</b> resulted in his termination. By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin’ Sumpthin’, the Majority, and JR Flood. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the <b>slack</b> summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and {{ceased to be a}} major factor in the orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett.

Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the <b>slack</b> waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E
