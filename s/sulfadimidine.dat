5000|$|Since {{the recent}} {{recognition}} of M. catarrhalis {{as an important}} pathogenic microbe, development of a possible antibiotic has been ongoing. A fraction of M. catarrhalis strains seemed to be resistant to ampicillin, which makes ampicillin and amoxicillin inappropriate choices of antibiotic against it. [...] Although all strains of M. catarrhalis were susceptible to cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, <b>sulfadimidine,</b> and tetracycline, they were also resistant to trimethoprim. [...] One {{of the reasons for}} the resistance of M. catarrhalis to ampicillin and trimethoprim is because of the beta-lactamase production, which allows resistance to ampicillin. [...] Also, the resistance of M. catarrhalis to other antibiotics may be attributed to beta-lactamase, as well, because the use of these antibiotics has triggered an increase in development of beta-lactamase, which resists antibiotics.|$|E

The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} residue concentrations of <b>sulfadimidine</b> in whole eggs of laying hens during and after its oral administration up to the 15 th day of the withdrawal period. The <b>sulfadimidine</b> residues were determined by a gradient high-performance liquid chromatography system with a photo-diode array detector at 275 nm. Our results indicate that the oral administration of <b>sulfadimidine</b> to laying hens produced a rapid and sustained increase in <b>sulfadimidine</b> residues in their eggs. The highest residue concentrations of <b>sulfadimidine</b> were found on the 6 th day of administration. After withdrawal, the residues declined rapidly, but they were still detectable on the 10 th day of the withdrawal period. On day 11, the residues were below the established MRL (0. 1 mg kg- 1).

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{applications}} {{which require}} {{knowledge of the}} solubility of a crystalline compound in an amorphous matrix are abundant in the literature. Several methods that allow the determination of such data have been reported, but so far have only been applicable to amorphous polymers above the glass transition of the resulting composites. The current work presents, for the first time, a reliable method for {{the determination of the}} solubility of crystalline pharmaceutical compounds in high and low molecular weight amorphous matrices at the glass transition and at room temperature (i. e. below the glass transition temperature), respectively. The solubilities of mannitol and indomethacin in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) K 15 and PVP K 25, respectively were measured at different temperatures. Mixtures of undissolved crystalline solute and saturated amorphous phase were obtained by annealing at a given temperature. The solubility at this temperature was then obtained by measuring the melting enthalpy of the crystalline phase, plotting it as a function of composition and extrapolating to zero enthalpy. This new method yielded results in accordance with the predictions reported in the literature. The method was also adapted for the measurement of the solubility of crystalline low molecular weight excipients in amorphous active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The solubility of mannitol, glutaric acid and adipic acid in both indomethacin and <b>sulfadimidine</b> was experimentally determined and successfully compared with the difference between their respective calculated Hildebrand solubility parameters. As expected from the calculations, the dicarboxylic acids exhibited a high solubility in both amorphous indomethacin and <b>sulfadimidine,</b> whereas mannitol was almost insoluble in the same amorphous phases at room temperature.

The method {{is based on the}} formation of violet colored azo product by the diazotization of sulfonamides, viz. sulfathiazole (SFT), sulfadiazine (SFD), sulfacetamide (SFA), sulfamethoxazole (SFMx), sulfamerazine (SFMr), sulfaguanidine (SFG) and <b>sulfadimidine</b> (SFDd) followed by a coupling reaction with iminodibenzyl in alcohol medium. Absorbance of the resulting violet azo product is measured at 570 - 580 nm and is stable for 24 h at 27 degreesC. Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration range of 0. 05 - 6. 0 mug ml(- 1) at the wavelength of maximum absorption, The method is successfully employed for the determination of sulfonamides in various pharmaceutical preparations and common excipients used as additives in pharmaceuticals do not interfere in the proposed method. The method offers the advantages of simplicity, rapidity and sensitivity without the need for extraction or heating. A reaction mechanism is proposed for the formation of the violet azo product.

40|$|THESIS 8593 The {{focus of}} the {{research}} presented in this thesis was on the potential application of a novel spray drying method to produce excipient-free nanoporous microparticles (NPMPs) of bioactive drug compounds and co-spray dried drug-excipient systems by a one-step spray drying technique. The potential of these NPMPs for inclusion in drug delivery systems, with particular emphasis on dry powder formulations for pulmonary drug delivery, was explored. A range of ten sulfa compounds: sulfadiazine, <b>sulfadimidine,</b> sulfadimethoxine, sulfadoxin, sulfaguanidine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethizole, sulfamethoxazole, sulfanilamide and sulfathiazole, as well as three steroid drugs: betamethasone base, prednisolone and prednisone and one anti-asthmatic drug, sodium cromoglicate, were selected for analysis. In all cases the physicochemical characteristics of the unprocessed, spray dried non-porous and porous powders were studied, which included amorphous/crystalline nature, thermal behaviour, polymorphic form and residual solvent content. A systemic evaluation of the micromeritic properties of the powders was undertaken and included particle size, particle morphology, powder density, specific surface area and flowability. The aerodynamic assessment of fme particles was evaluated using the Andersen cascade impactor. Solid-state stability studies of NPMPs were undertaken...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sulfadimidine</b> (SM 2) is {{a highly}} toxic and {{ubiquitous}} pollutant which requires rapid, sensitive and portable detection method for environmental and food monitoring. Herein, the use {{for the detection of}} SM 2 of a portable optofluidics-based biosensing platform, which was used for the accurate detection of bisphenol A, atrazine and melamine, is reported for the first time. The proposed compact biosensing system combines the advantages of an evanescent wave immunosensor and microfluidic technology. Through the indirect competitive immunoassay, the detection limit of the proposed optofluidics-based biosensing platform for SM 2 reaches 0. 05 μg·L− 1 at the concentration of Cy 5. 5 -labeled antibody of 0. 1 μg·mL− 1. Linearity is obtained over a dynamic range from 0. 17 μg·L− 1 to 10. 73 μg·L− 1. The surface of the fiber probe can be regenerated more than 300 times by means of 0. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (pH = 1. 9) washes without losing sensitivity. This method, featuring high sensitivity, portability and acceptable reproducibility shows potential in the detection of SM 2 in real milk and other dairy products...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of crystal habit on the dissolution and in vitro antibacterial and anitiprotozoal activity of sulfadimidine: 4 -aminosalicylic acid cocrystals. Methods: Cocrystals were produced via milling or solvent mediated processes. In vitro dissolution {{was carried out in}} the flow-through apparatus, with shadowgraph imaging and mechanistic mathematical models used to observe and simulate particle dissolution. In vitro activity was tested using agar diffusion assays. Results: Cocrystallisation via milling produced small polyhedral crystals with antimicrobial activity significantly higher than <b>sulfadimidine</b> alone, consistent with a fast dissolution rate which was matched only by cocrystals which were milled following solvent evaporation. Cocrystallisation by solvent evaporation (ethanol, acetone) or spray drying produced flattened, plate-like or quasi-spherical cocrystals, respectively, with more hydrophobic surfaces and greater tendency to form aggregates in aqueous media, limiting both the dissolution rate and in vitro activity. Deviation from predicted dissolution profiles was attributable to aggregation behaviour, supported by observations from shadowgraph imaging. Conclusions: Aggregation behaviour during dissolution of cocrystals with different habits affected the dissolution rate, consistent with in vitro activity. Combining mechanistic models with shadowgraph imaging is a valuable approach for dissolution process analysis...|$|E
