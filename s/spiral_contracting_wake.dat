40|$|A {{method of}} calculating the {{performance}} of a helicopter rotor in the hover is presented. The method combines the downwash velocity distribution induced by a <b>contracting</b> <b>spiral</b> vortex <b>wake</b> with strip element-momentum theory. The shape of the wake takes a prescribed geometry developed from an extensive series of model tests made in the USA. The predicted thrust and power is in good agreement with measurements made on model and full scale rotors provided that the aerofoil data is sufficiently well defined. The calculated load distribution along the blade is also compared with measurements made on Wessex helicopters. The load distribution is shown to be very sensitive to a light wind but theory compares well with experiment when this effect is eliminated. The hover performance predicted using only the wake induced velocity distribution is also discussed. The rotor performance is shown to be too sensitive to the geometry of the wake for the method {{to be used as a}} design tool with confidence, and the mathematical representation of the wake needs improving...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} London Market Excess of Loss Spiral (“LMX Spiral”), a {{phenomenon}} based upon {{excess of loss}} reinsurance contracts that developed within the London reinsurance market of the 1980 s. The unwinding of the LMX Spiral was {{a key factor in}} the crisis the Lloyd’s insurance market had to face in the early 1990 s. However, whilst the crisis resulted in a wave of litigation in the English courts, there is no legal appraisal of the additional element of risk brought by the LMX Spiral itself. The case law instead focuses on the duties of the underwriters and various agents that fuelled its development. This situation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. Firstly, reinsurance spirals are a potential side-effect of XL reinsurance markets and therefore other spirals may develop in the future. Secondly, this thesis shows that once a reinsurance spiral reaches a certain point, it becomes unsustainable, generating instability within the relevant reinsurance market. This thesis provides a detailed legal appraisal of reinsurance spirals and a new analysis of excess of loss reinsurance contracts. The first part sets out the relevant legal principles and describes the LMX Spiral and its impact; listing, for the first time, the “Spiral Effects” identified through reports and actuarial models. The second part reviews the case law and assesses the legal nature of the excess of loss “Spiral Contracts” at the core of any reinsurance spiral, concluding that the Spiral Effects can distort the <b>Spiral</b> <b>Contracts</b> {{to the point where they}} become simple contracts of indemnity. The third part explores the nature of excess of loss reinsurance in light of the review of the <b>Spiral</b> <b>Contracts,</b> submitting that excess of loss reinsurance contracts cover both the liability of the reinsured and the relevant insured peril...|$|R

40|$|The wake {{characteristics}} of a rotorcraft {{are affected by the}} proximity of a rotor to the ground surface, especially during hover. Ground effect is encountered when the rotor disk is within a distance of a few rotor radii above the ground surface and results in an increase in thrust for a given power relative to that same power condition with the rotor out of ground effect. Although this phenomenon has been highly documented and observed {{since the beginning of the}} helicopter age, there is still a relatively little amount of flow-field data existing to help understand its features. Joint Army and NASA testing was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center using a powered rotorcraft model in hover at various rotor heights and thrust conditions in order to contribute to the complete outwash data set. The measured data included outwash velocities and directions, rotor loads, fuselage loads, and ground pressures. The researchers observed a linear relationship between rotor height and percent download on the fuselage, peak mean outwash velocities occurring at radial stations between 1. 7 and 1. 8 r/R regardless of rotor height, and the measurement azimuthal dependence of the outwash profile for a model incorporating a fuselage.

40|$|AbstractStick-slip {{vibration}} presents one of {{the major}} causes of drilling problems, such as premature tool failures, low drilling efficiency and poor wellbore quality. The objective of this work is to investigate the influences of rotary table speed (RTS) on stick-slip phenomenon of the drilling system. In this study, the drilling system is treated as a lumped torsional pendulum model of which the bit/rock interaction is regarded as Coulomb friction. By analyzing cases with different RTS, two types of vibrations on the bit are found: stick-slip vibration and uniform motion. With an increase in the RTS, the stick-slip vibration on the drill bit disappears once the RTS arrives at its critical value. For the cases that stick-slip vibrations occur, the phase trajectories converge toward a limit cycle. For the cases that stick-slip vibration does not appear, the drill bit tends to stabilize at a uniform motion and the phase trajectories correspond to <b>contracting</b> <b>spirals</b> observed in the phase plane...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} optimal aerodynamic performance {{and design of}} conventional and coaxial helicopters in hover and forward flight using conventional and higher harmonic blade pitch control. First, we describe a method for determining the blade geometry, azimuthal blade pitch inputs, optimal shaft angle (rotor angle of attack), and division of propulsive and lifting forces among the components that minimize the total power for a given forward flight condition. The optimal design problem is cast as a variational statement that is discretized using a vortex lattice wake to model inviscid forces, combined with two-dimensional drag polars to model profile losses. The resulting nonlinear constrained optimization problem is solved via Newton iteration. We investigate the optimal design of a compound vehicle in forward flight comprised of a coaxial rotor system, a propeller, and optionally, a fixed wing. We show that higher harmonic control substantially reduces required power, and that both rotor and propeller efficiencies {{play an important role}} in determining the optimal shaft angle, which in turn affects the optimal design of each component. Second, we present a variational approach for determining the optimal (minimum power) torque-balanced coaxial hovering rotor using Blade Element Momentum Theory including swirl. We show that the optimal hovering coaxial rotor generates only a small percentage of its total thrust on the portion of the lower rotor operating in the upper rotor's <b>contracted</b> <b>wake,</b> resulting in an optimal design with very different upper and lower rotor twist and chord distributions. We also show that the swirl component of induced velocity has a relatively small effect on rotor performance at the disk loadings typical of helicopter rotors. Third, we describe a more refined model of the wake of a hovering conventional or coaxial rotor. We approximate the rotor or coaxial rotors as actuator disks (though not necessarily uniformly loaded) and the <b>wake</b> as <b>contracting</b> cylindrical vortex sheets that we represent as discrete vortex rings. We assume the system is axisymmetric and steady in time, and solve for the wake position that results in all vortex sheets being aligned with the streamlines of the flow field via Newton iteration. We show that the singularity that occurs where the vortex sheet terminates at the edge of the actuator disk is resolved through the formation of a 45 degree logarithmic spiral in hover, which results in a non-uniform inflow, particularly near the edge of the disk where the flow is entirely reversed, as originally hypothesized by previous authors. We also quantify the mutual interference of coaxial actuator disks of various axial spacing. Finally, we combine our forward flight optimization procedure and the Blade Element Momentum Theory hover optimization to form a variational approach to the multipoint aerodynamic design optimization of conventional and coaxial helicopter rotors. The resulting nonlinear constrained optimization problem may be used to map the Pareto frontier, i. e., the set of rotor designs for which it is not possible to improve upon the performance in one flight condition without degrading performance in the other. We show that for both conventional and coaxial rotors analyzed in hover and high speed flight, a substantial tradeoff in performance must be made between the two flight conditions. Finally, computational results demonstrate that higher harmonic control is able to improve the Pareto efficiency for both conventional and coaxial rotors. Dissertatio...|$|R

Potential measurements indicate that the sheath region around the negatively biased sphere <b>contracts</b> as the <b>wake</b> region establishes itself.

40|$|Despite its {{considerable}} {{use as a}} psychophysical tool, {{relatively little}} {{attention has been paid to}} factors that might influence the interocular transfer of the motion aftereffect. The present thesis reports five experiments that examined the role of eye-movements and their interaction with surround contours in the generation and interocular transfer of the motion aftereffect. Experiment 1 compared the amount of transfer of three different aftereffects when the non-adapted eye viewed a dark occluder or an equiluminant occluder. Equiluminant occlusion enhanced interocular transfer of the motion aftereffect but no the other two aftereffects. Experiment 2 showed a similar enhancement of interocular transfer for equiluminant occlusion conditions for motion aftereffects to rotating spokes, but not for aftereffects to rotating <b>spirals</b> nor <b>contracting</b> circles.;During adaptation to certaipes of motion displays, the adapting eye has a tendency to track the display. It was proposed that conjugate tracking generated aftereffects in the surrounding stationary contours in the non-adapted eye viewing the equiluminant occlusion display that resulted in an augmentation of the transfer of treffect. This hypothesis was supported by the results of Experiment 3, in which a ganzfeld was used to occlude the non-adapted eye, eliminating all contour information for that eye. No augmentation of interocular transfer was found following equiluminant ganzfeld occlusion of the non-e. Experiment 4 further supported the hypothesis by demonstrating that augmenting surround contour information red in abnormally high amounts of interocular transfer.;This Experiment also demonstrated that the surround contour-enhanced aftereffects were largely monocular in nature. Experiment 5 replicated these findings, but reduced the augmentation of the transferred aftereffect when subjects viewed a stationary fixation point during adaptation.;The final Experiment examined an aftereffect to pursuit eye-movements in which no stationary contour information was present. While motion aftereffects and their interocular transfer could be demonstrated after large and fast visual pursuit, no such aftereffects were shown for small, slow pursuit distances. These results suggest that the motion aftereffect resulting from pursuit eye-movements is likely to be influential in accounting for the enhancement the aftereffects demonstrated in the earlier experiments.;The augmentation of the motion aftereffect under equiluminant on conditions then, is the result of an aftereffect to stationary surround contours being generated in the 2 ̆ 2 non-adapted 2 ̆ 2 eye. This augments the transferred aftereffect. The results of the present thesis suggest that the motion aftereffect is particularly responsive to relative motion and may be part of the system responsible for detecting object motion...|$|R

Radioligand binding studies using rabbit cerebral membranes showed that both doxazosin and prazosin were roughly equipotent at displacing [3 H]-prazosin from specific binding sites. However, the lower pA 2 value for doxazosin at alpha 1 -adrenoceptors in isolated thoracic aorta preparations suggests a lower potency compared to prazosin. The dose-related pressor effects of intravenous phenylephrine {{were used to}} assess vascular alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism in vivo. There was a close agreement between alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist potency and maximum hypotensive effects with both doxazosin and prazosin. The alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist effects of doxazosin were more prolonged than those of prazosin. Studies using either radioligand binding or pressor responses to B-HT 920 showed that doxazosin did not show any significant affinity for the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor. Similarly, no direct vasodilator effects were observed either in animals administered angiotensin II or in isolated thoracic aorta <b>spiral</b> strip preparations <b>contracted</b> with potassium. Doxazosin has a longer terminal elimination half-life than prazosin. The pharmacokinetics of doxazosin were linear over the dose range examined. Following pharmacological 'autonomic blockade' and treatment with prazosin, doxazosin did not cause any further fall in blood pressure. These observations suggest that doxazosin, like prazosin, appears to exert its hypotensive action through alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism. The prolonged fall in blood pressure and well sustained alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism after doxazosin raise the possibility of an active metabolite which also has alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blocking properties...|$|R

Abstract for part I A {{study of the}} behaviour of an inviscid, swirling fluid is performed. This flow can be described by the Squire-Long equation if the constraints of time-independence and axisymmetry are invoked. The particular case of flow through a diverging pipe is selected and a study is conducted to determine over what range of parameters (both pipe inlet conditions and geometry) does a (unique) solution exist. The work is performed {{with a view to}} understanding how the phenomenon of vortex breakdown develops. Experiments and previous numerical studies have indicated that the flow is sensitive to boundary conditions particularly at the pipe inlet. A "quasi-cylindrical" simplification of the Squire-Long equation is compared with the more complete model and shown to be able to account for most of its behaviour. An advantage of this latter representation is the relatively undetailed description of the flow geometry it requires in order to calculate a solution. "Criticality" or the ability of small disturbances to propagate upstream is related to results of the quasi-cylindrical and axisymmetric flow models. This leads to an examination of claims made by researchers such as Benjamin and Hall concerning the interrelationship between "failure" of the quasi-cylindrical model and the occurrence of a "critical" flow state.

40|$|NOTE: Text {{of symbols}} not renderable in plain ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. This report {{is a study}} of the performance requirements necessary to launch a rocket propelled missile into a circular orbit about the earth. Various trajectories by which a missile can be launched into such an orbit are investigated and an estimation is made of the minimum propellant-gross weight ratio required to reach stable orbital conditions at various altitudes. The velocity of a projectile traveling about the earth in a circular orbit must be such that its weight is exactly balanced by the centrifugal force acting upon it. The expression for the required velocity, relative to a non-rotating earth, can be derived from the following figure. [ [...] . ]. By the law of Conservation of Energy, such an orbit, once obtained, must remain circular unless influenced by additional forces. The action of atmospheric drag would be to cause a continual loss of energy; this loss would be made up at the expense of potential energy, causing the projectile to move in toward the earth in a <b>contracting</b> <b>spiral.</b> It can be shown (of. ref. 2) that, for altitudes greater than one hundred and twenty miles, the rate of this contraction is negligible. The practical applications of an orbiting missile are numerous. A few are as follows: a) A radio relay station for television and other high frequency communication. b) To carry instruments for continuous measurement of upper atmospheric phenomena. c) A military weapon of unlimited range, provided it can be brought back to earth at will. The possibility of launching a vehicle into a circular orbit by means of rocket propulsion depends primarily upon the conditions of propellant consumption which are required to reach a stable orbital velocity. These conditions are: a) Propellant characteristics (in particular, specific impulse). b) Rate of propellant consumption. c) Propellant-gross weight ratio. The velocity necessary for a circular orbit is in the neighborhood of 26, 000 ft/sec. For an unboosted rocket with an uniform burning rate the terminal velocity (neglecting drag and gravity forces) is given by [ [...] . ] where [ [...] . ] is assumed constant. If we take [ [...] . ] to be equal to 400 sec., a representative value for a rocket fuel consisting of oxygen and hydrogen, the value of [ [...] . ], the propellant-gross weight ratio, corresponding to [ [...] . ] = 26, 000 ft/sec., is [ [...] . ]=. 0. 867. Thus, even with the most powerful rocket fuel, the required propellant gross weight ratio is very high, and the importance of a more careful estimation of this ratio is evident. A comprehensive analysis of the important factors which influence the performance of an orbiting rocket has been made by W. Z. Chien of GALCIT. In this analysis, Dr. Chien considered a vertical trajectory as a first approximation in obtaining estimates of the altitude of the circular orbit and of the propellant-gross weight ratio required (cf. ref. 2). This report extends the considerations of Chien's work to oblique trajectories of various types, all of which terminate at the end of burning with the proper velocity conditions for a circular orbit. The first part of the report is a recapitulation of Chien's analysis. The second part deals with the characteristics of various oblique trajectories by which a rocket may be launched directly into a circular orbit; and the third part analyses a procedure whereby the rocket is launched into an elliptical orbit near its perihelion, is allowed to travel as a free body around the earth to the aphelion of the ellipse and then, by an additional boost of velocity, is projected into a circular orbit. ...|$|R
