40|$|Abstract:The {{effects of}} {{four types of}} {{mulching}} models (surface tillage with straw mulching, no-tillage with straw mulching on furrow, no-tillage with stubble mulching, and no-tillage with straw mulching on ridge and furrow) on the root spatial distribution {{and the relationship between}} the roots and shoots of maize were investigated using stratified digging methods, with maize as the test crop. The distribution of maize roots was cone shaped and gradually extended from 20 cm to 40 cm below the surface during the elongation stage. Under the different mulch tillage models, the effects on maize root growth were positive. The mulching measures significantly affected the control and support of the early and later stages of maize growth. The maize significantly differed in the root weight density (P= 0. 026 < 0. 05) and the root surface area (P = 0. 005 < 0. 01) with different mulching measures. No-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow was the only mulching model in which the growth of the roots and leaves of maize was limited. However, the other maize growth measures were better than conventional tillage. In addition, no-tillage with straw mulching on the ridge and furrow had an advantage in terms of the growth of the surface roots, while stubble mulching and <b>strip</b> <b>mulching</b> had advantages in terms of the growth of deep roots and radial roots, respectively. Surface tillage with straw mulching was an ideal cultivation method for the cold an...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in the Mediterranean {{environment}} of central Italy from 2011 to 2013 in order to evaluate the effects of winter cover crops and their residues on the weed composition in a cover crop-tomato sequence. The treatments consisted in: (i) 5 soil managements { 3 cover crop species [hairy vetch, phacelia, white mustard]}, winter fallow mulched with barley straw before tomato transplanting, and conventionally tilled soil, (ii) 2 levels of nitrogen fertilization [0 and 100 kg N ha- 1], and (iii) 2 levels of weed management [weed-free and weedy] on tomato. The cover crop residues were left on the soil surface and arranged in strips which were used as beds for tomato seedlings transplanted in paired rows. The tomato was strip tilled between the tomato paired rows. Hairy vetch was the most suppressive species as cover crop and as dead mulch with the highest production of residues (634 g m- 2 of DM). Phacelia and mustard were not suitable for controlling weeds and, as dead mulches, showed values of weed aboveground biomass, weed density and composition similar to the bare soil (on average 85. 6 n m- 2, 403. 1 g m- 2 of DM, and 6. 3 n. species m- 2, respectively).

40|$|Upstream {{soil and}} water {{conservation}} measures in catchments can have positive impact both upstream in terms of less erosion and higher crop yields, but also downstream by less sediment flow into reservoirs and increased groundwater recharge. Green Water Credits (GWC) schemes are being developed to encourage upstream farmers to invest in {{soil and water}} conservation practices which will positively effect upstream and downstream water availability. Quantitative information on water and sediment fluxes is crucial as a basis for such financial schemes. A pilot design project in the large and strategically important Upper-Tana Basin in Kenya has the objective to develop a methodological framework for this purpose. The essence of the methodology is the integration and use of a collection of public domain tools and datasets: the so-called Green water and Blue water Assessment Toolkit (GBAT). This toolkit was applied in order to study different options to implement GWC in agricultural rainfed land for the pilot study. Impact of vegetative contour <b>strips,</b> <b>mulching,</b> and tied ridges were determined for: (i) three upstream key indicators: soil loss, crop transpiration and soil evaporation, and (ii) two downstream indicators: sediment inflow in reservoirs and groundwater recharge. All effects were compared with a baseline scenario of average conditions. Thus, not only actual land management was considered but also potential benefits of changed land use practices. Results of the simulations indicate that especially applying contour strips or tied ridges significantly reduces soil losses and increases groundwater recharge in the catchment. The model was used to build spatial expressions of the proposed management practices in order to assess their effectiveness. The developed procedure allows exploring the effects of soil conservation measures in a catchment to support the implementation of GWC...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} soil and water {{conservation}} techniques (SWCTs) on annual runoff (R a), runoff coefficients (RC a) and annual soil loss (SL a) at the plot scale have been extensively tested on field runoff plots in Europe and the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, a comprehensive overview of these effects and the factors controlling the effectiveness of SWCTs is lacking. Especially the effectiveness of SWCT in reducing R a is poorly understood. Therefore, an extensive literature review is presented that compiles the results of 101 earlier studies. In each of these studies, R a and SL a was measured on field runoff plots where various SWCTs were tested. In total, 353 runoff plots (corresponding to 2093 plot-years of data) for 103 plot-measuring stations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean were considered. SWCTs include (1) crop and vegetation management (i. e. cover crops, <b>mulching,</b> grass buffer <b>strips,</b> strip cropping and exclosure), (2) soil management (i. e. no-tillage, reduced tillage, contour tillage, deep tillage, drainage and soil amendment) and (3) mechanical methods (i. e. terraces, contour bunds and geotextiles). Comparison of the frequency distributions of SL a rates on cropland without and with the application of SWCTs shows that the exceedance probability of tolerable SL a rates is ca. 20 % lower when SWCT are applied. However, no notable effect of SWCTs on the frequency distribution of RC a is observed. For 224 runoff plots (corresponding to 1567 plot-year data), SWCT effectiveness in reducing R a and/or SL a could be directly calculated by comparing measured R a and/or SL a with values measured on a reference plot with conventional management. Crop and vegetation management techniques (i. e. buffer <b>strips,</b> <b>mulching</b> and cover crops) and mechanical techniques (i. e. geotextiles, contour bunds and terraces) are generally more effective than soil management techniques (i. e. no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage). Despite being generally less effective, no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage have received substantially more attention in the literature than the other SWCTs. Soil and water conservation techniques are generally less effective in reducing R a than in reducing SL a, which is an important consideration in areas where water is a key resource and in regions susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, all SWCTs show a more consistent and effective reduction of both R a and SL a with increasing R a and SL a magnitude, which is attributed to the reduced influence of measurement uncertainties. Although some significantly negative correlations between SWCT effectiveness and plot slope length, slope gradient or annual precipitation were found, the importance of these factors in explaining the observed variability in effectiveness seems limited. Time-series analyses of R a during multiple years of SWCT application strongly indicate that no-tillage and conservation tillage become less effective in reducing R a over time. Such an effect is not observed for SL a. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewe...|$|R

But weed species shifts and losses in crop yield caused from increased weed density have been cited as major hurdles of CA adoption (Dahal and Karki, 2014). Crop yields in CA can be similar to conventional systems if weeds are controlled (Chauhan et al., 2012). The availability of pre-plant, pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides provides an opportunity to control weeds in CA. But weed control strategies adopted must reduce the development of herbicide resistance by weeds.

In the recent years, the function of this basin can not be performed optimally in maintaining sustainability hydrologic function of Jeneberang dam.

The treatments implemented in duplicates were: maize (Zea mays) under shifting cultivation (T 1), maize on contour lines (T 2), groundnut (Arachis hypogea) on upper and maize on lower half of treatment plot, with both on contour lines (T 3), groundnut on contour lines (T 4) and maize on contour lines with natural vegetation as buffer strips (T 5). The average sediment concentration of runoff water varied from 5. 20 g L− 1 (T 1) to 1. 07 g L− 1 (T 5) in 2008 and from 3. 84 (T 1) to 0. 89 g L− 1 (T 5) in 2009.

40|$|Runoff {{and soil}} loss caused by water erosion are major drivers {{of soil and}} land {{degradation}} throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. This study aims to better understand and quantify (1) plot-scale annual runoff (Ra) and annual soil loss (SLa), (2) the factors that control Ra and SLa over {{the wide range of}} environmental conditions in Europe and the Mediterranean, and (3) the effectiveness of different land use types and soil and water conservation techniques (SWCTs) in reducing Ra and SLa. A more detailed discussion of the knowledge gaps with respect to plot-measured Ra and SLa in Europe and the Mediterranean, and the specific objectives for this research is given in chapter 1. A database of Ra and SLa data measured throughout Europe and the Mediterranean on bounded runoff and soil loss plots under natural rainfall, with a measuring period (representative for) at least one year was compiled from the literature. The resulting database contains plot data from 1 409 plots, corresponding to 9 297 plot-years from 239 plot-measuring stations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. The database contains Ra data for 804 plots (corresponding to 5 327 plot-years) and SLa data for 1 056 plots (corresponding to 5 327 plot-years) under conventional land management practice (see chapter 2). Furthermore, also Ra data for 287 plots (corresponding to 1 713 plot-years) and SLa data for 356 plots (corresponding to 2 035 plot-years) where SWCTs were tested were collected (see chapter 7). This study is both the largest compilation of plot SLa data in Europe and the Mediterranean to date, and the first to systematically include Ra data and data on plots where SWCTs are tested. A detailed discussion of the data included in the database is given in chapter 2 and chapter 7. Several knowledge gaps with respect to the effect of land use type on Ra and SLa over the whole of Europe and the Mediterranean are addressed in chapter 3. The analysis confirmed the important control of vegetation cover on Ra and SLa rates, with marked differences in both Ra and SLa between cultivated land (i. e. cropland, fallow plots, vineyards, tree crops), and semi-natural vegetation (i. e. shrubland, rangeland, forest, post-fire and grassland) for the whole of Europe and the Mediterranean. Generally, there is a good correspondence between Ra and SLa for the different land use types, but at the regional scale, differences were found between Ra and SLa rates for different climatic zones. Mean SLa values were smaller in the Mediterranean than in temperate and cold climatic zones, and mean annual runoff coeffient (RCa) rates were generally higher in the cold climatic zone than in the temperate and Mediterranean zones for similar land use types. Nevertheless, each land use type also comprises a wide variability in plot-measured Ra and SLa, and only weak relations were found between Ra and SLa and other environmental factors that are generally considered important determinants of Ra and SLa at the local scale such as plot length and slope gradient, indicating that these factors explain {{only a small part of}} the large variability in Ra and SLa that is observed at the continental scale. Part of the large uncertainty associated with plot Ra and SLa rates is associated with temporal variability. To explore the inter-annual variability in plot Ra and SLa rates, an analysis of 234 Ra and 307 SLa time-series with measuring periods equal to or longer than five years is performed in chapter 4. Temporal variability of RCa and SLa rates were shown to be related, but temporal variability in RCa is generally smaller than temporal variability in SLa. This was confirmed by a Monte-Carlo analysis which indicated that compared to SLa, shorter measuring periods are needed for plot measurements of RCa to allow the expected long-term mean RCa to be estimated with a specified degree of certainty. Nevertheless, uncertainties with respect to the estimation of long-term mean RCa and SLa can be large even after long measuring periods (i. e. 30 years). Closer examination of several environmental factors (i. e. climatic zone, land use type, plot length, slope gradient and annual precipitation) showed that these factors explain little temporal variability, and indicate that a large portion of the observed variability may indeed be random. Furthermore, there are substantial differences between temporal variability in plot-measured SLa and catchment sediment yield, and a better understanding of these differences can improve our understanding of differences in erosion processes between these spatial scales. Plot-measured Ra (804 plots corresponding to 5 327 plot-years) has received much less attention than SLa (1 056 plots corresponding to 7 204 plot-years) in Europe and the Mediterranean, both with respect to the reported data, as with respect to the analysis of Ra data at a continental scale. Therefore, a closer analysis of the annual rainfall (Pa) - annual runoff (Ra) relation is presented in chapter 5. In this assessment, two simple models were used; a linear mixed effects model and a modified Curve Number Method, adapted for annual data. Fitting of the models showed the important controlling effect of both land use type and soil texture (as expressed by the Hydrologic Soil Group) on the Pa-Ra relation. Contrary to expectations, fine-textured soils generally did not show the highest runoff response, which was attributed to the cracking behaviour of some clayey soils. An important effect of intra-annual precipitation distribution was expected, but this could only be demonstrated through simulation and not in the plot-measured data. A confrontation of the plot SLa data with two models for the estimation of interrill and rill erosion at a continental scale (i. e. the process-based PESERA model and empirical SEM model) in chapter 6 showed that there is a large variability in the relation between predicted and observed SLa data. This variability is partly attributed to temporal variability due to the fact that these models predict long-term mean SLa. Both models tend to under-predict SLa values for the Continental climatic zone, which is attributed to the fact that important processes such as freeze-thaw cycles and snowmelt erosion are not accounted for. Furthermore, improvements to both models can be made by using a land cover classification that is specifically designed for erosion studies, rather than the more general CORINE land covers. While it was shown in chapter 3 that land use management can be a very effective means of controlling both Ra and SLa rates, this is not always possible. In these instances, specific soil and water conservation techniques (SWCTs) are used to reduce Ra and SLa. A review of the effectiveness of different SWCTs in reducing plot-scale Ra and SLa in Europe and the Mediterranean is presented in chapter 7. This analysis showed that most SWCTs are on average more effective in reducing SLa than in reducing Ra. Furthermore, the importance of vegetation cover as a factor controlling Ra and SLa was further confirmed by the finding that crop and vegetation management (i. e. buffer <b>strips,</b> <b>mulching,</b> cover crops) are more effective in reducing Ra and SLa than soil management techniques (i. e. no-tillage, reduced tillage, contour tillage). However, the effectiveness of individual SWCTs in reducing Ra and SLa was found to be highly variable, suggesting several controlling factors that are unaccounted for. An important effect of the Ra and SLa rate measured on control plots with conventional treatment was found, and especially for smaller Ra and SLa rates, effectiveness of the SWCTs was more variable. Effects of environmental factors such as plot length, slope gradient or Pa on SWCT effectiveness could not be clearly identified. Analysis of the temporal variability of SWCTs showed that there is considerable inter-annual variability in the effectiveness of conservation tillage techniques. With respect to runoff reduction, the effectiveness of no-tillage techniques tends to decrease over the years. Finally, chapter 9 gives a synthesis of this research, along with a discussion of possibilities for further research. Voorwoord Abstract Samenvatting Abbreviations and symbols Contents Chapter 1.

40|$| the {{degradation}} of soil physical characteristics such as infiltration rate, soil structure and crusting. The physical removal of surface soil is serious for shallow, gravelly soils, but more serious are the resulting effects of poor soil physical conditions on crop production. Soil erosion also decreases the fertilizer use efficiency by increasing the nutrient losses. Soil erosion is seldom a direct constraint to an individual cropping cycle but rather a chronic depletion of the soil as a resource base. The principal causes of soil erosion are deforestation, overgrazing, shortened cycles of shifting cultivation and the cultivation of slopes without any form of conservation. The protection afforded by natural vegetation from erosion includes protection from direct impact of rainfall by the canopy, presence of a surface litter layer to further buffer droplet impact and to impede runoff and abundant rooting within the soil surface horizon which stablizes soils. The importance of carbon cycling within an ecosystem must never be overlooked. As surface and root litter decays, organic ma:erials assist in the formation and stabilization of soil aggregates which resist erosive forces. Soil structure {{and the distribution of}} macropores are further facilitated by increased rooting and macrofaunal activity. The resilience of natural ecosystems versus improperly managed agroecosystems shows the advantages of combining plant species of different architecture and chemical composition. Soil erosion by water poses a serious threat to the productive capacity of agriculture to keep pace with, and exceed, population growth. Steep, non-terraced hill-sides are the most susceptible to erosion but, given the frequency and intensity of precipitation in semi-arid and sub-humid areas, even moderate slopes are often in jeopardy. Too often bench terraces, grass <b>strips,</b> hedgerows, windbreaks, <b>mulches</b> and contour ditches are not only under-utilized but are even unknown within the cropping systems. One difficulty in getting farmers to appreciate the importance of soil conservation is that the return on labour and investments are not immediately evident and too often are beyond the planning horizon. It is only when land has become severely degraded that those farmers who did not practice soil conservation become aware of the consequences by comparison with those farmers who did. Agricultural resource scientists and planners must better familiarize themselves with the labour requirement and capital expense of candidate soil conservation practices, and must prepare farmer information packages which recommend socially acceptable and technically feasible options to the farmer. Soil survey and land use planning Susceptibility to deterioration is a very important soil quality and one that needs to be considered early in development planning. Erosion is the most obvious and serious hazard resulting from agricultural or other vegetation-based land uses. Susceptibility to erosion of soil types occurring in an area can be derived from soil survey information. Soil surveys also provide information on hazards restricted to specific soils, for example the presence of limiting layers for root development such as hardpans or salt and sodium accumulation in soils irrigated without adequate drainage, or subsidence of organic soils. From soil surveys interpretations can be made with regard to the suitability of soils for management operations such as tillage either by hand labour, animal traction or motorised machinery. Information used for such evaluations, which is collected during soil surveys, includes slope, soil depth, rock outcrops, surface stoniness, drainage condition and soil consistency. Soil surveys also make an essential contribution {{to the development of the}} interpretative classification of land suitability for irrigation. Knowledge of the characteristics of individual soils is essential for planning the economic use of water. It provides a basis for ensuring that development is concentrated on the most suitable soils available and for determining the method and quantity of water application that will achieve optimum efficiency. It is important also that water application should be planned in relation to data on soils, particularly subsoil characteristics, if the hazards of salinization and water-logging are to be avoided. Soil surveys also give information on major limitations of land use. Some of the limitations may be of a permanent nature: that is, they cannot be changed by management. Such factors include soil depths, texture and slope. Others may be of a temporary nature and can be corrected by management, for example soil fertility. To facilitate storage and retrieval of soil survey information for planning and resource management, the Kenya Soil Survey has established a Geographical Information System. This is also being used for digitizing soil maps and in the preparation of interpretation maps for various land use alternatives. Sustenance of land productivity calls for careful planning for the utilization and management of soil and water resources. To prepare the most rational plans, land evaluation must be called into play. It involves the execution and interpretation of basic surveys of soils, climate and vegetation and other aspects of land and its productivity in terms of the requirements of alternative forms of land use. The end result of land evaluation is the identification of a number of appropriate types of land use alternatives together with their consequences on implementation. Where the most appropriate options in Africa have been properly identified through land evaluation, there is no reason to fear that the consequences of intensification will cause irreversible damage to the soil resource. And for certain parts of Africa, the time to intensify agricultural production is now.

40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa shows that climate change is {{expected}} to cause an increased frequency of extreme events such as high temperature and rainfall intensity, droughts and floods, desertification, and spread of animal and human diseases. These extreme events are likely to {{have a negative impact on}} food security. Using the case of Ethiopia, this thesis analyses the role that social network and agricultural extension can play in enhancing farmers ability to adapt to climate change. The thesis builds on recent research, which has highlighted the role of social networks and extension in promoting adaptation to the negative impacts of climate change. Social networks between farmers can build community resilience and increase adaptation to climate change. They also affect technology adoption and climate change adaptation through social learning, joint evaluation of new technologies and collective action. Current research on social networks in Ethiopia has mainly focused on the effects of network size on technology adoption and there is no empirical study on which types of social networks matter the most, and how do such types of social networks matter for climate change adaptation. Agricultural extension is expected to facilitate climate change adaptation through training and education of farmers, enabling them to anticipate climate change and to update their knowledge, attitudes and adaptive capabilities in response to climate change. In addition to their well-established function of promoting technologies and natural resource management practices, agricultural extension services are expected to play new roles in building farmers social networks and supporting climate change adaptation strategies. There are various studies on agricultural extension reforms in Ethiopia, but there are still gaps in this literature, especially regarding the capacity of the extension service to promote adaptation to climate change and to promote social networks. The purpose of this thesis is, therefore, to fill these knowledge gaps and to contribute to the current debate on the dynamic links between climate change, social networks and extension reforms. The thesis combines quantitative and qualitative methods for analysis of three inter-related research topics. First, the thesis examines farmers vulnerabilities to climate change and the role of adaptation in increasing productivity at the household level. Second, it assesses how the different types of social networks are related with the adoption of sustainable land management practices for climate change adaptation. Third, by examining what works and what does not work well in the agricultural extension reforms in Ethiopia, the thesis investigates the interactions between climate change, social networks and extension reforms in Amhara region of Ethiopia. The thesis is based on a mixed methods approach. It combines a quantitative analysis, using World Bank data from a survey conducted in 2011 covering 1338 farmers. The analytical methods include a probit model, an OLS analysis and an endogenous switching regression model. Qualitative research methods included Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) combined with an individual scoring technique, and a Climate Vulnerability and Capacity Analysis. The study on climate change adaptation found that the effects of climate change and adaptation practices differ across agro-ecological zones and adopter groups. In the kolla agro-ecologies, the major hazards were drought, floods, and migration. In contrast, snowfall, landslides and crop diseases were the main hazards in the dega and woyna-dega agro-ecologies. Erratic rainfall, soil erosion and livestock diseases were common hazards to all agro-ecologies. Households responses to the hazards were differed across the different agro-ecologies. In the kolla agro-ecologies, the most common coping strategies were reducing the number of daily meals, migration, livestock selling and utilization of irrigation. In the dega and woyna-dega agro-ecologies common coping strategies included: changing consumption patterns; adopting drought resistant crops (sorghum and millet); sale of chickens, eggs, sheep, goats, eucalyptus trees; soil conservation and tree planting; zero grazing and water harvesting. In all agro-ecologies, local institutions support communal adaptation strategies such as communal water harvesting and irrigation schemes, reforestation, rangeland enclosure and prevention of soil erosion. The empirical results also revealed that farmers who implemented climate change adaptation strategies have significantly increased their food productivity and food security, compared to farmers who did not implement such strategies. The findings regarding the relationship between social networks and sustainable land management revealed that networks with relatives have a positive impact on planting trees, but the impact of such networks on soil conservation was found to be negative. This finding can be interpreted as an incidence of self-interested behavior, since farmers may plant trees as a means of securing land holdings. When farmers are faced with the risk of losing their land to relatives, due to common heritage, they prefer planting trees to soil conservation. Farmers can reclaim all their investment costs by cutting trees, should they lose their land holding rights to relatives. In contrast, it would be difficult to regain soil conservation investment costs in this case. Friendship networks were found to be insignificant in both planting trees and soil conservation, while neighborhood ties only had a significant association with tree planting. This suggests the potential contributions of friendship and neighborhood networks, which can significantly affect sustainable land management practices, but may remain untapped. The analysis of extension conducted as part of this thesis suggests that a uniform reform approach, as pursued in Ethiopia, does not fit well with the diverse agro-ecologies and extension challenges in the country. While the number of service providers increased substantially, they still lack skills, incentives and resources, which affect their work motivation and job performance. Moreover, the planning, monitoring and evaluation system was found not to be very effective in regularly assessing what has been achieved at the farmers training centers and what remains to be done in the future. Similarly, there is room to improve partnerships and linkages of actors, especially by including key actors that are currently missing. Based on the above findings, this thesis derived the following policy implications: 1. The potential capacity of schools and religious organizations in supporting climate change adaptation should be tapped. The case study identified agricultural extension, health extension, NGOs, cooperatives, indigenous institutions (Iddir, Kirre, Jiggie, Debo, Iquib), microfinance institutions, schools, local governments, youth and women groups as key institutions providing rural services. However, extension organizations, cooperatives/unions, local governments and NGOs were the only institutions providing services relevant for climate change adaptation. Surprisingly, important local institutions (schools and religious organizations) did not have any short or long term plans to support climate change adaptation efforts despite the fact that they have the social capital to plan and implement some communal strategies such as terracing and planting trees on communal lands. 2. The regional and national policies should support local climate change adaptation strategies. The study showed that adaptation efforts should not be left to only farmers and local governments. Regional and national policies should support the local adaptation strategies. It was found that the absence of communal land and natural resource use policies was encouraging farmers to over utilize natural resources, and the long delay in land use rights (certification) was discouraging farmers from making long term investments on their land (e. g., tree planting and soil conservation). Therefore, the findings suggest that it would be useful to promote the introduction of communal land and natural resource use policy and a speedy land certification process. 3. The potential contributions of social networks as alternative channels of extension services should be tapped. The findings revealed that funds for agricultural extension are declining and extension managers should look for alternative source of funding and move away from a one-size-fits-all thinking to a best fit approach. It needs to become a priority for the current extension system to better understand what types of social networks matter most for technology adoption. 4. The findings also indicate that extension reforms should consider current agricultural challenges, especially climate change. In dega and woyna-daga agro-ecologies, the main challenges were getting information on climate change related hazards (rainfall and temperature), commercial marketing (cooperative development, price and new markets), post-harvest handling (drying and storage technique). In the kolla agro-ecologies, the major problems were lack of dry land farming methods (contour plowing, <b>mulching,</b> <b>strip</b> farming, summer fallow, seedbed preparation and planning in rows). So far, the extension system is not geared towards addressing these different challenges, which calls for aligning the extension reforms to the different local farming systems. 5. It can also be derived from the findings of this study that the regional government should design a new incentive system for the extension service. The case study showed that current incentives are inconsistent with the regional goal of promoting commercially oriented agriculture. Service providers in the region were found to lack the soft skills, incentives and resources to provide commercially oriented|$|R
