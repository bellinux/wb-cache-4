This paper presents findings from an international research project which seeks to develop a <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> system for bamboo culms. Over 200 four-point bending tests were carried out on Guadua angustifolia Kunth culms for which numerous mechanical and physical properties were measured. Correlations between flexural strength, static modulus of elasticity, dynamic modulus of elasticity from stress waves and density provided mediocre results, with R 2 ranging from 0 · 27 to 0 · 47. However, properties such as flexural stiffness, flexural capacity and mass per unit length, which are less dependent on geometric properties, provided much stronger correlations, with R 2 ranging from 0 · 86 to 0 · 92. The quality of these correlations indicates that these {{could be used as}} indicating properties for flexural capacity in a simple yet reliable <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> procedure for bamboo.

As sawmills become increasingly efficient, the importance of focusing on value recovery becomes obvious.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the results of predicting the strength of center boards based on x-ray scanning of logs with the results obtained by machine <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> using a bending machine. The study was based on 131 Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) sawlogs that were scanned with an x-ray LogScanner and then sawn into boards. The bending stiffness of the center boards was tested using a strength-grading machine, and the bending strength was tested according to EN 408. Models for prediction of bending strength based on machine <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> and x-ray LogScanner measurements were calibrated using partial least squares regression. The study showed that the x-ray LogScanner (r 2 = 0. 44) and machine <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> (r 2 = 0. 43) had similar accuracy in predicting bending strength. The combination of both methods resulted in significantly higher accuracy (r 2 = 0. 56).

This {{can be achieved by}} different approaches that are represented in the current standard and pre-standard. The pre-standard defines a parametric and non-parametric calculation of characteristic properties from test results, which is the essential difference between various approaches. In both the non-parametric approach and the standard procedure, some simplifications and adjustment factors are used while in the parametric calculation only equations from a theoretical background are used. Procedures are derived for eight different strength grade combination and for all results comparisons are made. With the Mathematica software we used simulations to test given equations for the calculation of characteristic properties. Special consideration was taken on the non-parametrical calculation. The correction factor equation has not proved to be suitable, at least not for the assumptions that are made in the pre-standard. Therefore, we produced a new equation, which gives better results. A new <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> machine is under development, which is not yet standardized and cannot formally be used for <b>strength</b> <b>grading</b> and CE marking yet. The requirements for the derivation of machine settings for initial type testing were met and we established new settings. We tried different properties as the indicative property. Due to its good correlation to specimens strength properties, dynamic modulus of elasticity was chosen. Grading procedure could be simplified by avoiding density measuring. Using size matrix and global cost matrix, we evaluated grading machine performance for data with measured density and data with constant density for each of the strength grade combination.

40|$|Good {{knowledge}} {{of the characteristics of}} building material is of the utmost importance in static calculations in civil engineering. The characteristics of a piece of timber may vary depending on the growth area, log, and cutting. Therefore, each piece of timber should be examined separately. The examination is based on non-destructive testing, distinguishing – as in our case – between different <b>strength</b> <b>grades.</b> Eurocode 5 refers to the EN 14081 standard, which allows visual and machine grading. In order to identify the differences between the two, we carried out several measurements and compared them. We used several non-destructive methods (visual grading, longitudinal wave propagation, ultrasound, bending test and longitudinal frequency). Results of each non-destructive method were compared to the bending strength obtained with the destruction method. We made some correlations and evaluated them. The specimens were classified into optimal <b>strength</b> <b>grades</b> and the results compared with <b>strength</b> <b>grades</b> obtained by selected nondestructive methods. We also tested a prototype device developed during the project and compared it with other devices and visual standards. The device did well.

Specifically, porosity is a parameter influencing durability of curb construct while compressive strength and flexural strength are the elements affecting mechanical properties of curb construct. This study conducted an experimental study to statistically investigate {{the prominence of}} porosity, and compressive and flexural strength on dry-pressed concrete curbs (DPC). To this end, 27 mix designs of (DPC) were prepared based on three cement <b>strength</b> <b>grades</b> of 32. 5, 42. 5 and 52. 5 MPa. Water-to-cement ratio (w/c) (0. 2, 0. 25 and 0. 3) and cement content (300, 350 and 450 kg/m 3) were considered as the main parameters of the experiments. The statistical properties of the factors were assessed using Taguchi method. The results of Taguchi method revealed that specimen construct with 0. 2 of w/c, 400 (kg/m 3) cement content, and <b>strength</b> <b>grade</b> of 52. 5 MPa had the maximum compressive strength of DPC.

The correlation of the mechanical properties and the electrical resisitivity could be obtained then. It was difficult to measure compressive strength of a concrete mix at very early age, however, it was much easier to measure its electrical resisitivity and get the development rate.
