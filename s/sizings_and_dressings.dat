40|$|The {{influence}} of the fibre/matrix interface strength on fibre cross-over bridging in a crack along fibres is investigated. Four different composite systems (commercial glass fibre with two different <b>sizings</b> <b>and</b> two matrix resins) resulting in strong and weak interfaces were manufactured. Their crack growth resistance during crack propagation with fibre bridging in a double cantilever beam specimen loaded with end moments was measured. Bridging laws were derived from the experimental results and correlated with the chemical interface characteristics and a micromechanical model. It was found that a strong interface provided higher transverse strength and crack initiation loads, while the weak interface exhibited higher toughness due to enhanced fibre bridging. Composites with different matrix resins showed large variations in bridging behaviour even if their transverse strength was similar...|$|R
