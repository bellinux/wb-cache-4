Government agencies and federal officials, who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. The Washington Post reported the estimated crowd size for the inaugural ceremony, and the National Park Service <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not contest the estimate.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Khánh at the latter's office. He complained about the {{dissolution}} of the HNC and <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the US could not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Khánh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Diệm, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Khánh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Diệm, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change. Taylor then bemoaned Khánh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Khánh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.|$|E

A McCain spokesperson <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not, since all of the campaign's assets were pledged as collateral at the time, not just the donor list.|$|E
25|$|The film {{met with}} mixed {{reactions}} in other nations, particularly China and Islamic nations of western Asia. According to news reports, {{the film has}} not been shown in theaters in China, although it was freely available in bootleg DVD and video.

The foreign media suggested this was a cover for government opposition to a portrayal of homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{the number}} of open and ungated level {{crossings}} there are minor collisions, and these are reported in the local press. These have become more commonplace but are usually minor; warning signage to alert motorists that trams are operating has been erected at the start of each season in recent times, but incidents still occur. There are many occupation crossings, some with restricted visibility for motorists. The most recent incident took place on Monday, 27 July 2009, when a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with the overhead wires supplying power to both the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway at a busy road crossing in Laxey; there were no injuries. Police and the line's electrical engineering crews attended the scene, the report also <b>said.</b> <b>It</b> <b>did</b> not indicate what damage had occurred. Service resumed the next day after temporary repairs to the overhead lines, which were permanently repaired over the subsequent couple of weeks. An investigation into the incident was scheduled to take place later.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{military}} intelligence officials in 2007, there were many key reasons why the Uzbeks had been dominating the area. Military intelligence reports testified that the locals were scared to mobilize the opposition against the Uzbek militants due to their reputations as fierce fighters with long memories and very strong military backgrounds. Some of these fighters used to be soldiers and officers in the Soviet Army during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, {{and some of them}} had military training given by the CIA during the 1990s; hence they were experts in guerrilla warfare. The IMU fighters had little to lose and it was difficult for them to escape somewhere else. They couldn't go back to Uzbekistan, and after 2009, re-infiltration back to Afghanistan also started becoming more difficult. Thus, they made Waziristan their home. Local militants allied to the tribesmen were reported attacking and seizing the IMU's private jail in Azam Warsak. The Pakistan Army intelligence <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not intend to step in, but witnesses say government artillery fired on the Uzbek fighters they set up to fight the tribesmen.|$|E

500|$|The {{score and}} soundtrack for Mother India was {{composed}} by Naushad. Mehboob Khan {{had worked on}} eightfilms with Naushad and developed a rapport with him. The lyrics were by Shakeel Badayuni. The soundtrack consists of 12songs and features vocals by Mohammed Rafi, Shamshad Begum, Lata Mangeshkar, and Manna Dey. It was not particularly well received upon release, and critics <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not match the high pitch {{and quality of the}} film. However, its later reception has been more positive: the soundtrack made Planet Bollywood's list of [...] "100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks Ever", compiled in the 2000s. The review gave the album 7.5 stars out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The day {{following}} the brawl, Anthony {{issued a statement}} and apology to his family, the league, and fans. He also specifically apologized to Mardy Collins, whom he directly struck during the incident. At {{the time of the}} brawl, Anthony was the league's leading scorer; his suspension was also the longest of the players suspended, and the sixth-longest in NBA history. According to former NBA player Steve Kerr, Anthony had [...] "tarnished" [...] his image, and Ric Bucher said that Anthony had [...] "torched his own career". Sports Illustrated writer Marty Burns said that Anthony faced becoming known by sports fans across America as the player who punched Collins in the face and then ran away. An example of the backlash was Northwest Airlines pulling Anthony from its in-flight magazine cover, as it <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not want [...] "to condone the behavior of Anthony".|$|E

500|$|The glut was {{replaced}} with a shortage when most federal coins were hoarded amid the economic chaos of the Civil War. Slowest to vanish was the base-metal cent, which only had value because government <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> and at that time, confidence in government was shaken. [...] Eventually, it too vanished from circulation and commanded a premium for change. A variety of makeshifts replaced the vanished coins, such as fractional currency and merchant's tokens. Beginning in 1864, Congress began to authorize base metal coins {{that would not be}} hoarded. [...] It reduced the weight of the cent, causing it to be made of bronze, and also required a two-cent piece of the same metal. [...] The following year saw the initiation of the three-cent nickel and in 1866, the five-cent nickel (today simply known as the nickel) began production. The two-cent piece, initially popular, saw declining mintages as the public preferred the smaller, more convenient nickel coins.|$|E
500|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Mulkern praised Corden and Smith, but <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not [...] "quite tick [...] boxes". He was {{not engaged}} by the upstairs villain, wished for more [...] "laugh-out-loud moments than good-humoured banter" [...] and disliked that the Doctor seemed [...] "diminished" [...] when {{thrown into the}} everyday atmosphere. In a review for IGN, Matt Wales rated it 7 out of 10 and {{referred to it as}} [...] "one of the fluffier episodes" [...] in terms of plot, but he said it was an [...] "enjoyable little duck-out-of-water adventure". He called Smith [...] "an absolute joy to watch" [...] and said that Corden and Haggard [...] " [...] themselves admirably". However, he criticised the [...] "more traditional Who elements", such as the alien threat that the directing left [...] "devoid of almost all tension", Amy's occasional appearances that did not seem to gel {{with the rest of the}} story, and the short resolution, where [...] "the whole thing collapsed into an incomprehensible muddle".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{so with a}} lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", WALL-E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E
