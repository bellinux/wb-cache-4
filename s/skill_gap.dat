However, little is known {{with regard to the}} key factors determining the accurate transmission of worker training requirements. Using one of the few linked employer-employee surveys in the world, the 2006 Irish National Employment Survey, this paper identifies the key factors determining the correct identification of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> within firms. The impact of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> on average training expenditures and labour costs is also measured. The research finds that both HRM and collective bargaining arrangements are important factors in facilitating the accurate identification of <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> within firms. The analysis confirms that <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> are a key determinant of training expenditures and tend to raise average labour costs.

However, the challenge of integrating digital marketing approaches with established marketing practice emerges as the key <b>skills</b> <b>gap.</b> Emerging from the key findings, a Digital Marketer Model was developed, highlighting the key competencies and skills needed by an excellent digital marketer. The research concludes that guidance on best practice, focusing upon evaluation metrics, futureproofing and strategic integration, needs to be developed for the communication industry. The Digital Marketing Model should be subject to further testing in industry and academia. Suggestions for further research are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Skill {{shortages}} {{should not}} be confused with ‘labor shortages’ which identify an objective lack of workers in the market, independently of their skills, and it may arise because of limited geographical mobility, ageing populations or a labor market approaching full employment during an economic boom. Along with labor surpluses, labor shortages are one of the most traditional examples of labor market imbalances. It should be noted that what distinguishes an objective shortage of labor from a skill-related shortage (i.e. a special case of skill mismatch) is just the presence of a pool of unemployed individuals (i.e. non-discouraged jobseekers) willing to take up jobs in the labor market considered at the ongoing rate. Nevertheless, even in presence of unemployment and assuming that there is an adequate demand for labor in the market, it could still be difficult to point to a skill shortage for at least two reasons: (i) if we are not able to establish whether the unemployment we observe is frictional (i.e. just a short-run consequence of costly ‘search’), cyclical (i.e. due to the business cycle) or structural (ii) if we are not able to determine whether the position offered is accessible and/or attractive (e.g. whether or not the wage posted is competitive or, at least, rising with respect to other segments of the market that are not reporting unmet labor demands). In addition, skill shortages may be caused by both ‘horizontal’ skill mismatch - when workers have qualifications/skills which are different than the one required by the firms - or by ‘vertical’ skill mismatch - when workers’ skills and qualifications are of a lower level with respect to what firms require. In the literature, scholars have also referred to skill mismatch (and sometimes even to skill shortages) to define a situation in which the skills of the employed workers and those required by their jobs were different. To avoid any possible confusion, we will refer to this form of mismatch affecting only employed individuals as ‘on-the-job’ mismatch, in the more general case where workers can be both over and under skilled for their jobs (vertical on-the-job mismatch) or have different skills/qualifications (horizontal on-the-job mismatch), and as <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> to refer to employed workers whose skills are lower than those required by their jobs. It follows that skill mismatch, as we are defining it, can result in the occurrence of both skill shortages and on-the-job mismatches (both vertical and horizontal). Economists generally believe that labor markets adjust to such imbalances, especially over time. But it is also possible that such mismatches can persist for many years or decades. In such instances, adverse equilibria characterized by higher level of structural unemployment, long-term unfilled vacancies and/or lower labor force participation may arise and employers may eventually be forced to hire workers who possess lower or just different skills, giving place to the mismatch ‘on the job’. Public policy interventions to change or improve the match of workers to employers might be appropriate in such cases.|$|E
40|$|Only few {{previous}} studies have explored cross-national variation {{in the relationship between}} educational certificates and competences. In this paper, we investigate the certificate-competence relationship, operationalized as <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> by level of educational attainment. More importantly, we scrutinize how two aspects of educational stratification processes, vertical stratification and occupation-specificity, affects <b>skills</b> <b>gaps.</b> Using data on 25 - 54 year olds from the 2011 / 12 round of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), we find that more occupation-specific education systems produce smaller differences in basic general skills between adults with low and intermediate levels of education. Higher levels of vertical stratification, by contrast, result in larger low-intermediate <b>skills</b> <b>gaps.</b> None of the two stratification aspects can however explain variations in the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> between intermediate and high educated adults.

40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of the paper is on assessing the global aerospace industry as well as Indian scenario, and attempts to assess the <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> and training needs of Indian aerospace industry.   Design/methodology/approach: The study is qualitative in nature, and employs wide array of qualitative tools which includes desktop study, focus group interviews and secondary sources of information. Around 10 focus groups {{were used in the}} study, with each focus group having a minimum of 6 members of experts in the aerospace and allied industries. The study evolved into a 2 staged one, with the first study elucidating the growing importance and potential of aerospace industry, justifying the significance to take forward {{the second part of the}} study. And the second study specifically focuses on <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> and training needs. Findings and Originality/value: The Study yields varied results on existing generic expectations of aerospace industry, specific needs of aerospace industry, identification of aerospace job categories unique to aerospace industry, key issues of training in Indian scenario and recommendations. The paper in summary reflects the current scenario of aerospace industry potentials for India and its likely impact on <b>skills</b> <b>gap</b> and training needs. Practical implications: <b>Skills</b> <b>gap</b> is a significant gap between an organization’s current capabilities and the skills it needs to achieve its goals. As a number of Global forecasts project, India as an emerging aviation market, the <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> in this sector is predicted to be huge and necessitates the study on assessing the <b>skill</b> <b>gaps</b> and its allied training needs.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is {{to shed light on}} the plight of human capital flight or what is known as brain drain in OIC countries and determine its drivers. This report develops a data set containing brain drain rates and <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> ratios (a measure of the relative skill level of emigrants compared to residents) for all 57 OIC countries and then utilizes descriptive statistics to explore the role that a country’s income level, development level, population size and geographic location play in shaping brain drain rates and <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> ratios. Furthermore, this report investigates correlations between the brain drain phenomenon and the socio-economic indicators of human capital accumulation, equality, R&D expenditure, state of health services and urbanization. The analysis reveals that brain drain rates are shaped by income level and geographic location while development level and population size bear no effect on shaping brain drain rates. Skilled gap ratios on the other hand are shaped by income level, development level and geographic location but not by population size. The correlation analysis shows that there is correlation between <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> ratios and the socio-economic indicators of human capital accumulation, state of health services and urbanization while there is no statistical evidence to support the claim that there is any correlation between brain drain rates and the social-economi...|$|E

40|$|Competency {{management}} {{is a very}} important part of a well-functioning organisation. Unfortunately competency descriptions are not uniformly specified nor defined across borders: National, sectorial or organisational, leading to an opaque competency description market with a multitude of competency frameworks and competency benchmarks. An ontology is a formalised description of a domain, which enables automated reasoning engines to be built which by utilising the interrelations between entities can make “intelligent” choices in different situations within the domain. Introducing formalised competency ontologies automated tools, such as <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> analysis, training suggestion generation, job search and recruitment, can be developed, which compare and contrast different competency descriptions on the semantic level. The major problem with defining a common formalised ontology for competencies is that there are so many viewpoints of competencies and competency frameworks. Work within the TRACE project has focused on finding common trends within different competency frameworks in order to allow an intermediate competency description to be made, which other frameworks can reference. This research has shown that competencies can be divided up into “knowledge”, “skills” and what we call “others”. An ontology has been created based on this with a simple structure of different “kinds” of “knowledges” and “skills” using semantic interrelations to define the basic semantic structure of the ontology. A prototype tool for analysing a <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> analysis has been developed. Personal profiles can be produced using the tool and a <b>skill</b> <b>gap</b> analysis is performed on a desired competency profile by using an ontologically based inference engine, which is able to list closest fit and possible proficiency gap...|$|E

The change is so rapid that all the stakeholders, who interact with the software industry, need to be ready for any change taking place, in order to survive in the global market. Since the software industry is knowledge driven, employees are the driving force of its success. As a result organizations need to make sure their employees are capable of handling or facing any challenge within the industry. Today, most of the industries have experienced <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> or <b>skill</b> shortage issues, worldwide and are trying to find solutions to mitigate it. It has become a predominant problem to the software industry. The {{purpose of this study is}} to conduct an analysis of the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps,</b> existing in the Sri Lankan software industry, to the benefit of all the stakeholders. It is focused on identifying factors that cause the <b>skills</b> <b>gaps,</b> their significance and skill deficiencies exist among employees, for programming & software engineering, testing & quality assurance and technical support job categories. Technology change, working experience and acquired training level were identified as the major factors to carry out a significant study of them, with respect to the existing <b>skills</b> <b>gaps</b> among employees in the industry. <b>Skills</b> <b>gaps</b> were identified in terms of soft skills, technical skills and core skills, according to each job category.
