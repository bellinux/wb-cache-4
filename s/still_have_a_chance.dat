5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He {{decided that if}} his career went nowhere he would <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E

On the same day, Kurt Riezler's diary has his friend Bethmann Hollweg saying: [...] "If the war comes from the East, so that we are marching to Austria-Hungary's aid instead of Austria-Hungary to ours, {{then we have a}} chance of winning it. If war does not come, if the Czar does not want it or France dismayed, counsels peace, then we <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of maneuvering the Entente apart over this action." ...|$|E

5000|$|By {{introducing}} randomness, games {{can make}} sure {{that everyone in the}} game <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the game, no matter how bad their situation may be. Obscuring victory points can also accomplish this, for not knowing whether one can <b>still</b> win can <b>have</b> the same effect as <b>still</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to win. For example, in the group stages of tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, the final set of games in the group are often played at the same time. This results in fewer situations where one team has no chance of proceeding.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the pilots}} of the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service arrived in France in 1914 they found {{themselves}} equipped with pusher types too underpowered to carry machine guns and <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of overtaking the enemy, and tractor types which were difficult to arm for the aggressive pursuit of enemy aircraft because the propeller was in the way. Among other attempts to get around this (such as firing obliquely past the arc of the propeller, and even efforts, doomed to failure, to synchronize the Lewis Gun which {{was at the time}} the [...] "standard" [...] British aircraft weapon) was the expedient of firing straight through the propeller arc and [...] "hoping for the best". A high proportion of bullets would in the normal course pass the propeller without striking the blades, and each blade might typically take several hits before there was much danger of its failing, especially if it was bound with tape to prevent splintering (see diagram below, and illustration to the left).|$|E
2500|$|The phone vote {{determines the}} first semi-finalist that wins this stages, and occurs {{after all the}} acts in a semi-final have performed, whereupon a special phone line is opened for a short time, which the public can use {{to vote on the}} act that they thought was the best; the phone number used, shown after their performance, is the same for all semi-finalists, with the {{exception}} of the final two digits, which differs between each semi-finalist in terms of the order of their appearance. Once the lines have closed and the votes have been counted, the act with the highest number of public votes is automatically placed in the final. The judges' vote, held after the result of the phone vote, determine the second act that wins this stage, and is conducted between the second and third most popular acts the public voted on; the other semi-finalist at this point, are eliminated from the contest. The act which receives a majority vote from the judges, moves on to the final; in the event of a tied vote, upon the show increasing the number of judges to 4 from fifth series onwards, the second most popular act moves on to the final. From the sixth series onwards, the show incorporated a new feature in which any eliminated act from the semi-finals could <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of being sent through to the finals, by being picked by the judges to as their [...] "Wildcard" [...] act, later expanding this by allowing the public to vote on a second act to go through into the finals, out of the top three eliminated acts.|$|E

Now, Peters, you had better get forty winks; I will go out with Brown, Field, and Sankey, and relieve the three out there. I don't suppose they will come in, but they can take a nap where they are. You need not send out when the farmers come back; we shall see them." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{astonishing}} to Mainwaring, in afterward {{thinking about}} it all, how quickly his mind began to recover its steadiness after that first astonishing shock. Even as the other was speaking he discovered that his brain was becoming clarified to a wonderful lucidity; his thoughts were becoming rearranged, and with a marvelous activity and an alertness he had never before experienced. He {{knew that if he}} moved to escape or uttered any outcry he would be instantly a dead man, for the circle of the pistol barrel was directed full against his forehead and with the steadiness of a rock. If he could but for an instant divert that fixed and deadly attention he might <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for life. With the thought an inspiration burst into his mind and he instantly put it into execution; thought, inspiration, and action, as in a flash, were one. He must make the other turn aside his deadly gaze, and instantly he roared out in a voice that stunned his own ears: [...] "Strike, bos'n! Strike, quick!" ...|$|E
