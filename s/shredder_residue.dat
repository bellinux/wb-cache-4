5000|$|The {{shredding}} {{of automobiles}} and major household appliances {{is a process}} where a hammermill acts as a giant tree chipper by grinding the materials fed into it to fist-size pieces. The shredding of automobiles results {{in a mixture of}} ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal (e.g. alloys of copper and aluminium) and shredder waste, called automotive <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> or automobile <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> (ASR). ASR consists of glass, fiber, rubber, automobile liquids, plastics and dirt. ASR is sometimes differentiated into shredder light fraction and dust. Sometimes these residual materials are called [...] "Car-fluff".|$|E
50|$|Approximately 12-15 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the}} end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them. The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics. The remainder, known as automotive <b>shredder</b> <b>residue,</b> is put into a landfill.The <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials. Currently, 75% of the materials are able to be recycled. As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} enable a {{sustainable}} supply, {{the recovery of}} raw materials from secondary resources offers promising potential. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{is a source of}} various metals and polymers, but also includes hazardous substances. Therefore, a process for a thermo-chemical treatment of different fractions from WEEE were developed and optimized. With the aim to dehalogenate pyrolysis products and recover base and precious metals from <b>shredder</b> <b>residues</b> as well as gallium, indium and tantalum from Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) and tantalum capacitors, three thermochemical technology approaches were developed. From <b>shredder</b> <b>residues,</b> not only a concentrate of char and metals was produced, but also liquid and gaseous fuels. The char-metal mixture can be utilized directly in integrated copper smelters in order to recycle contained metals. Special attention was given on how formations of dioxins and furans (PXDD/F) can be suppressed and on how already formed PXDD/F can be decomposed continuously. Regarding LCD, the developed technology is able to extract > 99 wt. -% of indium selectively from LCD by using waste polyvinylchloride (PVC). For the last mentioned feedstock, a combination of pyrolytic and mechanical treatment was developed and optimized, which is able to form a concentrate of nearly 80 wt. -% tantalum...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} of end-of-life vehicles (ELV) will soon undergo a fundamental change. The {{impacts on the}} environment are hard to assess, {{especially with regard to}} light-density automotive <b>shredder</b> <b>residues</b> (ASR), which are at present almost exclusively disposed of on landfills. Reverse logistics is necessary to efficiently close the product life cycles in car recycling. The disposal infrastructure in car recycling has quickly developed over the past years.

40|$|A well {{developed}} infrastructure exists for the reuse and recycling of automotive parts and materials. At {{the end of}} a vehicle's useful life many parts are removed and sold for reuse and fluids are recovered for recycling or proper disposal. What remains is shredded, along with other metal bearing scrap such as home appliances, demolition debris and process equipment, and the metals are separated out and recycled. The remainder of the vehicle materials is call <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> which ends up in the landfill. As energy and natural resources becomes more treasured, increased effort has been afforded to find ways to reduce energy consumption and minimize the use of our limited resources. Many of the materials found in <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> could be recovered and help offset the use of energy and material consumption. For example, the energy content of the plastics and rubbers currently landfilled with the <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> is equivalent to 16 million barrels of oil per year. However, in the United States, the recovered materials, primarily polymers, cannot be recycled due to current regulatory barriers which preclude the re-introduction into commerce of certain materials because of residual contamination with substances of concern (SOCs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The source of the PCBs is not well understood. Old transformers, capacitors, white goods and ballasts from lighting fixtures are likely contributing factors. The project was designed to evaluate whether vehicles of varying age and manufacturing origin contribute to the PCB content in <b>shredder</b> <b>residue.</b> Additionally, the project was designed to determine if there are any trends in material composition of the <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> from varied age and manufacturing groups. This information would aid in future material recovery facility strategy and design. The test utilized a newly installed shredder plant to shred four categories of automobiles. The categories were defined by vehicle age and the manufacturing company and location. Each category of vehicles was processed individually through the shredder plant and the resulting <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> was analyzed for its materials composition and presence of PCBs and leachable metals. The results show that <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> from all vehicle categories tested are not significant contributors of PCBs and leachable metals. It was evident that leachable cadmium levels have decreased in newer vehicles. The composition of the <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> from each of the four categories is similar to the others. In addition, these compositions are approximately equal to the composition of typical shredder residues, not limited to automotive materials...|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{more than}} 50 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the end}} of their service life throughout the world. More than 95 % of these vehicles enter a comprehensive recycling infrastructure that includes auto parts recyclers/dismantlers, remanufacturers, and material recyclers (shredders). Today, about 75 % of automotive materials are profitably recycled via (1) parts reuse and parts and components remanufacturing and (2) ultimately by the scrap processing (shredding) industry. The process by which the scrap processors recover metal scrap from automobiles involves shredding the obsolete automobiles, along with other obsolete metal-containing products (such as white goods, industrial scrap, and demolition debris), and recovering the metals from the shredded material. The single largest source of recycled ferrous scrap for the iron and steel industry is obsolete automobiles. The non-metallic fraction that remains after the metals are recovered from the shredded materials (about 25 % of the weight of the vehicle) [...] commonly called <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> [...] is disposed of in landfills. Over the past 10 to 15 years, a significant amount of research and development has been undertaken to enhance the recycle rate of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), including enhancing dismantling techniques and improving remanufacturing operations. However, most of the effort has focused on developing technology to recover materials, such as polymers, from <b>shredder</b> <b>residue.</b> To make future vehicles more energy efficient, more lighter-weight materials [...] primarily polymers and polymer composites [...] will be used in manufacturing these vehicles. These materials increase the percentage of <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> that must be disposed of, compared with the percentage of metals. Therefore, as the complexity of automotive materials and systems increases, new technologies will be required to sustain and maximize the ultimate recycling of these materials and systems at end-of-life. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), in cooperation with the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP) and the American Plastics Council (APC), is working to develop technology for recycling materials from <b>shredder</b> <b>residue.</b> Several other organizations worldwide are also working on developing technology for recycling <b>shredder</b> <b>residue.</b> Without a commercially viable shredder industry, our nation may face greater environmental challenges and a decreased supply of quality scrap and be forced to turn to primary ores for the production of finished metals.

Facing the difficulty of disposing of auto <b>shredder</b> <b>residue,</b> the Japanese government is trying to enact legislation which facilitates recycling of end-of-life vehicles.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{developing}} a hydrometallurgical process to recover metals from automobile <b>shredded</b> <b>residue</b> (or car fluff). Automobile <b>shredded</b> <b>residue</b> (ASR) was characterised by particle size distribution, total metal content and metal speciation in order to guide the choice of target metals and the operating conditions of leaching. Characterisation results showed that Fe is the most abundant metal in the waste, while Zn was the second abundant metal in the fraction with diameter lower than 500 mu m. Sequential extractions denoted that Zn was easily extractable by weak acid attack, while Fe and Al required a strong acid attack to be removed. In order to recover zinc from < 500 mu m fraction leaching tests were operated using acetic acid, sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide at different concentrations. Sulphuric acid determined the highest zinc extraction yield, while acetic acid determined the highest zinc extractive selectivity. Sodium hydroxide promoted an intermediate situation between sulphuric and acetic acid. Zn recovery by electro winning using acetic leach liquor determined 95 % of Zn electro deposition yield in 1 h, while using sulphuric leach liquor 40 % yield in 1 h and 50 % yield in 2 h were obtained.
