40|$|Large banks often sell part {{of their}} loan {{portfolio}} {{in the form of}} collateralized debt obligations (CDO) to investors. In this paper we raise the question whether credit asset securitization affects the cyclicality (or commonality) of bank equity values. The commonality of bank equity values reflects a major component of systemic risks in the banking market, caused by correlated defaults of loans in the banks' loan books. Our simulations take into account the major stylized fact of CDO transactions, the non-proportional nature of risk sharing that goes along with tranching. We provide a theoretical framework for the risk transfer through securitization that builds on a macro risk factor and an idiosyncratic risk factor, allowing an identification of the types of risk that the individual tranche holders bear. This allows conclusions about the risk positions of issuing banks after risk transfer. Building on the strict <b>subordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>tranches,</b> we first evaluate the correlation properties both within and across risk classes. We then determine the effect of securitization on the systematic risk of all tranches, and derive its effect on the issuing bank's equity beta. The simulation results show that under plausible assumptions concerning bank reinvestment behavior and capital structure choice, the issuing intermediary's systematic risk tends to rise. We discuss the implications of our findings for financial stability supervision. risk transfer; systematic risk; systemic risk...|$|E

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has shown that}} many financial institutions dealing with credit derivatives were exposed to severe unexpected losses. This indicates that systematic influences are decisively underestimated {{particularly with regard to}} structured products like securitized <b>tranches</b> <b>of</b> collateralized debt obligations. Our analytical study addresses these systematic effects: We provide a simple model which allows a closed-form comparison of both bonds and tranches with respect to their systematic risk. We demonstrate that the exposure to systematic risk <b>of</b> <b>tranches</b> may be many times higher than the exposure of bonds, even if both products share the same rating grade, e. g., an ‘AAA’ rating, measured by either default probability or expected loss. Particularly in economic downturns, default rates <b>of</b> <b>tranches</b> may be multiples of those of bonds. Our results help understand high default rates <b>of</b> <b>tranches</b> during the financial crisis and show that classical ratings are insufficient metrics for measuring risks of structured products...|$|R

40|$|This paper does a {{valuation}} analysis <b>of</b> senior-subordinated structure <b>tranches</b> {{backed by}} non-agency mortgages. The valuation is done using Monte Carlo simulation and employs the CIR interest rate process {{in conjunction with}} an empirical model estimated for non-agency mortgage prepayments and defaults. The sensitivity of the value <b>of</b> <b>tranches</b> {{to a number of}} variables are analyzed. We find that the interest rate process parameters significantly affect prepayments and defaults but not the relative value of the senior tranche. It is found that with the shifting of prepayments, the senior trances does not dominated all the junior tranches at all interest rates. The shifting of prepayments has the unintended effect of providing stability to the junior tranches by making their cashflows less sensitive to prepayments. Our main conclusion is that while the shifting of prepayments increases protection from default to the senior tranche for a given level <b>of</b> <b>subordination,</b> it has the unwanted effect of lowering its value through increased contraction risk. The value loss should be taken into account in determining the optimum level <b>of</b> <b>subordination.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} holdings <b>of</b> highly-rated <b>tranches</b> <b>of</b> mortgage securitizations of American deposit-taking banks {{ahead of}} the credit crisis and evaluate hypotheses that have been advanced to explain these holdings. We find that holdings <b>of</b> highly-rated <b>tranches</b> were economically trivial for the typical bank, but banks with greater holdings performed more poorly during the crisis. Though univariate comparisons show that banks with large trading books had greater holdings, the holdings <b>of</b> highly-rated <b>tranches</b> are not higher for banks with large trading books in regressions that control for bank size. The ratio <b>of</b> highly-rated <b>tranches</b> holdings to assets increases with bank assets, but not for banks with more than $ 50 billion of assets. This evidence is inconsistent with explanations for holdings <b>of</b> highly-rated <b>tranches</b> that emphasize the incentives of banks deemed "too-big-to-fail". Further, the evidence does not provide support for "bad incentives" theories of holdings <b>of</b> highly-rated <b>tranches.</b> We find, however, that banks active in securitization held more highly-rated tranches. Such a result can be consistent with regulatory arbitrage {{as well as with}} securitizing banks holding highly-rated tranches to convince investors of the quality of these securities. Our evidence supports the latter hypothesis. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{tranching}} and tranche pricing of European securitization transactions of corporate loans and bonds. Tranching allows the originator to issue bonds with strong quality differences and thereby attract heterogeneous investors. We {{find that the}} number <b>of</b> differently rated <b>tranches</b> in a transaction is inversely related {{to the quality of}} the underlying asset pool. Credit spreads on tranches in a transaction are inversely related to the number <b>of</b> <b>tranches.</b> The average price for transferring a unit of expected default risk, paid in a transaction, is inversely related to the default probability of the underlying asset pool. The average price, paid for a tranche, increases with the rating of the tranche, it is higher for the lowest rated tranche and very high for AAA-tranches in true sale-transactions. It varies little across butterfly spreads obtained from rated tranches except for the most senior spread.

40|$|A loan “deal ” {{is often}} {{composed}} of several components (for example, a 3 -year revolving loan, a 10 -year secured senior term loan, and a 5 -year subordinated term loan). The division {{of a deal}} into two or more components, each with different risk characteristics, is called “tranching. ” This study recognizes the importance <b>of</b> <b>tranching</b> and establishes tranching as an integral component of a syndicated loan structure. In the first essay, we present a model to explain the economic value <b>of</b> <b>tranching</b> and show that riskier firms {{are more likely to}} take loans with multiple tranches. Therefore, the average credit spread on syndicated loans with multiple tranches is higher than that on nontranched loans. However, after accounting for the risk characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>tranched</b> loan, we show that a given tranche of a multi-tranche loan, on average, has a lower credit spread than an otherwise similar loan that is not part of a multi-tranche loan. We also show that the benefits <b>of</b> <b>tranching</b> accrue primarily to borrowers with speculative debt ratings.

40|$|The {{structure}} of securitization deals, {{referred to as}} ¶tranching¶, is standard. � In those transactions, claims on cash flows generated by the collateral are split into several classes of notes, at least 3 and possibly more than 5. Each class is called a tranche and has absolute priority in the cash flows over the more junior ones. Typically, investors with increasing sophistication acquire tranches with decreasing seniority. � This paper offers a model where such a slicing of claims into a stack of several debt like contracts arises endogenously as a value maximizing arrangement. It also predicts {{the relationship between the}} seniority <b>of</b> <b>tranches</b> and the sophistication of their acquirers. � It considers the situation of an issuer of asset-backed securities facing heterogeneous financial institutions. The institutions differ in their abilities to screen the collateral and retail the securities. Tranching induces good screeners to specialize on junior tranches to save retail costs, leaving senior tranches to good retailers. This may boost the price <b>of</b> junior <b>tranches</b> by increasing information collection, and improve the liquidity <b>of</b> senior <b>tranches</b> by mitigating the Winner's Curse. � The number <b>of</b> <b>tranches,</b> driven by the {{structure of}} the buy side, is arbitrary, and whether the sell side has private information or not about the collateral is irrelevant. ...|$|R
