During a post-game interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), he commented that [...] "someday, someone's {{going to make him}} eat his lunch. This is <b>something,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, that the players should take care of." [...] Recchi also mentioned revenge, not specifically from the Flyers, during an interview with the CBC. [...] "It doesn't surprise me coming from this guy. He's that type of player. He's done it before. It might not come from our team. But he better protect himself," [...] said Recchi.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Subterranean Jungle, Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism. He was {{replaced}} by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name Richie Ramone. Joey Ramone remarked that [...] " [...] saved the band as far as I'm concerned. He's the greatest thing {{to happen to the}} Ramones. He put the spirit back in the band." [...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] as well as the unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody Put <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs. I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group, because we never let anybody else write our songs." [...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody Put <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E
500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. [...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} Uematsu's {{compositions}} is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu {{has stated that}} he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat. His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is [...] "Aerith's Theme" [...] from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said [...] "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I do think there is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality." [...] He has been named one of the [...] "Innovators" [...] in Time Magazines [...] "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" [...] feature. He has also been called the [...] "John Williams of the video game world" [...] and been credited for [...] "increasing the appreciation and awareness" [...] of video game music.|$|E

[...] Despite his success in an [...] "A movie," [...] Bogart received a tepid twenty-six-week contract at $550 per week and was typecast as a gangster {{in a series of}} [...] "B movie" [...] crime dramas. Bogart was proud of his success, but the fact that it came from playing a gangster weighed on him. He once said: [...] "I can't get in a mild discussion without turning it into an argument. There must be <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> tone of voice, or this arrogant face—something that antagonizes everybody. Nobody likes me on sight.

Lamar has credited God for his fame and his deliverance from crime that often plagued Compton in the 1990s. Lamar also believes his career is divinely inspired and that he has a greater purpose to serve mankind, saying in an interview with Complex, [...] "I got a greater purpose, God put <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart to get across and that's what I'm going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done." ...|$|E

For Gerber, Howard was a flesh and blood duck and that, [...] "if Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt." [...] Gene Colan became the regular penciller with issue #4. Gerber later said to Colan: [...] "There really was almost a telepathic connection there. I would see <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, and that is what you would draw! I've never had that experience with another artist before or since." ...|$|E

[...] Several guests are featured in the video, including The B52s, Weird Al Yankovic, Spinal Tap, Ted Nugent, The Circle Jerks, Toni Basil, Rodney Bingenheimer, Holly Beth Vincent, and Afrika Bambaataa. Because the music video was praised by Warner Bros., they released [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] as a double A-side with [...] "Somebody Put <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Drink." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] was also released with [...] "Animal Boy" [...] in the United States and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] in Great Britain through Beggars Banquet Records.|$|E
2500|$|When the 1974 {{recording}} of the song was reaching {{number one on the}} country charts, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded. Parton refused. She recalls:I said, 'I'm really sorry,' and I cried all night. I mean, it was like the worst thing. You know, it's like, Oh, my God … Elvis Presley.' And other people were saying, 'You're nuts. It's Elvis Presley.' ...I said, 'I can't do that. <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart says, 'Don't do that. And I just didn't do it...

[...] "My mom, when she was younger, played violin in classical orchestras, and her mom, incidentally, was a classical musician. My mom used {{to take me to}} see classical concerts", says Blackman. [...] "My dad was into jazz – Miles Davis, Ahmad Jamal, people like that." [...] Blackman's first introduction to the drums happened when she was seven years old in her hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio and attending a pool party at a friend's house, she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set. [...] "It was incredible", says Blackman. [...] "Just looking at them struck <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them", says Blackman. [...] "And then, when I hit them, it was like, wow, that's me. That's completely natural for me. It's like breathing for me. It didn't feel awkward at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Consequently, the {{somewhat}} recently added drummer Richie Ramone {{stepped up to}} the writing process, resulting in the hit song [...] "Somebody Put <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Drink," [...] which would be released as a single and also appeared on the band's first compilation album Ramones Mania (1988). [...] "Joey was always encouraging me to write songs," [...] explained Richie, [...] "but I didn't really need the encouragement." [...] This would be the first time the band used the drummer as a songwriter since original drummer Tommy Ramone, with Joey saying he wanted to make Richie feel like a part of the band, because he felt past drummers were not {{so much a part of}} the band nor any good at writing, while calling Richie a [...] "regular Phil Collins." [...] Johnny would later say the album needed a better production quality, commenting that the guitar moments didn't sound like he had performed them. [...] "The producer on , Jean Beauvoir," [...] Johnny relates, [...] "was selected by the label, not us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Eduardo Rivadavia, editor for AllMusic, criticized the album for using more modern commercial conventions and heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards {{in an attempt}} to reinvent the band's style. Rivadavia specifically pointed out [...] "Somebody Put <b>Something</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Drink" [...] which he wrote [...] "wastes an aggressive vocal performance from Joey Ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track." [...] He goes on to call [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] "unbearably soft," [...] summing up that the album was a [...] "career low," [...] while he still rated the album three out of five stars. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] deemed both [...] "She Belongs to Me" [...] and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] to be [...] "defensive-sounding" [...] but called [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] an anthem, while also praising [...] "My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)." [...] Rolling Stone critic David Fricke called the album a [...] "reductionist masterpiece" [...] that [...] "proves they still have a lot more to give," [...] claiming it to rival previous albums Leave Home and Rocket to Russia.|$|E
2500|$|The ballad [...] "Thinkin' 'Bout My Ex" [...] {{continues}} the album's transition into a distinctly slower tempo. Backed by acoustic guitars, Jackson displays humanity in the song's topic of {{longing for a}} former companion while in a new relationship. Jackson apologizes to her current partner: [...] "When I'm holding you late at night/I'm thinkin' about my ex [...] And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart." [...] The song's theme was considered [...] "heartening" [...] and a [...] "crucial" [...] culpability. [...] "Warmth" [...] is described as an [...] "aural journey" [...] in which Jackson performs oral sex on her partner while in a moving vehicle. Jackson again displays method acting; providing descriptive details of the event over swirling ambient guitars. Whispers and moans are heard, as Jackson compliments her companion, and performs with authority over the track's minimal [...] "bass thump": [...] "Just like {{the water from the}} shore/Let your rain pour [...] But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth." [...] Jackson sings over the light sound of rain and thunder, representing climax and ecstasy. Jackson later clarified [...] "There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mouth" [...] as it was recorded.|$|E
