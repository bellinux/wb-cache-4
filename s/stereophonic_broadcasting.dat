50|$|The Crosby {{system was}} an FM <b>stereophonic</b> <b>broadcasting</b> {{standard}} developed by Murray G. Crosby. In the United States, it competed with, and ultimately lost to, the Zenith/GE system, which the FCC chose {{as the standard}} in 1961.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, he pioneered <b>stereophonic</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> The {{process he}} {{developed}} allowed a station {{to use a}} sideband of its frequency to broadcast subsidiary programming. This process was called multiplexing, and once fully instituted removed the need for two stations, and thus two receivers at the listener's end {{in order to achieve}} a stereophonic effect.|$|E
50|$|Also {{beginning}} in 1956, his acoustic laboratory studied the subjective evaluation of audio transmission quality, reproduction, and listening conditions. Steinke {{worked closely with}} sound engineers, sound designers (Tonmeisters), and production artists at the Funkhaus Berlin Nalepastrasse, focusing on experimental recordings and the acoustical properties of rooms. In 1960, he became {{the head of a}} telecommunications and broadcasting group, where he was responsible for the introduction of <b>stereophonic</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in East Germany in 1963.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, PBS member {{television}} station WGBH-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, began investigating {{uses for the}} new technology of <b>stereophonic</b> television <b>broadcasting,</b> particularly multichannel television sound (MTS), which allowed for a third audio channel, called the Secondary Audio Program (SAP). With a history of developing closed captioning of programs for hearing-impaired viewers, WGBH considered the viability of using the new audio channel for narrated descriptions of key visual elements, much like those being done for live theatre in Washington, D.C., by Margaret Pfanstiehl, who had been experimenting with television description {{as part of her}} Washington Ear radio reading service.|$|R
5000|$|Tests of six {{competing}} FM-only {{systems were}} conducted on KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during July and August 1960. [...] The Federal Communications Commission announced stereophonic FM technical standards in April 1961, with licensed regular <b>stereophonic</b> FM radio <b>broadcasting</b> set to begin in the United States on June 1, 1961. WEFM (in the Chicago area) and WGFM (in Schenectady, New York) were reported as the first stereo stations.|$|R
2500|$|A {{total of}} 2,005 Marlins were built with the {{smallest}} engine option, a [...] 232 I6. The AMC-designed [...] 4-barrel V8, often paired with an automatic transmission that had the shifter in a floor console, accounted for 42% of total production, while less than 6%, regardless of engine option, had the innovative [...] "Twin-Stick" [...] manual transmission (with overdrive). The center console-mounted controls offered one longer stick for the regular gears, with a second shorter lever for overdrive selection. It can be shifted as a 5-speed: from 1st to 2nd, to 2nd+OD, to 3rd, to 3rd+OD. Other options included [...] "Solex" [...] tinted glass (70% of production), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, [...] "Twin-Grip" [...] limited slip differential, air conditioning, adjustable steering wheel, power windows, and a choice of AM radio or an AM/FM monaural unit (50% of production) with [...] "Duo Costic" [...] rear speaker and [...] "Vibra Tone" [...] system to simulate <b>stereophonic</b> sound (stereo <b>broadcasting</b> was not yet widely available in the U.S.). Only 221 Marlins were built without a radio. Wide-ranging interior colors and upholstery choices were available, and options for the exterior, including accent colors for the roof and side window trim, enabled further customization.|$|R
5000|$|The audio (AF) input (or inputs {{in case of}} <b>stereophonic</b> <b>broadcasting)</b> {{is usually}} a signal with 15 kHz maximum {{bandwidth}} and 0 dBm maximum level. Preemphasis time constant is 50 Âµs. The signal after passing buffer stages is applied to a modulator where it modulates an intermediate frequency carrier (IF). The modulation technique is usually frequency modulation (FM) with a typical maximum deviation of 50 kHz (for 1 kHz. input at 0 dBm level).|$|E
50|$|On April 19, 1961, the FCC {{released}} its Final Order selecting the Zenith/GE system as the FM <b>stereophonic</b> <b>broadcasting</b> standard. At 9:59 AM that day, Crosby-Teletronics stock was worth $15 a share; by 2:00 P.M. {{it was down}} to less than $2.50. Another (albeit relatively minor) factor in the FCC choosing the Zenith/GE system was {{the widespread use of}} vacuum tubes in radios at the time; the additional tubes for an all-FM system would have increased the size, weight, cost of and heat generated by each tuner or receiver.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, WCRB-FM {{became the}} first Boston-area station to {{broadcast}} in multiplex stereo; {{for a few years}} prior to that, WCRB had broadcast some of its programming in stereo by carrying one channel on AM, the other on FM. WCRB was directly involved with the development of FM multiplex stereo. Station WCRB and H.H. Scott, then of Maynard, Massachusetts developed prototype stereophonic equipment that was used to prove the [...] "General Electric" [...] multiplex method being evaluated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). H.H. Scott was an early stereophonic receiver manufacturer that developed and manufactured high-quality home stereo equipment. Once the FCC approved <b>stereophonic</b> <b>broadcasting,</b> WCRB created a special [...] "stereo" [...] studio in downtown Boston, the first in the world. There was no dual channel (stereo) studio equipment at the time. Much of the equipment was handmade by the engineering staff. Many can remember the call-letter announcements, made on the half-hour as required by the FCC; [...] "You are tuned to WCRB, Waltham, thirteen-thirty AM, one-oh-two-point-five FM, with downtown studios in the elegant hotel Sheraton Plaza, featuring more than seventy hours weekly of FM stereo programming." ...|$|E
