Martin and Minerva eventually fell in love and had Finn. However, when the group of attempted escapeesled by an elderly widow (voiced by Laraine Newman)sought revenge on Martin, he fled on a boat with Finn. His escape is thwarted by the colossusrevealed to be a <b>security</b> <b>device</b> that was created to protect Founders Island from outside threatswho attacks the craft. In the chaos, the pair are separated, leaving Finn to drift away. The group is arrested and Minerva is heartbroken over Martin and Finn's disappearance.|$|E

25|$|The {{first case}} in which a {{floating}} <b>security</b> <b>device</b> was tested and upheld came a mere eight years after Holroyd v Marshall in In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co (1870) 5 Ch App 318; a remarkably quick gestation by any reckoning. The Court of Appeal held that the effect of the document was that the secured creditor could not interfere with the running of the business and its dealings with its own assets until the winding up of the company, but the occurrence of that event entitled the secured creditor to realise its security over the assets and to assert its charge in priority to the general body of creditors.|$|E
25|$|The American $100 {{bill has}} some competition, {{primarily}} from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote {{makes it easier to}} transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a <b>security</b> <b>device.</b> For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.|$|E

[...] GPS protection has met with some success. In one case, after a life-size ceramic nativity figurine disappeared from the lawn of a community center in Wellington, Florida, sheriff's deputies tracked it to an apartment where it was found lying face-down on a carpet. An 18-year-old woman was arrested.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to {{extensive}} use of Cloud services and newly evolving security threats, most cloud service providers (CSP) deploy varieties of <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> such as, firewalls, IPSec, IDS, etc. for controlling resource accesses based on the data centre security requirements. Today CSPs are looking for systematically hardening the security by incorporating multiple <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> in the network in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we present an automated framework for synthesizing data centre security configurations. We take a dummy data centre topology, CSP security (connectivity and isolation) requirements and business constraints (usability and cost) as input; and then synthesizes the correct and optimal data centre security. It determines the optimal placement of different <b>security</b> <b>devices</b> in the data centre...|$|R
