40|$|Abstract � A {{variety of}} methods to process plantar {{pressure}} distribution data are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare alternative methods to compute a pressure map from collected data. Correlation coefficients between the pressure maps were used to ascertain whether the pressure maps contain the same information. The interface pressure data of twenty subjects was collected for the data analysis with commercial GAITRite ® walkway system. <b>Stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution and pressure distributions at normal and fast walking speeds were recorded with each subject. The data was analyzed with Matlab ® software instead of the GAITRite ® software. Three alternative pressure maps (cumulative, maximum and average pressure maps) were computed from the measured data. The cumulative pressure map shows the sum of all pressure values detected with a single sensor. The maximum and average pressure maps, instead, present the maximum and mean pressure values of each sensor. The results of this study indicate that with <b>stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution, both cumulative and maximum or average pressure maps should be presented. With pressure distributions measured at walking, instead, any of the three computing methods can be used...|$|E

40|$|A 4 -channel {{microwave}} interferometer (center frequency: 60 GHz) {{has been}} constructed {{to measure the}} density profiles of plasmas confined within the Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX). LDX is {{the first and only}} experiment built to study plasmas confined by the field of a levitating, dipole magnet in a geometry that exploits plasma compressibility to achieve stability. Theoretical predictions [...] based partly on observations of planetary magnetospheres-suggest that dipole-confined plasmas will be driven by fluctuations into pressure and density profiles that are "stationary" to MHD interchange modes. The <b>stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> profile is characterized by an equal amount of entropy per flux-tube while the stationary density profile is characterized by an equal number of particles per flux-tube. These predictions are of interest to nuclear fusion research since they imply that the pressure and density profiles of dipole-confined plasmas can be simultaneously peaked and stable. Measurements with the interferometer show that the total density of LDX plasmas is strongly affected by the following parameters: levitated vs. mechanical support of the central dipole coil; input ECRH frequency and power; background pressure of neutral particles; plasma species. The gradients of the density profiles are, however, largely independent of the experimental conditions and approximate the value predicted for the stationary profile. Non-linear analyses suggest that dipole-confined plasmas are maintained in their <b>stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> and density profiles by a process of self-organized convection. We present measurements indicating that this self-organization process is observed in LDX. by Alexander C. Boxer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the acoustic behavior of a liner in a rectangular channel with grazing ow has been conducted. The liner is a locally reacting structure. When increasing the velocity of the grazing ow the transmission coecient increases at resonance frequency. The transmission coecient can become close to 1 and the liner produces acoustical energy instead of dissipating it. This ampli cation of the sound wave is accompanied {{by an increase in}} the <b>stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> drop induced by the liner. This eect is attributed to a modication of the ow induced by the acoustic wave. Thus, the ow is measured using PIV imaging technique and a comparison of velocity maps with and without sound excitation is performed. It is shown that the convection of large ow structures accompanies the sound amplication phenomenon. Some evidence of an hydrodynamic instability are thus given. ...|$|E

30|$|Once the {{resonance}} {{frequency of the}} tube is set, the device can start working. The sound coming from the woofer creates a standing wave in the tube. The air parcels in the tube start oscillating back and forth. The standing wave {{is associated with a}} <b>stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> and velocity fields as the particles are oscillating between two points, each at a different pressure. The alternation of compression and rarefaction of the gas causes the local temperature of the gas to oscillate with it due to the adiabatic nature of sound waves. During {{the first half of the}} oscillation, the particles move and reach a high-pressure area. Due to the pressure increase, they shrink, and consequentially, the local temperature rises. In this phase, the hot and shrunk parcels are able to transfer heat to the nearby stack wall if the latter is colder than the gas parcels. Similarly, when the parcels oscillate back to a low-pressure area, the rarefaction of the gas causes the local temperature to drop, and if the temperature of the parcels becomes lower than that of the walls, heat is transferred from the walls to the parcels.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the acoustical behaviour of a liner in a rectangu- lar channel with grazing flow has been conducted. The liner consists of a ceramic structure of parallel square channels: 1 mm by 1 mm in cross section, 65 mm in length, and a surface density of 400 channels/inch square. The channels are rigidly terminated, thus constituting a locally reacting structure. In the absence of flow the liner reacts classically: There is {{a significant decrease in}} transmission coefficient around the frequency of minimal impedance. When the wall is exposed to a grazing flow this behaviour is changed: an increase in transmission coefficient appears at this resonance frequency. The transmission coefficient can be even rise above 1 (up to 3 for a Mach number of 0. 3). This behaviour is caused by the appearance of a hydrodynamic instability above the liner. Furthermore, the <b>stationary</b> <b>pressure</b> drop induced by this liner is deeply affected by its acoustic behaviour. When a sound wave is added, at the resonance frequency of the liner, the pressure drop can increase by a factor 3 when the Mach number is 0. 3. This effect is attributed to a modification of the turbulent boundary layer induced by the acoustic wave...|$|E
