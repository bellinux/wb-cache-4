5|$|A <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a {{detailed}} White Paper {{was published in}} December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{intermediate}} program representation form, the Restricted Permutation Trees (RPT), and describe its construction and semantics via rewrite rules along with proofs of correctness. The RPT inherently reflects {{most of the}} legal permutations of the <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program and hence is suited to optimizations that involve code reordering. We illustrate the use of RPTs for performing Register Allocation and Instruction Scheduling, the performance of both of which depends upon the ordering of <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program. 1 Introduction The performance of many compiler optimizations depends upon the order of <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> the program. For example, the data cache hit rates are high if the <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program are ordered such that locality of variable accesses are high. Pipeline stalls are reduced if the <b>statements</b> <b>in</b> a program are ordered such that adjacent instructions are as independent as possible. In every case, the ordering of statements should ensure that the semantics o [...] ...|$|R

5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic. The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in a synagogue reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. The ADL {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of Jews, {{and the fact that the}} character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published the strip, issued a similar <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing the strip.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, Faramir {{is played by}} David Wenham. The actor jokes that he got the role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses. Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> Unfinished Tales, lacked beards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} days of the blockade, someone managed to smuggle a letter out of the Jewish quarter to the Jewish {{leadership}} in Constantinople. It was not until March 27 that the leaders of the Jewish community in the Ottoman capital forwarded it to the Rothschild family, together with a similar call for help from the Jews of Damascus. To these documents, the Jewish leaders attached their own <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> which they cast doubt on their ability to influence the sultan.|$|E

5|$|Brodie died {{nine months}} before {{publication}} of the book. As death neared, the cancer spread to her brain and bones, and Brodie experienced intense pain. During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to “give me a blessing,” although she had long been estranged from both her brother and the LDS Church. A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a priesthood blessing should not be misinterpreted as a request {{to return to the}} Church. It was Brodie’s last signed <b>statement.</b> <b>In</b> accordance with her wishes, friends spread her ashes over the Santa Monica Mountains, which she loved and had successfully helped to protect from real estate development.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|From here Alcibiades {{joined in}} the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a <b>statement</b> <b>in</b> the midst of the fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
