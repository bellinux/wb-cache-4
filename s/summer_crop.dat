500|$|As Domoina {{made its}} final {{landfall}} in Mozambique, it dropped heavy rainfall reaching [...] {{in the town}} of Goba over a five-day period. Rainfall in the capital Maputo, reaching [...] over two days, was about 40% of the annual total. After flooding occurred further south in South Africa, waters were released from the Pongolapoort Dam without warning. This caused many farmers to drown in southern Mozambique. Officials later advised residents along the Maputo River to evacuate to higher grounds, and thousands had to leave their houses. The storm flooded the Maputo, Umbeluzi, Incomati river basins, causing widespread power outages. The storm left the capital Maputo without clean water for several days after a pumping station was damaged, and the main harbor in the city was closed. Also in the city, the storm downed hundreds of trees, wrecked roofs, and damaged houses; about 10,000people were left homeless nationwide. The storm damaged 28pumping stations nationwide and destroyed over 50small dams. Floods affected the railroad connecting Maputo to South Africa, disrupted the construction of a dam, and damaged portions of a bridge near Boane. Transport was disrupted in the northern and southern portion of the country. There was widespread crop damage in Mozambique, affecting 350,000farmers, and flooding about [...] of fields. After an extended drought, many farmers had moved closer to river beds, making their fields more vulnerable. About 119,000tons of fruits, vegetables, and other crops were wrecked, consisting of much of the <b>summer</b> <b>crop,</b> and about 5,000cattle died. About 49,000people lost everything they owned. In the country, the storm caused 109fatalities, and damage was estimated at $75million.|$|E

40|$|<b>Summer</b> <b>crops,</b> {{including}} soybeans and corn, {{represent an}} important position in Brazilian international trade market. Therefore {{it is essential}} to have reliable information about crop acreage and yields. This study aims to compare three different methods of image segmentation, "Isoseg/Isodata", "K-Means" and "Parallelepiped", in order to establish the most appropriate algorithm for generating crop masks of corn and soybean using NDVI MODIS temporal image compositions. After the <b>summer</b> <b>crops</b> masks where produced using the three image segmentation algorithms, their respective areas where calculated and compared {{with each other and with}} estimates released by IBGE. It was concluded that the segmentation algorithm "Isoseg/Isodata" showed the best results and can be used as an alternative for mapping <b>summer</b> <b>crops.</b> Pages: 379 - 38...|$|R
2500|$|Part of the Sunderbans is {{shielded}} from tidal inflow by levees and there one finds villages and agriculture. During the monsoon season, [...] the low lying agricltural lands are waterlogged and the <b>summer</b> <b>crop</b> (kharif crop) is therefore mainly deepwater rice or floating rice. In the dry winter season {{the land is}} normally uncropped and used for cattle grazing. However, the lands near the villages are irrigated from ponds that were filled up during monsoon, and vegetable crops (rabi crops) can be grown here.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on the {{cultivar}} and conditions, tuberous roots mature {{in two to}} nine months. With care, early-maturing cultivars can {{be grown}} as an annual <b>summer</b> <b>crop</b> in temperate areas, such as the northern United States and China. Sweet potatoes rarely flower when the daylight is longer than 11 hours, as is normal outside of the tropics. They are mostly propagated by stem or root cuttings or by adventitious shoots called [...] "slips" [...] that grow out from the tuberous roots during storage. True seeds are used for breeding only.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{species of}} bamboo, the [...] "Payong" [...] and [...] "Praong" [...] of the Lepchas, here replace the Pao {{of the lower}} regions. The former was {{flowering}} abundantly, {{the whole of the}} culms (which were 20 feet high) being a diffuse panicle of inflorescence. The [...] "Praong" [...] bears a round head of flowers at the ends of the leafy branches. Wild strawberry, violet, geranium, etc., announced our approach to the temperate zone. Around the temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet, yam, brinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic leaves), and cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a <b>summer</b> <b>crop,</b> at 7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from the Dorjiling stock) cultivated as a winter crop in the plains, is superior both in size and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part of Sikkim, apparently from the want of sun; the tree grows well at from 3000 to 7000 feet elevation, and flowers abundantly; the fruit making the nearest approach to maturity (according to the elevation) from July to October. At Dorjiling it follows the English seasons, flowering in March and fruiting in September, when the scarce reddened and still hard fruit falls from the tree. In the plains of India, both this and the plum ripen in May, but the fruits are very acid.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the extent of heavy metal contamination in the Philippi horticultural area in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in the irrigation water, soils and vegetables in both winter and <b>summer</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons with an ICP-AES and tested against certified standards. Differences were found in heavy metal concentrations between the winter and <b>summer</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons in the irrigation water, soils and vegetables. Certain heavy metals exceeded the maximum permissible concentrations in the irrigation water, soils and vegetables produced in South Africa. These toxic concentrations were predominantly found in the <b>summer</b> <b>cropping</b> season for the soils and in the crops produced in winter. It is thus suggested that further studies are carried out in the Philippi horticultural area to determine the sources of the heavy metals to try and mitigate the inputs thereof and therefore reduce the amount of heavy metals entering the human food chain.

40|$|Excessive {{drainage}} {{of water}} beyond the root zone of agricultural plants is complicit in causing extensive dryland salinity in southern Australia. Opportunistically sowing <b>summer</b> forage <b>crops</b> within winter cereal rotations {{could be a}} flexible means of reducing this deep drainage whilst achieving additional livestock production. A simulation-based feasibility {{study was conducted to}} assess the effectiveness of <b>summer</b> forage <b>cropping</b> in altering the water balance and to predict any adverse effects on winter crop yield. At the study location in southern New South Wales an average of 37 % of the 557 mm annual rainfall falls outside wheat growing season, i. e., in the summer fallow period. <b>Summer</b> cowpea. <b>crops</b> planted in the fallow period were predicted to yield 1. 3 t/ha of biomass on average (range of 0 - 5. 7 t/ha) if sown every year. Crops failed to establish in 1 year out of 5, and predicted yield failed to exceed 1. 0 t/ha in 52 % of years. Compared with a wheat-fallow scenario, the wheat-cowpea systems increased evapotranspiration outside the wheat growing season by up to 40 % depending on surnmercrop frequency. Continuous wheat-cowpea cropping reduced deep drainage by 62 % but also reduced yields of following wheat crops by 13 %. Opportunistic <b>summer</b> <b>cropping</b> was less effective than continuous <b>summer</b> <b>cropping</b> in terms of total deep drainage reduction but produced more biomass per crop sown, and incurred smaller yield penalties on wheat. The simulation results suggest that opportunistic <b>summer</b> forage <b>cropping</b> is effective in reducing deep drainage and, compared to luceme phase farming systems, offers greater management flexibility and smaller winter crop yield penalties. Further studies are needed on the practicality and economic benefit of the proposed <b>summer</b> forage <b>cropping.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
6000|$|Wordsworth {{passed the}} winter of 1806-7 in a house of Sir George Beaumont's, at Coleorton in Leicestershire, the cottage at Grasmere having become too small for his {{increased}} family. On {{his return to the}} Vale of Grasmere he rented the house at Allan Bank, where he lived three years. During this period he appears to have written very little poetry, for which his biographer assigns as a primary reason the smokiness of the Allan Bank chimneys. This will hardly account for the failure of the <b>summer</b> <b>crop,</b> especially as Wordsworth composed chiefly in the open air. It did not prevent him from writing a pamphlet upon the Convention of Cintra, which was published too late to attract much attention, though Lamb says that its effect upon him was like that which one of Milton's tracts might have had upon a contemporary.[343] It was at Allan Bank that Coleridge dictated [...] "The Friend," [...] and Wordsworth contributed to it two essays, one in answer to a letter of Mathetes[344] (Professor Wilson), and the other on Epitaphs, republished in the Notes to [...] "The Excursion." [...] Here also he wrote his [...] "Description of the Scenery of the Lakes." [...] Perhaps a truer explanation of the comparative silence of Wordsworth's Muse during these years {{is to be found in}} the intense interest which he took in current events, whose variety, picturesqueness, and historical significance were enough to absorb all the energies of his imagination.|$|E
