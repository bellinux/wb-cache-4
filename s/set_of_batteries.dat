A few years later {{it was out of}} service because of the need to acquire a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries,</b> which in turn, never happened. After unsuccessful attempts of selling it to a foreign buyer, it was offered to various museums in Croatia with a final destination still pending.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{minister}} at the time, Berislav Rončević, explained that because Croatia was to join NATO {{in the spring}} 2008, {{it would be a}} part of the collective defense of the entire alliance, and the need to develop all aspects of the defence system, including a submarine force, would be unnecessary. In 2007 it was confirmed that the submarine was put up for sale through the state-owned [...] "Alan Agency" [...] that deals with weapons sales, with a starting price of 8million Croatian kunas (approximately 1.07million Euros). Acting commander of the Croatian Navy at the time, Ante Urlić, among other propositions, mentioned the possibility of installing a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries,</b> sonar and overhauling the submarine. Fully operational, Velebit would then be sold for a much higher price of around 15 million euros. Considering the potential overhaul and sale didn't happen, a decision was made to donate the submarine to a museum.|$|E

This approach offers significantly more flexibility during design <b>of</b> the <b>battery</b> system since the characteristics <b>of</b> the individual <b>battery</b> kinds can be combined advantageously. In this work a method has been developed which automatically dimensions an optimized battery system for defined vehicle requirements and a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> cells.

50|$|Priroda was {{originally}} designed to carry a deployable solar array. However, due to delays, {{and the fact that}} solar arrays were planned for other parts of Mir, a solar array {{was not included in the}} launch configuration. Instead, during free flight, Priroda was powered by two redundant <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> totaling 168. Priroda had an unpressurized instrument compartment and a habitable instrument/payload compartment. The unpressurized compartment contained propulsion system components, EVA handrails, and scientific equipment. The instrument/payload compartment was divided into two sections: an outer instrument section and an inner habitation and work compartment. Experiments on Priroda were provided by twelve different nations. These experiments covered microwave, visible, near infrared, and infrared spectral regions using both passive and active sounding methods.|$|R

In dynamic system, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> pack comprised with multi-ple cells are used to provide a required output voltage, where the performance and relia-bility <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> are seriously concerned. A smart and adaptive battery {{management system}} is able to monitor battery cells in real-time, also to control the power operation on batteries.

This thesis aims to design a 48 V power unit with 12 cells <b>of</b> lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> A battery management system with LTC 6803 - 2 is applied to give a real-time monitor on each cell’s voltage, state of charge and operation status. Besides, a graphic user interface is designed in software to implement all function in the aspect of users. Based on all the measurement results displayed on screen in real-time, a user is able to make a decision on batteries performance and then put forward controlling on batteries.

We make use of a large data <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> charge readings from real users and construct two computationally inexpensive machine learning classifiers to predict if a user session is authentic: the first one only based on the battery charge at a certain time of day; the second one predicts the authenticity of the user session when a previous, recent battery charge reading is available.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 This {{research}} {{focuses on}} events surrounding the activities <b>of</b> <b>Battery</b> Freeman, a coastal defense facility constructed within the earthworks of "old" Fort Stevens near Astoria, OR, in 1900 and destroyed in 1939. Archival data are {{used in conjunction with}} nearly 5, 000 artifacts that were recovered from archaeological excavations in 1989 by the Oregon State University Field School, to reconstruct the history of the facility. Archival information provided a detailed representation <b>of</b> the spatial <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Battery</b> Freeman with respect to the original earthworks of Old Fort Stevens. In addition, this information detailed the timing and progress of and materials used in the construction <b>of</b> the <b>battery.</b> Spatial, temporal, and typological analyses were conducted on the artifacts. The great majority of the artifacts are associated with Battery Freeman architecture. Many of these artifacts were homogenously distributed throughout a "fill unit" reflecting the leveling and bulldozing of the site. However, several primary features were preserved, including a remnant of the east bulkhead wall of the pre- 1900 structure and an incinerator feature apparently used in the battery. The spatial context of artifacts associated with these features could be interpreted with greater confidence...|$|R

30|$|The {{detailed}} formulation {{is described}} as follows. j, t, k, s are the indices of wind farms, time points, battery energy storage, scenarios, respectively. W is the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> wind farms. BAT is the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> storage plants. T 1 and T 2 are the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> deterministic/stochastic optimization time periods, respectively. S 1 and S 2 are the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> deterministic and stochastic scenarios, respectively. If there is no specific explanation, k ∈ BAT, j ∈ W, t ∈ T_ 1 ∪ T_ 2, s ∈ S_ 1 ∪ S_ 2. Equation (17) defines the objective to maximize the profit of the wind-BESS. Equation (17) includes the revenue from the energy market, the cost <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> degradation, the cost of wind curtailment (if any), and the cost due to power deviation penalty. For the deterministic optimization period, ρ_s = 1. Equation (18) defines the revenue from net output/input to the grid. Equations (19) and (20) define the costs of BESS degradation and power deviation penalties, respectively. Equation (21) defines the wind power curtailment cost. Equation (22) represents the net power output/input of the wind-BESS. Equation (23) is the wind power curtailment constraint. Equations (24)–(26) set power limits for BESS charging/discharging levels, indicating the BESS cannot charge and discharge at the same time. Equations (27) and (28) represent the SoC limits, {{and the relationship between}} SoC and the BESS charging/discharging behavior. Note that the SoC at the end of H− 1 in S 1 must be the same as the SoC at the beginning of H in S 2.
