50|$|Customers may {{instead be}} <b>seated</b> at the <b>bar,</b> and indeed if no {{customers}} can be {{seated at a}} table, then one customer must be <b>seated</b> at the <b>bar</b> that turn. The bar is an area {{in the center of}} the board consisting of 20 seats, in four rows of five. If you seat a customer at the bar then you will lose or gain points - the amount indicated on the bar stool. This is cleverly done, as the first five seats gain you points, so there's no harm in sitting there. However, the next fifteen seats have negative values, that increases across each row of seats, but then falls back at the start of the next row. Getting good <b>seats</b> at the <b>bar</b> for your customers becomes very much a game of cat and mouse.|$|R
