40|$|We {{simulate}} in {{one dimension}} the magnetic <b>shearing</b> <b>instability</b> for a vertical magnetic field penetrating a Keplerian accretion disc. An initial equilibrium state is perturbed {{by adding a}} single eigenmode of the <b>shearing</b> <b>instability</b> and the subsequent evolution is followed into the nonlinear regime. Assuming that the perturbation is the most rapidly growing eigenmode, the linear theory remains applicable until the magnetic pressure perturbation {{is strong enough to}} induce significant deviations from the original density. If the initial perturbation is not the fastest growing mode, the faster growing modes will appear after some time. 1 Introduction Balbus and Hawley (1991) realised that a Keplerian accretion disc penetrated by a vertical magnetic field is unstable to a <b>shearing</b> <b>instability</b> previously described by Velikhov (1959) and Chandrasekhar (1960).

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} part of {{the velocity}} autocorrelation function of a granular fluid in the homogeneous cooling state has been calculated by using mode-coupling theory for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions. The existence of the <b>shearing</b> <b>instability,</b> leading to a divergent behavior of the velocity flow fluctuations, is taken into account. A time region in which the velocity autocorrelation function exhibits a power law decay, when time {{is measured by the}} number of collisions per particle, has been been identified. Also the explicit form of the exponential asymptotic long time decay has been obtained. The theoretical prediction for the power law decay is compared with molecular dynamics simulation results, and a good agreement is found, after taking into account finite size corrections.

40|$|We {{show how}} the level of {{turbulence}} in accretion disks {{can be derived from}} a self-consistency requirement that the associated e+ective viscosity should match the instantaneous accretion rate. This method is applicable when turbulence has a direct energy cascade. Only limited information on the origin and properties of the turbulence, such as its injection scale and anisotropy, is needed. The method is illustrated by considering the case of turbulence originating from the magnetic <b>shearing</b> <b>instability.</b> The corresponding e+ective kinematic viscosity coefficient is shown to scale as the 1 / 3 power of surface mass density at a given radius in optically thick disks, and to be describable by a Shakura-Sunyaev law with aB 0. 04. Mass ow in disks fed at a localized hot spot is calculated for accretion regimes driven by such turbulence, as well as passive magnetic eld di+usion and dragging. An important result of this analysis is that thin disks supported by turbulence driven by the magnetic <b>shearing</b> <b>instability,</b> and more generally any turbulence with injection scale of order of the disk thickness, are very low magnetic Reynolds number systems. Turbulent viscosity-driven solutions with negligible eld dragging and no emission of cold winds or jets are natural consequences of such regimes. Disks of accreting objects that are magnetized enough to be shielded by a magnetopause, however, may not operate in their innermost regions in the magnetic <b>shearing</b> <b>instability</b> regime. The possibility therefore remains to be explored of centrifugally driven winds emanating from such regions.

40|$|This letter {{investigates the}} effect of <b>shear</b> on Rayleigh-Taylor <b>instability</b> (RTI). Even simple uniform shear {{strongly}} influences the instability; longer waves are completely stabilized when density stratification is large (higher Atwood numbers). This apparently counter-intuitive result {{is due to the}} presence of Atwood number in the shear term. When the unstable density interface is embedded in a shear layer, shear is again found to stabilize the RTI. However, this configuration introduces additional unstable <b>shear</b> <b>instability</b> modes in the lower wavenumber regime. A new type of <b>shear</b> <b>instability,</b> whose growth rate increases with Atwood number, plays a dominant role, while Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which was previously understood to be the only possible <b>shear</b> <b>instability</b> in this context, has little significance. Hence the billows observed in the nonlinear stages of RTI, which are usually attributed to KHI, may actually be the nonlinear manifestation of this new instability...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the consequences of}} magnetic buoyancy and the magnetic <b>shearing</b> <b>instability</b> (MSI) on the strength and organization of the magnetic field in a thin accretion disk. We discuss a model in which the wave-driven dynamo growth rate is balanced by the dissipative effects of the MSI. As in earlier work, the net helicity is due to small advective motions driven by nonlinear interactions between internal waves. Assuming a simple model of the internal wave spectrum generated from the primary m = 1 internal waves, {{we find that the}} magnetic energy density saturates at about (H/r) exp 4 / 3 times the local pressure (where H is the disk thickness and r is its radius). On very small scales the <b>shearing</b> <b>instability</b> will produce an isotropic fluctuating field. For a stationary disk this is equivalent to a dimensionless 'viscosity' of about (H/r) exp 4 / 3. The vertical and radial diffusion coefficients will be comparable to each other.

We present a rough estimate of its effects and find that it removes magnetic flux from the disk at a rate comparable to that caused by turbulent diffusion...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} linear <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> often use simple {{velocity}} and density profiles (e. g. constant, piecewise) for obtaining good {{qualitative and quantitative}} predictions of the initial disturbances. Furthermore, such simple profiles provide a minimal model for obtaining a mechanistic understanding of otherwise elusive <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities.</b> However, except a few specific cases, the efficacy of simple profiles has remained limited to the linear stability paradigm. In this work we have proposed a general framework that can simulate the fully nonlinear evolution {{of a variety of}} stratified <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> as well as wave-wave and wave-topography interaction problems having simple profiles. To this effect, we have modified the classical vortex method by extending the Birkhoff-Rott equation to multiple interfaces, and furthermore, have incorporated background shear across a density interface. The latter is more subtle, and originates from the understanding that Bernoulli's equation is not just limited to irrotational flows, but can be modified to make it applicable for piecewise velocity profiles. We have solved diverse problems that can be essentially reduced to the multiple interacting interfaces paradigm, e. g. spilling and plunging breakers, stratified <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> like Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield, jet flows, and even wave-topography interaction problem like Bragg resonance.

The model for wave growth involves instability due to the wind shear resulting from the cirrus outflow. This model is based on an equation for the waves' phase speed which is similar to the Helmholtz equation. It, however, does not assume an incompressible atmosphere, but rather assumes density is a logarithmic function of height.

40|$|Abstract. As the {{deformation}} of chip increases with cutting speed, the morphology of chip changes from continuous to serrated type.

A new analytical model for predicting adiabatic shear critical condition in orthogonal cutting is proposed by considering cutting conditions and properties of workpiece material. It is found that the influence of shear strain on the onset of adiabatic shear could be neglected. The shear strain rate and temperature, however, play a leading role on the onset of adiabatic shear. At lower cutting speed the shear strain rate plays a dominant role while at higher cutting speed the situation is just the reverse. With the increase of cutting speed, the yield stress, material characteristic constant and uncut chip thickness will facilitate adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>instability,</b> while the coefficient of strain rate hardening, coefficient of strain hardening, coefficient of thermal softening, thermal diffusivity and tool rake angle have negative effect on adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>instability...</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} on two-dimensional convection {{with or without}} a vertical magnetic field reveal a bewildering variety of periodic and aperiodic oscillations. Steady rolls can develop a <b>shearing</b> <b>instability,</b> in which rolls turning over in one direction grow at the expense of rolls turning over in the other, resulting in a net shear across the layer. As the temperature difference across the fluid is increased, two-dimensional pulsating waves occur, in which the direction of shear alternates. We analyse the nonlinear dynamics of this behaviour by first constructing appropriate low-order sets of ordinary differential equations, which show the same behaviour, and then analysing the global bifurcations that lead to these oscillations by constructing one-dimensional return maps. We compare the behaviour of the partial differential equations, the models and the maps in systematic two-parameter studies of both the magnetic and the non-magnetic cases, emphasising how the symmetries of periodic solutions change as a result of global bifurcations.

40|$|Hsu, Tian-JianTo better {{understand}} the turbulent coherent structures in the coastal environments, we report 3 D Large-eddy simulation (LES) study of wave breaking processes in the surf zone, and <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> in an idealized buoyant plume at high Reynolds number. For the simulation of breaking waves, the numerical model is implemented using the open-source CFD toolbox, OpenFOAM®, in which the incompressible three-dimensional filtered Navier-Stokes equations for the water and air phases are solved with a finite volume scheme. A Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to capture {{the evolution of the}} water-air interface. The numerical model is validated with measured free surface elevation, turbulence averaged flow velocity, turbulent intensity for solitary wave and periodic wave conditions in a laboratory wave flume and near-prototype scale large wave flume. For the first time, simulated intermittency of breaking wave turbulence over barred beach are compared with observation. Simulation results show that during the initial overturning of the breaking wave, 2 -D horizontal rollers are generated, and can further evolve into a couple of 3 -D hairpin vortices. Some of these vortices are sufficiently intense to impinge onto the bed. These hairpin vortices possess counter-rotating and downburst features, which are key characteristics of obliquely descending eddies (ODEs) observed by earlier laboratory studies using Particle Image Velocimetry. Simulation results also confirm that as the ODEs approach the bottom, significant bottom shear stress is generated. Remarkably, the collapse of ODEs onto the bed can also cause drastic spatial and temporal changes of dynamic pressure on the bottom. By allowing sediment to be suspended from the bar crest, intermittently high sediment suspension events and their correlation with high turbulence and/or high bottom shear stress events are investigated for a periodic wave train. The simulated intermittency of sediment suspension is similar to previous field and large wave flume observations. Coherent suspension events account for only 10 % of the record but account for about 50 % of the sediment load. Model results further suggest that about 60 ~ 70 % of coherent bottom stress events are associated with surface-generated turbulence. Nearly all the coherent sand suspension events are associated with coherent turbulence events due to wave-breaking turbulence approaching the bed. <b>Shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> are responsible for major turbulent mixing in estuaries. However, most estuarine models adopt hydrostatic pressure assumption and the grid resolution used are not sufficient to resolve <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities.</b> In this study, the numerical investigation focused on resolving <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> and their surface signature in an idealized buoyant plume at high Reynolds number using the non-hydrostatic surface and terrain-following coastal circulation model NHWAVE. The Reynolds number of the resolved <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the simulation exceed 1. 2 × 106, which is similar to that observed in the Connecticut River plume. Using 80 million grid points with grid size approaching the observed Ozmidov length scale, simulation with standard Smagorinsky closure can reproduce the observed <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> with a similar length scale and turbulent dissipation rate. By examining the resolved energy spectrum, about one order of magnitude of energy cascade (- 5 / 3 slope) is resolved. Moreover, model results show high turbulence in braids instead of cores of <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities,</b> which is similar to the field observations. By computing the horizontal surface divergence to represent surface signatures, model results clearly indicate that <b>shear</b> <b>instabilities</b> can leave unique surface signatures which may be detected by remote sensing imagery.
