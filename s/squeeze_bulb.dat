5000|$|Akin {{to water}} droppers, the oldest known {{manufactured}} water guns utilized a simple rubber <b>squeeze</b> <b>bulb</b> into which water could be drawn, then forcibly expelled out the nozzle by squeezing the bulb rapidly. [...] This design has inherent limitations regarding {{the amount of}} pressure that one can achieve (fully dependent on the user's hand gripping strength) {{as well as the}} need to refill after each shot.|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the MDI, asthma medication was delivered using a <b>squeeze</b> <b>bulb</b> nebulizer which was fragile and unreliable. [...] The relatively crude nature of these devices also meant that the particles that they generated were relatively large, too large for effective drug delivery to the lungs. [...] Nonetheless these nebulizers paved the way for inhalation drug delivery providing the inspiration for the MDI.|$|E
50|$|The PPV may be {{considered}} a forerunner of the modern velomobile. This tricycle was manufactured with a three-speed, floor shift, open type transmission with a single-wheel drive. Either the driver or the passenger could pedal independently or as a team. Reverse was accomplished by reaching outside and turning one of the rear wheels by hand. At one time, a rear-hinged, surrey top was available. Most were manufactured with a dark blue bottom and a white hood. Red or yellow bottoms with white tops were also offered. Sometimes bicycle accessories were added, e.g. <b>squeeze</b> <b>bulb</b> horn and a rear view mirror.|$|E

50|$|Bicycles {{often have}} a classic bulb horn, {{operated}} by <b>squeezing</b> a rubber <b>bulb</b> attached to a metal horn. <b>Squeezing</b> the <b>bulb</b> forces air through a steel reed located in the throat of the horn, making it vibrate, producing a single note. The flaring horn matches the acoustic impedance of the reed to the open air, radiating the sound waves efficiently, making the sound louder. Other types of horns used on bicycles include battery-operated horns (sometimes even car horns on 12-volt circuits are incorporated) and small air horns powered by a small can of compressed gas.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{specialty}} dildos are available, such as {{ones that}} expand when an attached inflator bulb is squeezed, simulate ejaculation by releasing warm water on demand when a reservoir is compressed, or function as enema nozzles, allowing an enema {{to be given}} while using the strap-on for anal intercourse. Inflatable dildos generally expand in girth when inflated (they usually come with a simple hand-squeeze inflator bulb), allowing the dildo to keep expanding during intercourse as the receiver slowly stretches, giving a unique completely filled feeling which is hard to obtain using normal dildos. Ejaculating dildos contain a <b>squeeze</b> <b>bulb</b> or other reservoir, which when filled with hot water beforehand, allows the wearer to [...] "come" [...] into the receiver at the proper moment. Enema nozzle dildos contain tubing connections, and when used for anal penetration (most often with silicone lube, as water-soluble lube would quickly break down when combined with an enema) allow the receiver to receive an enema during intercourse. Some BDSM mistresses specialize in offering this service. A relatively new product in this field is dildos with electrodes for erotic electrostimulation, further increasing the range of sensations the receiver can experience.|$|E
5000|$|Brush Motor Car Company (1907-1909), {{later the}} Brush Runabout Company (1909-1913), {{was based in}} Highland Park, Michigan. The company was founded by Alanson Partridge Brush (February 10, 1878 in Michigan [...] - [...] March 6, 1952 in Michigan), who {{designed}} a light car with a wooden chassis (actually, wooden rails and iron cross-members), friction drive transmission and [...] "underslung" [...] coil springs in tension instead of compression {{on both sides of}} each axle. Although there were many makes of small runabouts of similar size and one to four cylinders at this time (before the Model T Ford dominated the low-price market), the Brush has many unusual design details showing the inventiveness of its creator. Power was provided by a large single-cylinder water-cooled engine. Two gas-powered headlamps provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim. The horn was located next to the engine cover, with a metal tube running to a <b>squeeze</b> <b>bulb</b> affixed near the driver. A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat.|$|E
40|$|The {{inhalation}} therapies were in use since ancient {{time and}} had their origin in India 4000 years ago. The inhalationtherapies include smoking of datura preparations for asthma and other lung complaints, which have come from thetraditional Ayurvedic therapies practised in India. The datura roots containing potent alkaloids with anticholinergicbronchodilating properties along with ginger and pepper were powdered and made into a paste for smearing on areed which is then dried and then smoked through a pipe. In late 18 th and 19 th century earthenware inhalers werepopular for inhalation of plants infusion and other ingredients. The atomizers and nebulizers were later developed inmid 1800 century {{as a response to}} the outgrowth of perfume industry. The spray technology was developed for theeffervescent waters at the thermal spas. In 20 th century combustible powders and cigarettes containing drugs for thetreatment of long complaints became popular. Subsequently hand-bulb nebulizers were developed and weresuccessful in the treatment of asthma using epinephrine. The drug was delivered by hand <b>squeeze</b> <b>bulb</b> nebulizer, butfailed to continue due to its fragile nature and the dose varied with the hand pressure [1]. The development of thefirst pressurized metered dose inhaler was the milestone in the development of inhaled drugs. The advancement inthe technology have influenced greatly by the scientific developments in several areas like theoretical modelling indirect measure of lung deposition, particle sizing techniques and invitro deposition studies. The present era are seenwith a rapid advancement in technological progress in inhaled drug delivery and applications of aerosol science insystemic therapy, gene replacement therapy, use of immunosuppressants and antimicrobials and specific targeting ofinhaled drugs [2]...|$|E

50|$|The hornophone is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} composed {{of a number of}} reed bulb horns, typically used as vehicle horns, clamped into a metal frame. The arrangement of the horns is much like a xylophone or glockenspiel, tuned to a heptatonic scale. Ordinarily there is either a higher or lower rack or mounting of horns tuned to sharps and flats, like the black notes of a musical keyboard. The instrument is typically played standing, by <b>squeezing</b> the <b>bulbs</b> of the horns.|$|R
50|$|Pasteur {{pipettes}} {{can also}} be used for microscale distillation. The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a boiling chip and heated to reflux one-half to two-thirds of the way up the inside of the tube. After <b>squeezing</b> the <b>bulb</b> to expel air, a pasteur pipette is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid (into the vapor). The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip, causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette.|$|R

5000|$|The term bulb is a {{reference}} to old-style pneumatically actuated shutters; <b>squeezing</b> an air <b>bulb</b> would open the shutter, and releasing the bulb would close it.

50|$|In {{infectious}} disease control a smoke test {{is done to}} see whether a room is under negative pressure. A tube containing smoke is held {{near the bottom of}} the negative pressure room door, about two inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently <b>squeezing</b> the <b>bulb.</b> Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not at negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{recommended}} to use pasteur pipettes for work involving accuracy since pasteur pipettes are not designed to measure specific volume; however, {{it can be used}} to add drops of reagents. Before using a pasteur pipette, the tip should be carefully examined for cracks. To increase accuracy, the pipette is to be rinsed with the reagent. To use the pipette, <b>squeeze</b> the <b>bulb</b> to expel air out of the pipette and submerge the tip of the pipette to the solution vertically. Gently relax the bulb to draw the solution up and make sure that the solution does not overshoot into the bulb contaminating it. To dispense the reagent, hold the tip against the side of the target container at a 30 to 45 degrees angle.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the first}} visit, Tudor tested each child's I.Q. and {{identified}} {{whether they were}} left-handed or right-handed. A popular theory at the time held that stuttering {{was caused by a}} cerebral imbalance. If, for example, a person was born left-handed but was using their right hand, their nerve impulses would misfire, affecting their speech. Johnson did not believe the theory, but still suggested Tudor test each child's handedness. She had them draw on chalkboards and <b>squeeze</b> the <b>bulb</b> of the dynamometer. Most were right-handed, but left-handed children were present in all the groups. There was no correlation between handedness and speech in this subject crop.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to syringes in the 1970s {{was to use}} a glass medicine dropper, supposedly easier to manipulate with one hand.

40|$|The Vital- 2 unit pictured is a {{semi-automatic}} {{device that}} permits highly accurate blood pressure measurement, even by untrained personnel. Developed by Meditron Instrument Corporation, Milford, New Hampshire, {{it is based}} in part on NASA technology found in a similar system designed for automatic monitoring of astronauts' blood pressure. Vital- 2 is an advancement over the familiar arm cuff, dial and bulb apparatus customarily used for blood pressure checks. In that method, the physician <b>squeezes</b> the <b>bulb</b> to inflate the arm cuff, which restricts the flow of blood through the arteries. As he eases the pressure on the arm, he listens, through a stethoscope, to the sounds of resumed blood flow as the arteries expand and contract. Taking dial readings related to sound changes, he gets the systolic (contracting) and diastolic (expanding) blood pressure measurements. The accuracy of the method depends on the physician's skill in interpreting the sounds. Hospitals sometimes employ a more accurate procedure, but it is "invasive," involving insertion of a catheter in the artery...|$|R
5000|$|A cuff of the {{appropriate}} size is fitted smoothly and also snugly, then inflated manually by repeatedly <b>squeezing</b> a rubber <b>bulb</b> until the artery is completely occluded. It {{is important that the}} cuff size is correct: undersized cuffs record too high a pressure; oversized cuffs may yield too low a pressure. Usually three or four cuff sizes should be available to allow measurements in arms of different size. Listening with the stethoscope to the brachial artery at the antecubital area of the elbow, the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff. When blood just starts to flow in the artery, the turbulent flow creates a [...] "whooshing" [...] or pounding (first Korotkoff sound). The pressure at which this sound is first heard is the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is further released until no sound can be heard (fifth Korotkoff sound), at the diastolic arterial pressure.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} share {{time and to}} shift {{attention}} between bimanual simultaneous motor tasks were studied in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 19 age- and intelligence-matched controls. The task consisted of drawing triangles with the dominant hand and <b>squeezing</b> a rubber <b>bulb</b> with the nondominant hand. Motor performance was measured using the variables: amplitude of squeezing, frequency of squeezing and velocity of drawing triangles. After eliminating variance due to baseline differences in single-handed performance, the bimanual simultaneous performance of PD and controls {{turned out to be}} similar to the frequency of squeezing and the velocity of drawing triangles. The amplitude of squeezing, however, differed between the two groups: it was significantly reduced in PD. Arguably the disturbance in the bimanual performance of PD patients was not due to a disorder of time sharing, but to a decreased ability to shift attention from the visually cued task to the non visually cued task. The results agree with current evidence that PD patients are more impaired when they have to rely upon internal control for the regulation of shifting attention than when external cues are available...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{impedance}} {{testing is}} an objective method for determining middle ear function. Such {{an aid to}} diagnosis of middle ear pathology and application to clinical audiology was first realized by Metz (1946). Acoustic impedance measures the opposition encountered by an acoustic wave. When a sourxd is introduced to the external auditory meatus one can measure the opposition that exists at the lateral surface of the tympanic membrane or at some plane within the external auditory meatus. These clinical acoustic impedance measurements may be classified as either static or dynamic. Static acoustic impedance measurements are made with ambient air pressure within the external auditory meatus, while dynamic measurements are made when the air pressure is varied within the external auditory meatus. Dynamic measurements basically describe the mobility of the tympanic membrane; by knowing the mobility of the tympanic membrane one can determine {{the function of the}} middle ear. Tympanic membrane mobility can also be determined by otoscopic examination, using a Siegle otoscope. The physician varies the air pressure within the external auditory meatus by <b>squeezing</b> on a <b>bulb</b> that is attached to the otoscope. The tympanic membrane moves as the air pressure is varied. Middle ear function is then determined by the amount of mobility. The purpose of this study will be to compare two methods far determining middle ear malfunction: acoustic impedance measurement and otoscopic examination. This will be done by testing patients with middle ear pathologies using both methods and comparing the test results with the surgically-confirmed results. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Exercise {{intolerance}} {{in patients}} with cystic fibrosis is commonly attributed to reduced pulmonary and nutritional status. The possible role of diminished efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in relation to skeletal muscle performance was investigated {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis. METHODS [...] In vivo synthesis of ATP in skeletal muscle during submaximal exercise was studied in eight patients with cystic fibrosis aged 12 - 17 years, and in 19 healthy control subjects aged 8 - 36 years. The intracellular pH and concentrations of phosphate compounds were calculated at four steady states from phosphorus- 31 labelled nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements in the forearm muscle during <b>bulb</b> <b>squeezing</b> in an exercise protocol. Normalised power output, expressed as percentage maximal voluntary contraction (Y, in %MVC), {{was related to the}} energy force of ATP hydrolysis (X = ln [ATP]/[ADP][Pi]). This relationship provides an in vivo measure of efficiency of oxidative work performance of skeletal muscle. RESULTS [...] During all workloads (but not at rest) intracellular pH was higher in the patients with cystic fibrosis than in the controls. The linear least square fit for Y = a-bX showed high correlations in both groups; the slope b was 19 % lower in the patients than in the controls (11. 8 % v 14. 5 % MVC/ln M; 95 % confidence interval for difference 0. 3 to 5. 0). CONCLUSIONS [...] In patients with cystic fibrosis oxidative work performance of skeletal muscle is reduced. This may be related to secondary pathophysiological changes in skeletal muscle in cystic fibrosis...|$|R

40|$|In {{everyday}} life, we {{are constantly}} confronted to choice situations in which we need {{to decide whether or}} not to execute an action, and how to adjust the response vigor, i. e. how fast/strongly to execute that action. These decisions are thought to depend on the value of the expected outcome of the action to be undertaken and on its cost, in terms of effort and time investment. Moreover, how action duration affects choice is supposed to depend on the opportunity cost, i. e. the average value of all the other actions that the agent could be executing instead. However, it remains unclear how these different factors are integrated when human subjects are confronted to real choices. Here we asked human subjects to participate in different versions of a behavioral task involving effort-based decision making and compared their behavior with different model predictions (e. g. Niv et al. 2006). Participants had to <b>squeeze</b> a pressure <b>bulb</b> in different conditions. In the FIXED conditions, the monetary reward, duration and amount of effort required were determined in advance and participants could simply accept or refuse the trials proposed. In the FREE condition, participants could adjust the level of effort invested in order to decrease the duration of the squeezing. This allowed us to evaluate response vigor during the execution of the task. We manipulated opportunity cost by changing the average level of reward and effort required per unit of time. We also measured different psychometric variables, such as skin conductance, pupil diameter and facial EMG activity, during the execution of these tasks. Preliminary results show that human behavior does not follow model predictions. In particular, response vigor is much less affected by the task conditions than predicted. Also, in contrast to model predictions, opportunity cost, here defined as the average level of reward per unit of time, affected more the decision of whether or not to execute an action than response vigor, a result which also contradicts theoretical models. The present study shows that human subjects, when confronted to choices involving the adjustment of effort and time investment as a function of reward values, do not conform to current theoretical models. A new model is thus proposed to take into account this new set of data...|$|R
