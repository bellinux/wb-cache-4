25|$|In race {{eighteen}} the Kiwis led at {{the start}} {{and up to the}} first mark. They set the speed record of the series, reaching 47.57 knots (55mph, 88 kph) as they rounded the mark, to lead by 5 seconds. They kept the lead during the first downwind run, but Oracle got ahead at the first crossing on the upwind leg after the Kiwis made a poor tack. Team New Zealand had <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> advantage and the lead at the time, but did not properly cover Oracle. The American boat was up on the foils, and powered past the Kiwis. Oracle went on to lead by 57 seconds at the windward gate and kept the lead for the rest of race, winning by 54 seconds.|$|E
500|$|As Hercule {{approached}} the channel, Hood put Mars on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> overtaking Jason and {{bearing down on}} the French ship. At 20:30, L'Héritier recognised that the current was too strong for Hercule to successfully navigate the Raz de Sein and instead anchored [...] {{at the mouth of}} the channel with a spring on his cable, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed L'Héritier to swing his broadside to face the enemy while stationary, roughly [...] southwest of Pointe de Raz and about [...] from his destination at Brest.|$|E
500|$|At 09:00, Duncan {{made the}} signal to prepare for battle while De Winter {{organised}} his ships into a line of battle to meet the British attack in a solid defensive formation, sailing on the port tack in a northeasterly heading. As they manoeuvred into their assigned stations, the Dutch fleet drew closer to the shore. Duncan intended to follow Lord Howe's manoeuvres at the Glorious First of June three years earlier and bring each ship through the Dutch line between two opponents, but the Dutch formation and proximity to the shore rendered this plan impractical. To compensate, Duncan signalled for his ships to form line and sail southeast on the port tack so {{that they had the}} wind directly behind them. Shortly afterwards, concerned that the Dutch might make the shoreline before he could bring them to battle despite his wry insistence that [...] "I am determined to fight the ships on land if I cannot by sea", Duncan ordered his fleet to turn southwards and advance on the enemy and [...] "bear up and sail large". He fired signal guns to alert his captains and then ordered them to [...] "engage the enemy as arriving up" [...] and for his [...] to attack the Dutch rear. At 11:00, Duncan sought to remedy increasing gaps between his vessels by ordering the faster ships to slow down and wait for their compatriots. He then made an effort to re-establish the line on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> before realising that the Dutch fleet was still in order awaiting the British attack and continually drawing closer to the dangerous coastline. Abandoning his previous signals, Duncan ordered the entire fleet to turn towards the Dutch and attack directly, each ship to [...] "steer for and engage her opponent". Many of these signals were poorly executed and incorrect, visibility was low and Trollope's squadron was still using obsolete signal codes, so a number of vessels failed to comprehend Duncan's intentions, turning the advancing line into a ragged pattern of scattered vessels clustered into two loose groups. The flurry of orders was so quick and contradictory that at least one captain gave up entirely: the Scottish captain, John Inglis, of HMS Belliqueux threw his signal book to the deck in frustration and shouted [...] "Up wi' the hel'lem and gang into the middle o't." ...|$|E
5000|$|In sailing, tack is {{a corner}} of a sail on the lower leading edge. Separately, tack {{describes}} which side of a sailing vessel the wind is coming from while under way—port or <b>starboard.</b> <b>Tacking</b> is the maneuver of turning between <b>starboard</b> and port <b>tack</b> by bringing the bow (the forward part of the boat) through the wind. Jibing is the maneuver of turning from one tack to another by bringing the stern (rear of the boat) through the wind.|$|R
5000|$|The lug sail, or lugsail, is a fore-and-aft, four-cornered sail that is {{suspended}} from a spar, called a yard. When raised the sail area overlaps the mast. For [...] "standing lug" [...] rigs, the sail {{remains on the}} same side of the mast on both the port and <b>starboard</b> <b>tacks.</b> For [...] "dipping lug" [...] rigs, the sail is lowered partially to be brought around to the leeward side of the mast in order to optimize the efficiency of the sail on both tacks.|$|R

2500|$|The {{course for}} the 34th America's Cup has been {{especially}} designed {{to take advantage of}} the San Francisco Bay to bring the racing within easy viewing of the shore for the first time. The starting area is furthest away from the shore, close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The boats are only allowed to enter the starting box two minutes before the gun. The boat entering on port tack is allowed to enter ten seconds before the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> boat. This is to reduce the danger of having two boats travelling at up to [...] heading towards each other into the starting area.|$|E
2500|$|Race eight brought Team New Zealand to {{the brink}} of disaster. Leading from the start to midway up the third leg, TNZ was tacking back to {{starboard}} to once again cover Oracle. However, a lack of hydraulic power at a crucial moment during the turn meant that the large wingsail did not move in time. The boat's starboard hull rose {{out of the water and}} Aotearoa came within a degree of capsizing. [...] To add insult to injury, Barker was penalised for failing to give way to Oracle who was on <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> at the time. Merely glad to have their boat in one piece, the New Zealanders followed Spithill to the finish 52 seconds behind.|$|E
60|$|Finding it {{was likely}} to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were all fast, and handed the mizen. The ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better {{spooning}} before the sea, than trying or hulling. We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous. We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped {{the man at the}} helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room. When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail. Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at south-west. We got the <b>starboard</b> <b>tacks</b> aboard, we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.|$|R
2500|$|Race 2 narrative: Alinghi {{received}} a penalty {{for being in}} the pre-start area before the designated time. There was very little pre-start maneuvering. BMW Oracle Racing started on <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> ahead of Alinghi on port tack. Alinghi sailed faster than during the previous race and benefited from a 20-degree wind shift, which put the Swiss boat in the lead at about {{the midpoint of the}} first leg. But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind after tacking for the lay line. BMW Oracle Racing then proved to be much faster on the first reach, pulling about 2 kilometers ahead (26.8 kt vs. 25.2 kt average speed). [...] The final delta includes the penalty turn by Alinghi. Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 to gybe mark, 0h39 to finish.|$|E
2500|$|At one point, the tugs succeeded {{turning the}} Star of Bengal on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> but she {{immediately}} reverted {{to the port}} tack when either due to a sudden change in direction of the wind or due to an error on part of the Star of Bengals crew, her sails were filled aback. This resulted in a more dangerous situation, pushing all three vessels towards the rocky shore of Coronation island. The two tugs continued to struggle to pull the Star of Bengal out of danger, but the ships continued to drift leeward. Both tugs started to experience mechanical problems with their boilers due to overloading, and the Hattie Gage also developed structural problems with her mast mounting. At 3:50a.m. the Star of Bengal dropped her anchors in [...] of water. Pulled into less than [...] of water and occasionally as close as [...] to the land, the tugs finally severed the hawsers at 4:00a.m., steamed out of danger, and found shelter from still strengthening wind [...] away, behind Warren Island.|$|E
2500|$|The resail of race {{thirteen}} {{began at}} 2:33pm in [...] of wind. Spithill tried to hook Barker during the pre start to gain advantage, but Barker managed to prevent Oracle from gaining the overlap. Team New Zealand led over the line, {{and took a}} 3-second lead around the reach mark. The pivotal moment of the race came {{towards the end of}} the second leg. Team New Zealand were slightly ahead and tried to cross in front of Oracle who had the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> advantage. Spithill had to evade the Kiwi boat, and gained a penalty for the infraction. With the boats still close heading into the leeward gate, Barker fluffed his lines, and Aotearoa ended up being forced to jibe twice in quick succession. Oracle sped away to begin the third leg leaving the Kiwis almost dead in the water. That was effectively the race, and Oracle confirmed their third point by 1:24 at the finish. The New Zealanders' largest defeat of the Cup to date brought the score to 3–8.|$|E
2500|$|Heathcote {{took his}} ship in and at 12:34 pm passed the French rear, firing on {{them with her}} port guns, as the French stood in for Toulon on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b> The rest of the squadron, joined by the 74-gun [...] from Pellew's fleet, {{followed}} in succession. The British ships then turned about and tacked across in the opposite direction, cannonading the fleeing French with their starboard batteries. At 1:00 pm the advance ships of Pellew's fleet, , [...] and [...] arrived and opened fire on the rear-most French ship, the Wagram. The British ships tacked and wore, exchanging fire with the French until the wind carried Cosmao-Kerjulien's squadron under {{the safety of the}} shore batteries covering the approach to Toulon. Casualties were light throughout both fleets, the only fatality during the action occurred aboard Heathcote's ship, when a seaman was killed in an accident. The only other casualty aboard Scipion was one man wounded by enemy fire. [...] With the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, Heathcote was sent to Marseilles with four ships of the line, to collect British prisoners of war from the port and convey them to Port Mahon.|$|E
2500|$|He became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, {{hoisting}} his flag in {{the battleship}} HMS Lord Warden, in April 1869. He {{was promoted to}} full admiral on 1 April 1870 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 20 May 1871. [...] "In the autumn of 1870 the Mediterranean Squadron, {{under the command of}} Sir Alexander Milne joined up with the Channel Squadron for the purpose of carrying out combined manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal, and Sir Alexander, being the senior admiral, took supreme command. [...] The low freeboard, fully rigged turret-ship Captain had joined the Channel Squadron a short time before, and the combined fleet put to see from Vigo". [...] On 6 September [...] "the fleet was sailing in two columns on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> in a fresh north-west breeze, and Sir Alexander Milne went on board the Captain in the afternoon to inspect her and see how she behaved at sea, as she was a novelty... During the time the Commander-in-Chief was on board the Captain the wind and sea had increased, and he had great difficulty in getting back to his own ship – the Lord Warden. [...] In fact, the captain of the Captain (Hugh Burgoyne) tried to persuade him not to risk it, but to remain on board for the night and return in the morning. [...] Sir Alexander, however, was a dour auld Scotsman and said he would get back to his ship, and did." [...] That night the Captain capsized and sank and [...] "only the gunner and seventeen men were saved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is sailing in {{towards the}} land on that side," [...] he said. [...] "She has evidently made a tack out, {{and is now}} on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> again." ...|$|E
60|$|So, {{instead of}} making speed through the water toward deep sea, I hove the Elsinore to on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> {{with no more than}} leeway driftage to the west and south.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right ahead again," [...] he remarked. [...] "But as I suppose you're going on, we'd better stretch {{straight}} across on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b> We'll get smoother water along the island shore." ...|$|E
60|$|I sing {{a legend}} of the sea, So hard-a-port upon your lee! A ship on <b>starboard</b> <b>tack!</b> She's bound upon a private cruise-- (This {{is the kind of}} spice I use To give a salt-sea smack).|$|E
60|$|The moon covered again, {{and it was}} in {{darkness}} that the Elsinore rounded up on the wind on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b> This, in her case, under lower-topsails only, meant that she lay eight points from the wind, or, in land terms, at right angles to the wind.|$|E
60|$|The wind returned, and the PYRENEES, her deck {{smoking and}} shimmering {{in the bright}} gray light, ran off dead to leeward. Then she worked back, port tack and <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> crisscrossing her track, combing the sea for the Acteon Islands, which the {{masthead}} lookouts failed to sight.|$|E
60|$|The breeze freshened and held, Columbine {{with all}} plain sail set made good speed, and they laid off a {{straight}} {{course on the}} big Atlantic chart. The risks of the middle passage were left behind. If they were lucky, she would reach far across on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> without their shifting a rope.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well. Gentlemen, {{we will go}} on board; the Cæsar must weigh {{and join}} the other vessels in the offing.

6000|$|... "A sure thing," [...] agreed Dampier. [...] "I {{was driving}} {{her to work}} off it with the sea getting up when the breeze burst on us.

60|$|Jimmy said nothing--he had partly {{expected}} this; {{and while}} he smoked his second pipe, the vapors were rolled apart, and the breeze came down on them. Unfortunately {{it came from the}} northwest, which, as the sawmill they were bound for stood {{at the head of a}} deep inlet on the west coast of Vancouver Island, was ahead of them; so for a while they let her stretch out into the Pacific, close-hauled upon the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b>|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the Dazzler sped beyond the last smoking sea and was sliding {{up and down on}} the long Pacific swell. The wind had {{increased}} its velocity and necessitated a reefing down of jib and mainsail. Then they laid off again, full and free on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> for the Farralones, thirty miles away. By the time breakfast was cooked and eaten they picked up the Reindeer, which was hove to and working offshore to the south and west. The wheel was lashed down, and there was not a soul on deck.|$|E
60|$|Wolf Larsen barked a short {{laugh in}} my ear and strode away to the weather side of the poop. I {{expected}} him to give orders for the Ghost to heave to, but she kept on her course and he made no sign. Louis stood imperturbably at the wheel, but I noticed the grouped sailors forward turning troubled faces in our direction. Still the Ghost tore along, till the boat dwindled to a speck, when Wolf Larsen’s voice rang out in command and he went about on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And we {{went and}} did it," [...] Sparrowhawk said solemnly, and then emitted a series of chuckling noises. [...] "We laid over, <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> and I pinched the Emily against the spit. 'Go about,' Captain Munster yells at me; 'go about, or you'll have me aground!' He yelled other things, much worse. But I didn't mind. I missed stays, pretty as you please, and the Flibberty drifted down on him and fouled him, and we went ashore {{together}} in as nice a mess as {{you ever want to}} see. Miss Lackland transferred the recruits, and the trick was done." ...|$|E
60|$|I shall {{begin at}} the beginning--{{yesterday}} afternoon. For it was yesterday afternoon, five weeks to a day since we emerged from the Straits of Le Maire into this gray storm-ocean, that once again we found ourselves hove to directly off the Horn. At {{the changing of the}} watches at four o'clock, Captain West gave the command to Mr. Pike to wear ship. We were on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> at the time, making leeway off shore. This manoeuvre placed us on the port tack, and the consequent leeway, to me, seemed on shore, though at an acute angle, to be sure.|$|E
60|$|The Arangi {{was beating}} {{out between the}} coral patches of the narrow channel into {{the teeth of the}} brisk trade wind. This necessitated {{frequent}} tacks, so that, overhead, the mainsail was ever swooping across from port tack to <b>starboard</b> <b>tack</b> and back again, making air-noises like the swish of wings, sharply rat-tat-tatting its reef points and loudly crashing its mainsheet gear along the traveller. Half a dozen times, as it swooped overhead, Jerry leaped for it, mouth open to grip, lips writhed clear of the clean puppy teeth that shone in the sun like gems of ivory.|$|E
60|$|But {{the wind}} was light, the Pyrenees' bottom was foul, {{and she could not}} beat up against the strong {{westerly}} current. At the end of two hours she had lost three miles. The sailors worked eagerly, as if by main strength they could compel the PYRENEES against the adverse elements. But steadily, port tack and <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> she sagged off to the westward. The captain paced restlessly up and down, pausing occasionally to survey the vagrant smoke wisps and to trace them back to the portions of the deck from which they sprang. The carpenter was engaged constantly in attempting to locate such places, and, when he succeeded, in calking them tighter and tighter.|$|E
60|$|About ten, both vessels {{were on the}} <b>starboard</b> <b>tack,</b> {{standing}} to the southward and westward, or out towards the broad Atlantic, with the brig about a league under the Dawn's lee, and a little forward of her beam. This was the most favourable position {{for us to be}} in, in order to effect our purpose, since the cruiser had already passed her nearest point to us, on that tack. The horizon to windward, and all along the margin of the sea at the northward, was covered with clouds, which threatened, by the way, a capfull of wind. This dark back-ground would be likely to prevent our being seen; and the instant the night shut in the outline of the brig's canvass, I ordered our helm put down.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} Elsinore's bow paid off. The {{angle of the}} beat of the gale changed, and soon, with dreadful speed, we were dashing {{straight}} before it and straight toward the rocks we could not see. But all doubt was over. The success of the manoeuvre was assured. Mr. Mellaire, informed by messenger along the bridge from Mr. Pike, slacked off the head-yards. Mr. Pike, his eye on the helmsman, his hand signalling the order, had the wheel put over to port to check the Elsinore's rush into the wind as she came up on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b> All was activity. Main- and mizzen-yards were braced up, and the Elsinore, snugged down and hove to, had a lee of thousands of miles of Southern Ocean.|$|E
60|$|For {{three days}} this continued, and then, when the gale broke {{and a little}} pale {{sunshine}} streamed down on the tumbling sea, changing the grey combers to flashing white and green, they gave her a double-reefed mainsail, part of the boom-foresail, and a jib or two, and thrashed her slowly back to the northwards on the <b>starboard</b> <b>tack.</b> Still, {{more than one of}} them glanced over the taffrail longingly as she gathered way. She was fast, and with a little driving and that breeze over her quarter she would bear them south towards warmth and ease at some two hundred miles a day, while the way they were going it would be a fight for every fathom with bitter, charging seas, and there lay ahead of them only cold and peril and toil incredible.|$|E
