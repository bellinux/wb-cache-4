5|$|One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish <b>Seabird</b> Centre, {{near the}} {{important}} bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra {{and the surrounding}} islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face {{and how we can}} protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of <b>seabird</b> conservation in the UK. <b>Seabird</b> tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of <b>seabird</b> conservation. For example, the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African <b>seabird</b> colonies has impacted on the conservation of threatened <b>seabird</b> populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{percent of}} seabirds are colonial, and <b>seabird</b> colonies {{are among the}} largest bird colonies in the world, {{providing}} one of Earth's great wildlife spectacles. Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded, both in the tropics (such as Kiritimati in the Pacific) and in the polar latitudes (as in Antarctica). <b>Seabird</b> colonies occur exclusively {{for the purpose of}} breeding; non-breeding birds will only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated.|$|E
50|$|The Laysan finch is a generalist, {{feeding on}} seeds, small insects, fruit, carrion (of <b>seabirds</b> and Hawaiian monk seals), and the eggs of nesting <b>seabirds.</b> While unable {{to break into}} the eggs of the larger <b>seabirds</b> (such as {{albatross}} and boobies) they will scavenge from them. They actively take the eggs of smaller <b>seabirds</b> such as those of white tern (Gygis alba) and the endemic Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis).|$|R
50|$|Feral cats (Felis catus) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} introduced mammals and one of the most effective predators on ground-nesting <b>seabirds.</b> On the Kerguelen Islands in the Southern Ocean, cats kill 1.2 million nesting <b>seabirds</b> annually. One study stated that introduced feral cats have been responsible for the extinction of 10 petrel species in the 20th century alone. Feral cats are such effective predators on ground-nesting <b>seabirds</b> because <b>seabirds</b> did not evolve with terrestrial predators and therefore did not develop defenses against them. In many cases, <b>seabirds</b> do not even recognize feral cats as a threat. It has also been demonstrated that feral cats on islands preferentially eat <b>seabirds,</b> but during the nonbreeding season cats switch their prey base to insects, rats, and mice for subsistence.|$|R

5|$|Some <b>seabird</b> {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some <b>seabird</b> populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E
5|$|Around twenty {{non-native}} {{species of}} flora {{have been introduced}} to Caroline Island via human contact. Among these are the vine Ipomoea violacea, which has begun to proliferate. Domestic cats and dogs introduced alongside a small homestead have driven the <b>seabird</b> population away from the islet of Monu Ata-Ata.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seabird</b> colonies {{are highly}} variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an {{albatross}} colony, or densely packed {{as with a}} murre colony. In most <b>seabird</b> colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge-tailed shearwater. When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels {{in order to use}} their burrows.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used <b>seabirds</b> {{as indicators of}} both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of <b>seabirds</b> with land was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. <b>Seabirds</b> have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of <b>seabirds</b> acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|R
50|$|Incidental {{mortality}} of <b>seabirds</b> {{as a result}} of fishing has fallen to near-zero levels in the CCAMLR convention area. No {{mortality of}} <b>seabirds</b> or marine mammals was recorded {{as a result of}} fishing for Antarctic toothfish in 2011-12 and only two <b>seabirds</b> (Southern Giant Petrels Macronectes giganteus) have been killed as a result of fishing in the Ross Sea since 1996/97.|$|R
5|$|Storm petrels seem to {{be largely}} free of blood parasites, even when in close {{proximity}} to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that <b>seabird</b> species with long incubation periods and long lives have well-developed immune systems that prevent serious blood parasitism.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatrosses}} are {{a family}} of 21 species of large <b>seabird</b> found across the Southern and North Pacific Oceans. The largest are among the largest flying birds in the world. Ten species are regularly seen in Tasmanian waters, with another three recorded less frequently and one vagrant species.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: <b>seabird</b> colony; {{breeding}} colony; communal roost; heronries; rookery. A large {{congregation of}} individuals {{of one or}} more species of bird that nest or roost in proximity at a particular location. Many kinds of birds are known to congregate in groups of varying size; a congregation of nesting birds is called a breeding colony. A group of birds congregating for rest is called a communal roost. Approximately 13% of all bird species nest colonially. Nesting colonies are very common among seabirds on cliffs and islands. Nearly 95% of seabirds are colonial, leading to the usage, <b>seabird</b> colony, sometimes called a rookery. Many species of terns nest in colonies on the ground. Herons, egrets, storks and other large waterfowl also nest communally in what are called heronries. Colony nesting may be an evolutionary response to a shortage of safe nesting sites and abundance or unpredictable food sources which are far away from the nest sites.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of most <b>seabirds</b> is less {{colourful}} {{than that}} of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), {{but most of the}} colour in <b>seabirds</b> appears in the bills and legs. The plumage of <b>seabirds</b> is thought in many cases to be for camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is {{the same as that of}} Antarctic prions, and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many <b>seabirds</b> helps hide them from prey below).|$|R
40|$|This report gives a {{preliminary}} {{account of the}} analysis of stomach contents of <b>seabirds</b> collected in ice-filled waters in the Eastern parts of Svalbard during the "Lance"-expedition in summer 1984. A total of 40 <b>seabirds</b> of 7 species were collected. The dominating <b>seabirds</b> were Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis and Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, with 8 and 18 individuals respectively.

5|$|Like many seabirds storm petrels will {{associate}} with {{other species of}} <b>seabird</b> and marine mammal species {{in order to help}} obtain food. It is theorised that they benefit from the actions of diving predators such as seals and penguins which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the surface feeding storm petrels to reach them.|$|E
5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the <b>seabird</b> grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E
5|$|Other commercially {{valuable}} products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese and ducks), {{which are used}} as insulation in clothing and bedding, and <b>seabird</b> faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The War of the Pacific, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.|$|E
50|$|Every {{year the}} puffins and other <b>seabirds</b> on Sule Skerry are {{monitored}} {{by a team}} of birders called the Sule Skerry Ringing Group. They have been monitoring the <b>seabirds</b> on the island since 1975.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} animal welfare laws before 1900, the animals' safety {{was not the}} main reason for the act. <b>Seabirds</b> were useful to sailors to warn of land in bad weather. If a boat was in fog and the sailors could hear <b>seabirds</b> nearby then they would know that they were near land. If the {{population}} of <b>seabirds</b> declined then they would not have this early warning system.|$|R
40|$|During the 1992 - 1993 133 <b>seabirds</b> {{found on}} Belgian beaches were necropsied. Most {{frequent}} species were the guillemot (Uria aalge), the oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), the razorbill (Alca torda) and the herring gull (Larus argentatus). The three main observations were, in decreasing order, cachexia, acute and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, and oil contamination of plumage and intestinal tract. The pelagic origin of <b>seabirds</b> {{was associated with}} all 3 observations; oil contamination was associated with acute gastro-enteritis and cachexia and, finally, the immature character was associated with cachexia. A hypothetical mechanism of death would be oiled pelagic <b>seabirds</b> that become cachectic and die of acute gastroenteritis. It is unlikely that <b>seabirds</b> act as a reservoir for bacteria, that were only occasionally identified in our material. Therefore, it appears that infectious agents play a minor role in <b>seabirds</b> stranding. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|<b>Seabird</b> {{mortality}} {{caused by}} long-line fisheries can be greatly reduced by {{techniques such as}} setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds (also {{known as}} marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, {{behaviour}} and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, {{as the same}} environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern <b>seabird</b> families emerged in the Paleogene.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds, {{by virtue}} {{of living in a}} geologically depositional {{environment}} (that is, in the sea where sediments are readily laid down), are well represented in the fossil record. They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like <b>seabird</b> that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Seabird's</b> {{songs were}} {{recently}} heard on Pushing Daisies, Numb3rs, and Grey's Anatomy. <b>Seabird's</b> song [...] "Don't You Know You're Beautiful" [...] was {{played at the}} beginning of the Ghost Whisperer Season 5 episode On Thin Ice.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Approximately 215 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in the Great Barrier Reef. The islands and cays of the Great Barrier Reef are especially important to <b>seabirds</b> with some 1. 4 to 1. 7 million <b>seabirds</b> visiting them each year to breed. The birds of the Great Barrier Reef {{can be divided into}} three groups based primarily on their habitat use, shorebirds, land birds and <b>seabirds.</b> These are collectively known as coastal birds...|$|R
50|$|Over 40 million <b>seabirds</b> are {{negatively}} affected by oil platforms. <b>Seabirds</b> tend to aggregate around oil rigs, attracted by artificial lighting, flares, {{food and other}} visual cues. <b>Seabirds</b> often collide directly with oil platforms or circle around oil rigs and flares for days, eventually dying of starvation. Birds such as storm petrels, dovekies and shearwaters migrate across the Grand Banks and hydrocarbon development near the oil platforms significantly decreases the populations of these birds.|$|R
5|$|Shetland {{has three}} {{national}} nature reserves, at the <b>seabird</b> colonies of Hermaness and Noss, and at Keen of Hamar {{to preserve the}} serpentine flora. There are a further 81 SSSIs, which cover 66% {{or more of the}} land surfaces of Fair Isle, Papa Stour, Fetlar, Noss and Foula. Mainland has 45 separate sites.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is a {{breeding}} ground for many important <b>seabird</b> species. One of the world's largest colonies of northern gannets, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 percent of the global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of Leach's petrels, up to 90 percent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of Atlantic puffins, about 30 percent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 northern fulmar pairs, about 13 percent of the UK total. Dùn is home to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Prior to 1828, St Kilda was their only UK breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as Fowlsheugh. The last great auk (Pinguinus impennis) seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840. Unusual behaviour by St Kilda's bonxies was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's petrel population. Using night vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a <b>seabird.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with <b>seabird</b> colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration {{it has also been}} reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E
40|$|Trends in oil {{rates of}} beached <b>seabirds</b> reflect {{temporal}} and spatial patterns in chronic oil pollution at sea. We analysed a long-term dataset of systematic beached bird surveys along the Belgian North Sea coast during 1962 – 2015, where extreme high oil contamination rates and consequently high mortality rates of <b>seabirds</b> during the 1960 s used to coincide with intensive ship traffic. In the 1960 s, > 90 % of all swimming <b>seabirds</b> that washed ashore were contaminated with oil and estimated oil-induced mortality of <b>seabirds</b> was probably several times higher than natural mortality. More than 50 years later oil rates of <b>seabirds</b> have dropped to historically low levels while shipping is still very intense, indicating that chronic oil pollution has significantly declined. The declining trend is discussed {{in the light of}} a series of legislative measures that were enacted in the North Sea region to reduce oil pollution...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seabirds</b> {{and plastic}} debris: global {{perspective}} As far-ranging and upper-trophic predators, <b>seabirds</b> are valuable biological indicators of climatic and human-related perturbations of marine food webs, including {{the incidence of}} pollutants (e. g., Furness and Camphuysen 1997, Burger and Gochfeld 2004). In particular, <b>seabirds</b> have proven sensitive indi-cators of trash in oceanic systems because they often ingest debris resembling their prey (Van Franeker and Meijboom 2002, Nevins et al. 2005). However, studies to date have largely focused on documenting the incidence and type of plastic ingestion. The available research has documented global marine debris distributions (Ayre 2006, Weiss 2006) and pervasive plastic ingestion in sea-bird populations worldwide (Collins 2005, Edwards 2005), from the tropics to subpolar regions. 58 Hyrenbach et al. —Seabirds Indicate Plastic Pollution in the Marine Environment <b>Seabirds</b> and plastic debris: local perspective <b>Seabirds</b> are an integral and conspicuous component of the Alaska marin...|$|R
