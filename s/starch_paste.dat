25|$|The doffing {{took only}} a few minutes, the piecers would run {{the length of the}} mule gate thrutching five {{spindles}} a time, and the doffing involved lifting four cops from the spindles with the right hand and piling them on the left forearm and hand. To get a firm cop bottom, the minder would whip the first few layers of yarn. After the first few draws the minder would stop the mule at the start of an inward run and take it in slowly depressing and releasing the faller wire several times. Alternatively, a <b>starch</b> <b>paste</b> could be skillfully applied to the first few layers of yarn by the piecers – and later a small paper tube was dropped over spindle – this slowed down the doffing operation and extra payment was negotiated by the minders.|$|E

Using pot experiments and field experiments, we studied the effects of shading on <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> viscosity and <b>starch</b> content with six rice varieties for three years, using the Rapid Visco Analyser to measure <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> viscosity. Shading at different growth stages and in different rice varieties all affected the <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> characteristics of rice. The effects of shading on <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> viscosity at middle and later growth stages were greater than those at earlier stages. Shading enhanced breakdown but reduced hold viscosity and setback at tillering-elongation stage. Most pasting parameters changed significantly with shading after elongation stage. Furthermore, the responses of different varieties to shading differed markedly. The change scope of <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> viscosity in Dexiang 4103 was rather small after heading, while that in IIyou 498 and Gangyou 906 was small before heading.

In a reconstitution study, replacement of insoluble starch with soluble starch decreased the viscosity of pastes and reduced the stickiness of gels. Rice amylopectin fine structure was found to significantly correlate with paste breakdown. Proportion of long chains of amylopectin was negatively correlated and proportion of short chains positively correlated with paste breakdown. Influences of starch granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and other granule-associated proteins on rheological properties of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> and gels were studied using a normal and three isogenic waxy (a waxy null and two GBSS-containing waxy mutants) maize starches. Starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, reduced paste breakdown and viscosity of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes.</b> The viscoelasticity of pastes and gels was greatly reduced as more starch-granule-associated proteins were removed. Light microscopy of <b>pastes</b> suggested that <b>starch</b> granule-associated proteins influence the rheology of pastes through increasing the rigidity of gelatinized starch granules. The study indicated that starch granule-associated proteins, especially GBSS, can significantly change the rheological properties of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> and gels despite its low concentration in <b>starch</b> <b>pastes.</b> Location of <b>starch</b> granule-associated proteins was revealed using a protein specific dye with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Starch granule-associated proteins {{were found to be}} concentrated in internal concentric rings in potato, maize, and wheat starches. Observation of granule proteins at different optical depths of field showed that proteins were distributed in discrete spheres. Amylose-free potato and waxy corn starch granules showed no internal protein spheres, indicating that the protein spheres are composed of GBSS and are likely associated with location of amylose. GBSS was also found to be strongly associated with isolated gelatinized granule remnants of normal potato, maize and wheat starches while virtually no protein was found in remnants of amylose-free potato and waxy maize starch. Starch granule-associated proteins, including GBSS, were found to be partially lost during alkaline extraction of rice starch. Variation in amount of loss in GBSS and other granule-associated proteins was found among different rice lines. Starch damage caused by ball milling was shown to reduce the viscosity and elastic nature of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes.</b> The study showed that soluble starch, amylopectin, and starch granule-associated proteins have their unique functions and contribute to the overall rheology of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> and gels.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to characterize the chestnut and its starch. Chemical composition of the chestnuts showed high level of starch. Moisture level in the raw nuts was around 50 g/ 100 g in wet basis and starch content, around 80 g/ 100 g in dry basis; other nut flour components were protein (5. 58 g/ 100 g), lipid (5. 39 g/ 100 g), crude fiber (2. 34 g/ 100 g) and ash (2. 14 g/ 100 g). Starch fraction was chemically characterized {{in order to identify}} the granule quality as compared with those of cassava and corn. This fraction showed more lipids and proteins than the other starches. Chestnut starch granules showed peculiar shape, smaller than the control starches and low amount of damaged units. Chemical composition concerning amylose : amylopectin ratio was intermediate to that presented by cassava and corn starch granules. Water absorption at different temperatures as well as solubility were also intermediate but closer to that presented by cassava granules. The same behavior was observed in the interaction with dimethyl-sulfoxide. Native starch granules and those submitted to enzymatic treatment with commercial alpha-amylase and also with enzymes from germinated wheat were observed by scanning electronic microscopy. Water suspensions of chestnut starch granules were heated to form pastes that were studied comparatively to those obtained with cassava and corn starches. Viscographic pattern of chestnut <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> showed a characteristic profile with high initial viscosity but peak absence, high resistance to mechanical stirring under hot conditions and high final viscosity.

40|$|Physical and {{functional}} properties of starches isolated from 93 noncultivated genotypes of nine Amaranthus species {{from a world}} germ plasm collection and an additional 31 cultivated Amaranthus genotypes obtained from China were tested. A wide variation {{was found in the}} properties tested among the Amaranthus species and among genotypes within the same species. When comparing starches from cultivated and noncultivated genotypes, it was generally found that amylose was lower; <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> profiles were more consistent with higher peak viscosity, lower breakdown, and lower setback; the gelatinization temperature was lower; and energy of enthalpy was higher. Under cool storage, the hardness of cultivated <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> was lower and the adhesiveness was higher.

40|$|Thirteen {{extensively}} characterised {{grain sorghum}} varieties were evaluated {{in a series}} of 7 broiler bioassays. The efficiency of energy utilisation of broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets is problematic and the bulk of dietary energy is derived from sorghum starch. For this reason, rapid visco-analysis (RVA) <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> profiles were determined as they may have the potential to assess the quality of sorghum as a feed grain for chicken-meat production. In review, it was found that concentrations of kafirin and total phenolic compounds were negatively correlated with peak and holding RVA viscosities to significant extents across 13 sorghums. In a meta-analysis of 5 broiler bioassays it was found that peak, holding, breakdown and final RVA viscosities were positively correlated with ME:GE ratios and peak and breakdown RVA viscosities with apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) to significant extents. In a sixth study involving 10 sorghum-based diets peak, holding and breakdown RVA viscosities were positively correlated with ME:GE ratios and AMEn. Therefore, it emerged that RVA <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> profiles do hold promise as a relatively rapid means to assess sorghum quality as a feed grain for chicken-meat production. This potential appears to be linked to quantities of kafirin and total phenolic compounds present in sorghum and it would seem that both factors depress RVA starch viscosities in vitro and, in turn, also depress energy utilisation in birds offered sorghum-based diets. Given that other feed grains do not contain kafirin and possess considerably lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, their RVA <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> profiles may not be equally indicative...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} ferulic acid and catechin on <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> {{properties}} were studied {{as part of}} an investigation into the structure and functionality of phenolics in starch-based products. Commercial maize starch, starches from sorghum cultivars (SV 2, Chirimaugute, and DC- 75), and the phenolic compounds ferulic acid and catechin were used in the investigation. Pasting properties were measured using rapid viscosity analysis. Ferulic acid and catechin (up to 100 mg each) were added to maize or sorghum starch (3 g, 14 % mb) in suspensions containing 10. 32 % dry solid content. Addition of catechin resulted in pink-colored pastes, whereas ferulic acid had no effect on paste color. Ferulic acid and catechin decreased hot paste viscosity (HPV), final viscosity, and setback viscosity of maize and sorghum <b>starch</b> <b>pastes,</b> but had no influence on the peak viscosity (PV) of the former. Both phenolics increased breakdown viscosity. Ferulic acid had greater influence on HPV, final viscosity, breakdown, and setback than catechin. Addition of catechin under acidic conditions (pH 3) decreased HPV, final viscosity, and setback of maize starch, but alkaline conditions (pH 11) slightly increased setback. Both acidic and alkaline conditions resulted in increased breakdown. Investigations on model-system interactions between ferulic acid or catechin and starch demonstrated that phenolic type and pH level both significantly influence <b>starch</b> <b>pasting</b> properties, with ferulic acid producing a more pronounced effect than catechin. The significance of these interactions is important, especially in food matrices where phenolics are to be added as functional food ingredients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{is a major}} {{component}} of many of the world's food supplies. In order to utilise these supplies effectively the properties of starch must be fully understood. Although starch systems have been investigated quite extensively, there is relatively little information concerning the physico-chemical behaviour of starch under conditions relevant to food processing. The texture of many fabricated foodstuffs is regulated by adding starch. In many cases the addition of starch causes food systems to behave as viscoelastic pastes. In Australasia, wheat starches are generally used to control texture. However starches from some wheat cultivars do not impart the desired rheological characteristics to foodstuffs and this thesis concerns an investigation into this phenomenon which was investigated in three sections. In section I, a fundamental study of the rheological properties of wheat <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> was performed. Measurements were made of the flow behaviour of pastes under both oscillatory and steady shear conditions. Pastes formed under a range of experimental conditions from various wheat varieties were studied. Both wheat varieties and paste preparation conditions were found to influence rheological behaviour. The results show that differences in the <b>pasting</b> properties of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> may be attributed to two factors, namely the swelling capacity of the starch (the volume which the starch gel particles would occupy when close packed if excess solvent were present) and the size distribution of the granules. The rheological properties depend on the source of starch since this effects particle swelling capacities and size distributions. Paste preparation conditions influence rheological properties since they alter the volume occupied by gelatinised granules. The rheological behaviour of <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> changes with time when the pastes are stored. The effect of storage on dynamic rigidity was investigated and the results suggested that a crystallisation process is responsible for the increase in dynamic rigidity with time. The results were therefore evaluated using the Avrami equation. In section II, an investigation was made of the degree of crystallinity, that is the proportion of polymer chains that are in an ordered state, in a number of wheat starch varieties that have different swelling capacities. Measurements of the X-ray crystallinity index, enthalpy change and specific volume were used to investigate crystallinity. The results show that higher swelling capacities are associated with relatively disordered arrangements of polymer chains within granules. The crystallinity results for the various starch fractions with narrow size ranges confirm previous studies showing that small granules tend to be more crystalline. However small granules were found to have higher swelling capacities than large granules. In this instance the increased swelling capacity of small granules as compared to large is probably due to the decreased amount of lipid per unit area at the surface of the small particles. In section III, Proton (1 H) and Carbon- 13 (13 C) NMR were used to investigate <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> made from different wheat varieties that have different pasting properties. 1 H spin-lattice (T 1) relaxation times, 1 H spin-spin (T 2) relaxation times, polymer hydration coefficients (h) and 1 H diffusion coefficients (D) of starch-water systems were determined. Line-widths at half-heights (Δ√ 1 / 2) of peak intensities at various carbon positions and total 13 C liquid signals were also obtained. In all cases the NMR parameters were not found to be dependent on wheat variety. The polymer hydration coefficient, that is the amount of water molecules that are in the bound state, was estimated from the ratio of the amplitude of the 1 H signal due to unfrozen water at 258 K to the amplitude of the 1 H signal at 303 K. A value of 0. 34 gH 2 O/g dry starch was obtained. The T 1 and T 2 magnetisation recovery curves for <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> were found to be single exponential functions. This suggests a fast molecular exchange of water molecules between different sites in the system. A two-state model based on exchange between bulk and bound water was shown to be adequate in describing the relaxation behaviour of water protons in the system. Diffusion measurements of water molecules show that there is no restricted or barrier limited diffusion occuring in <b>starch</b> <b>pastes.</b> The diffusion coefficients were interpreted using various models. The best model was found to be one which takes into account both the obstruction and hydration effects. This gives a shape factor for the suspended gel particles which indicates that water is diffusing through oblate ellipsoids. These are probably amylopectin molecules present in the <b>starch</b> <b>pastes.</b> In an attempt to confirm this possibility, 1 H NMR measurements were repeated on a pure amylopectin-water system. The diffusion coefficients of the amylopectin-water system were interpreted using the same model and similar result was obtained for the shape factor of amylopectin molecules. The 13 C liquid signal results confirm that sharp resonances, which correspond to liquid-like behaviour on the NMR time-scale of the polysaccharide chains, are only observed when the starch is gelatinised. The decrease in the line-widths at half heights of the peak resonances at various carbon positions when the pasting temperature is increased is probably due to an increase in mobility of the polymer chains. In the various wheat <b>starch</b> <b>pastes</b> studied, a loss of about one-third of the total 13 C liquid signal was observed. This was attributed to the crystallisation of polymeric material, lipid-amylose complexes and remnants of ordered structures in the <b>starch</b> <b>pastes...</b>|$|R
