5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration {{of meaning and}} economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The <b>Seafarer,</b> although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The <b>Seafarer</b> was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E

5|$|Struggling {{to fit in}} at Howard, {{unable to}} make tenure, and with {{concerns}} about the increasing crime rates in Washington, in 1977 the family decided to move once again, this time to Athens, Georgia. Shortly after the move Jarrell became {{an assistant professor at}} the University of Georgia. He and his wife started a high-end educational toy company that stemmed from their children's love for similar toys when living in Washington, D.C.. They opened a small shop called Tadpole Toys and Hobby Center in Athens to great reception. However, as a result of poor sales in May1982 they were forced to close it. Soon afterwards, Jarrell received tenure at the University. In 1988, he retired from his position and from teaching as a whole in order to focus on his creative work. By 1994 all three children were grown; the two daughters attended the Art Institute of Chicago, and Wadsworth Jr. became a <b>seafarer.</b> That year, Jae and daughter Jennifer moved to New York {{to find a place to}} live, settling in SoHo, where they were joined by Jarrell a few months later. Currently, Jarrell and Jae live and work in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E

40|$|The study {{primarily}} {{focuses on}} finding {{the awareness of}} <b>seafarers</b> about the various clauses of the TCC agreement, status of implementation of these clauses by the ship management company and excavating the level of satisfaction among the sample <b>seafarers</b> regarding the agreement. <b>Seafarers</b> from three different ships managed by same shipping company are involved as the unit analysis of this study. There were total of 50 respondent Indian <b>seafarers</b> (40 Ratings and 10 Petty Officers) who work as Motorman, Able bodied seaman, Ordinary Seaman, Steward, Boatswain, Fitter, Chief Cook and Pump man.

25|$|Thomas Abernethy (1803–1860) was a Scottish <b>seafarer,</b> gunner in the Royal Navy, and polar explorer. Because he {{was neither}} an officer nor a gentleman {{he was little}} {{mentioned}} in the books written by {{the leaders of the}} expeditions he went on, but was praised in what was written and was awarded five Arctic Medals. He was in parties that, for their time, reached the furthest north, the furthest south (twice), and the nearest to the South Magnetic Pole. In 1831, along with James Clark Ross's team of six, Abernethy was in the first party ever to reach the North Magnetic Pole.|$|E
25|$|The Augustinians {{followed}} the Portuguese flag in Africa and the Gulf behind the explorer and <b>seafarer</b> Vasco da Gama. Nikolaus Teschel (d. 1371), auxiliary Bishop of Ratisbon, where he died, with some brethren preached the Gospel in Africa. He had sailed from Lisbon in 1497, {{and arrived at}} Mozambique in March 1498. Portuguese Augustinians also worked {{on the island of}} Sao Tome, in Warri (Nigeria) and in what is now known as Angola, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon up until 1738. The Portuguese also took control of the port of Goa in India—giving the Augustinians a foothold there also. Besides the early Portuguese Augustinians, other Augustinian missionaries have since followed to Africa from America, Ireland, Belgium and Australia.|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} the lives of Indian Lascars or <b>seafarers</b> in Imperial Britain between 1850 and 1950. I explore their working and living {{conditions}} on these ships; issues such as their health and accommodation on shipboard are discussed and compared to those of their British colleagues. The relationships and hierarchies of power on shipboard are also considered. The thesis challenges the perception that Indian seafarers' resistance was always unlawful and not blind, personalised or violent (Balachandran). The concept of moral economy is employed to illustrate how Indian <b>seafarers</b> had certain expectations of their rights on shipboard and protested against violations of these standards when opportunities arose. I explore British perceptions of Indian <b>seafarers.</b> For example, depictions of Indians in the British popular press are explored. The position of Indian <b>seafarers</b> in relation to other non-European <b>seafarers</b> is also considered. My thesis explores how Indian <b>seafarers</b> constructed and negotiated identities both collectively and as individuals in different contexts and at different times. Building upon theoretical approaches to identity, I illustrate how Indian <b>seafarers</b> constructed multiple and fluid identities that changed over time. I describe how Indian <b>seafarers</b> were able to shuffle identities like cards (Colley) and illustrate the reasoning and choice behind their identities (Sen). I also consider how Indian <b>seafarers</b> constructed, negotiated and manipulated the boundaries of collective identities. It explores the role of the family in the migration process, whether temporarily for work or for more long term migration and settlement in Britain. The role of the family in India in the decision to migrate and their support for absent <b>seafarers</b> is documented.

25|$|There {{are four}} great poetic codices of Old English poetry (a codex {{is a book}} in modern format, {{as opposed to a}} scroll): the Junius Manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Nowell Codex or Beowulf Manuscript; most of the {{well-known}} lyric poems such as The Wanderer, The <b>Seafarer,</b> Deor and The Ruin are found in the Exeter Book, while the Vercelli Book has the Dream of the Rood, some of which is also carved on the Ruthwell Cross. The Franks Casket also has carved riddles, a popular form with the Anglo-Saxons. Old English secular poetry is mostly characterized by a somewhat gloomy and introspective cast of mind, and the grim determination found in The Battle of Maldon, recounting an action against the Vikings in 991. This is from a book that was lost in the Cotton Library fire of 1731, but it had been transcribed previously.|$|E
25|$|Piri began {{engaging}} in government-supported privateering (a {{common practice in}} the Mediterranean Sea among both the Muslim and Christian states of the 15th and 16th centuries) when he was young, in 1481, following his uncle Kemal Reis, a well-known corsair and <b>seafarer</b> of the time, who later became a famous admiral of the Ottoman Navy. During this period, together with his uncle, he took part in many naval wars of the Ottoman Empire against Spain, the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice, including the First Battle of Lepanto (Battle of Zonchio) in 1499 and the Second Battle of Lepanto (Battle of Modon) in 1500. When his uncle Kemal Reis died in 1511 (his ship was wrecked by a storm in the Mediterranean Sea, while he was heading to Egypt), Piri returned to Gelibolu, where he started working on his studies about navigation.|$|E
25|$|The archipelagos and {{islands of}} the Caribbean were the first sites of African {{dispersal}} in the western Atlantic during the post-Columbian era. Specifically, in 1492, Pedro Alonso Niño, a black Spanish <b>seafarer,</b> piloted one of Columbus's ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter {{the population of the}} Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes as freedmen, but most often as enslaved servants and workers. Demand for African labour increased in the Caribbean because of the massive deaths among the Taino and other indigenous populations, resulting primarily from Eurasian infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, as well as conflict with the Spanish, and harsh working conditions. By the mid-16th century, slave trade from Africa to the Caribbean was so profitable that the Englishmen Francis Drake and John Hawkins engaged in piracy and violated Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from Sierra Leone to Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic).|$|E

According to , biographical details regarding Wallace-Johnson's activities during this time period are hard to discern, as Wallace-Johnson contradicted himself in his autobiographical notes and his personal reminisces. He {{took a job as}} either a sailor on an American ocean liner sailing between the United States and Africa or as an engine hand for Elder Dempster Lines; in an interview, he stated the former, while in a lecture at the Easter School he claimed the latter. He normally travelled to English-speaking areas, but on occasion, he journeyed to French, Spanish and Portuguese territories on the African continent. He joined the United Kingdom National Seamen's Union and supposedly edited the <b>Seafarer,</b> a newsletter which he and other black sailors distributed among ship crews. During his time off, he studied the working conditions for employees at ports along the western coast of Africa. It is believed that he joined the Communist Party during his time as a sailor, as the party had a history of recruiting among sailors who frequently visited seamen's clubs in port cities. In 1929, he began working in Sekondi as a clerk in a trading company, but only held the job for a year before travelling to Nigeria.|$|E
