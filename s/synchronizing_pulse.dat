The error is referred to as SCH phase and is expressed in degrees of subcarrier phase. For PAL, the definition of SCH phase is slightly different due to the more complicated relationship between the sync and subcarrier frequencies — the SCH phase relationship for a given line repeats only once every eight fields. Therefore, PAL SCH phase is defined, per EBU Technical Statement D 23-1984 (E), as “the phase of the +U component of the color burst extrapolated to the half-amplitude point of {{the leading edge of the}} <b>synchronizing</b> <b>pulse</b> of line 1 of field 1.” ...|$|E

40|$|The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has {{successfully}} operated an in-house developed powerline fault locator system since 1986. The BPA fault locator system consists of remotes installed at cardinal {{power transmission line}} system nodes and a central master which polls the remotes for traveling wave time-of-arrival data. A power line fault produces a fast rise-time traveling wave which emanates from the fault point and propagates throughout the power grid. The remotes time-tag the traveling wave leading edge as it passes through the power system cardinal substation nodes. A <b>synchronizing</b> <b>pulse</b> transmitted via the BPA analog microwave system on a wideband channel sychronizes the time-tagging counters in the remote units to a different accuracy of better than one microsecond.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaA {{system has}} been {{developed}} to simultaneously sample and transmit digital data from five remote geophysical data receiver stations to a control station that processes, displays, and stores the data. A microprocessor in each remote station receives commands from the control station over a single telemetry channel. The commands adjust the sensing amplifier’s input voltage range (1 microvolt to 2 volts peak-to-peak), the number of samples (128 to 30, 000), the sampling rate (256 to 32, 768 samples/sec), {{and the number of}} signals (1 to 16) to average at the remote stations. A 12 bit analog-to-digital converter samples data with bandwidths of 100 Hz to 10 kHz for time periods selected from 100 seconds to 1 second, respectively. Each remote station begins sampling geophysical signals when it receives a <b>synchronizing</b> <b>pulse</b> relayed from the control station. Digitized geophysical data is transmitted to the control station over broadband (100 kHz bandwidth) UHF telemetry channels using standard asynchronous serial (19. 2 kbaud) techniques and hardware dropout detection and recovery. The amount of data (480 kbits) and the maximum time to transmit data (30 secs) dictate using broadband telemetry (even though most geophysical telemetry is less than 10 kHz in bandwidth). Header information (transmitted before the data) contains station number, digital sampling parameters, transmission block size, and checksum. This information is used by a computer program (in a PDP- 11 / 23 (***) minicomputer) to maintain up to 5 simultaneous Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers from the remote stations into 5 separate data buffers.
