Red (Vulpes vulpes) and grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) occasionally capture one, though not many large adults. They are perhaps most important prey for mid-sized carnivores such as the American badger (Taxidea taxus), the coyote (Canis latrans), and the bobcat (Lynx rufus) and small supplemental prey for larger ones such as the mountain lion (Puma concolor) and the gray wolf (Canis lupus). Snakes sometimes attack them (usually young ones) and bird predators include eagles, hawks, and owls. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are the only avian predators large enough to regularly take full-grown white-tailed jackrabbits, though ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) may occasionally take an adult, though these latter two species and other largish raptorial birds typically attack young. They attempt to evade detection by crouching in the vegetation where their cryptic colouration makes them difficult to observe. They may slink away, but if detected, they bound away at speed, adopting a zigzag course. They can run up to 55 km/hr (34 mi/hr) and leap up to 5 m. They are also hunted and eaten by humans.|$|E

The large zooplankton were removed by 95 -pm plankton nets in some LCs and different phosphorus fertilization regimes were applied. The chlorophyll a and sestonic POC and PP concentrations decreased significantly in the presence of crustacean zooplankton, whereas algal biomass was ‘less affected.

However, interactive effects of these two mechanisms on spatial complexity have not been extensively studied. We investigated the mechanisms underlying a spatial mosaic of low-tide exposed hummocks and waterlogged hollows on an intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea dominated by the seagrass Zostera noltii. A combination of field measurements, an experiment and a spatially explicit model indicated that the mosaic resulted from localized sediment accretion by seagrass followed by <b>selective</b> waterfowl <b>grazing.</b> Hollows were bare in winter, but were rapidly colonized by seagrass during the growth season. Colonized hollows were heavily grazed by brent geese and widgeon in autumn, converting these patches to a bare state again and disrupting sediment accretion by seagrass.

The {{purpose of}} the study was to document the habitat associations of I. pienensis in the Beskids in relation to historical land use and present landscape structure. Materials and Methods: Isophya pienensis was studied in the Moravian- Silesian Beskids Mountains at 15 sites representing small unforested areas surrounded by spruce forests on themassifs of the Smrk (1, 276 ma. s. l.) andKnehyne (1, 256 ma. s. l.) mountains. Thirty-minute timed counts were used. Results and Conclusions: Isophya pienensiswas found at 5 of the 15 sites but was not found at elevations below 1, 000 m a. s. l. The occurrence of I. pienensis in the Beskids on small, isolated, shady sites at elevations over 1, 000 mis not a result of its being amountain species. Rather, it is due to the persistence of open-forest habitats and of ecotones near forest lodges where broadleaf vegetation is maintained on shady spots by occasional mowing.

40|$|Abstract. Bacteria, {{protozoa}} and nematodes interact {{closely in}} soil ecosystems. Protozoa and nematodes eat bacteria (and occasionally each other), while bacteria defend themselves using chemical substances, resistant cell walls, irregular shapes and motility. Protozoa and nema-todes {{are very different}} types of organisms, and hence apply very different feeding mechanisms; thus many protozoa can pick and choose individual bacterial cells, whereas nematodes ingest bacterial patches more uncritically. Protozoa and nematodes are both aquatic organisms whose activity depends on available soil water, but differences in size, motility, resting stages and reproductive strategies mean that the soil physico-chemical environment influences the activity of protozoa and nematodes differently. For example, {{the relative importance of}} protozoa compared to nematodes may shift towards protozoa in very clay-rich soils. The interactions between the three organism groups have major ecological consequences such as modification of the bacterial communities and increased nitrogen mineralisation, both of which affect plant growth. Increased nitrogen mineralisation will usually be beneficial for plant growth, whereas the grazing-induced changes in the bacterial communities can be both beneficial and detrimental to plants. <b>Selective</b> protozoan <b>grazing</b> can favour plant inhibiting bacteria.

Aims: To estimate the density of hares and hence grazing pressure among years. To assess the response of biomass, vegetation height and composition to a cessation of hare grazing. Methods: We used indices of hare abundance based on spotlighting and counts of hare pellets on a transect. The effect of hare grazing on tall alpine herbfield was assessed by using 15 paired exclosure and control quadrats for six years. Results: The indices of hare abundance suggested densities {{similar to those in}} upland areas of Britain. Grazing did not affect the composition, cover of herbs or graminoids or, for 2010, vegetation height or biomass. Variation in vegetation and hare numbers among years was not correlated with climatic variables.

40|$|Large {{mammalian}} herbivores are key {{drivers of}} grazed community structure especially through their <b>selective</b> <b>grazing</b> which requires animals {{to discriminate between}} food items. The impact of local plant diversity on <b>selective</b> <b>grazing</b> is however largely unknown. We investigated the ability of sheep to discriminate between plant species within a patch (feeding station level) using sown plant mosaics involving up to four grassland species: perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), narrow-leaf plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium). This {{made it possible to}} vary two factors likely to decrease sheep discrimination ability: plant species richness and degree of resemblance. Patch species richness only slightly decreased sheep selectivity for ryegrass. Sheep preferred plantain and avoided yarrow relative to ryegrass, confirming that they can discriminate these species at a fine scale. Contrary to previous surveys, sheep did not select ryegrass over fescue, which suggests that species resemblance impaired within-patch discrimination. The degree of species similarity would thus interact with the local distribution of resources so that either positive or negative effects of neighbouring plants can be observed on selection for a focal plant species. This highlights the importance of improving our knowledge of how grazers discriminate plant species for predicting their susceptibility to herbivory...|$|E

Here, we present the responses in abundance and biomass of all identifiable protozooplankton taxa (heterotrophic protists ranging from 2 to 500 µm) during the bloom. Acantharia, dinoflagellates and ciliates together contributed > 90 % of protozooplankton biomass in the upper 100 m throughout the experiment with heterotrophic nanoflagellates, nassellaria, spumellaria, phaeodaria, foraminifera and the taxopodidean Sticholonche zanclea providing the remainder. Total protozooplankton biomass increased slightly from 1. 0 to 1. 3 g C m− 2 within the fertilized patch and remained at 0. 7 + 0. 04 g C m− 2 outside it.

Both the range of prey strains that supported growth as well as those that were ingested but not digested was very similar for the two grazers, suggesting a common property of these prey strains that lent them susceptible to grazing.

40|$|Higher {{stocking}} density under seasonal-rotation grazing {{is expected to}} increase plant abundance because expanded animal distribution and reduced <b>selective</b> <b>grazing</b> on forage species will reduce the spatial variation and competitive advantage of non-forage species compared to yearlong grazing. Rangeland scientists struggle with how long rangeland experiments must continue in order to detect grazing treatment effects, particularly in semi-arid ecosystems with slow responses and high spatio-temporal variability. My first study investigated grazing system effects on plant abundance (cover and density) over the short-term (12 yrs) or long-term (22 or 34 yrs) after accounting for covariates (mesquite and precipitation gradients). My second study assessed how grazing systems affected spatial variation in grass abundance over 22 or 34 years after accounting for precipitation gradient. The first study was a course resolution approach, looking at grazing impacts on plant abundance. The second study was a finer resolution assessment of the underlying assumption that rotational grazing systems reduce <b>selective</b> <b>grazing.</b> Using split-plot analysis of variance, with year as the split, changes in mean plant abundance and variance in grass abundance were compared between two grazing systems (yearlong vs. seasonal rotation), after accounting for covariate(s). Variance of grass abundance among sample locations within an experimental pasture was the measure of spatial variability and was expected to increase with <b>selective</b> <b>grazing.</b> Grazing systems did not influence plant abundance or spatial variation of grasses. The absence of grazing effect may be due to overriding influences of grazing intensity, large pasture sizes, temporal variation in precipitation, and few replicates. Specific to spatial variation, the absence of grazing system effect may be due to discrepancies in transect representation across ecological sites and spatial variation of grasses occurring at scales different than the 30 -m transect size. Like earlier research, my studies failed to substantiate the fundamental premise for implementing rotational grazing systems. This exposes challenges that confront rangeland scientists when implementing grazing studies in spatio-temporally heterogeneous ecosystems.

Herbivores affect plant communities directly by <b>selective</b> <b>grazing</b> of plant species, and indirectly by either epizoochory or endozoochory. Helianthemum nummularium is considered an increasing species because its distribution increased after the introduction of large, free-ranging grazers {{in at least two}} coastal dune grassland areas in Belgium. However, its seeds lack any obvious adaptations for epizoochory, and direct observations of plant/seed consumption are scarce. Through field and lab experiments, we assessed the dispersal ability of H. nummularium via endozoochory and epizoochory. In a differentiated grazer exclusion experiment, evidence was found that plants are grazed by large domestic ungulates and small wild herbivores although these incidences were rare. Direct endozoochory evidence remained scarce. No seeds were found germinating in field-collected dung, and only few seedlings emerged following a seed feeding experiment. However, once deposited, we found higher growth rates when seeds were mixed with dung and decreased establishment success when seeds were sown in combination with competitively superior species. Epizoochory was plausible because both fur and hooves of cattle and horses were potentially capable of contributing to the transport of H. nummularium seeds. We conclude that herbivores play a role in seed dispersal, while their <b>selective</b> <b>grazing</b> behaviour most probably creates an appropriate environment for Helianthemum establishment and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|In West Africa {{policies}} for prescribed early fire, <b>grazing</b> and <b>selective</b> tree cutting in the savanna-woodlands are rarely based on long-term experimental studies. The {{purpose of this}} study was to provide scientific evidence based on field data from two case studies for an informed discussion on the long-term response of herbaceous abundance both at the community and individual species levels to fire, <b>grazing,</b> <b>selective</b> cutting and their interactions. A long-term factorial experiment was established in two State forests reserve in Burkina Faso, and mainly differing in their soil attributes. Community abundance data recorded from line intercept sampling over 13 years, were analyzed using a multivariate ordination technique known as Principal Response Curves (PRC). The results indicate that disturbance regimes, independently or interactively, influenced species abundance over time with inter-site specificity. The dynamics of these disturbance regimes exhibited temporal variation which could be related, to some extent, to inter-annual variation in annual rainfall. The PRC ordination accounted for 38 % and 34 % of the variation within the data set for sites with deep and shallow soils, respectively. At the site with deep soils, more than one PRC axis was needed to summarize the community response sufficiently, suggesting that the species reacted in different ways to disturbances. The PRC method approach to the analysis of disturbance dynamics allowed us to distil the complexity of the community responses to those of individual species and to identify species that can serve as indicators of certain disturbance regimes...|$|R
5000|$|However, this {{ecosystem}} of hygrophile and edaphic freshwater forests is {{of general}} structural complexity and extent. It {{was in a}} state of extinction due to [...] "shifting cultivation, <b>grazing,</b> <b>selective</b> cutting of valuable or rare tree species, road and dam construction, and over-exploitation of non-timber forest products" [...] to meet the basic needs of rural community. This misuse also resulted in degradation of the ecosystem of rare plants and animals. It reached a chronic stage when indigenous multilayered plant communities became extinct in several areas with resultant creation of open fields, shrubs or grass savanna of least value. Thus, degradation of the ecologically rich system necessitated intervention at the Government level through enabling legislation to stop further damage to the ecosystem. The government of the Republic of Benin enacted a new forest law (no. 93-009) in July 1993, under which the uniqueness of riparian forests as refuge ecosystem for plant and wildlife of many kinds, was duly recognized. The rules enacted clearly defined that [...] "clearance of wood and shrubs is not allowed within 25 m at both sides of any waterway (article 28). Moreover, in the management plans of most forest reserves in Benin, gallery forests are to be left uncut, and rare species (e.g. Khaya spp. (Meliaceae), Milicia exelsa (Moraceae)) outside the gallery forests will not be cut either." [...] In spite of such a legislation the enforcement is not effective as it is reported that uncontrolled and unplanned, mostly illegal utilisation of the forests resources continues, particularly in non-protected areas.|$|R
40|$|As blooms of {{cyanobacteria}} {{expand and}} intensify in freshwater systems globally, {{there is increasing}} interest in their ecological effects. In addition to being public health hazards, cyanobacteria have long been considered a poor quality food for key zooplankton grazers that link phytoplankton to higher trophic levels. While past laboratory studies have found negative effects of nutritional constraints and defensive traits (i. e., toxicity and colonial or filamentous morphology) on the fitness of large generalist grazers (i. e., Daphnia), cyanobacterial blooms often co-exist with high biomass of small-bodied zooplankton in nature. Indeed, recent studies highlight the remarkable diversity and flexibility in zooplankton responses to cyanobacterial prey. Reviewed here are results {{from a wide range}} of laboratory and field experiments examining the interaction of cyanobacteria and a diverse zooplankton taxa including cladocerans, copepods, and heterotrophic protists from temperate to tropical freshwater systems. This synthesis shows that longer exposure to cyanobacteria can shift zooplankton communities toward better-adapted species, select for more tolerant genotypes within a species, and induce traits within the lifetime of individual zooplankton. In turn, the function of bloom-dominated plankton ecosystems, the coupling between primary producers and grazers, the stability of blooms, and the potential to use top down biomanipulation for controlling cyanobacteria depend largely on the species, abundance, and traits of interacting cyanobacteria and zooplankton. Understanding the drivers and consequences of zooplankton traits, such as physiological detoxification and <b>selective</b> vs. generalist <b>grazing</b> behavior, are therefore of major importance for future studies. Ultimately, co-evolutionary dynamics between cyanobacteria and their grazers may emerge as a critical regulator of blooms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
