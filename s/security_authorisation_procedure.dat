So far, in the current Dutch <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> spray drift is the only source of exposure.

Based on the REACH regulation, so-called Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) are subject to <b>authorisation.</b> The <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> aims to ensure the good functioning of the internal market, while assuring that risks of SVHCs are properly controlled. Since ECHA has become operational in 2008, recurring decisions on SVHCs have been made. The question posed in this article is: to what extent can decision making in the REACH <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> be assessed as legitimate?

40|$|The Agency {{has a role}} to help {{facilitate}} the procedure for authorising the placing in service 1 of vehicles and the harmonisation of the National Safety Authorities decision making processes for authorisation. This is particularly important in the transition phase until all the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) are complete and all networks and vehicles conform to the TSIs. In this context this report {{is part of a}} suite of initiatives intended to facilitate vehicle authorisation. These initiatives include: defining and maintaining the list of parameters to be checked for vehicle authorisation compiling and maintaining the Reference Document that: o lists the national rules for each parameter; o describes the national legal framework covering the <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure,</b> and o records the equivalence of the various national rules for each parameter. The Agency, under the auspices of its Cross Acceptance Working Party, set about understanding and documenting the different existing national <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures,</b> their commonalities and differences. The analysis also identified technical subject areas of authorisation that generated the most cost, time delay and uncertainty. It soon became clear that as well as determining the “status quo ” of <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> used today, it was essential to have a common understanding of the new procedure contained within the recast Interoperability Directive. This led to the initiative with the European Commission to document a common understanding {{in the form of a}} Commission Recommendation (known as DV 29 [2]).

In addition, the GMO Panel produces guidance documents to specify certain aspects of GMO risk assessment and to provide guidance for the preparation and presentation of GMO applications.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND In {{order to}} assess surface water {{exposure}} to active substances of plant protection products (PPP) in the EU, the FOCUS (FOrum for the Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe) surface water workgroup introduced four runoff and six drainage scenarios for Step 3 of the tiered FOCUSsw approach. These scenarios may not necessarily represent realistic worst-case situations for the different Member States of the EU. Hence, the suitability of the scenarios for risk assessment in the national <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> is not known. RESULTS Using Germany as an example, the paper illustrates how national soil-climate scenarios can be developed to model entries of active substances into surface waters from runoff and erosion (using model PRZM) and from drainage (using model MACRO). In the <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> for PPPs on member state level, such soil-climate scenarios {{can be used to}} determine exposure endpoints with a defined overall percentile. CONCLUSION The approach allows the development of national specific soil-climate scenarios and to calculate percentile-based exposure endpoints. The scenarios have been integrated into a software tool analogous to FOCUS-SWASH which can be used in the future to assess surface water exposure in <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> of PPPs in Germany...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the operation of}} the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives (EURL) and its role in the <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> of feed additives in the European Union. Feed additives are authorised according to Regulation (EC) No. 1831 / 2003, which introduced a completely revised <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> and also established the EURL. The regulations authorising feed additives contain conditions of use such as legal limits of the feed additives, which require the availability of a suitable method of analysis for official control purposes under real world conditions. It is the task of the EURL to evaluate the suitability of analytical methods as proposed by the industry for this purpose. Moreover, the paper shows that one of the major challenges is the huge variety of the methodology applied in feed additive analysis, thus requiring expertise in quite different analytical areas. In order to cope with this challenge, the EURL is supported by a network of national reference laboratories (NRLs) and only the merged knowledge of all NRLs allows for a scientifically sound assessment of the analytical methods.
