5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a serious blemish {{on a beautiful}} poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or {{that it is a}} statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} criticized {{element of the}} film is its ending. The film has a more traditional [...] "happy ending" [...] which contradicts the tone {{of the rest of the}} picture.**Vest. pgs. 134–5* This has led to speculation that this ending is the product of John's imagination, caused by hallucinations from his forced coma after he is incarcerated. As one observer mused, [...] "The conclusion of Minority Report <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a joke Spielberg played on his detractors—an act of perfectly measured deviltry." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{programme}} was a {{hit with}} listeners, although a BBC World Service listener in India allegedly [...] "strongly objected to 'Robots {{taking part in a}} comedy show'" [...] and another in Sierra Leone thought that [...] "as a source of information it is misleading". One listener complained to the Radio Times that [...] "In just about 50 years of radio and latterly TV listening and watching, this <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> the most fatuous, inane, childish, pointless, codswallopping drivel...It is not even remotely funny".|$|E
500|$|Music critic Chet Flippo {{wrote in}} a Texas Monthly article {{entitled}} [...] "Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album {{is more than a}} good country music; it's almost Gospel": [...] "The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C album, and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".|$|E
500|$|The 1933 film My Weakness had {{previously}} {{used the word}} [...] "gay" [...] as an overt descriptor of homosexuality; one of two men pining away for the same woman suddenly suggests a solution to their mutual problem: [...] "Let's be gay!" [...] However, the Studio Relations Committee censors decreed that the line was too risqué {{and had to be}} muffled. [...] The 1934 film This Side of Heaven included a scene in which a fussy, gossipy interior decorator tries to sell a floral fabric pattern to a customer, who knowingly replies, [...] "It <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a bit too gay." ...|$|E

500|$|Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe {{noted that}} the buildup to the finale added intrigue {{at the cost of}} cliche. John Levesque of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said [...] "the whole six-episode arc <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a B or B-minus effort that got bogged down in one {{character}} and gave us all-too-familiar subplots that were lacking in imagination." [...] Phil Rosenthal of the Chicago Sun-Times described the arc as a [...] "lingering exit". Associated Press Television critic Frazier Moore found the entire story arc to be [...] "a dramatic and fitting farewell for the character - and a proud performance by Smits". The Buffalo News describes the arc as [...] "a brilliant five-episode story line".|$|E
500|$|In 1989 President George H.W. Bush awarded Kennan the Medal of Freedom, the nation's {{greatest}} civilian honor. Yet {{he remained}} a realist critic of recent U.S. presidents, urging the U.S. government to [...] "withdraw from its public advocacy {{of democracy and}} human rights", saying that the [...] "tendency to see ourselves {{as the center of}} political enlightenment and as teachers to a great part {{of the rest of the}} world <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> unthought-through, vainglorious and undesirable". These ideas were particularly applicable to U.S. relations with China and Russia. Kennan opposed the Clinton administration's war in Kosovo and its expansion of NATO (the establishment of which he had also opposed half a century earlier), expressing fears that both policies would worsen relations with Russia. He described NATO enlargement as a [...] "strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan, at {{his website}} Jammer's Reviews, gave [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] {{two out of}} four. Prior to airing, he {{considered}} {{the possibility that the}} crew might actually return home and thus the series would go in a different direction. This was based on the involvement of Berman in the writing, the length of time for the crew returning home matching the summer hiatus and the possibility that the fifth series would cover the crew's reintegration into Federation society. After watching [...] "Hope and Fear", he said [...] "At its fundamental core, a story like [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> almost completely pointless." [...] He said that once again, the status quo of the series was maintained and nothing of note changes. He called the score [...] "wonderous", the sets [...] "impressive" [...] and the direction of the episode [...] "stellar", but said that the plot was [...] "cobbled together out of unlikely coincidences and prior story events that have been twisted to fit the end result." ...|$|E
500|$|The WiiWare {{version has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{with the central}} criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, £10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which [...] "sacrifices none of [...] classic-influenced charm". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that [...] "the prospect of Amaya finally earning {{a little something for}} the hard work he invested in this masterpiece <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> satisfyingly poetic" [...] and [...] "absolutely worth your money". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. Edge compared the remake to , satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story [...] "belongs on a Nintendo system" [...] and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master, in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Drowned in Sound, Alexander Tudor {{observed}} the album's [...] "abrasiveness, brute force, and determination {{to push the}} instrument to its limits," [...] describing a [...] "relentless pummelling of metal in motion; often aggressive or chaotic, but using scales to evoke a sense of discipline" [...] while noting that Stetson was [...] "equally at home with classical minimalism." [...] Exclaim! reviewer Vincent Pollard noted how Vol. 3 [...] "organically and coherently blends Stetson's avant-garde playing and dark, complex themes with accessible and compelling compositions," [...] while MusicOMH commented that Stetson was [...] "finding guttural, fuzzy, violent sounds from his saxophone... but also finding a disarming warmth where necessary." [...] In his review for No Ripcord, Stephen Wragg stated that [...] "there’s such a polyphonic richness to these recordings that it sounds, at times, like five people are present" [...] and noted that the techniques employed in the recording of the album [...] "creates this heady, vertiginous rush– adrenaline-inducing in its deftness; and that’s an effect that <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> incredibly difficult to recreate in music." [...] Spins Richard Gehr suggested that the music was [...] "densely multiphonic, often claustrophobic, and reeks of fear and flight" [...] but that it [...] "offers at least a slight sense of salvation," [...] {{and concluded that the}} final album in the trilogy was [...] "music of the moment, a work of granular epiphanies that accrete, finally, into a magnificent whole." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 6, 1956, Raymond {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in Westport, Connecticut. Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake's 1956 Corvette at twice the [...] speed limit, he hit a tree and was killed. Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances {{as a result of the}} weather. Driving in the convertible with its top down, Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall. Drake was thrown clear of the crash, but Raymond, with his seat belt buckled, died instantly. Speculation surrounds the nature of his death, with some, Drake included, believing Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death, which led Drake to say Raymond [...] "had been trying to kill himself". Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond's personal life. Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs, and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation: [...] "Committing suicide <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an odd way for a man of Raymond's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance". Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert's biography, [...] "probably out of consideration to Raymond's surviving family". Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond [...] "hit the accelerator by mistake" [...] instead of the brake. Raymond is buried in St. John's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Dale Launer, who was {{a friend}} of the Rodger family, stated that he had counseled Rodger on {{approaching}} and befriending women, but that Rodger did not follow the advice. He said in an interview, [...] "I first met [...] when he was aged eight or nine and I could see then that {{there was something wrong with}} him. I'm not a psychologist, but looking back now he <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> someone who was broken from the moment of conception." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the piece}} had its first West End revival in 1970 {{the play was}} warmly though not rapturously praised by the critics, {{but by the time}} of the next major production, in 1976, Irving Wardle of The Times considered, [...] "Stylistically, it is Coward's masterpiece: his most {{complete}} success in imposing his own view of things on the brute facts of existence," [...] and Michael Billington of The Guardian wrote of Coward's influence on Harold Pinter. In 2004, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "With Hay Fever and Private Lives, Blithe Spirit <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> being one of Coward 's three indisputable comic masterpieces. [...] the outrageous frivolity with which Coward treats mortality that makes the piece so bracing." ...|$|E

2500|$|During 1979, von Balthasar distanced {{himself from}} a {{newspaper}} attack on Opus Dei which had cited his earlier accusations of integrism. [...] He wrote in a personal letter to the Prelature, sent also to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, that [...] "because of my lack of concrete information, I am not able to give an informed opinion about Opus Dei today. On the other hand, one thing <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> obvious: many of the criticisms levelled against the movement, including those of your own journal concerning the religious instruction given by Opus Dei members, {{seem to me to}} be false and anti-clerical." [...] Von Balthasar maintained his unfavourable judgment of Escrivá's spirituality and repeated it in a television interview during 1984, but he did not renew his criticism of Opus Dei as an organization.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1844 Transmutation {{became a}} middle class talking point with the {{anonymous}} publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation by Robert Chambers presenting Lamarckian views. It brought the notion of transmutation out into the public arena and was a sensation, quickly becoming a best-seller in fashionable society circles and going into new editions. Darwin read it in November, and when questioned by Hooker in January he admired its prose, but wrote that the [...] "geology <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> bad, & his zoology far worse". The book was liked by many Quakers and Unitarians. Darwin's friend the Unitarian physiologist William Carpenter called it [...] "a very beautiful and a very interesting book", and helped Chambers with correcting later editions. Critics thanked God that the author began [...] "in ignorance and presumption", for the revised versions [...] "would {{have been much more}} dangerous". Vestiges paved the way for discussion, but emphasised the need for secure mastery of awkward facts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 American Journalist John P. Harris {{wrote an}} {{editorial}} in the Salina Journal highlighting a lack of balance in the Soviet system, which promoted an International Women's Day for the female workers without promoting a corresponding day for male workers. Harris stated that although he did not begrudge Soviet women their March day of glory, its resulting gender inequality clearly exhibited a serious flaw in the Communist system, which, [...] "makes much of the equal rights it has given the sexes, but as it turns out, the women are much more equal than the men." [...] Harris stated that while the men toiled along in their grooves doing what their government and womenfolk tell them to do, there was no day when males are recognised for their service, leading Harris to conclude that [...] "This <b>strikes</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> unwarranted discrimination and rank injustice." [...] Similar questions about the inequality of observing women's day without a corresponding men's day occurred in media publications from the 1960s through to the 1990s, at which time the first attempts at inaugurating international Men's Day are recorded.|$|E
