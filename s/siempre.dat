5|$|Construction {{began on}} the part of SR905 between Britannia Boulevard and <b>Siempre</b> Viva Road in April 2008, and from Brittania Boulevard to I-805 in July 2009. Efforts were made to keep {{construction}} going despite a shortfall in funding from state bonds in 2009. The part between Britannia Boulevard and <b>Siempre</b> Viva Road opened in December 2010. The interchange with I-805 began to be upgraded in April 2011, and the construction, which used $20million in federal funding, finished in February 2012. The final freeway segment of SR905 between I-805 and Britannia Boulevard opened on July 30, 2012. The entire cost of the project connecting I-805 to the border crossing was $441million.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a banda music project, the album earned Fernández a Latin Grammy Award for Best Ranchero Album, four Premios Oye! and a Grammy nomination. Para <b>Siempre</b> is considered responsible for bringing Mexican traditional music to a younger audience that had never listened to the singer before. Fernández released music videos for the twelve tracks and recorded a TV special on his ranch in Guadalajara, Jalisco. A sold-out promotional tour led to the recording of the live album Primera Fila, Fernández' follow up album.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rican {{performer}} Ednita Nazario {{peaked at}} number {{one for the}} first time with her 20th album, Por Ti. Bronco's <b>Siempre</b> Arriba also spent one week at the top, replacing fellow Mexican performers Los Tigres del Norte on August 9, 2003. A.B. Quintanilla with Kumbia Kings, Intocable and Los Temerarios were the only performers to hit the top spot twice in 2003. Cuban salsa performer Celia Cruz, who died on July 16, 2003, debuted at number one on the chart and won the Grammy Award for Best Salsa/Merengue Album with her last recording Regalo del Alma.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} CD track listing {{was released}} on September 18, 2007 in México, September 25, 2007 in United States and on February 26, 2008 in Spain with an album cover featuring the performer on a red background. On April 15, 2008, a CD/DVD format, with a black background on the cover was released, which included music videos for the 12tracks recorded on Para <b>Siempre,</b> directed by Benjamin Hidalgo. A karaoke version of the album, with a yellow background, was released in April 2008.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{upgraded}} to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and <b>Siempre</b> Viva Road, SR905 {{had a direct}} connection with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When that segment of the SR905 freeway was opened in 2010, the interchange with SR125 had initially been omitted, forcing traffic on SR905 and SR125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which continues to parallel SR905) to make the connection. To help fix this problem, ramps from SR905 in both directions and SR11 westbound to SR125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, {{at a cost of}} over $21 million. Southbound traffic on SR125 must currently still exit to Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's south end in order to connect to SR905, but the southbound ramps are scheduled to begin construction in 2018.|$|E
5|$|SR 905 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Tocayo Avenue and Oro Vista Road in Nestor. It begins as a freeway, intersecting with I-5 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. After interchanges with Beyer Boulevard and Picador Boulevard, the freeway then intersects I-805. Following this, SR 905 veers southeast to parallel Otay Mesa Road, with interchanges at Caliente Avenue (in Pacific Gateway Park), Britannia Boulevard, and La Media Road. After La Media, the route interchanges with the SR 125 (South Bay Expressway) toll road and the SR 11 freeway, which is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Immediately after, SR 905 turns south to its final interchange at <b>Siempre</b> Viva Road before the route ends at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, which truck traffic must use to cross the border.|$|E
5|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} as a tie between Michel Camilo and Tomatito for Spain and Paquito D'Rivera for Tropicana Nights. D'Rivera holds the record for most wins as performer in this category, with six (including one awarded as the Paquito D'Rivera Quintet) out of eight nominations. Bebo Valdés won the award twice for albums which also earned the Grammy Award: Bebo de Cuba received the Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album accolade in 2005, while Juntos Para <b>Siempre,</b> by Bebo and Chucho Valdés won for Latin Jazz Album in 2010. Bebo and Chucho Valdés, Camilo, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, and Arturo Sandoval have twice been awarded. In 2012, the award was given to Sandoval for the album Dear Diz (Every Day I Think of You), which was also nominated for Album of the Year. Since its inception, the award has been presented to musicians or ensembles originating from Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, United States, and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} finished as the forty-fourth {{album of}} the Billboard 200 of 1995 and finished at number 123 on the Billboard 200 albums of 1996. Two years after Selena's murder, Dreaming of You and <b>Siempre</b> Selena (1996) occupied {{the third and fourth}} slots respectively on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Dreaming of You sold 420,500 copies between 1997 and 1999, and sold 190,000 units in 1997 alone. The biopic Selena (1997) contributed to a 65% increase of sales for Dreaming of You for that year. Dreaming of You sold half a million copies in Texas. Some Texas retailers criticized sale figures for the state because the album had sold poorly at their music stores. By December 1995, Dreaming of You had sold two million copies in the U.S. and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipments of two million copies. Within ten months of its release, the album was nearing triple-platinum status; it was eventually certified 35×platinum (Latin field) by the RIAA, denoting shipment of 3.5 million units. It remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S. with five million copies sold worldwide as of January 2015. A percentage of the proceeds from the album's sales was donated to the Selena Scholarship Fund.|$|E
25|$|With {{the release}} of <b>Siempre</b> in 2006, the quartet charted one of the best-selling music albums of all time, with five million copies in just one year.|$|E
25|$|The Classic era of Argentine {{rock music}} was {{completely}} over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated, grandiose, and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including Pastoral, and Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de <b>Siempre.</b> But {{it was the}} beginning of the period of symphonic and progressive rock dominance.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2014 Rivera's album 1969 - <b>Siempre,</b> En Vivo Desde Monterrey, Parte 2 went on {{sale and}} sold over 10,000 in the week ending July 6, {{according}} to Nielsen SoundSCan. Since the album's release, Rivera has tied with Selena Quintanilla for most no. 1s by a female on the Regional Mexican Albums chart. Billboard magazine named Rivera the highest-ranked woman on the year-end Top Latin Artists chart of 2014, ranking at No. 5. The next-highest female artist is Shakira, at No. 32.|$|E
25|$|After Soda's separation, Cerati {{released}} the studio albums Amor Amarillo (1993), Bocanada (1999), +Bien (2001) and <b>Siempre</b> Es Hoy (2002). In 2002 he released 11 Episodios Sinfónicos that contained some Soda Stereo and solo songs played {{live with a}} symphony orchestra. Cerati also released electronic music as Plan V, and other projects. Ahí Vamos! (2006), is considered as a back-to-basics return. His last album to date is Fuerza Natural (2009), which changes several things about his previous albums and has been very well received by fans and critics.|$|E

25|$|Nueva Trova, {{initially}} so popular, {{was dealt}} a blow {{by the fall}} of the Soviet Union, though it was already fading. It suffered inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their eyes opened to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 70s now seem dry and passé; once a theme is no longer topical, the piece rests solely on its musical quality. Those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, amongst which Puebla's Hasta <b>siempre</b> stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} Cuban pianist/composers of the 20th century was Ernesto Lecuona (18951963). Lecuona composed over six hundred pieces, mostly in the Cuban vein, and was a pianist of exceptional quality. He was a prolific composer of songs and music for stage and film. His works consisted of zarzuela, Afro-Cuban and Cuban rhythms, suites and many songs that became Latin standards. They include Siboney, Malagueña and The Breeze And I (Andalucía). In 1942 his great hit Always in my heart (<b>Siempre</b> en mi Corazon) was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song; it lost out to White Christmas. The Ernesto Lecuona Symphonic Orchestra performed the premiere of Lecuona's Black Rhapsody in the Cuban Liberation Day Concert at Carnegie Hall on 10 October 1943.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003, Urs {{became a}} member of the {{international}} musical quartet Il Divo along with Carlos Marín (Spain), Sébastien Izambard (France), and David Miller (United States). He had an informal first audition with the group's creator, Simon Cowell. In Cowell's office, he simply asked Urs to sing for him unaccompanied. Impressed by Buhler's tenor voice, Cowell offered him a place in Il Divo. Their first album, Il Divo, became a worldwide multi-platinum selling record when released in November 2004, entering Billboard at number four and selling five million copies worldwide in less than a year and knocking Robbie Williams from the number one spot in the charts. Their second album, Ancora, was released on November 7, 2005 in the United Kingdom. Il Divo's third album <b>Siempre</b> was released on November 21, 2006 in the United States and on November 27, 2006 internationally.

500|$|In October 2007, {{the album}} debuted at number {{two on the}} Billboard Top Latin Albums and spent almost its entire chart run in the Top Ten; it topped the chart for five non-consecutive weeks, three weeks in 2008 and two in 2009, when it {{replaced}} Primera Fila, Fernández' follow-up live album, {{at the top of}} the chart, being the first time that a male performer replaces himself at number-one, and the first time since Selena did it in 1995. According to Sony BMG Norte, with over one million copies sold worldwide, Para <b>Siempre</b> is the most successful release by Vicente Fernández since 2000. Only seven other recordings by Fernández sold more units in the United States. It was the best-selling Regional Mexican album of 2008 and at the Billboard Top Latin Albums Year-end chart the album ranked at number two, behind [...] by Wisin & Yandel. Para <b>Siempre</b> was purchased on 50,000mobile phones in Mexico, a [...] "novelty" [...] for a regional Mexican album. The album's success is attributed to a change in the sound; instead of employing multiple composers and producers as in previous albums, Para <b>Siempre</b> was written and produced entirely by Joan Sebastian. Miguel Trujillo, Sony BMG México CEO, commented about the album, [...] "This album connected to a new generation that probably never listened to Vicente before." [...] Para <b>Siempre</b> was named the best-selling Regional Mexican album of the decade in the United States.|$|E
500|$|... "No Quiero Saber" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by A.B. Quintanilla III, Selena's brother and principal record producer.

[...] He {{also said}} that [...] "Puente" [...] was the only song that was [...] "not allowed to undress". When asked about [...] "Puente"'s main theme, Arjona commented, [...] "Although many believe is a threshed topic, it isn't for a Cuban, be it on the island or Florida. The status of this dispute hasn't changed since 1959 and I've never seen {{something}} as disgusting as a rivalry between people occasioned from politics. Chávez can fight with Uribe, Fidel with Obama, but what has this to do with two third-generation cousins that inherit an enmity for a politic matter".|$|E
500|$|Bueno {{was booked}} {{to appear on}} Saturday on the show <b>Siempre</b> Sábado. Instead, his band played in the show as a tribute without anybody singing. Conspiracy {{theories}} surfaced claiming that Bueno's death was linked to a [...] "Bailanta Mafia" [...] and that he received death threats in the days prior the accident.|$|E
500|$|... {{the portion}} from SR 905 to Enrico Fermi Drive is completed. On that segment, plans were to {{construct}} two interchanges at Enrico Fermi Drive and <b>Siempre</b> Viva Road as the proposed route curves {{to the southeast}} before reaching the border crossing. SR 11 will operate as a toll road once the entire route is completed.|$|E
500|$|On {{his review}} for Billboard En Español, Joel Brito {{declared}} that the tracks, [...] "Un Millón de Primaveras" [...] ("A Million Springs") and [...] "El Último Beso" [...] ("The Last Kiss"), are tender and desperate, with Vicente's voice powerful, sweet and cheerful; while [...] "Estos Celos", {{was one of his}} best performances, along with [...] "Niña Hechicera" [...] ("Wicked Girl").

500|$|Six years later, American duranguense band Alacranes Musical {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Por Amarte Así" [...] on their studio album Ahora y <b>Siempre</b> (2007). Their cover peaked at [...] number {{two at the}} Hot Latin Songs chart and became their first number-one song on the Billboard Regional Mexican Songs chart. An editor for Allmusic described as one of that songs in the album [...] "the group's festive sound is showcased on fast-paced songs of romance".

Para <b>Siempre</b> was certified diamond in Mexico for sales of 600,000 units. The sales were, according to Sony BMG Marketing Vice-President and A Nir Seroussi, a [...] "phenomenon" [...] because [...] "the music market in Mexico is completely pirated" [...] and Fernández's albums usually sell only 50,000 units per album.|$|E
