They {{were able to}} do so for hours, because they had <b>steam</b> <b>bypass</b> systems designed to de-couple the reactor output from the generator electrical output. The three units were reconnected to the grid within 5 hours. Bruce A and B stations were designed to operate for at least 6 hours disconnected from the grid.|$|E
30|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>bypassing</b> from {{injection}} {{to production}} well is another factor impacts the thermal efficiency of steam injection. The producer {{is designed to}} remove condensed steam and movable bitumen through gravity drainage. If the condensation rate of fluids is in balance with the fluid movement created by gravity, then, the <b>steam</b> <b>bypassing</b> is prevented (Yuan and Nugent 2013). During bitumen production, a liquid pool is formed around the production well. This liquid pool, being denser than steam, is not easily displaced by the steam phase and prevents live steam from flowing directly into the producer. This phenomenon is known as steam trap {{and the maintenance of}} this liquid pool is called steam trap control (Gates and Leskiw 2010).|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the {{evidence}} presented by the <b>steam</b> trap <b>bypass</b> tube failure, determining the failure mechanism, determining the root cause of the failure and to recommend appropriate corrective actions. The power plant is a coal fired power plant with its normal operation temperature of 540 °C. This study consists of failure mode inventory collection of the <b>steam</b> trap <b>bypass</b> tube failure, collection of background information about the process, component function and operating conditions. Detailed investigation carried out by visual examination, nondestructive testing (NDT), metallurgical testing which consists of microstructure examination, chemical testing and mechanical testing. Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Glow Discharge Spectrometer (GDS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (XRD) experiments were used throughout the investigation on the sample obtained. From the evidence with considering the contribution factors such as temperature, pressure and environment, a fault analysis was made and it can be concluded that the cause of failure to the <b>steam</b> trap <b>bypass</b> is due to multi causes which consists of creep failure and hydrogen damage. The root cause of high temperature creep and hydrogen damage which occurred at the <b>steam</b> trap <b>bypass</b> tube is due to material properties that are inadequate for the actual operating conditions of a <b>steam</b> trap <b>bypass</b> tube which is not according to the specification.

50|$|Reactor {{pressure}} in a BWR {{is controlled by}} the main turbine or main <b>steam</b> <b>bypass</b> valves. Unlike a PWR, where the turbine steam demand is set manually by the operators, in a BWR, the turbine valves will modulate to maintain reactor pressure at a setpoint. Under this control mode, the turbine will automatically follow reactor power changes. When the turbine is offline or trips, the main steam bypass/dump valves will open to direct steam directly to the condenser. These bypass valves will automatically or manually modulate as necessary to maintain reactor pressure and control the reactor's heatup and cooldown rates while steaming is still in progress.|$|E

40|$|In {{power plant}} {{locations}} with adequate supply of cooling water the steam from the steam turbine is condensed {{in a water}} cooled condenser. In most instances circulating water from the cooling tower is used to condense the turbine exhaust steam. In other instances once through cooling is deployed wherein water from a lake, river or sea is used to condense the turbine exhaust steam. In water challenged locations or locations where wet cooling cannot be deployed due to permitting or regulatory issues, the steam from the steam turbine is condensed in an air cooled condenser (ACC) wherein ambient air is used to cool and condense the turbine exhaust steam. In a combined cycle plant, during normal operation, the water or air cooled condenser condenses the turbine exhaust <b>steam.</b> During <b>bypass</b> operation, when the steam turbine is out of service, the high-pressure steam from the HRSG is attemperated in a pressure reducing/desuperheating (PRD) valve and then admitted into the water cooled or air cooled condenser. The <b>bypass</b> <b>steam</b> flow is substantially higher than the design turbine exhaust steam flow and the duration of bypass operation can vary from {{a few hours to}} several weeks. The requirements for admission of <b>bypass</b> <b>steam</b> into a water cooled condenser are substantially different from that for an air cooled condenser. In a water cooled condenser the <b>bypass</b> <b>steam</b> is admitted in the <b>steam</b> dome. The <b>bypass</b> <b>steam</b> as well as the turbine exhaust steam is condensed outside the tubes. In an air cooled condenser the <b>bypass</b> <b>steam</b> is admitted in the large diameter <b>steam</b> duct. The <b>bypass,</b> as well as the turbine exhaust steam (normal operation), is condensed inside the tubes. There are similarities and differences in the requirements for admission of <b>bypass</b> <b>steam</b> into a water cooled and air cooled condenser. The differences must be identified and addressed to ensure safe and reliable performance of the condenser...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{investigation}} of <b>steam</b> <b>bypass</b> and pressure control system (SBPCS) is performed by RETRAN- 3 D code for Lungmen nuclear power plant. The {{purposes of this}} study are: 1) to demonstrate that the dynamic response of SBPCS is capable of controlling the system pressure smoothly when the reactor steam generation exceeds the steam flow used by the turbine, and 2) to study the effect of pressure regulator (PR) on dynamic response. The dynamic response of SBPCS is evaluated by means of the perturbations induced by pressure setpoint changes. The parametric study of SBPCS performs the effect of lead-lag regulator on the dynamic response. Finally, the resultant dynamic responses indicate that the design of SBPCS is capable of damping the system oscillation and bring the system to a stable state...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{consists}} of two steps. The first step {{is the development of}} a TRACE (TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine) /PARCS(Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator) model of Lungmen nuclear power plant (NPP) which includes the vessel, reactor internal pumps (RIPs), main steam lines, and important control systems (such as the feedwater control system, <b>steam</b> <b>bypass</b> & pressure control system, and recirculation flow control system), etc [...] Key parameters were identified to refine the TRACE/PARCS model further in the frame of a steady state analysis. The second step is the performance of Lungmen NPP TRACE/PARCS model transient analyses. The MSIV closure direct scram (MSIVCD, MSIV = Main Steamline Isolation Valve) transient data of Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) is used to verify the Lungmen NPP TRACE/PARCS model. The trends of TRACE/PARCS analysis results are consistent with the FSAR data. It indicates that there is a respectable accuracy in the Lungmen NPP TRACE/PARCS model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-An {{analysis}} is provided of the effeds of steam pipe acoustics {{on the control}} of steam pressore in boiling water reactors. A madel is developed for the process which encompasses the reactor vessel, the main <b>steam</b> piping, the <b>bypass</b> system piping, the turbiie throttle valve and bypass valve, and associated control equipment. It is shown that instability of the closed loop can OCCUT unless the acoustics are soitably accounted for. Moreover, it is shown that although classical compensation schemes may lead to adequate controller designs in some situations, such regulators are limited {{in their ability to}} provide fast pressure recovery and can thus contribute to undesirable oscillations between reactor pressure and water level conlrol loops. §tate variable methods are shown to lead to fundamentally different control structures which eliminate this difficulty but other considerations are noted which can limit their application. These are, however, minor when compared to the benefits attainable. ...|$|R
40|$|The turbine {{bypass system}} (TBS) {{provides}} operational flexibility so that the plant may accept certain load changes without disturbing the nuclear steam supply system. The TBS is designed to discharge a stated percentage of rated main steam flow directly to the main condensers, bypassing the turbine. This <b>steam</b> <b>bypass</b> enables the plant to take step load reductions up to the TBS capacity without the reactor or turbine tripping. The system is also used during startup and shutdown to control reactor pressure for a boiling water reactor (BWR) and steam generator pressure for a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The TBS is not required for safe shutdown as the relief and safety valves are operated under emergency conditions. The system {{is not required to}} function as a heat sink for the prevention or mitigation of postulated accidents. Failure of the TBS during a load reduction or turbine trip would result in the actuation of the relief valves and possibly the safety valves. The PSB reviews the system from the branch connection at the main steam system to the main condensers. 1. The PSB reviews the TBS to determine that a failure of the system or system components will not have an adverse effect on essential equipment. 2. The PSB reviews the TBS functional requirements for both normal and abnormal operating conditions, and with respect to the following: (a) capability to isolate those portions of the system that could leak or malfunction; (b) capa-bility to perform adequate operational testing and inservice inspection; (c) to assure there are no adverse effects of postulated system piping failures on safety-related equipment; and (d) to reduce the possibility of reactor tran-sients due to inadvertent operation of the TBS from faults in the TBS instru-mentation and control...|$|E
40|$|The loss of nonemergency {{ac power}} {{is assumed to}} result {{in the loss of}} all power to the station auxiliaries. This {{situation}} could result either from a complete loss of the external grid (offsite) or a loss of the onsite ac distribution system. It is different from the loss of load condition considered in Standard Review Plan (SRP) Section 15. 2. 2 because, in the latter case, ac power remains available to operate the station auxiliaries. The major difference is that in the loss of ac power transient all the reactor coolant circulation pumps are simultaneously tripped by the initiating event. This causes a flow coastdown as well as a decrease in heat removal by the secondary system. Within a few seconds the turbine trips and the reactor coolant system is isolated, causing the pressure and temperature of the coolant to increase. A reactor trip is initiated. The diesel generators are automatically started and provide elec-tric power to the vital loads. The sensible and decay heat loads are handled by actuation of the steam relief system, <b>steam</b> <b>bypass</b> to the condenser, reactor core isolation cooling system in a boiling water reactor (BWR) emergency core cooling system, (BWR) and auxiliary feedwater system in a pressurized water reactor The review of the loss of ac power transient includes the sequence of events, the analytical model, the values of parameters used in the analytical model, and the predicted consequences of the transient. The sequence of events described in the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) is reviewed by both RSB and the Instrumentation and Control Systems Branch (ICSB). The RSB reviewer concentrates on the need for the reactor protection system, the engineered safety systems, and operator action to secure and maintain the reactor in a safe condition...|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{pressures}} used in the steam circuits and the materials used, steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia. When warming up a steam turbine for use, the main steam stop valves (after the boiler) have a bypass line to allow superheated <b>steam</b> to slowly <b>bypass</b> the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine. Also, a turning gear is engaged {{when there is no}} steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion. After first rotating the turbine by the turning gear, allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane (no bowing), then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine, first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10-15 RPM (0.17-0.25 Hz) to slowly warm the turbine. The warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours.|$|R
