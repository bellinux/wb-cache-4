5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for <b>six</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>of</b> which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

[...] In the mid-1960s, the top deck lay under an estimated <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> (...) <b>of</b> mud. [...] A Georgetown group attempted to salvage and restore the vessel as a tourist attraction, and in 1964 the U.S. Navy formally abandoned it, rendering it eligible for private salvage; but the attempt failed for lack of funds. [...] As of 2011, the ship's boiler stack was still visible at low tide.|$|E

60|$|That those {{throes of}} {{sickness}} ensued, I need not say. A short time after passing Ramsgate, Serjeant Lankin, {{who had been}} exceedingly gay and satirical--(in his calm way; he quotes Horace, my favorite bits as an author, to myself, and has a quiet snigger, and, so to speak, amontillado flavor, exceedingly pleasant)--Lankin, with a rueful and livid countenance, descended into his berth, in the which that <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> serjeant packed himself I don't know how.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2005, Sports Minister Richard Caborn announced: [...] "They say the Cup Final will be there, barring <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> snow or {{something}} like that". By November 2005, WNSL were still hopeful of a handover date of 31 March, {{in time for the}} cup final on 13 May. However, in December 2005, the builders admitted that there was a [...] "material risk" [...] that the stadium might not be ready in time for the final. In February 2006 these worries were confirmed, with the FA moving the game to Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|On December 24, 1910, Mazama {{reached the}} landing for Fort Klamath, on the Wood River with a barge loaded with freight in tow.

Based on this inflow, and the outflow to the Crowe River, the provincial government estimates that the water of the lake is replaced every three years. The lake is normally totally frozen over from mid-December to the third week in April, when the ice usually breaks up.|$|E
2500|$|The 17th and 18th {{century is}} marked by severe floodings issues, which caused {{widespread}} damage and population shifts. These floods eventually caused the disappearance of towns near Acolman such as Tlacuilocan, Tzapotla and Tescazonco. [...] During one of the attempts to control the rivers in the area, a dam was constructed which cause havoc for the area. During one of the floods, the monastery was submerged in over <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water, covering the church floor with silt and nearly destroyed the cloisters. In the 17th and 18th centuries, epidemics such as smallpox decimated the native population.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1935, Robert Young {{struck a}} {{submerged}} log and sank in the Willamette River near Oswego.

2500|$|During its service, the Cumberland was {{involved}} in a number of serious incidents. [...] In November 1872, the ship was frozen in the ice in the St. Mary's River; most of the crew trekked on foot from the ship to Collingwood, Ontario; leaving a few cremembers and passengers on the vessel. [...] The fate of those left aboard is not known, but it is likely the ship overwintered in the ice. [...] In November 1874, the Cumberland was caught in a storm on its way to Thunder Bay. [...] Caulking of the ship's hull came loose in several areas, and it began to take on water. [...] To lighten the load, livestock on the deck was thrown overboard. [...] The ship made it to port with <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water in the hold and promptly sank. [...] In November 1875, the Cumberland was again caught in a storm, and was grounded near Silver Islet, Ontario. Luckily, there was little damage from this incident, and cargo and passengers soon arrived safely in Thunder Bay. [...] In September 1876, the ship ran aground again, this time at Owen Sound.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the fighting in Sicily, Durnford-Slater took over operational command of both No. 3 and No. 40 (Royal Marine) Commandos along with the Special Raiding Squadron, operating them as a brigade. In August and September 1943 he commanded them during Operation Baytown, as the Allies commenced their invasion of Italy. In early October he led the detachment in Operation Devon, where they were employed to spearhead the assault on Termoli, on the east coast of Italy, about 120 miles north of Bari. In the end the port was captured {{largely as a result of}} Durnford-Slater's commandos. The town was taken despite intelligence failures, it was expected that they would face only administrative units of the German 1st Parachute Division, but in fact 26th Panzer Division were in the area, being rested following the fighting at Salerno; and problems during the landing, some landing craft of 40 Commando and the SRS grounding fifty yards offshore in <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water, leading to the loss of all their radios as the men waded ashore. [...] Their success meant 8th Army was able to move forward instead of fighting for the line of the Bifurno River, whose mouth was at Termoli. The capture of port closer to the front line also enabled the Allies to shorten their supply lines, and opened a road from Naples to the east coast.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} projects had a {{layer of}} streambed stones arranged as a foundation, upon which the adobes were placed. Later, stone and masonry were used for foundation courses, which greatly added to the bearing capacity of the brickwork. [...] Aside from superficial leveling, no other ground preparation was done before construction started. There is some evidence {{to indicate that the}} initial structures at some of the outposts were produced by setting wooden posts close together and filling the interstitial spaces with clay. At completion, the building would be covered with a thatched roof and wall surfaces would be coated with whitewash to keep the clay exterior from eroding. This type of construction is known as [...] "wattle and daub" [...] (jacal to the natives) and eventually gave way to the use of adobe, stone, or ladrillos. Even though many of the adobe structures were ultimately replaced with ones of piedra or brick, adobe was still employed extensively and was the principal material used in building the missions as there was an almost universal lack of readily-available stone. The adobes were laid in courses and cemented together with wet clay. Due to the low bearing strength of adobe and the lack of skilled brick masons (albañils), walls made of mud bricks had to be fairly thick. The width of a wall depended mostly on its height: low walls were commonly two feet thick, while the highest (up to thirty-five feet) required as much as <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> material to support them.|$|E

2500|$|Camel {{had been}} used to carry stores and {{supplies}} to the Cape {{for the use of the}} army under General Francis Dundas, which was fighting the Third Frontier War. On 20 September she was anchored in Algoa Bay with the 16-gun sloop [...] Both captains, Lee of Camel and Samuel Gooch of Rattlesnake, were onshore with a number of their men, supporting the army. At 4 pm a strange sail was seen approaching the bay, flying the Danish flag. The ship entered the bay and approached the British ships, where upon it was approached by a guard boat from Camel, who planned to board her. As they approached, the British sailors saw armed men aboard and realised the ship was a large frigate; they immediately returned to Camel. A British privateer schooner, the Surprise, had also passed by the strange ship, and discovered she was a French frigate. The Surprise sailed for the Rattlesnake to report this. With Lee and Gooch ashore, command devolved to First Lieutenant William Fothergill of Rattlesnake. After warning shots fired from both Camel and Rattlesnake elicited no response, both ships prepared for action. By 8.30 pm the French frigate, which was the 40-gun Preneuse under Captain Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite, had manoeuvred close to Rattlesnake. Fothergill fired a broadside at her, supported by Camel, and a general action broke out. The ships exchanged fire for over three hours, with Preneuse concentrating her fire on Camel, until having sustained a shot below the waterline and having <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water in the hold, Camels crew were forced to abandon the guns to work the pumps.|$|E
