25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The <b>skin</b> <b>depth</b> is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the <b>skin</b> <b>depth</b> of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E
25|$|Casimir's {{analysis}} of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by Lifshitz and his students. Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, {{such as the}} modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials. Lifshitz's theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir's idealized 1/a4 force law for large separations a {{much greater than the}} <b>skin</b> <b>depth</b> of the metal, and conversely reduces to the 1/a3 force law of the London dispersion force (with a coefficient called a Hamaker constant) for small a, with a more complicated dependence on a for intermediate separations determined by the dispersion of the materials.|$|E

The greater electrical resistivity of carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs), excluding metal matrix composites, results in much greater <b>skin</b> <b>depths</b> or standard depths of penetration, thereby providing for the through-thickness inspection of much thicker components than are usually associated with eddy current NDE. For example, <b>skin</b> <b>depths</b> in copper and 304 stainless steel at 10 kHz are 0. 026 inch** and 0. 168 inch, respectively.

Three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical modeling results for a bipole source 5 <b>skin</b> <b>depths</b> away compare well with those for a plane-wave source, showing that the method is valid.

[...] This technology was further developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. [...] Oil shale is heated by vertical electrode arrays. Deeper volumes could be processed at slower heating rates by installations spaced at tens of meters. The concept presumes a radio frequency at which the <b>skin</b> <b>depth</b> is many tens of meters, thereby overcoming the thermal diffusion times needed for conductive heating.

2500|$|This {{theory is}} false. [...] RF current does tend to flow {{on the surface}} of conductors, but the depth to which it penetrates, called <b>skin</b> <b>depth,</b> depends on the {{resistivity}} and permittivity of the material as well as the frequency. [...] Although skin effect limits currents of Tesla coil frequencies to the outer fraction of a millimeter in metal conductors, the <b>skin</b> <b>depth</b> of the current in body tissue is much deeper due to its higher resistivity and lower permittivity. [...] The depth of penetration of currents of Tesla frequency (0.1 - 1MHz) in human tissues is roughly 24 to 72cm (9 to 28 inches). [...] Thus skin effect has little influence on the path of the current through the body; it takes the path of lowest electrical impedance to ground, and can easily pass through the core of the body. [...] In the medical therapy called longwave diathermy, RF current of Tesla frequencies was used for decades for deep tissue warming, including heating internal organs such as the lungs. [...] Modern shortwave diathermy machines use a higher frequency of 27MHz, which would have a correspondingly smaller <b>skin</b> <b>depth,</b> yet these frequencies are still able to penetrate deep body tissues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{analytical}} {{expression for}} the voltage {{measured by a}} four-point alternat-ing current potential drop (ACPD) method on a flat metal surface is derived. Far-field expressions for the electric field in a metal plate and {{in the region of}} the probe (air) are used to obtain contributions to the ACPD voltage from the metal plate and due to inductance in the pick-up circuit. The far-field approximation is accurate for a plate whose edges are several tens of <b>skin</b> <b>depths</b> from the probe, and for a probe whose pick-up points are several <b>skin</b> <b>depths</b> away from the current drive points. Comparison of the theory with experiment on a brass plate shows excellent agreement. ...|$|R

This effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of DC. Third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels, an important factor for subway systems.|$|E

For example, at 60 Hz, a 2000 MCM (1000 square millimetre) copper conductor has 23% more resistance than it does at DC. The same size conductor in aluminum has only 10% more resistance with 60 Hz AC than it does with DC.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} long term {{evolution}} of magnetic fields generated by a collisionless relativistic e + e − shock which is initially unmagnetized. Our 2 D particle-in-cell numerical simulations show that downstream of such a Weibel-mediated shock, particle distributions are close to isotropic, relativistic Maxwellians, and the magnetic turbulence is highly intermittent spatially, with the non-propagating magnetic fields forming relatively isolated regions with transverse dimension ∼ 10 − 20 <b>skin</b> <b>depths.</b> These structures decay in amplitude, with little sign of downstream merging.
