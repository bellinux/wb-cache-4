5|$|Lakes in the {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek include the Griffin Reservoir, Maple Lake, and Summit Lake. These {{bodies of water}} are in South Abington Township and Scott Township.

The creek and the reservoir serve as a supplemental drinking water supply for more than 100,000 people as of the late 20th century. A spring known as Fountain Springs is in {{the watershed}} in South Abington Township. The Justus Meadows are in the watershed in Scott Township. Most of the watershed is developed, but there are <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> undeveloped reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Moreau had an {{opportunity}} to smash one of the enemy forces, but he moved slowly. Saint-Cyr started from Oberkirch on 2 July. The next day his wing moved in an easterly direction, seizing enemy positions at Oppenau, on the Kniebis Mountain and at Freudenstadt. This deep thrust completely separated Fröhlich {{from the rest of the}} Army of the Upper Rhine. Latour and Sztáray tried to hold a position behind the Murg River but Desaix attacked them in the Battle of Rastatt on 5 July. To assist in this operation, Moreau directed Saint-Cyr to move down the Murg valley. On the same day as Rastatt, Taponier's division captured Gernsbach. At Rastatt, the French employed 19,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to spar with 6,000 Austrians led by Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Johann Mészáros von Szoboszló. The French turned both Austrian flanks, forcing their enemies to pull back east toward Ettlingen. Casualties on both sides were light. The Austrians lost 200 men and three guns captured. At Ettlingen Latour found the archduke's leading elements, with the main body <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days distant. The Austrians were in a vulnerable situation but Moreau delayed for three days at Rastatt, allowing Charles to bring up 25 battalions and 39 squadrons.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-day}} rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with {{three games in}} five days, {{starting}} with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead {{to open up the}} game, only to give it back up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would not get any closer than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, but <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seasons away from becoming a national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.|$|E

New equipment was not built for this train; instead, older cars that were completely refurbished by Pullman and by C shops.

25|$|Although the {{majority}} of studies on bilingual sentence processing are focused on L2 processing, there are <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> studies that have investigated cross-language activation during their native language (L1) reading. For example, van Assche et al. replicated the cognate effect in L1 with Dutch-English bilinguals, and found that a non-dominant language may affect native-language sentence reading, both at earliest and at later reading stages. Titone et al. observed this cross-language activation in English-French bilinguals at early reading stages only when the L2 was acquired early in life. They also concluded that the semantic constraint provided by a sentence can attenuate cross-language activation at later reading stages.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the Right {{had shifted}} {{to support the}} newly rich in some European {{countries}} (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing, such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, there are <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> right-wing movements today, notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound and American paleoconservatives, that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.|$|E

25|$|The lack {{of chairs}} {{may also have}} been to provide more space for prostration, another ancient Jewish {{observance}} that the Jews of Yemen continued to practise until very recent times.

In the small Jewish community that exists today in Bet Harash, prostration is still done during the tachanun prayer. Jews of European origin generally prostrate only during certain portions of special prayers during Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). Prostration was a common practise amongst all Jews until some point during the late Middle Ages or Renaissance period.|$|E

A few escaped or hid, some {{with the help of}} at least two German soldiers, one named Liederman, the other Bruendl. A very small number (said to be 26 total), were permitted to stay on in the Citadel to work for the German army. On December 4, 1943, the Latvia police arrested these last Jews, leaving only three survivors who were still in hiding in the Citadel.|$|E
25|$|Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve was {{established}} in the end of 1991, a few months after Estonia regained its independence.

The proving grounds were established in 1947 and in 1953 expanded to 33 304 ha (333km2), making it the biggest Soviet military polygon in Estonia. Still, the Soviet Army damaged only about 10% of the proving grounds' territory, leaving the rest intact.
