Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets, including Russia's largest, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet. Fish breeding, especially of salmon and trout, is a growing industry.|$|E
5|$|With the French forces {{withdrawn}} from the operation by the late summer of 1953, Viet Minh Regiment 95 re-infiltrated Route One and resumed ambushes of French convoys, retrieving weapons caches missed by the French forces.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{selection}} of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers {{a great variety of}} Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød – a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found {{in all parts of the}} city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop <b>still</b> <b>operating,</b> Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Schleswig-Holstein was re-boilered and {{converted}} into a cadet training ship. One {{of the most significant}} changes visually was the trunking of the two forward funnels into a single larger smoke stack. Schlesien was made the flagship of the battleship squadron in January 1933. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the Kriegsmarine. By this time, only Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> as warships; the four Braunschweig-class ships had been disposed of or {{converted into a}}uxiliary ships.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{external}} magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. It does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization, probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was <b>still</b> <b>operating.</b> Alternatively, some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud {{in the presence of}} an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.|$|E
5|$|The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus {{factory that}} {{produces}} refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter {{from the factory}} is exported to Jordan. The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight restaurants {{in the city and}} four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions. Today, there are only two soap factories <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> in the city.|$|E

5|$|Upon commissioning, Taylor joined Destroyer Division 12 of the Atlantic Fleet. She cruised {{with that}} fleet during World War I but saw no action. Following {{the war on}} 1 April 1919, she was {{assigned}} to Destroyer Division 8. In 1920, Taylor was placed in reduced commission though <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> on the Atlantic coast. That summer, on 17 July, the Navy adopted the alpha-numeric hull designation system, and Taylor became DD-94. In October, she was placed back in full commission and, until the summer of 1922, operated with Destroyer Division 8, Flotilla 8, Squadron 3. On 21 June 1922, the ship was placed out of commission at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Farsari {{expanded}} his business interests into commercial photography and taught himself photography in 1883. In 1885 he formed {{a partnership with}} photographer Tamamura Kozaburō to acquire the Stillfried & Andersen studio (also known as the Japan Photographic Association), which had some 15 Japanese employees. The studio's stock included images by Felice Beato that it had acquired along with Beato's studio in 1877. It {{is not clear how}} long the partnership of Tamamura and Farsari lasted, for within a few years they were in competition with each other. Farsari further {{expanded his}} business in 1885 when the Yokohama Photographic Company (owned by David Welsh) folded and Farsari acquired its premises (next door to his own) and moved in. In addition to his Yokohama studio, Farsari likely had agents in Kobe and Nagasaki. By the end of 1886, Farsari and Chinese photographer Tong Cheong were the only foreign commercial photographers <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> in Japan, and by the following year even Tong Cheong had gone.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Vietnam was {{estimated}} to have about 100,000 troops in Kampuchea, but, sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach, the Vietnamese Government began withdrawing forces in earnest. Between April and July 1989, 24,000 Vietnamese soldiers returned home. Then, between 21 and 26 September 1989, after suffering 15,000 soldiers killed and another 30,000 wounded during the 10-year occupation, Vietnam’s commitment to Kampuchea was officially over, when the remaining 26,000 Vietnamese soldiers were pulled out. However, armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese-installed PRK regime claimed that Vietnamese troops were <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989. For example, non-communist groups engaging in land-grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite Vietnamese Special Forces near Tamar Puok along Route 69. Then, in March 1991, Vietnamese units {{were reported to have}} re-entered Kampot Province to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive. Despite such claims, on 23 October 1991, the Vietnamese Government signed the Paris Peace Agreement, which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, a large anti-Polish protest {{took place}} in Lazdijai, with cries to march on Sejny. The last Lithuanian attempt to retake the town was made on August 28. The Lithuanians (about 650 men) were {{defeated}} by the combined forces of the Polish Army (800 men) and PMO volunteers (500 men). On August 27, the Poles officially demanded that Lithuanians retreat behind the Foch Line. On September 1, Rudnicki announced incorporation of PMO volunteers into the 41st Infantry Regiment. During the negotiations on September 5, representatives {{of the two groups}} agreed to settle on a detailed demarcation line; Lithuanians agreed to retreat by September 7. The Polish regular army units did not cross the Foch Line, and refused to aid the PMO insurgents <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> on the Lithuanian side.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} in {{use as a}} fort through the 18th and 19th centuries {{under the command of}} successive captains, <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> in conjunction with Pendennis. A review by Colonel Christian Lilly in 1714 reported that the fortification was in a satisfactory condition, and in the 1730s, St Mawes was equipped with 17 artillery pieces, including six 24-pounder (11kg) cannons, mostly positioned in the batteries beneath the Henrician castle. Britain's wars with France in the late-18th century made the defence of Falmouth critical and from 1775 until 1780 the local militia was called up to defend St Mawes. By the 1780s, the castle was equipped with over 30 pieces of heavy artillery. There were repeated concerns emerged about its ordnance, however, and an inspection in 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars found that only one 24-pounder gun was serviceable.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} football association, the Fédération Togolaise de Football, {{was founded in}} 1960 and became affiliated with FIFA in 1964. The organisation has fifteen staff members focusing on women's football. Football is the fourth-most-popular women's sport in Togo, trailing basketball, handball and volleyball. Football's popularity is growing, however. The country had 380 registered players in 2006, up from 180 in 2000. Women's football was first organised {{in the country in}} 2000. By 2006, there were 105 football clubs in Togo, 11 of which were for women only. A national women's competition was created by 2006 and was <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> in 2009. While there are no school, university or regional competitions for women's football, there was an active under-17 women's league in 2009. In 2010, a women's football competition involving 50 women's teams was organised by the German embassy, which provided teams with football kits and footballs.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} certificates {{were granted}} on 10 April, {{and the first}} trial run was made the following day. Ordinary service started on 25 April, though without the dining car. The initial price was NOK 422, and travel time was 5 hours 45 minutes. The trains have four cars, of which three are regular open seating, and one is a dining car. From 15 June, full service was introduced. The company stated that the service {{was meant to be}} more luxurious than with SJ, including wider seating (three instead of four abreast) and a wooden interior. The company markets the service as all first-class seating. The trains also had Wi-Fi. After the full service was introduced, the price increased to NOK 593. By July, Ofotbanen had still not found a locomotive for the second train, and was <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> only a single round service. Passenger numbers were at 35 per departure, not close to the capacity of 84, or the necessary annual 100,000 needed to make a profit.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} <b>still</b> <b>operating</b> in 1937, though a public request {{had been made}} for regular {{transport}} to take children to the Hagley District School, in consequence of the Hadspen school's impending closure. Children from the town began attending the Hagley school in March 1938. By {{the middle of the}} same year a tender was approved by the Minister of Education for regular school transport. The transport was also for students from nearby Carrick., whose school closed in the 1930s. The school building was finally removed; a tender in 1944 called for it to be removed and re-erected at Falmouth. Schools have also been run in other town buildings, including a hall near the Anglican church, that was used for worship before the church's completion, in what is now the Uniting Church and also in another building that later became a private home. In the 21st century there are no schools remaining in Hadspen.|$|E
