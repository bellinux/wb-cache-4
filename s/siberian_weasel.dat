6000|$|There is no {{possibility}} of explaining the system of life in this world, on any principle of conqueringly Divine benevolence. That piece of bold impiety, if it be so, I have always asserted in my well-considered books,--I considering it, on the contrary, the only really pious thing to say, namely, {{that the world is}} under a curse, which we may, if we will, gradually remove, by doing as we are bid, and believing what we are told; and when we are told, for instance, in the best book we have about our own old history, that [...] "unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them," [...] we are to accept it as the best thing to be done under the circumstances, and to wear, if we can get them, wolf skin, or cow skin, or beaver's, or ermine's; but not therefore to confuse God with the Hudson's Bay Company, nor to hunt foxes for their brushes instead of their skins, or think the poor little black tails of a <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> on a judge's shoulders may constitute him therefore a Minos in matters of retributive justice, or an Æacus in distributive, who can at once determine how many millions a Railroad Company are to make the public pay for not granting them their exclusive business by telegraph.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} prey selection, <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> are midway between small, rodent-eating mustelids {{and the more}} {{polyphagous}} martens. They rarely eat reptiles, invertebrates and plants, preferring instead to prey on rodents of small to moderate size. Water voles are their most frequent prey in their western range, while voles and mice are eaten in their eastern range. Moderate sized rodents targeted by <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> in the east include Daurian and Alpine pikas, and Siberian zokors. In local areas, chipmunks, muskrats, red squirrels and jerboas are eaten. Fish may be eaten in some areas during certain seasons. In Ussuriland, they may scavenge extensively on the kills of wolves and yellow-throated martens during the winter. Elsewhere, small birds are an important food item. Reptiles and amphibians are typically eaten at {{the periphery of the}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel's</b> range. Plant foods known to be eaten by <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> include pine nuts and actinidia fruits. They typically eat about 100-120 gm of food daily, and cache excess food. In urban areas in China, <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> prey extensively on rats. They are capable of single-handedly killing and dragging the largest fowls. In contrast to sables, which are ambush predators, <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> are active hunters, readily chasing prey through snow, logs, water and people's houses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> have an {{extended}} rutting period which {{is subject to}} geographic variation. The rut begins in early February to late March in western Siberia. In Primorye, the rut begins in early March to late April. Six pairs of <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> in a fur sovkhoz near Moscow began rutting from 25 April to 15 May. They mate for 35 minutes, doing so repeatedly. The gestation period lasts 38-41 days. There is one record of a female giving birth after only 28 days. Litters consist of 4-10 kits.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> are overall {{useful for}} {{limiting}} rodent populations, they are nonetheless damaging to poultry and muskrat farms. They frequently enter the roosts of domesticated fowl and pigeons, sometimes killing {{more than they}} can eat.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel,</b> {{known locally}} as the [...] "yellow rat wolf," [...] {{is the most common}} weasel in China. It is found {{throughout}} China Proper and Manchuria, and known to steal poultry from farmers but helps to control the rodent population. Hair from the tail of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> is used to make ink brush for traditional Chinese calligraphy. Other weasel species include the least weasel and stoat in the north, yellow-bellied weasel and back-striped weasel in the south, and mountain weasel in the west. The steppe polecat is bigger than the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> and found across northern China.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{classified}} as a subspecies of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (M. sibirica). The two species are very similar in appearance but differ in the ratio of tail length to head and body length. There are also genetic differences which suggest that the two diverged around 1.6-1.7 million years ago. Their ranges now overlap in western Japan where the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> has been introduced.|$|E
50|$|In Chinese folklore, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> {{is viewed}} as a {{wandering}} spirit (shen) that can steal and replace people's souls.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{danger to}} the Japanese night heron is the {{deforestation}} of rural, lowland forests. Unchecked farmland development has particularly affected the heron’s breeding and feeding ranges, adversely affecting its usual nesting habits. In addition, the night heron’s nests fall within the predatory niche of the rapidly increasing crow population in the area. Since 1901, when <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> were introduced to Hokkaido, the Japanese night heron has also faced both competition and predation from <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels,</b> which are active hunters of the fish and insects that the heron preys on. As a result, the Japanese night heron has seen a dramatic decline in the wild.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> {{includes}} northern Myanmar, Laos, North Korea, Pakistan, Nepal, India, (Himalayas), Bhutan, Russia (from the Kirov Province, Tataria, and the western Urals through Siberia and the Russian Far East), Taiwan and northern Thailand. They have been introduced to Honshu, Shikoku, Kamishima and Jebu.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> have long, {{stretched}} out bodies with relatively short legs, but are more heavily built than solongois, stoats and least weasels. Their heads are elongated, narrow and relatively small, and their ears are broad at the base, but short. Their tails represent half their body length. <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> are {{much larger than}} stoats and solongois, and almost approach ferrets and minks in size. Adult males are 28-39 cm long, while females reach 25-30.5 cm. The tail in males reaches 15.5-21 cm in length, while that of females reaches 13.3-16.4 cm. Males weigh 650-820 g, while females weigh 360-430 g. Exceptionally large individuals have on rare occasions occurred in the Baraba steppe. The skull is in several respects intermediate in form between that of the stoat and the mink it is longer and larger {{than that of the}} stoat, but is somewhat more flattened than the mink's. Their winter fur is very dense, soft and fluffy, with guard hairs reaching 3-4 cm in length. The underfur is dense and loose fitting. <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> are monotone in colour, being bright reddish-ocherous or straw-red, though orange or peach tones are sometimes noticeable on the skin. These tones are especially bright on the back, while the flanks and underbelly are paler. A dark, coffee-brown mask is present on the face. Their tails are more brightly coloured than the back, and are fluffier than those of other members of the genus. The lips and chin are white or slightly ochreous. The front of the muzzle is darker than the remaining parts of the head.|$|R
50|$|Common mammals are elk (Alces alces), Siberian {{chipmunk}} (Eutamias sibiricus), linx (Felis lynx), <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (Mustela sibirica), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), {{and brown}} bear (Ursus arctos).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (Mustela sibirica) is a {{medium-sized}} weasel native to Asia, {{where it is}} widely distributed and inhabits various forest habitats and open areas. It is therefore listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|The large predators include brown bears, wolves, and wolverines. Ten {{mustelid}} species {{make the}} reserve their home, from the largest, the wolverine, to the least weasel, {{as well as}} the ermine, the American and European mink, the pine marten, the sable, and the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> are not fussy {{about their}} shelters. They may nest inside fallen logs, empty stumps, {{brushwood}} piles and exposed tree roots. They also use and enlarge the dens of other animals. The length of their burrows range from 0.6-4.2 metres and are 0.2-1.3 metres deep. The nesting chamber, {{which is located}} in the middle or end of the passage, is lined with bird feathers and rodent wool. In addition to a permanent burrow, adults have up to five temporary shelters which may be separated from each other by several kilometres.|$|R
50|$|As with plants, the {{biodiversity}} {{of animals in}} the park is high. Over 2,500 species have been recorded, {{many of which are}} endemic. The park records 220 species of terrestrial vertebrates. The ungulates are typical of the Siberian taiga: Caspian deer, Siberian roe deer and moose. The carnivores include sables, <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels,</b> and ermines. The steppe sections of the park are home to steppe polecats, long-tailed sousliks (a type of ground squirrel), meadow larks, and black kites. In hard-to-reach rocks and on the islands, there are rock doves and Siberian swifts. The largest mammal in the lake itself is the Baikal seal.|$|R
40|$|Hai-Yin Wu (1999) Is there current {{competition}} between sympatric <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> (Mustela sibirica) and ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) in a subtropical forest ecosystem of Taiwan? Zoological Studies 38 (4) : 443 - 451. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> (Mustela sibirica) and ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) sympatric in the Guandaushi Forest {{are of particular}} interest because, with low density of rodent prey most of the time, weasels in this area perhaps adapt their diets and may compete with ferret badgers. Dietary and spatial relationships between the 2 carnivores were studied by scat analysis and capture-and-recapture rates from March 1995 to August 1998. Diets of allopatric populations reported by others are referenced for comparison. As expected, by switching to arthropod prey and shrews, weasels in Guandaushi Forest consumed food items different from weasels in alpine grasslands. Ferret badgers in Guandaushi and Fushan forests consumed similar diets. The dietary overlap between the sympatric weasels and ferret badgers was substantial; however, the occurrence frequencies of vertebrates, arthropods, and earthworms in their diets differed significantly. The major groups of arthropod prey of the 2 species differed; this {{might be related to}} their foraging behaviors. Results from preliminary trapping (March to November 1995) suggested that habitat segregation exists between weasels and ferret badgers in the 3 regions (A-C) which differ in habitat types. This pattern was confirmed in the main study period. More weasels were captured in region A than in the other regions, while a reversed pattern was observed for ferret badgers...|$|R
50|$|The Red panda, Clouded leopard, <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel,</b> Asiatic black bear, barking deer, Himalayan tahr, goral, gaur and {{pangolin}} {{are some}} of the fauna found near Kalimpong. Avifauna of the region include the pheasants, cuckoos, minivets, flycatchers, bulbuls, orioles, owls, partridges, sunbirds, warblers, swallows, swifts and woodpeckers.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} as kolonok or kolinsky. In form and hunting behaviour, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> {{represents}} a transitional form between small mustelids (such as stoats and least weasels) and their larger cousins (minks and s). It is a valuable furbearer, particularly for the paint brush industry.|$|E
50|$|Although superficially {{similar to}} the European mink, studies {{indicate}} the American mink's closest relative is the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (kolonok) of Asia. The American mink has been recorded to hybridize with European minks and polecats in captivity, though the hybrid embryos of the American and European minks are usually reabsorbed.|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{examined}} {{difference in}} the abundance of mammals in post-fire silvicultural management stands within a pine forest in Samcheok, Gangwon province, South Korea, from 2008 - 2010. Researchers recorded the tracks of 12 mammal species, amur hedgehogs (Erinaceus amurensis), Japanese moles (Mogera wogura), raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels</b> (Mustela sibirica), European badgers (Meles meles), Bengal cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), wild boars (Sus scrofa), roe deer (Caproelus pygargus), water deer (Hydropotes inermis), Korean hares (Lepus coreanus), red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) and Siberian chipmunks (Tamias sibiricus). There were {{significant differences in the}} number of species and tracks linked to mammals among unburned, post-burned Japanese red pine planted and post-burned untreated stands. Of the 12 mammal species analyzed, six species were related to habitat variables in a stepwise approach with repeated measures. Long-term ecological research is needed to understand post-fire pine forest management...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} very close to the European polecat in general appearance, {{proportions}} and habits, though its body seems somewhat more elongated, due to its shorter guard hairs. The tail is short, constituting a third of its body length. The skull is heavier and more massive than that of the European polecat, having more widely spaced zygomatic arches and more strongly developed projections, particularly the sagittal crest. It greatly resembles the black-footed ferret of North America, with the only noticeable differences between them being the steppe polecat's much longer and softer fur, shorter ears, and shorter postmolar extension of the palate. It has four pairs of teats and well-developed anal glands, which can produce a sharp-smelling liquid which is sprayed in self-defence. Males measure 320-562 mm in body length, while females measure 290-520 mm. Tail length of males is 80-183 mm and 290-520 mm for females. Males in Siberia may weigh up to 2,050 grams, while females weigh 1,350 grams. One giant polecat from Semirechye had a body length of about 775 mm. Overall, specimens exhibiting gigantism are more common than in the European polecat, and occur primarily in western Siberia, where they likely hybridise with <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Elephants {{at the zoo}} {{are said}} {{to be one of the}} chief attractions; all the {{elephants}} are descended from the family of a single [...] "hero elephant" [...] given to Kim Il-sung by Ho Chi Minh in 1959. Kim Il-sung later criticised the zoo as [...] "capitalist" [...] because it kept elephants and other foreign animals, and reportedly instructed the zoo to keep only native animals. However, as of 2001, the zoo kept a variety of non-indigenous species of animals, including 400 given as gifts by heads of state and other foreign citizens. A significant number of those were the gift of a single Swedish citizen, Jonas Wahlström, director of the Skansen Aquarium; they are housed in the Animal Museum, which opened as a new exhibit in 1985. According to a report by The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, the zoo also has a parrot which can squawk [...] "Long live the Great Leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung" [...] in English. The Central Zoo conducted its first zoo exchange with South Korean zoos in April 2005, in which they received llamas and hippopotamuses, among other species of animals. Many of the animals sent south, which included Asiatic black bears, African ponies, and <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasels,</b> were first quarantined by South Korea before being shipped to their destinations.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{its great}} expense, sable fur is {{typically}} integrated into various clothes fashions: to decorate collars, sleeves, hems and hats (see, {{for example the}} shtreimel). The so-called kolinsky sable-hair brushes used for watercolour or oil painting are not manufactured from sable hair, but {{from that of the}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hair source: {{normally}} the brush {{is made from}} goat, <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (黄鼠狼 huángshǔláng, yellow-rat-wolf), pig, mouse, buffalo, wolf, or rabbit hair, while exotic ones {{can be made from}} tiger, fowl, deer, and even human hair (from a baby's first haircut, said to bring good fortune while taking the imperial examinations).|$|E
50|$|Hair {{from animals}} such as horses is also an animal fiber. Horsehair is used for brushes, the bows of musical {{instruments}} and many other things. The best artists brushes are made from <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel,</b> many other fibers are used including ox hair and hog bristle. Camel-hair brushes are usually made from squirrel, cheaper ones from pony, but never camels. Chiengora is dog hair.|$|E
50|$|Kamchatka {{is famous}} for the {{abundance}} and size of its brown bears. In the Kronotsky Nature Reserve there {{are estimated to be}} three to four bears per 100 square kilometres. Other fauna of note include carnivores such as tundra wolf (Canis lupus albus), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) Anadyr fox (Vulpes vulpes beringiana), East Siberian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli), wolverine (Gulo gulo), sable (Martes zibellina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), East Siberian stoat (Mustela ermine kaneii) and <b>Siberian</b> least <b>weasel</b> (Mustela nivalis pygmaea). The peninsula hosts habitat for several large ungulates including the Kamchatka snow sheep, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and Chukotka moose (Alces alces burulini) one of the largest moose {{in the world and the}} largest in Eurasia; and rodents/leporids, including mountain hare (Lepus timidus), marmot, and several species of lemming and squirrel.The peninsula is the breeding ground for Steller's sea eagle, one of the largest eagle species, along with the golden eagle and gyr falcon.|$|R
50|$|Oriental reed warblers {{have small}} {{breeding}} territories and can achieve high population densities. The nest is built 1-1.5 metres {{above the ground}} among reed stems. Two to six eggs are laid and are incubated for 12 to 14 days. The young birds fledge after 10 to 15 days. Major predators at the nest include the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> and snakes of the genus Elaphe.|$|E
5000|$|Siberian weasels are {{valuable}} furbearers, being significantly harvested in Siberia and the Far East. Their fur is used both {{in its natural}} state and for imitating the fur of more valuable species. A couple of alternative names for the fur were Tartar sable and fire marten. [...] <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> fur makes the finest water colour or oil paint brushes and is especially sought after by artists. The so-called kolinsky sable-hair brush is produced using the winter fur of the male <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel,</b> not sable. In China, their orange fur is largely used to create ink brush for calligraphers. The name of the brush is thus 狼毫筆, lit. 'wolf hairs brush', as a reduction from 黃鼠狼 + 毫 + 筆, lit. [...] "yellow rat wolf" [...] "hairs" [...] "brush". Their hairs are appreciated because they are harder than goat hair (羊毫). They are hunted by shooting with dogs or {{through the use of}} box traps. They are extremely aggressive when caught in traps, emitting piercing shrieks and letting loose a pungent secretion which reportedly takes a month to wash away.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} in colour to the American mink, but is {{slightly}} smaller and has a less specialised skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the European mink is not {{closely related to the}} American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (kolonok). The European mink occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese {{night heron}} prefers dense, damp forest, in both its {{breeding}} and winter ranges. Common until the 1970s, this species {{is threatened by}} deforestation in its summer and winter ranges for timber and farmland. Other documented threats include {{the introduction of the}} <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> (Mustela sibirica) in its breeding range and nest predation by crows, due to the increasing crow populations. The current population is estimated at less than 1,000 mature individuals. Accordingly, the Japanese night heron is marked as a protected species in Japan and Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|The European mink is {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the genus Mustela, having a greatly elongated body with short limbs. However, compared to its close relative, the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel,</b> the mink is more compact and less thinly built, thus approaching ferrets and European polecats in build. The European mink has a large, broad head with short ears. The limbs are short, with relatively well-developed membranes between the digits, particularly on the hind feet. The mink's tail is short, and does not exceed half the animal's body length (constituting about 40% of its length). The European mink's skull is less elongated than the kolonok's, with more widely spaced zygomatic arches and has a less massive facial region. In general characteristics, the skull is intermediate in shape between that of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel</b> and the European polecat. Overall, the skull is less specialised for carnivory than that of polecats and the American mink. Males measure 373 - 430 mm in body length, while females measure 352 - 400 mm. Tail length is 153 - 190 mm in males and 150 - 180 mm. Overall weight is 550 - 800 g. It is a fast and agile animal, which swims and dives skilfully. It is able to run along stream beds, and stay underwater for one to two minutes. When swimming, it paddles with both its front and back limbs simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Fossil finds of the European mink {{are very}} rare, thus {{indicating}} {{the species is}} either a relative newcomer to Europe, probably having originated in North America, or a recent speciation caused by hybridization. It likely first arose in the Middle Pleistocene, with several fossils in Europe dated to the Late Pleistocene being found in caves and some suggesting early exploitation by humans. Genetic analyses indicate, rather than being {{closely related to the}} American mink, the European mink's closest relative is the European polecat (perhaps due to past hybridization) and the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel,</b> being intermediate in form between true polecats {{and other members of the}} genus. The closeness between the mink and polecat is emphasized because the species can hybridize.|$|E
5000|$|A brush is most {{commonly}} {{employed by the}} artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made {{from a variety of}} fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and mongoose hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red sable brushes (weasel hair). The finest quality brushes are called [...] "kolinsky sable"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>weasel.</b> This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's [...] "snap." [...] Floppy fibers with no snap, such as squirrel hair, are generally not used by oil painters.|$|E
