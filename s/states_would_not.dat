5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the <b>states</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accept.|$|E
5|$|The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States as {{a result}} of the latter's victory in the Spanish–American War. A {{compensation}} of US$20million was paid to Spain according to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. As it became increasingly clear the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> recognize the nascent First Philippine Republic, the Philippine–American War broke out, the First Republic was defeated, and the archipelago was administered under an Insular Government. The war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians, mostly from a cholera epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The rare amity {{established}} {{between the two}} <b>states</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> last; the death of Mehmed I {{and the rise of}} Murad II in 1421 coupled with the ascent of John VIII to the Byzantine throne led to a deteriorated change in relations between the two. Neither leader was content with the status quo. John VIII made the first and foolish move by inciting a rebellion in the Ottoman Empire: a certain Mustafa had been released by the Byzantines and claimed that he was Bayezid's lost son.|$|E

5|$|Though Khrushchev's {{strategy}} {{failed to}} achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal {{of the western world}} to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June 1991, as Slovenia and Croatia {{prepared}} to declare their independence during {{the breakup of}} Yugoslavia, the European Community (EC) foreign ministers decided the EC member <b>states</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> extend diplomatic recognition to the two states. The EC viewed the declarations as unilateral moves and offered assistance in negotiations regarding {{the future of the}} SFR Yugoslavia instead. At the same time, the EC decided to suspend direct talks with Slovenia and Croatia. The move was welcomed by the Yugoslav federal government. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on 25 June, and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units began to deploy from its bases in Slovenia the next day. On 27 June, armed conflict broke out as the JNA and the Territorial Defence Force of Slovenia (TDS) began fighting over control of Slovenia's border posts, in what became the Ten-Day War.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that <b>states</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{original}} agreement, the USAF paid {{the cost of}} maintenance for the missiles for five years. After this costs would fall on the United Kingdom, which {{would have to take}} over their logistic support. With ICBMs becoming available, the Americans did not foresee the Thor missiles making a substantial contribution to the western nuclear deterrent after 1965. On 1 May 1962, the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, informed the Minister of Defence, Harold Watkinson, that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> provide support for Thor after 31 October 1964. Watkinson then informed him that the system would be phased out. An Air Council meeting on 31 May 1962 decided that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. A public announcement was made on 1 August 1962. McNamara's decision on 7 November 1962 to cancel Skybolt—approved by President John F. Kennedy on 23 November—left the RAF without a successor to Thor. The British government negotiated the Nassau Agreement to buy Polaris. The future of the British nuclear deterrent now lay with the Royal Navy. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963.|$|E
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E

25|$|Kansas has {{a history}} of many firsts in {{legislative}} initiatives—it was the first state to institute a system of workers' compensation (1910) and to regulate the securities industry (1911). Kansas also permitted women's suffrage in 1912, almost a decade before the federal constitution was amended to require it. Suffrage in all <b>states</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be guaranteed until ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.|$|E

25|$|Filipinos {{initially}} {{saw their}} relationship with the United States as that of two nations joined in a common struggle against Spain. However, the United States later distanced itself from the interests of the Filipino insurgents. Emilio Aguinaldo was unhappy that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> commit to paper a statement of support for Philippine independence. Relations deteriorated and tensions heightened as {{it became clear that the}} Americans were in the islands to stay.|$|E
25|$|McKinley's {{election}} {{victory in}} 1900 was demoralizing for the insurgents, and convinced many Filipinos that the United <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> depart precipitously. This, {{coupled with a}} series of devastating losses on the battlefield against American forces equipped with superior technology and training, convinced Aguinaldo that he needed to change his approach. Beginning on September 14, 1899, Aguinaldo accepted the advice of General Gregorio del Pilar and authorized the use of guerilla warfare tactics in subsequent military operations in Bulacan.|$|E
