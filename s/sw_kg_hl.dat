40|$|Sustainable {{production}} of pork requires farms that are economically viable, ecologically sound and socially acceptable, both {{now and in}} the future. Promising mitigation options to improve the integrated sustainability of a pig farm can be deduced from variation in their economic, environmental and societal performance. This study explores the variation in sustainability performance among 27 specialized fattening pig farms in the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network. Moreover, the combined sustainability performance is quantified, in order to identify the characteristics of best performing farms. To quantify the economic performance we used the net farm income (NFI) and labor productivity. With a life cycle assessment (LCA) the environmental performance was quantified for land occupation (LO), non-renewable energy use (NREU), global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP) and acidification potential (AP). To quantify the societal performance the usage of antibiotics and the pig mortality rate were used. The average NFI was -€ 3. 1 per 100 <b>kg</b> slaughtered weight (<b>SW),</b> produced with a labor productivity of 0. 4 h per 100 <b>kg</b> <b>SW.</b> To produce 100 <b>kg</b> of <b>SW,</b> a total LO and NREU were needed of respectively 1121 m 2 and 2802 MJ. GWP was 546 kg CO 2 -eq per 100 <b>kg</b> <b>SW,</b> of which 31 % CO 2, 7 % from CH 4, and 62 % from N 2 O. Total EP was 61. 4 kg NO 3 [...] eq/ 100 <b>kg</b> <b>SW,</b> of which 53 % from leaching of nitrate and 23 % from phosphate. Total AP was 5. 3 kg SO 2 -eq per 100 <b>kg</b> <b>SW,</b> of which 79 % NH 3, 11 % from NOx and 10 % from SO 2. The use of antibiotics per 100 <b>kg</b> <b>SW</b> averaged 18. 9 daily dosages per animal year. The number of deceased pigs per 100 <b>kg</b> <b>SW</b> averaged 0. 03. There is a high variation in economic, environmental and societal performance among fattening pig farms. Farm characteristics related to scale positively affect economic and environmental performance. A low feed intake and a feeding ration with a high share of wet by-products positively affect the environmental performance. To identify explanatory farm characteristics from FADN for societal performance, more suitable indicators are needed. Best performing farms, which outperform on economic, environmental and societal performance do exist and are on average larger and are feeding a higher proportion of by-products. To understand the characteristics of an integrative sustainable fattening pig farm, more insight is needed in the entrepreneurial characteristics and the drivers to manage and perform in a more profitable, environmental friendly and societally acceptable way...|$|R

However, co-production of high-value products {{may be able to}} justify the cost of large-scale algae cultivation. The basic goal {{of this study is to}} develop a techno-economic analysis (TEA) and Life-cycle assessment (LCA) for the production of glucosamine, a high value product, and lipid from the diatom Cyclotella. This analysis considers two algal growth pathways, e. g. raceway open pond (RWP) and photobioreactor (PBR) cultivation. It demonstrated that large-scale PBR costs are much more than open pond systems for the production of glucosamine and lipid from diatoms. The selling price of glucosamine is highly sensitive to Cyclotella productivity and chitin content. In order to generate 1 kg of glucosamine, 9700 <b>kg</b> (RWP <b>HL)</b> / 1050 <b>kg</b> (PBR <b>HL)</b> freshwater, 40 <b>kg</b> CO 2, 0. 70 kg nitrogen, 0. 18 kg phosphorus, and 1. 2 kg silicon nutrients are required for algae cultivation with water recovery. With a price of 1. 50 for lipid as coproduct, the projected selling price of glucosamine is 35 /kg, 106 /kg and 82 /kg for RWP, PBR high lipid cultivation conditions, and PBR high chitin cultivation condition systems, respectively. Currently, these prices are not competitive with industrial shellfish-derived glucosamine, but can be reduced by technology improvements such as producing food grade lipid, increasing algal productivity or chitin content. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) was used to investigate the resource consumption and environmental impacts of production of glucosamine and lipid co-product from the marine diatom Cyclotella sp. A well-to-product (WTP) LCA was performed that included algae cultivation, algae harvesting, glucosamine production, and lipid extraction. With 95...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) mineral undersaturations on the Bering Sea shelf have prompted {{new interest in}} the physical and biological factors that control the inorganic carbon system in the region. Understanding of the dynamics that influence the spatio-temporal variability of total alkalinity (TA) – one major component of the seawater carbonate system – has been constrained by limited historical data collected across the shelf, and the consensus has been that TA is largely conservative. However, the recently documented undersaturated conditions {{have the potential to}} cause substantial non-conservative variability in TA in this region through the dissolution of carbonate minerals. In order to quantify the contribution of carbonate mineral precipitation and dissolution to variability in TA on the southeastern Bering Sea shelf, we examined seasonal {{observations of}} TA that were made between 2008 and 2010 as part of the BEST-BSIERP Bering Sea Project. Conservative influences accounted for most of the variability in TA concentrations, with well-constrained mixing dominating in spring and summer of 2008. Bering Shelf Water (BSW) contained a constant ratio of TA to salinity, while river discharge (RW) added TA relative to salinity at a predictable rate. Although substantial organic carbon production and denitrification can cause some non-conservative variation in TA concentrations (a maximum of ~ 15 ?mol <b>kg</b> <b>SW?</b> 1 combined), carbonate mineral dissolution and precipitation were shown {{to be the most important}} processes responsible for non-conservative TA–salinity relationships. CaCO 3 uptake by the dominant pelagic phytoplankton calcifier (i. e., coccolithophores) was shown to alter TA concentrations by as much as 59 ?mol <b>kg</b> <b>SW?</b> 1. Evidence for shallow-water CaCO 3 mineral dissolution was also observed, which caused TA concentrations to increase by as much as 36 ?mol <b>kg</b> <b>SW?</b> 1. Therefore, contrary to our previous understanding, the non-conservative physico-biogeochemical factors observed in this study play an important role in controlling the ocean carbon cycle of the Bering Sea shelf...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} estimated economic values on genetic improvement was also assessed using different selection indices. The six production systems were described according to their sale age, levels of input and final goal, namely, short-fed medium input beef (SMB); long-fed medium input beef (LMB); short-fed high input beef (SHB); long-fed high input beef (LHB); long-fed low input dual purpose (LLD); and long-fed medium input dual purpose (LMD). Two evaluation bases were considered: fixed herd size and fixed pasture input. In the fixed herd-size situation, the economic values for production (except MY in beef systems) and functional traits (except FI in all systems) were positive meaning a unit increase in genetic merit of these traits had greater influence on revenues than costs. As expected, the economic value for MY was negative in the pure beef systems (SMB, LMB, SHB and LHB) and positive in the dual-purpose systems (LLD and LMD). When compared with the economic values estimated in the fixed herd-size situation, in the fixed pasture input situation they were lower for feed intake in the three classes of livestock and other traits related to it in all systems. These traits were CoSR, CoWR, PSR, CoWT, SWh and MY. The economic values for CoWT in LLD and LMD were negative (KSh − 11. 14 and − 15. 33 respectively). The economic values did not influence much {{the direction of the}} genetic response in each trait in the different production systems. However, the magnitude of the actual gain was dependent on the index applied. The magnitude of the economic values for production and functional traits estimated in this study suggest that genetic improvement of these traits will {{have a positive effect on}} profitability of Boran cows kept in dual-purpose systems and when herd size is restricted. In beef systems, genetic improvement of MY will have a negative effect on profitability, especially when restrictions on herd size and feed exists...|$|R

In addition, TNF-resistant monocytic cell lines could be sensitized to TNF cytotoxicity by DMSO treatment. Other highly polar molecules, known to be potent differentiation inducers, showed similar effects to those of DMSO. The potentiating effect of DMSO was related neither to an up-regulation of TNF receptor expression nor to an alteration {{in the rate of}} TNF internalization and degradation. We present evidence that the TNF activities are p 55 TNF receptor-mediated and are not due to insertion of TNF into lipid bilayers, an effect that could be susceptible to DMSO, as this component has been described to modify cell membrane characteristics. DMSO-induced potentiation of TNF cytostasis/cytotoxicity was restricted to myeloid leukemia cell lines. In non-myeloid cells such as fibrosarcomas, myosarcomas, thymomas, or carcinomas, DMSO was found either not to alter or to inhibit TNF-induced cell death. The latter results are in good agreement with data reported by others who suggested that DMSO could act as a scavenger of TNF-induced toxic radical formation.

Analyses of variance were performed using the procedures of SAS (1988) to determine differences between CC, family code nested within calf code (FC(CC)), SEX, birth year (BY), and birth season (BS). The analysis of variance indicated that calf code was a significant effect for GG (P <. 0001), FG (P < 1. 0001), and SW (P <. 0001). Family code nested within calf code was significant for all traits and SEX was significant for all traits excluding FG. Birth year and birth season were significant effects for WW, GG, FG, and SW.

DESIGN: Prospective randomized open label study. SETTING: The first 12 h post-CABG surgery in an {{intensive care unit}} (ICU). PATIENTS: There were 230 patients enrolled in the study: 208 were analyzed, with 109 from the HL group and 99 from the RL group. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received over the first 12 h post-CABG 10 ml <b>kg</b> BW(- 1) <b>HL</b> solution in the HL group versus 30 ml kg BW(- 1) of RL solution in the RL group. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hemodynamic status, body fluid balance and inotrope utilization were compared in the two groups. Post-operative cardiac index increase was significantly higher in HL than in RL (P = 0. 02), while mean arterial pressure and other hemodynamic parameters were comparable together with urinary output, indicating similar tissue perfusion in both the groups despite a much lower fluid infusion in the HL group. Therefore, a significant negative fluid balance was achieved in the HL {{but not in the}} RL group (- 790 +/- 71 vs. + 43 +/- 115 mL 12 h(- 1), P < 0. 0001 for HL and RL, respectively).

Results Transduction of CML (BV 173, EM 3, K 562 and Lama 84) and AML (<b>HL</b> 60 and <b>KG</b> 1 a) cell lines with the capsid mutants resulted in an up to 36 -fold increase in CML transduction efficiency (K 562 : 2 -fold, 60 % ± 2 % green fluorescent protein (GFP) + cells; BV 173 : 9 -fold, 37 % ± 2 % GFP + cells; Lama 84 : 36 -fold, 29 % ± 2 % GFP + cells) compared to controls. For AML (<b>KG</b> 1 a, <b>HL</b> 60) and one CML cell line (EM 3), no significant transduction (+ cells) was observed for any vector. Although the capsid mutant clone was established on a cell line, proof-of-principle experiments using primary human cells were performed.

Wang In {{the process of}} screening for plants containing alkaloids potentially inhibiting human erythrocytic AChE and human BuChE, Corydalis yanhusuo was studied. 10. 8 kg of dried tuber was percolated with 120 liters of 95 % ethanol. From the primary extract, extracts with individual types of alkaloids were prepared. In this diploma thesis only one extract was processed (extract type A-ether, pH 9. 7). Alkaloids from this extract were separated into bases which chlorides were either soluble or insoluble in chloroform. From each of the above mentioned fractions phenolic and non- phenolic alkaloids were obtained. Alkaloids were separated from extract of non-phenolic chlorides soluble in chloroform. From this mixture (+) -corydaline (labeled GC- 1) was isolated {{by the use of}} column chromatography on alumina and preparative TLC on silica gel.

40|$|International audienceWe {{analysed}} {{nitrogen oxides}} (N 2 O, NO and NO 2) {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emissions from two beech forest soils close to Vienna, Austria, which were exposed to different nitrogen input from the atmosphere. The site Schottenwald (SW) received 22. 6 kg N y - 1 and Klausenleopoldsdorf (KL) 13. 5 kg N y - 1 through wet and dry deposition. Nitrogen oxide emissions from soil were measured hourly with an automatic dynamic chamber system. Daily N 2 O measurements were carried out by an automatic gas sampling system. Measurements of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and CO 2 emissions were conducted over larger areas on a biweekly (SW) or monthly (KL) basis by manually operated chambers. We used an autoregression procedure (time-series analysis) for establishing time-lagged relationships between N-oxide emissions and different climate, soil chemistry and N-deposition data. It was found that changes in soil moisture and soil temperature significantly effected CO 2 and N-oxide emissions with a time lag of up to two weeks and could explain up to 95 % of the temporal variations of gas emissions. Event emissions after rain or during freezing and thawing cycles contributed significantly (for NO 50 %) to overall N-oxides emissions. In the two-year period of analysis the annual gaseous N 2 O losses at SW ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 77 kg N ha - 1 y - 1 and NO losses were 0. 18 to 0. 67 kg N ha - 1 per vegetation period. In KL significantly lower annual N 2 O emissions (0. 52 kg N 2 O-N kg ha - 1 y - 1) as well as considerably lower NO-losses were observed. During a three-month measurement campaign NO losses at KL were 0. 02 kg, whereas {{in the same time}} period significantly more NO was emitted in <b>SW</b> (0. 32 <b>kg</b> NO-N ha - 1). Higher N-oxide emissions, especially NO emissions from the high N-input site (SW) indicate that atmospheric deposition had a strong impact on losses of gaseous N from our forest soils.

Reducing {{concentrate}} supplementation in {{dairy cow}} diets while monitoring milk production with pea-wheat intercrops. ? Journal of Dairy Science, 87, (10), 3398 - 3406 Sponsorship: Florida Agricultural Experiment StationIn {{the first of}} 2 experiments, 40 dairy cows were {{used to evaluate the}} milk production potential and concentrate-sparing effect of feeding dairy cows a basal diet of pea-wheat intercrop silages instead of perennial rye-grass silage (GS). Dairy cows were offered GS or 2 intercrop silages prepared from wheat and either Magnus peas (MW, a tall-straw variety) or Setchey peas (SW, a short-straw variety) ad libitum. The respective intercrops were supplemented with 4 kg/d of a dairy concentrate (CP = 240 g/kg dry matter; MW 4 and SW 4), and the GS were supplemented with 4 (GS 4) or 8 (GS 8) kg/d of the same concentrate. The second experiment measured the forage DM intake, digestibility, rumen function, and microbial protein synthesis from the forages by offering them alone to 3, nonlactating cows (3 x 3 Latin square design with 21 -d periods). Forage dry matter intake was greater in cows fed the intercrop silages than those fed GS. Milk production was greater in cows fed SW 4 than those fed GS 4 or MW 4, but similar to cows fed GS 8. Dietary treatment did not affect milk fat, protein, or lactose concentrations. The intercrops had greater N retention, and were more digestible than the GS, and these factors probably contributed to the greater forage DM intakes and greater milk production from the intercrop silages compared with the GS. Rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations were similar across forages, but urinary purine derivative excretion was greater in the cows fed the intercrop silages than the GS, suggesting that rumen microbial protein synthesis was enhanced by feeding the intercrops. In conclusion, similar milk yield and milk composition can be obtained by feeding <b>SW</b> and 4 <b>kg</b> of concentrates as that obtained with GS and 8 kg of concentrates. Feeding intercrop silages instead of GS with the same amount of concentrates increased forage intakes, N retention, and microbial protein synthesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Leaf blight {{of maize}} (Zea mays L.) caused by Bipolaris maydis (Nisik. And Miyake) {{is one of}} the major factors {{limiting}} maize production in the plain areas of Pakistan. Particularly in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). The objectives of this study were to estimate heritability, selection differential, expected and observed response to selection for amydis leaf blight resistance grain yield maturity and plant and ear height and to determine progress from selection in two maize populations. Two cycles of S 1 recurrent selection were conducted in broad based maize populations. Sarhad White (SW) and Azam. One hundred S 1 lines of each population were compared with their respective original populations as checks. The experimental material was evaluated under artificial epiphytotics during 2003 and 2004 at NWFP Agriculture University Peshawar. Selection differentials, expected responses and heritability estimates were determined from the replicated S 1 lines of the second cycle that were generated after random mating of selected S 1 lines of the first cycle. Significant variations between the cycles were observed for all the traits except maturity. High heritability estimates. Desirable selection differentials and close correspondence of expected and observed response were manifested fro all the characters. Days to tasseling silking and pollen shedding decreased non-significantly in SW (3. 01, 4. 07 and 3. 66 % cycle- 1) but approximately 1 % cycle- 1 increase was observed of maturity traits in Azam. Ear height and plant height were significantly increased in SW (20. 97 and 17. 52 % cycle- 1) while significantly decreased in Azam population by 6. 87 and 3. 23 % cycle- 1, respectively. Blight disease was significantly reduced from 2. 9 to 2. 3 in SW and from 3. 1 to 2. 5 in Azam population. One the other hand grain yield was significantly increased in <b>SW</b> from 2041 <b>kg</b> ha- 1 cycle- 1 to 2528 kg ha- 1 cycle- 1 or 19. 24 % cycle whereas from 2346 kg ha- 1 cycle to 2772 kg ha- 1 cyucle- 1 or 15. 34 % cycle- 1 respectively. These findings suggested that S 1 recurrent selections is effective in improving disease resistance and grain yield. However some additional cycles of selection may be necessary to further improved grain yield and resistance level to maydis leaf blight in these two maize populations...|$|R
40|$|Two {{lines of}} Holstein Friesian cows which differ genetically for live weight, the Light Line (LL) and the Heavy Line (HL), have been {{selected}} at the Dairy Cattle Research Unit (Massey University) since 1989. The aim of the current experiment was to compare the productive and reproductive performance of these two lines during early lactation. Measurements of milk production, liveweight (LW), and pasture intake were made in 1996, while reproductive data were analysed for 1992 to 1997. In experiment 1 a, the milk production of the two lines was compared during the first 12 weeks of the lactation by the weekly measurement of the milk yield and the milk composition of 30 LL cows (average LW= 412 <b>kg)</b> and 27 <b>HL</b> cows (average LW= 445 kg), with {{the two groups of}} cows fed and managed identically. Pasture dry matter intake (DMI), calculated as pasture disappearance, was 13 to 15 kg DM a day during these 12 weeks. Although the HL produced slightly more milksolids (MS) than the LL, the difference was not significant (LL= 139 vs HL= 141 kg MS). However, the HL cows > 2 year old produced 7 kg MS more than the LL cows > 2 year old (P 2 year old, the HL cows > 2 year old tended to calve and to conceive later in the calving and mating periods, respectively, because the HL cows had a lower conception rate at first service than the LL cows (LL= 70 % vs HL= 58 %, P< 0. 05). The ovaries of 10 cows from each line (LL= 405 vs kg HL= 481 kg) were scanned daily during a complete cycle before the start of mating. Cows from the HL had preovulatory follicles with larger diameter (LL= 12. 7 vs HL= 15. 7 mm, P< 0. 05) and corpus lutea with larger areas (LL= 690 vs HL= 859 mm 2, P< 0. 05) than the LL cows. No differences were detected in the diameter of the first and second dominant follicles. On average, the preovulatory follicles of the HL cows achieved their maximum diameter later in the cycle compared to the LL (LL= day 18 th vs HL= day 20 th). The results from the current experiment show that although the HL produced slightly more MS than the LL in the longer period, the two lines of cows achieved similar levels of MS yield during early lactation independently of their LW and size. Similarly, although the LL cows had a slightly higher MS conversion efficiency than the HL cows, the differences in energy and MS conversion efficiency between the two lines were not significant. The reproductive data analysed from 1992 to 1997 suggest that the LL cows achieved a better reproductive performance than the HL cows because of their higher conception rate at first service. However, more information is required from other stages of the lactation before any definite conclusion is reached about the feed conversion efficiency of the two lines. Similarly, considering the variation in the reproductive performance of the HL between the years, reproductive data from subsequent seasons must be collected in order to verify, or disprove, the current conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Foram avaliadas as características quantitativas da carcaça de novilhos Red Angus com idade média inicial de 8 meses e 189 kg, confinados durante 114, 144, 173 e 213 dias até os respectivos pesos de abate (PA) de 340, 370, 400 ou 430 kg, com idade de 12, 13, 14 e 15 meses. A dieta alimentar continha uma relação volumoso:concentrado de 56 : 44, contendo 13, 13 % de proteína bruta e 2, 7 Mcal de energia digestível/kg MS. O corte serrote, embora tenha aumentado linearmente em peso (91, 73; 103, 26; 106, 20 e 116, 66 kg) frente ao aumento do peso de abate, decresceu linearmente quando expresso em relação ao peso de carcaça fria (50, 55; 50, 79; 50, 16; e 48, 86 %). A porcentagem do corte costilhar foi a que sofreu maior incremento (23, 36; 25, 40; 28, 50; e 35 %) com o aumento do peso de abate, acompanhando o aumento na deposição de gordura de cobertura (3, 91; 6, 16; 6, 16; e 9, 58 mm). A área do músculo Longissimus dorsi (ALD) aumentou linearmente frente ao aumento do peso de abate (ALD = 27, 48 + 0, 083 PA), enquanto a ALD/ 100 kg de carcaça fria decresceu linearmente (ALD/ 100 kg carcaça = 45, 14 - 0, 0425 PA). Foi estimado, por intermédio da equação de regressão, que a espessura de gordura mínima exigida pelos frigoríficos (3 mm) teria sido alcançada com 327 kg de peso. Considerando o peso de carcaça mínimo de 180 kg, este seria atingido com um peso de abate de 337 kg. Utilizando novilhos da raça Red Angus para produção do superprecoce, o peso de abate não deve ser {{superior}} a 400 kg, para não exceder os 6 mm de gordura de cobertura, evitando o recorte do excesso. The carcass quantitative {{characteristics of}} feedlot finished Red Angus steers, with initial age of eight months and 189 kg, slaughtered with 340, 370, 400 or 430 <b>kg</b> (<b>SW),</b> were evaluated. The {{number of days}} to reach the respective weight was 114, 144, 173 and 213 days. The diet contained 13. 13 % crude protein, 2. 7 Mcal digestible energy/kg DM and a roughage:concentrate ratio of 56 : 44. Carcass dressing percentage and conformation were not affected by the slaughter weight. The saw cut weight although increasing linearly in weight (91. 73; 103. 26; 106. 20 and 116. 66 kg) as the slaughter weight increased, declined linearly when expressed in relation to cold carcass weight. Side cut percentage showed the highest increase (23. 36; 25. 40; 28. 50 and 35 %) as the slaughter weight increased, following the increase of subcutaneous fat thickness (3. 91; 6. 16; 6. 16 and 9. 58 mm). The Longissimus dorsi muscle (LMA) increased linearly as the slaughter weight increased (LMA = 27. 48 + 0. 083 SW) while the LMA/ 100 kg of cold carcass weight declined linearly (LMA/ 100 kg carc. = 45. 14 - 0. 0425 SW). According to the regression equation the minimum subcutaneous fat thickness required by the slaughter weights (3 mm) would be reached at 327 kg of live weight. Considering the minimum carcass weight of 180 kg, it would be reached with the slaughter weight of 337 kg. Using Red Angus breed to produce steers to be slaughtered at young age the slaughter weight should not surpass 400 kg, in order to not exceed the 6 mm of subcutaneous fat thickness, to avoid the carcass trimming for fat excess...|$|R

As pesagens foram {{realizadas}} em intervalos de 28 dias, após jejum de 16 horas, e os animais foram abatidos com 13 a 15 meses. Utilizou-se o programa computacional MINITAB para as análises estatísticas. Avaliou-se a influência do genótipo (G), da condição sexual (CSx) e a interação G x CSx sobre características produtivas e de carcaça. G influenciou peso final (PF) e peso de carcaça quente (PCQ). O genótipo SN apresentou maior PF médio (389, 3 kg) e o genótipo AN o menor (343, 1 kg). CSx influenciou PF, PCQ e grau de acabamento (GA). I e CS foram mais pesados ao final (373, 8 kg e 375, 2, respectivamente) que os C (341, 2 kg). O menor peso médio de PCQ foi observado nos animais C (180, 6 kg), que diferiu daquele dos animais I (197, 0 kg) e dos CS (201, 3 kg). Animais CS apresentaram maior grau de acabamento (2, 17) que as outras CSx. A CSx mostrou tendência de influência sobre a área de olho do lombo -AOL nos animais CS, com a maior média (65, 21 cm²), contra 62, 85 cm², para animais I, e 58, 30 cm², para animais C. Houve interação G x CSx para ganho médio diário GMD e rendimento de carcaça REND. Quando corrigido para covariável peso inicial, registrou-se interação no PF e, quando corrigido para PF, interação no PCQ. Animais com gene de raça continental foram mais pesados ao final do experimento. A castração aos seis meses de idade prejudicou o desempenho de bovinos confinados e abatidos aos 15 meses.

The effects of genotype (G), SC and G x SC on performance and carcass characteristics, were evaluated. Slaughter (SW) and hot carcass weight (HCW) were affected by G. The SN presented the highest <b>SW</b> (389. 3 <b>kg)</b> and AN the lowest (343. 1 <b>kg).</b> SC affected <b>SW,</b> HCW and finishing degree (FD). I and CS males were heavier at slaughter (373. 8 and 375. 2 kg, respectively) than C (341, 2 kg). The lowest HCW was observed for C steers (180, 6 kg), differing (P<. 02) from I (197 kg) and CS (201, 3 kg). CS steers showed better FD (2, 17 points) than the other SC. The SC showed tendency (P<. 07) to influence ribeye area, with CS steers showing larger area (65. 2 cm²). The G x SC interaction was significant for average daily gain and carcass dressing percentage. When adjusted for initial weight, the interaction was significant for SW, and when adjusted for SW the interaction was significant for HCW. The Simmental crosses were heavier at slaughter.
