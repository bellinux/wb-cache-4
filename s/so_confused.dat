5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus had become <b>so</b> <b>confused</b> {{as to its}} meaning (was it the genus or the family?) {{that it should not}} be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical {{congress}} rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|Rainier's main {{priorities}} {{remained the}} protection of trade, but his command came under increasing interference from London, in particular the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas. Dundas was insistent throughout 1799 and 1800 that the priority for Rainier should be the invasion and capture of Java, thus eliminating the Dutch East Indies entirely. Contradictory orders came from Lord Mornington, who was instructing Rainier to plan an invasion of Île de France, while Rainier himself wished to resurrect the abandoned operation against Manila. <b>So</b> <b>confused</b> was the command structure that in September 1800 Rainier threatened to resign, but in October 1800 a renewed threat from Egypt redirected the focus of his squadron to the Red Sea and {{only a handful of}} minor operations against Dutch posts on Java were carried out by a small force under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball, capturing a few merchant ships but losing more than 200 men to disease in the process. At the Cape of Good Hope, a gale on 5 December 1799 caused severe damage to shipping in Table Bay: among the wrecks were HMS Sceptre with 290 crew, the Danish ship of the line Oldenburg and several large American merchant ships.|$|E

25|$|In this work, Dennett's {{interest}} {{in the ability of}} evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since {{become an integral part of}} his program. He defends a theory known by some as Neural Darwinism. He also presents an argument against qualia; he argues that the concept is <b>so</b> <b>confused</b> that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of physicalism. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.|$|E
25|$|During {{planning}} for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. The decision left Burgoyne precariously isolated, and left the Americans confounded at the decision. Alden argues Howe may have been motivated by political opportunism; if Burgoyne was successful, he would receive the credit for a decisive victory, and not Howe. However, the confusion was further compounded {{by the lack of}} explicit and contradictory instructions from London. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision <b>so</b> <b>confused</b> Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic of treason.|$|E

Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the [...] "sense of time is <b>so</b> <b>confused</b> in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date [...] ".

Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like <b>so</b> <b>confused</b> and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations.

500|$|The {{episode was}} edited by series regular Jay Rabinowitz in a Manhattan NBC facility, with {{consultation}} {{at various times}} by Fleder, Yoshimura and Tom Fontana. Rabinowitz edited the episode for several days alone, then worked with Fleder for four days, making hundreds of edits to the episode. Yoshimura worked with the editor next and was disappointed with the first cut of the episode that he saw, claiming that {{it needed to be}} [...] "a lot more frenetic and chaotics at the end, and not so artsy". Yoshimura also told Rabinowitz that the final cut of the episode should place strong emphasis on Braugher because he felt that the story is experienced [...] "through his eyes". During the editing process, Yoshimura originally removed a scene featuring a silhouette of Pembleton riding the escalator out of the subway station after Lange died. Yoshimura felt that the shot was too sentimental, but Levinson personally had it placed back in the episode after Fleder claimed to have [...] "begged" [...] for it to be included. When Fontana first watched the episode, he felt that the prologue was too confusing because it was difficult to tell what happened during the accident scene. It was edited so that rather focusing on medium shots of D'Onofrio and MacVittie, it included a wider shot to establish the presence of a subway train before the accident so viewers would not be <b>so</b> <b>confused.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} rated R for [...] "pervasive vulgar {{language}} and crude sexual humor, {{and for some}} violent images" [...] by the Motion Picture Association of America; this rating did not come as surprise to most media outlets, as many had predicted long before that the film would likely be for ages 18 and over. However, {{there was much more}} discussion within the MPAA than initially reported in the media. The board's objections to the film were described in highly specific terms by Paramount Pictures executives in private memos circulating at Paramount. For months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17. South Park was screened by the MPAA six times—five times, the board returned the movie to Paramount with an NC-17. The last submission the filmmakers received was an NC-17, two weeks before release. A marketing agent from Paramount called the two and explained that the studio [...] "needed" [...] an R. In response, Stone called producer Scott Rudin and [...] "freaked out." [...] Rudin then called a Paramount executive and, in Stone's words, [...] "freaked out on them." [...] The next day the film was changed to an R rating without reason, with the original film intact. [...] "The ratings board only cared about the dirty words; they're <b>so</b> <b>confused</b> and arbitrary," [...] said Parker to The New York Times shortly before the release of the picture. [...] "They didn't blink twice because of violence." [...] During production of the trailer for the film, the raters objected to certain words but had no problem with a scene in which cartoon bullets are killing soldiers. [...] "They had a problem with words, not bullets," [...] he said. The MPAA gave Paramount specific notes for the film; in contrast, Parker and Stone's NC-17 comedy Orgazmo, released in 1998 by Rogue Pictures, was not given any specifications on how to make the movie acceptable for an R rating. The duo attributed the R rating to the fact that Paramount {{is a member of the}} MPAA; the distributor dismissed these claims. The film was given a 15 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification for [...] "frequent coarse language and crude sexual references" [...] with no cuts made. It was rated MA15+ (Mature accompanied for those under 15) by the Australian Classification Board without cuts.|$|E
