5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> {{anything}} connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance was a {{cultural}} movement that profoundly affected European intellectual {{life in the}} early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, {{and other aspects of}} intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.|$|E
5|$|During the Eocene, rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} Eocene before <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> Eurasia. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former virus {{was likely to}} have come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston and <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders. He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Grand Forks {{was chosen}} as the site for an Air Force base. Grand Forks Air Force Base brought {{thousands}} of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota became integral to the city's economy. With construction of federal highways, during the postwar years residential and business development became suburbanized, <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> new areas as land was available. Interstate 29 was built on the western side of the city, and two enclosed shopping malls – South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall – were built on the south side.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, a {{wildfire}} {{among the}} hills adjacent to Machu Picchu threatened the site until fire fighters could cut {{a ring of}} trees to prevent the fire from <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> the ruins. In early 2010, heavy rainfall affected Machu Picchu and Cuzco. On January 25, 2010, 2,000 tourists were stranded near Machu Picchu when a landslide blocked the railroad connecting the site with Cuzco. The tourists were evacuated by ten helicopters, including four from the United States military on loan from the embassy in Lima.|$|E

5|$|K'ak' Chan Yopaat was the {{eleventh}} dynastic ruler at Copán. He was crowned as king in AD578, 24days {{after the death}} of Moon Jaguar. At the time of his rule, Copán was undergoing an unprecedented rise in population, with residential land use <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> all available land in the entire Copán Valley. The two surviving stelae of K'ak' Chan Yopaat contain long, hard-to-decipher hieroglyphic texts and are the oldest monuments at the site to survive without being either broken or buried. He reigned for 49years until his death on 5February 628. His name is recorded on four stelae erected by his successors, one of which describes a rite performed with relics from his tomb in AD730, almost a hundred years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Lochry's Defeat, {{also known}} as the Lochry massacre, was a battle fought on August 24, 1781, near present-day Aurora, Indiana, in the United States. The battle was part of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which began as a {{conflict}} between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies before <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> the western frontier, where American Indians entered the war as British allies. The battle was short and decisive: about one hundred Indians of local tribes led by Joseph Brant, a Mohawk military leader who was temporarily in the west, ambushed a similar number of Pennsylvania militiamen led by Archibald Lochry. Brant and his men killed or captured all of the Pennsylvanians without suffering any casualties.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{along with}} whales and dolphins, are {{descendants}} of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 {{million years ago}} (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.|$|E

5|$|Sarawak is {{the only}} state in Malaysia where Christians outnumber Muslims. The {{earliest}} Christian missionaries in Sarawak were Church of England (Anglicans) in 1848, followed by Roman Catholics a few years later, and Methodists in 1903. Evangelizing first took place among the Chinese immigrants before <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> indigenous animists. Other Christian denominations in Sarawak are Borneo Evangelical Mission (or Sidang Injil Borneo), and Baptists. Indigenous people such as the Iban, Bidayuh, and Orang Ulu have adopted Christianity although they do retain some of their traditional religious rites. Many Muslims come from the Malay, Melanau, and Kayan ethnic groups. Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion are predominantly practised by Chinese Malaysians. Other minor religions in Sarawak are Baha'i, Hinduism, Sikhism, and animism.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} of megalodon {{set the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size {{may have contributed to the}} {{extinction of}} megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The extinction of megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned to hold in Mongolia was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because the competition was initially founded for Eastern European countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually <b>spreading</b> <b>to</b> other nations. Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.|$|E

5|$|The first weather maps in the 19th {{century were}} drawn {{well after the}} fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After {{the advent of the}} telegraph, {{simultaneous}} surface weather observations became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s.

Literary accounts of organs being played in English Benedictine abbeys {{toward the end of}} the tenth century are the first references to organs being connected to churches. Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to oboes; no evidence of clarinets exists during this period.|$|E
