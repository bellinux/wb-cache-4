In a first step, an iron free leachate is prepared from an used magnet using nitric acid. Cobalt is separated through a liquid–liquid extraction in aqueous nitrate media using as organic phase the ionic liquid trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium nitrate which is easily prepared from the commercially available ionic liquid trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride (Cyphos® IL 101).

40|$|This review {{will cover}} the {{developments}} in the chemistry of phenanthroline-based ligands in the last 10 – 15 years. 1, 10 -Phenanthroline (phen) is a classic ligand in coordination chemistry, which couples versatility in metal ion binding with peculiar properties of its complexes. For instance, metal complexes with phenanthroline can be featured by an intense luminescence or can interact with DNA in an intercalative fashion inducing, in some cases, DNA cleavage. For this reason a number of phenanthroline-containing ligands has been recently synthesized by inserting phenanthroline within open-chain or macrocyclic backbone, {{in order to develop}} new molecular chemosensors for metal cations and anions, ionophores as well as new intercalating agents for polynucleotides. Furthermore, phenanthroline is rigid and its insertion within cyclic or acyclic structures can impart to the resulting ligand a high degree of pre-organization, affording <b>selective</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents.</b> This review will discuss on the coordination, luminescence and intercalating and/or DNA cleaving properties as well as on analytical applications of metal complexes with phenanthroline-based ligands.

In contrast, disulfonated bis-triazine ligands are unable to separate Am(III) from Eu(III) in this system. The greater ability of the tetrasulfonated ligands to retain Am(III) selectively in the aqueous phase than the corresponding disulfonated ligands appears to be due to the higher aqueous solubilities of the complexes of the tetrasulfonated ligands with Am(III). The selectivities for Am(III) complexation observed with hydrophilic tetrasulfonated bis-triazine ligands are in many cases far higher than those found with the polyaminocarboxylate ligands previously used as actinide-selective <b>complexing</b> <b>agents,</b> and are comparable to those found with the parent hydrophobic bis-triazine ligands.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of actinide recycling processes is considered in several countries, aiming at {{the reduction of}} long-term radiotoxicity and heat load of used nuclear fuel. This requires {{the separation of the}} actinides from the fission and corrosion products. The separation of the trivalent actinides (An(III)) Am(III) and Cm(III), however, is complicated by the presence of the chemically similar fission lanthanides (Ln(III)). Hydrophilic N-donor ligands are employed as An(III) or Am(III) selective complexing agents in solvent extraction to strip An(III) or Am(III) from an organic phase loaded with An(III) and Ln(III). Though they exhibit excellent selectivity, the complexation chemistry of these ligands and the complexes formed during solvent extraction are not sufficiently characterized. In the present thesis the complexation of An(III) and Ln(III) with hydrophilic N-donor ligands is studied by time resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), UV/Vis, vibronic sideband spectroscopy and solvent extraction. TRLFS studies on the complexation of Cm(III) and Eu(III) with the Am(III) <b>selective</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> SO 3 -Ph-BTBP (tetrasodium 3, 3 ’, 3 ’’, 3 ’’’-([2, 2 ’-bipyridine]- 6, 6 ’-diylbis(1, 2, 4 -triazine- 3, 5, 6 -triyl)) tetrabenzenesulfonate) revealed the formation of [M(SO 3 -Ph-BTBP) n](4 n- 3) - complexes (M = Cm(III), Eu(III); n = 1, 2). The conditional stability constants were determined in different media yielding two orders of magnitude larger  2 -values for the Cm(III) complexes, independently from the applied medium. A strong impact of ionic strength on the stability and stoichiometry of the formed complexes was identified, resulting from the stabilization of the pentaanionic [M(SO 3 -Ph-BTBP) 2] 5 - complex with increasing ionic strength. Thermodynamic studies of Cm(III) -SO 3 -Ph-BTBP complexation showed that the proton concentration of the applied medium impacts the hydration, resulting in more negative reaction enthalpies of the complexation in acidic media. Utilizing absorption spectroscopy, the formation of the [Am(SO 3 -Ph-BTBP) 2] 5 - complex was quantified. The conditional stability constant of this complex is by log 2 = 0. 2 larger than of the analogous Cm(III) complex. This is in excellent agreement with the separation factor derived from solvent extraction (SFCm(III) /Am(III) = 1. 6). Solvent extraction studies were performed in the SO 3 -Ph-BTBP/TODGA system (N,N,N’,N’-tetraoctyl-diglycolamide) at varied nitric acid concentration, SO 3 -Ph-BTBP concentration and temperature, demonstrating the separation of Am(III) from Cm(III) and the light Ln(III) with separation factors of SFCm(III) /Am(III) = 2. 6 - 3. 0 and SFEu(III) /Am(III) up to 1100. Furthermore, the VII selectivity of the SO 3 -Ph-BTBP/TODGA system is not affected by Eu(III) concentrations of 2 - 15 mmol/L or by hydrolysis after contact with nitric acid for several weeks. Radiolytic degradation occuring at  doses > 10 kGy, however, limits the recycling of SO 3 -Ph-BTBP. In case of SO 3 -Ph-BTPhen (tetrasodium 3, 3 ', 3 ", 3 "'-((1, 10 -phenanthroline- 2, 9 -diyl) bis(1, 2, 4 -triazine- 3, 5, 6 -triyl)) tetrabenzenesulfonate) the coordinating nitrogen atoms of the pyridine moieties of SO 3 -Ph-BTBP are fixed in cis position by the phenantroline moiety. This results in increased complex stability for lipophilic derivatives. However, TRLFS studies on SO 3 -Ph-BTPhen and SO 3 -Ph-BTBP in aqueous solution at pH 3 showed that the preorganization has no significant impact on the stability of the formed complexes. Due to the lower pKa of SO 3 -Ph-BTPhen the log 2 values in acidic media are higher than for SO 3 -Ph-BTBP. The selectivity of the complexing agent, however, remains unaltered. The Cm(III) and Eu(III) 1 : 1 complexes formed with the decadentate Am(III) <b>selective</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> H 4 TPAEN (N,N,N’N’-tetrakis[(6 -carboxypyridin- 2 -yl) methyl]ethylenediamine) were investigated using TRLFS. The conditional stability constants of these complexes differ by 1. 9 orders of magnitude. This is in excellent agreement with the separation factor derived from solvent extraction (SFEu(III) /Cm(III) ≈ 100). The complexation of M(III) with H 4 TPAEN is driven by the high positive reaction entropy. PTD (2, 6 -bis[1 -(propan- 1 -ol) - 1, 2, 3 -triazol- 4 -yl]pyridine) is a charge neutral, CHON compatible complexing agent designed for the selective complexation of An(III). 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 complexes with Cm(III) and Eu(III) were characterized in aqueous solution at pH 3 and in 0. 44 mol/L HNO 3. The difference of log 3 = 4 for the Cm(III) complexes in the different media is primarily caused by the protonation of PTD. Ionic strength effects and the concurring complexation of Cm(III) by nitrate contribute to a lesser extent. In solvent extraction lower separation factors were observed than calculated from the difference of the log 3 values of Cm(III) and Eu(III) (SF(experimental) Eu(III) /Cm(III) ≈ 200 vs. SF(calculated) Eu(III) /Cm(III) ≈ 1000). This was proven to be caused by the presence of lower coordinated species during solvent extraction. The 5 D 0 → 7 F 0 transition of more than 20 Eu(III) -BT(B) P/BTPhen complexes was studied. A correlation between the shift of the 7 F 0 emission band and the number of coordinating N-donors was established, allowing to easily identify the stoichiometry of Eu(III) N-donor complexes. Furthermore, the strong nephelauxetic effect observed is an excellent proof of a covalent share in the Eu(III) -N-donor bond. The results obtained in the present thesis represent a valuable contribution to the fundamental understanding of the complexation of trivalent actinides and lanthanides with hydrophilic N-donor ligands and, thus, to the development of new processes for the recycling of An(III) ...|$|E

30|$|The LiFePO 4 /C was {{synthesized}} via sol-gel {{method by}} using Fe 3 + as iron sources, ascorbic acid as reducing reagent, and acetic acid, ethanediol, oxalic acid, and ethylenediamine as <b>complexing</b> <b>agents.</b> The LiFePO 4 /C synthesized with acetic acid as <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> has better electrochemical performance, having a discharge capacity of 161.1 mAh g- 1 {{at the first}} cycle, and the capacity decreases to 157.5 mAh g- 1 after 30 cycles. The capacity fading rate is 2.2 %. According to the crystal field theory, a <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> with a small stability constant would be decomposed easily due to poor stability when heating. However, {{we found that the}} discharge capacity of LiFePO 4 /C synthesized with acetic acid as <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> was not consistent with the principle. The problem was solved by computing the CFSE of Fe 2 + in a crystal field.|$|R
40|$|Planarization {{processes}} such as chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and electrochemical mechanical planarization (ECMP) {{are typically}} carried out with slurries containing <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> {{as one of the}} principal chemical components. In such slurries, <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> enhance the solubility of copper and increase the dissolution rate of the abraded material, promoting higher copper planarization rates. The nature of the <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> used in the slurry, along with slurry pH and redox potential are among the key factors controlling the dissolution and passivation behavior of copper, and thereby governing the dynamic copper removal and planarization rates during the CMP and ECMP processes. In this paper, potential-pH diagrams of copper in aqueous systems containing a number of <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> including glutaric acid, maleic acid, α-alanine and α-aminobutyric acid are presented. The predominance regions of copper complexes under different copper and ligand activities and their implications on copper removal during planarization processes are discussed...|$|R

Film thickness, dropping test, the adhesion between aluminum and paint film were tested for single-factor experiments and orthogonal to seek better electrolysis process. The paint adhesion {{is the first}} grade for electrochemical conversion solution containing <b>complexing</b> <b>agents,</b> or {{it is the second}} grade without <b>complexing</b> <b>agents.</b> When DNS <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> is 2 ~ 5 g/L, film corrosion resistance rises with the increasing content of <b>complexing</b> <b>agent.</b> If voltage is too low, corrosion resistance of conversion coating is poor; voltage is too high, the films form powders. Better formulations for zirconate conversion coating are: 5 g/L DNS <b>complexing</b> <b>agent,</b> 10 V voltage, treatment temperature is 40 ℃. Electrochemical conversion coating is thinner than chemical conversion, but the corrosion resistance is better because the electrochemical conversion coatings are smoother and compacter than the chemical conversion coating. The paint films on electrochemical conversion coating are smoother than the chemical one. Two kinds of conversion coatings have very good adhesion with paint film up to the first level. Electrochemical conversion coatings thickness is 2. 5 µm, bubble time of NaOH-glycerine solution on them is up to 92 s...|$|R
