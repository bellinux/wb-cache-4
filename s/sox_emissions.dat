The use of high turbulence in the combustion zone and feeding an acid-capturer directly into the incinerator to absorb acid gases eliminates the costly afterburner and scrubber. This paper presents some systematic incineration tests of uniform industrial wastes such as paper mill sludge cake, rubber waste and petroleum coke. Sludge cakes with high moisture and low heating values can be treated to a low emission level by co-firing with coal. The high superficial gas velocity has improved combustion efficiency but increases NOx emissions. However, sulphur content has almost no influence on sulphur retention. The problems of CO/NOx emissions and circulation stability are also discussed.

50|$|FBC {{reduces the}} amount of sulfur emitted {{in the form of}} <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions.</b> Limestone is used to {{precipitate}} out sulfate during combustion, which also allows more efficient heat transfer from the boiler to the apparatus used to capture the heat energy (usually water tubes). The heated precipitate coming in direct contact with the tubes (heating by conduction) increases the efficiency. Since this allows coal plants to burn at cooler temperatures, less NOx is also emitted. However, burning at low temperatures also causes increased polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions. FBC boilers can burn fuels other than coal, and the lower temperatures of combustion (800 °C / 1500 °F) have other added benefits as well.|$|E
40|$|Emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) cause {{considerable}} {{global environmental}} {{and human health}} impacts including acidification, climate change, and increased premature deaths in human populations due to serious heart and lung diseases. Although recently revised regulations in MARPOL 73 / 78 Annex VI are expected to decrease <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships, {{it is clear that}} these regulations will need further development. Even forthcoming requirements for <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from marine sources will still be considerably less strict in 2020 than the requirements for <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from terrestrial emission sources in force today. Without further regulatory developments, emissions of harmful <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships will persist, and will also indirectly hinder the efficient operation of available exhaust aftertreatment devices for other air emissions from ships. This thesis examines the regulation of <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships with a focus on the dominant type of regulation: ‘command and control’ (CAC) regulation. The purpose is to identify and examine historical and current differences between standard-setting in the regulation of <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from terrestrial sources, and the regulation of <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from marine sources. Standard-setting differences are considered across three regulatory scales (international, regional, national), with a theoretical and methodological foundation mainly in international environmental law and regulatory studies, and with the further aims of identifying the underlying rationales for the key differences in standard-setting, the regulatory effects of these differences, and the possibilities of improvement of <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> regulation in the marine setting. Five categories of environmental standard-setting are examined: (a) product standards; (b) process standards; (c) emission standards; (d) environmental quality standards; and (e) other standards. In conclusion, this thesis argues that standard-setting in the regulation of terrestrial and marine SOx emission sources differs on all regulatory scales, both historically and presently. A key difference in standard-setting is that the control of <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> from terrestrial sources has relied on combinations of standard-setting approaches, whereas marine emission sources have primarily been controlled with product standards. Arguably, the emission to be controlled has been a crucial decisive factor for the choice of standard-setting type. Other decisive factors were inter alia technical, economic, and institutional. The regulatory effects of the key differences are that experiences were gained in the terrestrial regulatory setting from using various forms of regulatory standards compared to the marine setting. The possibilities of improvement of <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> regulation in the marine setting depend on perspectives and priorities. If the ambition is to refine the precision of standard-setting in <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> regulation, there are improvement possibilities. Three broader implications of this study’s results are highlighted: regulatory studies can provide deeper understandings of the design of regulation; the analysis of standard-setting against a surrounding explanatory context can demonstrate the influence on standard choice of factors such as emission type, technology, and science; and regulatory studies can be used to analyse large quantities of multiscale regulatory material, which can yield better overviews of a regulatory landscape...|$|E

Further,SOx emissions in China had been increasing {{at an annual rate}} of 3 % for the periodfrom 1985 to 1992 (see Figure 1). However, as the values in the Statistical Yearbook exclude small size productionunits such as the township-village enterprises, the above values are likely to be underestimated. Based on our Japan-China input-output tables for environmental analysis, China's <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> in 1987 reached 20 million tons, which was as large as theemissions from the US. Hence, with the rapid rate of economic growth, China wouldprobably become the world largest emitter of SOx in the future. As Japan's emissionsof SOx in 1985 was estimated to be 1. 15 million tons, <b>SOx</b> <b>emissions</b> in China was thus 17 times larger than that in Japan. On the other hand, GDP of Japan in 1985 was 1. 4 trillion dollars, whereas the size of the Chinese economy was 0. 3 trillion dollars in 1987, which was less than one-fourth the size of the Japanese economy.
