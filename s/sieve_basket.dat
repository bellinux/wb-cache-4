60|$|One {{thing was}} very remarkable, viz. that they taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets; but they soon outdid their masters; for they made {{abundance}} of most ingenious things in wicker-work; particularly {{all sorts of}} <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves,</b> bird-cages, cupboards, &c. as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other things, being very ingenious at such work when they were once put {{in the way of}} it.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the great}} {{economic}} potential for Los Angeles, the demand for Indian labor grew rapidly. Yaanga began attracting Indians from the islands and {{as far away as}} San Diego and San Luis Obispo. The village began to look like a refugee camp. Unlike the missions, the pobladores paid Indians for their labor. In exchange for their work as farm workers, vaqueros, ditch diggers, water haulers, and domestic help; they were paid in clothing and other goods as well as cash and alcohol. The pobladores bartered with them for prized sea-otter and seal pelts, <b>sieves,</b> trays, <b>baskets,</b> mats, and other woven goods. This commerce greatly contributed to the economic success of the town and the attraction of other Indians to the city.|$|R
25|$|Wapishana men craft wooden stools and <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves,</b> and squeezers {{for use in}} the {{preparation}} of cassava and other foods. They also make arrows, fencing wire into points, but these arrows and bows they buy or get hold of from other Indians have been almost entirely replaced by shotguns. Women make clay cooking pots and spin cotton and weave the thread into baby slings and hammocks. Introduced crafts include needlework, dressmaking, and rustic furniture making.|$|R
50|$|In Iran the Asheq of Azerbaijan, the Challi of Baluchistan, the Luti of Kurdistan, Kermānshāh, Īlām, and Lorestān, the Mehtar in the Mamasani district, the Sazandeh of Band-i Amir and Marv-dasht, and the Toshmal {{among the}} Bakhtyari {{pastoral}} groups worked as professional musicians. The men among the Kowli worked as tinkers, smiths, musicians, and monkey and bear handlers; they also made <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves,</b> and brooms and dealt in donkeys. Their women {{made a living}} from peddling, begging, and fortune-telling.|$|R
50|$|Their main {{occupation}} was {{the production of}} household items such as <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves</b> and chewing gum made by men and sold by women in the neighbouring towns. Among other sources of income Patkanov lists fortune-telling and cattle larceny. Nomadic Garachi groups used to train animals and make street song-and-dance performances. This practice was described in the famous 1913 story Garaja giz by the Azeri writer Suleyman Sani Akhundov. The Garachi claim to adhere to Shia Islam but in reality are non-religious for the most part.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{forms of}} honey {{collecting}} entailed {{the destruction of}} the entire colony when the honey was harvested. The wild hive was crudely broken into, using smoke to suppress the bees, the honeycombs were torn out and smashed up — along with the eggs, larvae and honey they contained. The liquid honey from the destroyed brood nest was strained through a <b>sieve</b> or <b>basket.</b> This was destructive and unhygienic, but for hunter-gatherer societies this did not matter, since the honey was generally consumed immediately and there were always more wild colonies to exploit. But in settled societies {{the destruction of the}} bee colony meant the loss of a valuable resource; this drawback made beekeeping both inefficient and something of a [...] "stop and start" [...] activity. There could be no continuity of production and no possibility of selective breeding, since each bee colony was destroyed at harvest time, along with its precious queen.|$|R
60|$|Thus, I think, I {{have given}} a full account of all that {{happened}} to them till my return, {{at least that was}} worth notice. The Indians were wonderfully civilised by them, and they frequently went among them; but they forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians coming to them, because they would not have their settlement betrayed again. One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught the savages to make wicker- work, or baskets, but they soon outdid their masters: for they made abundance of ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves,</b> bird-cages, cupboards, &c.; as also chairs, stools, beds, couches, being very ingenious at such work when they were once put in the way of it.|$|R
50|$|The Sikligar in Haryana are now {{divided into}} two groups, the Hindu Sikligar and Sikh Sikligar. The {{difference}} in religions mean that both groups are distinct communities, with no intermarriage. Both speak the Haryanvi dialect. They are found mainly in the districts of Hissar, Jind, Rohtak, Sirsa and Mohendargarh. Settled in hamlets {{on the outskirts of}} towns and villages, living often in thatched huts, they are further divided into 84 clans, known as gotras. The main ones being the Chauhan, Nirban, Taunk, Kalilot, Mohil, Joone, Dugoli Ke, Moyal, Padyar, Khankhara, Bhati, Dhare, Khichi, Ghelot, Badke, Dangi, Jaspal, Patwa, Solanki, Matlana, Dagar, and Banwari. Their main occupation remains metal burnishing. They are involved in the manufacturing of implements such as spades, sickles, <b>sieves</b> and iron <b>baskets.</b> A small number are now farmers, raising poultry and cattle.|$|R
6000|$|This flagitious man, {{in order}} to compass his black designs, {{employed}} certain wicked instruments (which great statesmen are never without) to adapt several London cries, {{in such a manner}} as would best answer his ends. And, whereas it was upon grounds grievously suspected, that all places at Court were sold to the highest bidder: Certain women were employed by his emissaries, to carry fish in baskets on their heads, and bawl through the streets, [...] "Buy my fresh places." [...] I must, indeed, own that other women used the same cry, who were innocent of this wicked design, and really sold their fish of that denomination to get an honest livelihood; but the rest, who were in the secret, although they carried fish in their <b>sieves</b> or <b>baskets,</b> to save appearances; yet they had likewise, a certain sign, somewhat resembling that of the free-masons, which the purchasers of places knew well enough, and were directed by the women whither they were to resort, and make their purchase. And, I remember very well, how oddly it looked, when we observed many gentlemen finely dressed, about the Court end of the town, and as far as York Buildings, where the Lord Treasurer Oxford dwelt, calling the women who cried [...] "Buy my fresh places," [...] and talking to them in the corner of a street, after they understood each other's sign: But we never could observe that any fish was bought.|$|R
50|$|Neoteric theory {{proposes that}} {{evidence}} of association with manifest tools alone is both sufficient to define Homo sapiens and their presence {{as a separate}} species at a date far earlier than 3.3 million years. In his work on abductive reasoning, Professor Lorenzo Magnani at the University of Pavia provides a logical opening to suggest that stone tools have their precursors in materials subject to rapid decay.Such tools might include wooden implements and articles made of fibre for which physical evidence is missing, including woven bark strips, leather and animal fur. The presence in contemporary cultures of non-stone tools currently in use alongside those of materials of long duration, add support to the Neoteric theory {{and the need to}} revise the currently supposed evolutionary trajectory of the human.Obviously, following the path of abductive logic, stone tools were not the first tools, rather, these were wooden grubbing sticks, <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves,</b> fish traps, wooden skewers, leather straps and fibrous cord.The first date for tool use among early humans is thus pushed back far beyond the 3.3 million years that is now the first ‘marker’ for human ingenuity. There may be extant (long-lived) cultures that, having no stone implements, demonstrate a wealth of intelligence through the production of manifest tools not dependant on stone (or metal) and whose complex behavior reflects refined reasoning, a rich repertoire of belief, profound artistic expression and complex language.|$|R
6000|$|... "The poor creatures, {{thoroughly}} humbled, being {{reduced to}} about thirty-seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and earnestly begged for food; hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen well armed, together with Old Friday, and three Indian slaves were loaded {{with a large}} quantity of bread and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the poor Indians being ordered to {{sit down on the}} side of the hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have proved faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their bounds, where at this day they quietly and happily remain, and where we now and then visit them. They are confined to a neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or four in length, on the south-east corner of the island, the sea being before, and lofty mountains behind them, free from the appearance of canoes; and indeed their countrymen never made any inquiry after them. We gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; have taught them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant corn, make bread, breed tame goats and milk them, as likewise to make wicker work, in which I must ingenuously confess, they infinitely out do us, having made themselves several pretty necessaries and fancies, as <b>baskets,</b> <b>sieves,</b> bird-cages, and cupboards, as also stools, beds and couches, no less useful than delightful; and now they live the most innocent and inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued in the world, wanting nothing but wives to make them a nation.|$|R
