40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the two {{important}} issues {{of the law of}} capital market. Namely, the period of time in which <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> is valid (validity) and obligation to asupplement (to correct and update) <b>the</b> <b>prospectus.</b> <b>The</b> Law on the Capital Market of Serbia regulates validity of <b>the</b> <b>prospectus,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> time period in which <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> is valid. <b>The</b> <b>prospectus</b> shall be valid for 12 months after its publication {{for the purposes of the}} offers of securities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public or <b>the</b> admission <b>to</b> a regulated market, under the condition that the information in <b>the</b> <b>prospectus,</b> where appropriate, updated by a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospectus,</b> containing <b>the</b> latest information on the issuer and securities which shall be offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public or admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF. The paper is particularly focused on the difference between the time of the validity of <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> and <b>the</b> period of the validity of public offering of securities. The time for which <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> is valid (validity) is an issue which is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obligation <b>to</b> update and <b>supplement</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ad hoc obligation <b>to</b> inform <b>the</b> public in the capital market. An obligation <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> (<b>to</b> update and/or to correct). i. e. <b>to</b> create a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> exists from <b>the</b> moment <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> is approved until the end of the public offering or until the securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF. An obligation to update and correct <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> indicates and obligation to include completely new relevant information in the <b>supplement</b> of <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> or <b>to</b> correct <b>the</b> relevant irregularities or incompleteness of information contained in <b>the</b> <b>prospectus</b> with regard <b>the</b> issuer and securities which are to be offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public or admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF, as long as those facts might be of relevance for the investment decision...|$|R
