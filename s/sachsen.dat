5|$|After her commissioning, <b>Sachsen</b> {{joined the}} German fleet, which was tasked {{primarily}} with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were {{presumed to be}} the most likely enemies in a continental war. In the early 1880s, heightened tensions with Russia prompted the naval command developed more offensively-minded contingencies. These formed the basis for the annual summer fleet maneuvers, in which <b>Sachsen</b> took part.|$|E
5|$|Kapitän zur See Otto von Diederichs took {{command of}} the ship in 1889. <b>Sachsen</b> {{took part in a}} {{goodwill}} visit to Portsmouth {{to take part in the}} Cowes Regatta. Following the trip to England, <b>Sachsen</b> and the rest of the fleet conducted the annual summer exercises. At 15:45 on 27 February 1890, <b>Sachsen</b> ran aground outside Kiel in foggy weather. The grounding dented the bottom of the hull and tore it open. However, on 2 March, the ship was able to get underway at high tide. Repairs lasted for two weeks. In 1891, the German navy stopped the practice of deactivating the fleet in the winter months and instead kept the front-line units on permanent active duty. The fleet was also reorganized, to form two four-ship divisions. <b>Sachsen</b> and her sisters were assigned to the I Division, under the command of Admiral Hans von Koester. Annual fleet training cruises were conducted in April. The summer fleet maneuvers, which occurred during mid-August to mid-September, up through 1894 were always centered on defensive actions in the North and Baltic seas.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, <b>Sachsen</b> was {{withdrawn}} from active service {{and placed in}} the reserve fleet. The ship remained as a reserve vessel until 19 February 1910, when she was stricken from the navy list. The following year, <b>Sachsen</b> was used as a target hulk off the coast of Schwansen for the fleet. Following the German defeat in World War I in 1918, the vessel was sold to Hattinger Co., which broke the ship up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven in 1919.|$|E

5|$|SMS Oldenburg {{was laid}} {{down at the}} AG Vulcan {{shipyard}} in Stettin in 1883, launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. Oldenburg was intended {{to have been a}} fifth member of the <b>Sachsen</b> class, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the ships of the <b>Sachsen</b> class prompted a redesign that bore little resemblance to the earlier vessels. Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight 24cm guns amidships, six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside. She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German-made steel.|$|E
5|$|The Bayern {{class was}} {{a class of}} four super-dreadnought battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy). The class {{comprised}} , , <b>Sachsen,</b> and Württemberg. Construction started on the ships shortly before World War I; Baden was laid down in 1913, Bayern and <b>Sachsen</b> followed in 1914, and Württemberg, the final ship, was laid down in 1915. Only Baden and Bayern were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, Bayern and Baden were the last German battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine.|$|E

5|$|The year 1896 {{followed}} {{much the}} same pattern as the previous year. On 10 March 1896, Koester once again raised his flag aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. Individual ship training was conducted though April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included {{a visit to the}} Dutch ports of Vlissingen and Nieuwediep. Further maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm again went into dock for maintenance, and while she was out of service, Koester transferred his flag to <b>Sachsen</b> from 16 September to 3 October. Koester again flew his flag aboard <b>Sachsen</b> from 15 December to 1 March 1897.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>Sachsen</b> entered {{service in}} 1878, she only participated in one annual fleet exercise, in 1880, before all four ships were {{assigned}} to the 1884 maneuvers. This was due to the poor performance of <b>Sachsen</b> in the 1880 maneuvers and the negative reputation of the class. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. The four ships served rotations with the fleet for the next two years, though in 1886, all four were demobilized as the Reserve Division in the Baltic. Aside from the Sachsens half-sister , the German Navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until the late 1880s when the first of the s were laid down. The poor performance of the sortie corvettes, coupled with the rise of the Jeune École, led Leo von Caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats.|$|E

5|$|Between 1925 and 1929, the SS was {{considered}} to be a small Gruppe (battalion) of the SA. Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth. As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden. The SS established a number of Gaus (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of SS-Gau Berlin, SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg, SS-Gau Franken, SS-Gau Niederbayern, SS-Gau Rheinland-Süd, and SS-Gau <b>Sachsen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both Bayern and Baden were interned in Scapa Flow {{following}} the Armistice in November 1918. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, {{the commander of}} the interned German fleet, ordered his ships be sunk on 21 June 1919; Bayern was successfully scuttled, though British guards managed to beach Baden to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. <b>Sachsen</b> and Württemberg, both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. Bayern was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal {{was opened}} for traffic, {{eight years after}} work had begun. Württemberg and her three sisters, along with dozens of other warships, {{attended}} the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of}} the fleet in the Baltic. Württemberg again served during the 1896 and 1897 maneuvers, though <b>Sachsen</b> was her only sister to join the exercises. Baden and Bayern were out of service for extensive modernization.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Sachsen</b> {{class of}} four ships {{was built in}} the late 1870s to early 1880s. The ships—, , , and —were {{designed}} to operate as part of an integrated coastal defense network. The ships were intended to sortie from fortified bases to break up an enemy blockade or landing attempt, and were labeled as Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes) by the Imperial Navy. As a result of their intended roles, they were given a short cruising radius and were not intended for high-seas operations. Armed with six 26cm guns, they were, however, intended to fight hostile ironclads on relatively equal terms.|$|E
5|$|Baden {{was ordered}} under the {{provisional}} name Ersatz Wörth in 1912, under {{the fourth and}} final Naval Law, which was passed that year. Construction began at the Schichau-Werke dockyard in Danzig under construction number 913. The ship was laid down on 20 December 1913 and launched on 30 October 1915. After fitting-out, sea trials were conducted; the ship was commissioned into service on 14 March 1917. She had cost the Imperial German Government 49 million Goldmarks. Badens two sisterships, <b>Sachsen</b> and Württemberg, both lay incomplete {{at the end of}} World War I and were subsequently scrapped, leaving Baden the last battleship built for the Imperial Navy.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} <b>Sachsen</b> class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E

5|$|Following their commissionings in 1878–1883, {{the four}} ships {{served with the}} fleet on {{numerous}} training exercises and cruises in the 1880s and 1890s. They also participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various cities in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In the late 1890s, the four ships were extensively rebuilt; their secondary batteries were modernized and they received upgraded propulsion systems. They were removed from active duty between 1902 and 1910 and relegated to secondary duties. <b>Sachsen</b> and Bayern became target ships while Württemberg became a torpedo training ship. The three ships were broken up for scrap in 1919–1920. Baden {{was used as a}} boom defense hulk from 1910 to 1920, when she became a target ship. She survived until 1938, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{commissioned}} into the fleet in July 1916 and March 1917, respectively. This {{was too late}} for either ship {{to take part in the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Bayern was assigned to the naval force that drove the Imperial Russian Navy from the Gulf of Riga during Operation Albion in October 1917, though the ship was severely damaged from a mine and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. Baden replaced Friedrich der Grosse as the flagship of the High Seas Fleet, but saw no combat. Both vessels were interned in Scapa Flow following the Armistice in November 1918. Bayern was successfully scuttled on 21 July 1919, but British guards managed to beach Baden to prevent her from sinking.

5|$|The German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) ordered Westfalen {{under the}} {{provisional}} name Ersatz <b>Sachsen</b> {{as a replacement}} for , the lead ship of the elderly s. The Reichstag secretly approved and provided funds for Nassau and Westfalen at the end of March 1906, but construction on Westfalen was delayed while arms and armor were procured. She was laid down on 12 August 1907 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. As with her sister , construction proceeded swiftly and secretly; detachments of soldiers guarded both the shipyard and the major contractors who supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched on 1 July 1908, underwent an initial fitting-out, and then in mid-September 1909 was transferred to Kiel by a crew composed of dockyard workers for a final fitting-out. However, the water level in the Weser River was low at this time of year, so six pontoons had to be attached to the ship to reduce her draft. Even so, it took two attempts before the ship cleared the river.|$|E
