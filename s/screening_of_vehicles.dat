25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} <b>screens</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|R

50|$|Customs {{should have}} both base offices at the {{warehouse}} {{and around the}} gates. The office at the warehouse is mainly for detecting harmful agriculture and smuggling (drugs, dirty money). Office at gates are mainly for the reason of detecting mis-picked cargo or radiation containers. At gates there should be radiation-detection equipments aim at detecting dangerous weapons and radiation stuff {{that can be used}} to make dirty bombs. Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) are passive radiation detection devices used for the <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> individuals, <b>vehicles,</b> cargo or other vectors for detection of illicit sources such as at borders or secure facilities. Portal VACIS imaging system helps trained operators see the contents of closed containers, assisting them in intercepting weapons, contraband, and other items of interest and verifying shipping manifests. Patented drive-through technology lets trucks drive through the system without stopping, providing an effective solution for high-traffic situations where lengthy manual inspection processes are impractical or undesirable.|$|R
40|$|Poor aqueous {{solubility}} {{of chemical}} entities presents {{a major challenge}} to modern drug delivery, because of their low bioavailability. Our aim was to prepare and evaluate a suitable solid self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SSEDDS) as a potential carrier for rutin. After <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> various <b>vehicles</b> (surfactants, co-surfactants and oils) and selection of those having the better drug solubilizing power, liquid SEDDS were formulated. Prepared formulations were evaluated for self-emulsifying ability and phase diagrams were constructed to optimize the systems. System (S 6), prepared from Triton/Acconon/Labrafac, attained highest drug solubilization capacity, hence, was selected for the preparation of SSEDDS by adsorption on different nano-structured carriers (Neusilin®, Fujicalin® and F-melt®) in different ratios. S 6 had a very small particle size of 4. 849  ±  0. 001  nm and a high percentage transmittance of 99. 31  ±  0. 16 %. SSEDDS showing good flow properties as well as reasonable drug loading capacity were selected for in vitro drug release studies. The SSEDDS (SS 4) composed of Neusilin® US 2 : S 6 (1 : 2) attained the best drug release properties and was subjected to further characterization (SEM, FTIR and XRD). Conclusion: The optimized liquisolid dosage form of rutin provided good flowability as well as fast drug release properties and, therefore, can be suitable for oral delivery system...|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{explosive}}s, explosive precursors, {{or other}} threat agents presents {{a number of}} technological challenges for optical sensing methods. Certainly detecting trace levels of threat agents against a complex background is chief among these challenges; however, the related issues of multiple target distances (from standoff to proximity) and sampling time scales (from passive mines to rapid rate of march convoy protection) for different applications make it unlikely that a single technique will be ideal for all sensing situations. A number of methods for spanning the range of optical sensor technologies exist which, when integrated, could produce a fused sensor system possessing {{a high level of}} sensitivity to threat agents and a moderate standoff real-time capability appropriate for portal <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> personnel or <b>vehicles.</b> In this work, we focus on several promising, and potentially synergistic, laser-based methods for sensing threat agents.

40|$|Discrimination of benign {{sources from}} threat sources at Port of Entries (POE) is {{of a great}} {{importance}} in efficient <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> cargo and <b>vehicles</b> using Radiation Portal Monitors (RPM). Currently RPM's ability to distinguish these radiological sources is seriously hampered by the energy resolution of the deployed RPMs. As naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) are ubiquitous in commerce, false alarms are problematic as they require additional resources in secondary inspection in addition to impacts on commerce. To increase the sensitivity of such detection systems without increasing false alarm rates, alarm metrics need to incorporate the ability to distinguish benign and threat sources. Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering technique were implemented in the present study. Such techniques were investigated for their potential to lower false alarm rates and/or increase sensitivity to weaker threat sources without loss of specificity. Results of the investigation demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity in discriminating benign sources from threat sources...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of the development and diffusion <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services, and to how information technology interacts with forms of organization and business models to undermine or support the development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. The overall research question asked in the thesis is: what are the technical, business and organizational prerequisites for the development and diffusion of a rich variety <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services? The development and diffusion <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services have been empirically investigated by ethnographic field studies, prototype software development and case studies as part of a collaborative practice research approach involving the Volvo Group. Based on ethnographic field studies <b>of</b> current <b>vehicle</b> repair service work, analytical patterns were identified to better understand the core foundation <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. In the prototype development, a platform was developed, which allowed exploring the technical prerequisites for the development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. Two case studies examined, first, the development of IT support for vehicle services and, secondly, the organization <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> service development. The results from all these collaborative practice research activities suggest that the vehicle industry needs to revise its conception <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services as services extending product features in favor <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services enriching the use <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> Thus, the thesis argues that the lack <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services, rather than being just a question of technical nature, can only be remedied by a change of perspective from products to services, which in turn influences the choice of technology, forms of organization and underlying business models. Vehicle services are here conceptualized as services interacting across the ecosystem <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> stakeholders to enrich the customer’s use <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> Hence, to be really useful, vehicle services must roam organizational and technical boundaries and cannot be treated as properties <b>of</b> the <b>vehicle.</b> This requires vehicle manufacturers to adopt appropriate forms of technology and organization. The concept of information infrastructure is shown to be appropriate since it allows separating services from shared infrastructural resources. Such a separation also allows opening up the development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services to other service providers. Open innovation is described as a suitable form of opening up the innovation and development <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services to a larger group of service providers. The thesis argues that these three prerequisites – business model, technology and organization – have to closely interact to facilitate the development and diffusion of a rich variety <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> services. The general contribution of the thesis is to show how product oriented industries have to revise their proprietary mindset in favor of an open attitude to successfully engage in the development of services...|$|R
