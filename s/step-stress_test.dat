40|$|Abstract: In this article, we {{consider}} models for experiments {{in which the}} stress levels are altered at intermediate stages during the exposure. These experiments, referred to as <b>step-stress</b> <b>tests,</b> belong to the class of accelerated models that are extensively used in reliability and life-testing applications. Models for <b>step-stress</b> <b>tests</b> have largely relied on the cumulative exposure model (CEM) discussed by Nelson. Unfortunately, the assumptions of the model are fairly restrictive and quite unreasonable for applications in survival analysis. In particular, under the CEM the hazard function has discontinuities at the points at which the stress levels are changed. We introduce a new step-stress model where the hazard function is continuous. We consider a simple experiment with only two stress levels. The hazard function {{is assumed to be}} constant at the two stress levels, and linear in the intermediate period. This model allows for a lag period before the effects of the change in stress are observed. Using this formulation in terms of the hazard function, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters. A simple least-squares type procedure is also proposed that yields closed form solutions for the underlying parameters. A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to study the behavior of the estimators obtained by the two methods for different choices of sample sizes and parameter values. We analyze a real dataset and show that the model provides an excellent fit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} model the {{relationship}} between failure time and degradation for a simple step stress test where underlying degradation path is linear and different causes of failure are possible. It is assumed that the intensity function depends only on the degradation value. No assumptions are made about {{the distribution of the}} failure times. A simple <b>step-stress</b> <b>test</b> is used to shorten failure time of products and a tampered failure rate (TFR) model is proposed to describe the effect of the changing stress on the intensities. We assume that some of the products that fail during the test have a cause of failure that is only known to belong to a certain subset of all possible failures. This case is known as masking. In the presence of masking, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the model parameters are obtained through an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by treating the causes of failure as missing values. The effect of incomplete information on the estimation of parameters is studied through a Monte-Carlo simulation.

In a special class of accelerated life <b>tests</b> known as <b>step-stress</b> <b>tests,</b> the stress levels increase discretely at pre-fixed time points, and {{this allows the}} experimenter to obtain information on {{the parameters of the}} lifetime distributions more quickly than under normal operating conditions. Moreover, when a test unit fails, there are often more than one fatal cause for the failure, such as mechanical or electrical. In this article, we consider the simple step-stress model under time constraint when the lifetime distributions of the different risk factors are independently exponentially distributed. Under this setup, we derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the unknown mean parameters of the different causes under the assumption of a cumulative exposure model. Since it is found that the MLEs do not exist when there is no failure by any particular risk factor within the specified time frame, the exact sampling distributions of the MLEs are derived through the use of conditional moment generating functions. Using these exact distributions as well as the asymptotic distributions, the parametric bootstrap method, and the Bayesian posterior distribution, we discuss the construction of confidence intervals and credible intervals for the parameters.

METHODS: Fully anatomically shaped monolithic resin composite molar crowns (Lava Ultimate, n= 24) and leucite reinforced glass-ceramic crowns (IPS Empress CAD, n= 24) were fabricated using CAD/CAM systems. Crowns were cemented on aged dentin-like resin composite tooth replicas (Filtek Z 100) with resin-based cements (RelyX Ultimate for Lava Ultimate or Multilink Automix for IPS Empress). Three step-stress profiles (aggressive, moderate and mild) were employed for the accelerated sliding-contact mouth-motion fatigue test. Twenty one crowns from each group were randomly distributed among these three profiles (1 : 2 : 4). Failure was designated as chip-off or bulk fracture. Optical and electron microscopes were {{used to examine the}} occlusal surface and subsurface damages, as well as the material microstructures. RESULTS: The resin composite crowns showed only minor occlusal damage during mouth-motion step-stress fatigue loading up to 1700 N. Cross-sectional views revealed contact-induced cone cracks in all specimens, and flexural radial cracks in 2 crowns. Both cone and radial cracks were relatively small compared to the crown thickness. Extending these cracks to the threshold for catastrophic failure would require much higher indentation loads or more loading cycles.

40|$|Accelerated life tests (ALTs) {{are often}} used to make timely {{assessments}} of the life time distribution of materials and components. The goal of many ALTs is estimation of a quantile of a log-location failure time distribution. Much of the previous work on planning accelerated life tests has focused on deriving test-planning methods under a specific log-location distribution. This thesis presents a new approach for computing approximate large-sample variances of maximum likelihood estimators of a quantile of general log-location distribution with censoring and time-varying stress based on a cumulative exposure model. This thesis also presents a strategy to develop useful test plans using {{a small number of}} test units. We provide an approach to find optimum <b>step-stress</b> accelerated life <b>test</b> plans by using the large-sample approximate variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of a quantile of the failure time distribution at use conditions from a <b>step-stress</b> accelerated life <b>test.</b> In Chapter 2, we show this approach allows for multi-step stress changes and censoring for general log-location-scale distributions. As an application of this approach, the optimum variance is studied as a function of shape parameter for both Weibull and lognormal distributions. Graphical comparisons among test plans using step-up, step-down, and constant-stress patterns are also presented. The results show that, depending on the values of the model parameters and quantile of interest, each of the three test plans can be preferable in terms of optimum variance. In Chapter 3, using sample data from a published paper describing optimum ramp-stress test plans, we show that our approach and the one used in the previous work give the same variance-covariance matrix of the quantile estimator from the two different approaches. Then, as an application of this approach, we extend the previous work to a new optimum ramp-stress test plan obtained by simultaneously adjusting the ramp rate and the lower start level of stress. We find that the new optimum test plan can have smaller variances than that of the optimum ramp-stress test plan previously obtained by adjusting only the ramp rate. We also compare optimum ramp-stress test plans with the more commonly used constant-stress accelerated life test plans. Previous work on planning accelerated life tests has been based on large-sample approximations to evaluate test plan properties. In Chapter 4, we use more accurate simulation methods to investigate the properties of accelerated life tests with small sample sizes where large-sample approximations might not be expected to be adequate. These properties include the simulated bias and variance for quantiles of the failure-time distribution at use conditions. We focus on using these methods to find practical compromise test plans that use three levels of stress. We also study the effects of not having any failures at test conditions and the effect of using incorrect planning values. We note that the large-sample approximate variance is far from adequate when the probability of zero failures at certain test conditions is not negligible. We suggest a strategy to develop useful test plans using a small number of test units while meeting constraints on the estimation precision and on the probability that there will be zero failures at {{one or more of the}} test stress levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerated}} {{degradation test}} (ADT) has become critical for product reliability assessment. In performing the ADT for newly developed products, a constant-stress ADT may be impractical or sometimes impossible where the available size of testing units and the testing duration are heavily bounded {{to meet the}} short development period of the products. As an alternative, a <b>step-stress</b> accelerated degradation <b>test</b> (SSADT) can be {{a useful tool for}} satisfying the test limitation, and for making up for uncertainty in selecting appropriate levels of stress. Occasionally, the elevated stress under SSADT not only accelerates the performance degradation of products, but it may also expedite traumatic failures. This paper proposes a modeling approach to simultaneously analyze linear degradation data and traumatic failures with competing risks in an SSADT experiment. Under the modeling approach, a cumulative exposure model is considered. The failure rate corresponding to each failure mode is described {{as a function of the}} degradation level at the moment of failure. No parametric assumptions are made regarding the failure-time distribution to extend the proposed method to more general cases. We derive maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters, then estimate failure rates and product reliability based on the degradation level to failure. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimates are also discussed. The proposed model is applied to accelerated degradation data from plastic substrate active matrix light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs), along with sensitivity analysis.

The first is that the times of stress level elevating in the new model are identical for all products, which enable us to use only one chamber (oven) for testing all test units. The second is that, the new method does not require continuous inspection and to elevate the stress level, {{it is not necessary}} for the experimenter to inspect the value of the degradation continually. The new method decrease the cost of measurement and also {{there is no need to}} use electronic sensors to detect the first passage time of the degradation to the threshold value in the new method. We assume that the degradation path follows a gamma process. The stress level is elevated as soon as the measurement of the degradation of one of the test units, at one of the specified times, exceeds the threshold value. Under the constraint that the total experimental cost does not exceed a pre-specified budget, the optimal settings including the optimal threshold value, sample size, measurement frequency and termination time are obtained by minimizing the asymptotic variance of an estimated quantile of the lifetime distribution of the product. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|By {{solving the}} problem of very long test time on {{reliability}} qualification for Light-emitting Diode (LED) products, the accelerated degradation test with a thermal overstress at a proper range {{is regarded as a}} promising and effective approach. For a comprehensive survey of the application of <b>step-stress</b> accelerated degradation <b>test</b> (SSADT) in LEDs, the thermal, photometric, and colorimetric properties of two types of LED chip scale packages (CSPs), i. e., 4000 °K and 5000 °K samples each of which was driven by two different levels of currents (i. e., 120 mA and 350 mA, respectively), were investigated under an increasing temperature from 55 °C to 150 °C and a systemic study of driving current effect on the SSADT results were also reported in this paper. During SSADT, junction temperatures of the test samples have a positive relationship with their driving currents. However, the temperature-voltage curve, which represents the thermal resistance property of the test samples, does not show significant variance as long as the driving current is no more than the sample’s rated current. But when the test sample is tested under an overdrive current, its temperature-voltage curve is observed as obviously shifted to the left when compared to that before SSADT. Similar overdrive current affected the degradation scenario is also found in the attenuation of Spectral Power Distributions (SPDs) of the test samples. As used in the reliability qualification, SSADT provides explicit scenes on color shift and correlated color temperature (CCT) depreciation of the test samples, but not on lumen maintenance depreciation. It is also proved that the varying rates of the color shift and CCT depreciation failures can be effectively accelerated with an increase of the driving current, for instance, from 120 mA to 350 mA. For these reasons, SSADT is considered as a suitable accelerated test method for qualifying these two failure modes of LED CSPs...|$|R
