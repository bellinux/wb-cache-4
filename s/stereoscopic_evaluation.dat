40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{introduced}} project is to achieve a combination of photogrammetric measurement techniques and procedures of digital image analysis in one <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> system, {{which can be used}} in architectural surveying, building preservation and archaeology. Digital stereoscopic examination allows users an estimation of the spatial dimension and the surface texture of objects. The integration of automated image analysis techniques simplifies the stereoscopic measurement procedure and offers an increase in accuracy. Due to the substantial similarities of stereoscopic image pairs, correlation techniques provide measurements of subpixel precision for corresponding image points. Already within the process of image orientation this technique allows the use of natural unmarked tie points. Separate signalized control points are no longer necessary. The stereoscopic measurement process itself is simplified by an automated correlation-based depth determination for manual single point measurements. An adapted expansion algorithm for the same process even offers the possibility to measure profiles and object surfaces automatically. Additionally an included interface for the integration of tacheometric measurements and laser scanner point clouds allows a combined object evaluation. Digital surface models (DSM) can be created by triangulation and edited within the stereo model. In combination with the high resolution image material of the stereo evaluation, high-quality unwrappings, ortho images and 3 D models can be generated. Taking various approaches for camera modelling into consideration, analogue and digital amateur cameras as well as panoramic cameras, can be used for stereoscopic recording in addition to the common metrical cameras. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} the surface pretreatment of a feldspathic ceramic on the shear bond strength of two different resin cements. Background Data: Although several conventional surface treatments have been used on feldspathic ceramic, few studies have investigated the effects of an alternative surface treatment, the association of aluminum oxide sandblasting with Nd:YAG and Er:YAG lasers. Methods: Sixty samples made of a feldspathic ceramic were divided into three groups (n = 20) and treated with (1) controlled-air abrasion with Al(2) O(3) + 10 % hydrofluoric acid (HF), (2) Al(2) O(3) + Er:YAG laser, and (3) Al(2) O(3) + Nd:YAG laser. Afterward, silane (Dentsply) was applied on each treated surface. Each of the three main groups was divided into two subgroups (n = 10), where a different resin cement was employed for each subgroup. It was built a cylinder with resin cement (RelyX Arc) in subgroup (A) and with self-adhesive cement (RelyX U 100) in subgroup (B). After 24 h at 37 degrees C, the prepared specimens were submitted to shear bond strength test and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> to determine the type of failure. Results: Bond strength mean values were not statistically significant for the surface treatment methods or resin cements. Conclusion: The null surface treatment proposed with aluminum oxide sandblasting associated with the Er:YAG or Nd:YAG laser and using cementation with self-adhesive cement can be an alternative bonding technique for feldspathic ceramic, since it was as effective as the conventional treatment with aluminum oxide sandblasting and hydrofluoric acid using the conventional resin cement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{framework}} for virtual reality based training of puncture interventions is presented. The system uses a haptic device with {{six degrees of}} freedom (6 DOF) to enable realistic force sensations during needle insertions into virtual patients. A manifold of different visualization techniques gives new insights into the anatomy of the punctured region. The 3 D effect is enhanced by <b>stereoscopic</b> visualization. An <b>evaluation</b> component rates the quality of virtual punctures to give the user feedback and improvement suggestions. Currently the system supports the training of three different puncture tasks. Two of them have been evaluated in a pilot user study with 55 participants.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} converting con-ventional monocular videos to stereoscopic ones. In the system, an input monocular video is firstly segmented into shots so as to reduce operations on similar frames. An automatic depth estimation method is proposed to compute the depth maps of the video frames utilizing three monocular depth cues – depth-from-defocus, aerial perspective and motion. Foreground/background objects can be interactively segmented on selected key frames and their depth values can be adjusted by users. Such results are propagated from key frames to non-key frames within each video shot. Equipped with a depth-to-disparity conversion module, the system synthesizes the counterpart (either left or right) view for stereoscopic display by warping the original frames according to their disparity maps. The quality of converted videos is evaluated by human mean opinion scores (MOS), and experiment results demonstrate that the proposed conversion method achieves encouraging performance.

40|$|As {{part of the}} 2 nd German Spacelab misssion (D 2) the MOMS- 02 scanner has {{collected}} high-resolution images with 5 m and 14 m ground pixel size. Based on a 3 -line CCD-concept, direct and simultaneous stereo imaging is enabled through nadir, forward, and backward looking CCD lines, that allow to view terrestrial at different aspect angles. Given the known camera position and orientation, the ground position of object points can be determined from MOMS- 02 images within the <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> In extension of current photogrammmetric algorithms a combined approach to orbit determination and photogrammmetric restitution has been developed, which allows the simultaneous adjustment of orbital parameters and ground coordinates. To this end, the spacecraft trajectory and the covariance matrix from the orbit determination process are incorporated into the photogrammetric processing with associated partial derivatives of spacecraft positionwith respect to epoch state and model parameters. Statistically the resulting estimation procedure is equivalent {{to a combination of}} orbit determination and photogrammetric restitution from radio tracking data, 3 -line stereo image data and ground control point information. The first results of this combination applied to the MOMS- 02 experi- ment are presented. To this end MOMS- 02 images and a priori epoch state vector of the space shuttle are combined together with GPS- derived ground control points to estimate a consistent set of ground point coordinates and shuttle orbital parameters. The resulting epoch state vector, that reflects the navigational information content of the MOMS- 02 imagery and GPS control points, is analyzed and compared to the original orbit solution. Conclusions regarding the benefit from the combination of orbit determination and photogrammetric image restitution are drawn...|$|E
40|$|Although several {{conventional}} surface treatments {{have been}} used on feldspathic ceramic, a few studies investigated {{the effects of the}} irradiation with Er: YAG laser using different parameters. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the shear bond strength of a resin cement to feldspathic ceramic, after the application of different surface treatments, especially the irradiation with Er:YAG laser. Forty-two discs made of a feldspathic ceramic were divided into six groups (n = 7) : G 1 : control group - 10 % hydrofluoric acid (HF), G 2 : Air abrasion with Al 2 O 3 + HF; G 3 : Er: YAG laser with 500 mJ/ 4 Hz, G 4 : Er: YAG laser with 500 mJ/ 4 Hz: + HF; G 5 : Er: YAG laser with 400 mJ/ 6 Hz and G 6 : Er:YAG laser with 400 mJ/ 6 Hz + HF. After this, all the specimens were treated with silane, and then a resin cement cylinder was built on the treated ceramic surface. After 24 h at 37 oC, specimens were submitted to the shear bond strenght test and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> to determine the type of failure. The mean bond strength values (MPa) obtained were: G 1 - 17. 55, G 2 - 18. 80, G 3 - 21. 80, G 4 - 12. 62, G 5 - and 15. 81 G 6 - 11. 59. After performing the ANOVA and Tukey's test, it was concluded that the group irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 500 mJ/ 4 Hz performed similarly to the groups that received the conventional treatments, such as hydrofluoric acid etching and the combination of air abrasion plus hydrofluoric acid, and was higher than the other groups irradiated with Er:YAG laser. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the prevalence and causes of unilateral visual impairment {{in the urban}} population of Hyderabad city {{as part of the}} Andhra Pradesh Eye Disease Study. Stratified, random, cluster, systematic sampling was used to select 2, 954 subjects from 24 clusters representative of the population of Hyderabad. Eligible subjects underwent detailed eye examination including logMAR visual acuity, refraction, slitlamp biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, dilatation, cataract grading, and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of fundus. Automated threshold visual fields and slitlamp and fundus photography were done when indicated by standardised criteria. Unilateral visual impairment was defined as presenting distance visual acuity &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 18 in the worse eye and &#x 0026;# 8805; 6 / 12 in the better eye, which was further divided into unilateral blindness (visual acuity &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 60 in the worse eye) and unilateral moderate visual impairment (visual acuity &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 18 - 6 / 60 in the worse eye). A total of 2, 522 subjects (85. 4 &#x 0025; of eligible), including 1, 399 &#x 0026;# 8805; 30 years old, participated in the study. In addition to the 1 &#x 0025; blindness and 7. 2 &#x 0025; moderate visual impairment (based on bilateral visual impairment criteria) reported earlier in this sample, 139 subjects had unilateral visual impairment, an age-gender-adjusted prevalence of 3. 8 &#x 0025; (95 &#x 0025; confidence interval 2. 7 - 4. 9 &#x 0025;). The major causes of this visual impairment 39. 9 &#x 0025; were refractive error (42. 9 &#x 0025;), cataract (14. 4 &#x 0025;), corneal disease (11. 5 &#x 0025;), and retinal disease (11. 2 &#x 0025;). Of this unilateral visual impairment was blindness. The major causes of unilateral blindness were corneal disease (23. 2 &#x 0025;), cataract (22. 5 &#x 0025;), retinal disease (18 &#x 0025;), and optic atrophy (12. 9 &#x 0025;). On the other hand, the predominant cause of unilateral moderate visual impairment was refractive error (67 &#x 0025;) followed by cataract (9 &#x 0025;). Of the total unilateral visual impairment, 34. 3 &#x 0025; was present in those &#x 0026;lt; 30 years old and 36. 2 &#x 0025; in those 30 - 49 years old. Unilateral visual impairment afflicts approximately 1 in 25 persons in this urban population. A large proportion of this unilateral visual impairment is present in younger age groups. The causes of unilateral visual impairment, like those of bilateral visual impairment in this population, are varied, suggesting therefore, that in addition to the current focus of eye care in India predominantly on cataract, other causes of visual impairment need to be addressed as well. </b...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the most}} of {{machining}} processes, chip morphology and microstructure contain deep information about the cutting mechanisms, their evolution and, even, about both {{the process and the}} workpiece. However, usually, changes in the process are related only to changes in the tool morphology and in the surface integrity hiding relevant information. This is commonly due to the chip characterization is not an easy task. In effect, chip geometry and dimensional features are habitually hardly measurable and evaluable. In this work, a methodology for characterizing the chip developed in the dry turning processes of Titanium alloys (Ti 6 Al 4 V - UNS R 56400) has been proposed. This characterization has been achieved by considering different geometrical and dimensional parameters. Thus, shrinkage parameter has been evaluated through the changes in length and compared with the corresponding values determined through variations measured in thickness and width. However, the partially discontinuous form of the Ti chips makes difficult the dimensional <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Stereoscopic</b> Optical Microscopy (SOM) techniques can help to evaluate the chip shrinkage parameter through the measurement of the shear angle. In parallel, SOM techniques can assist for measuring other geometrical parameters of the chip. In this context, the evolution of the shrinkage parameter with the length of machining and the changes of the chip geometry with the cutting parameters (cutting speed and feed) has been also analyzed...|$|R

Methods: A total of 11 786 {{people of all ages}} from 94 clusters representative {{of the population of the}} Indian state of Andhra Pradesh were sampled using a stratified, random, cluster, systematic sampling strategy. These participants underwent a detailed interview and eye examination including measurement of visual acuity with logMAR charts, refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, and <b>stereoscopic</b> dilated fundus <b>evaluation.</b> An eye was considered to have corneal blindness if the visual acuity was < 20 / 200 due to a corneal disease. Results: Of those sampled, 10 293 (87. 3 %) people participated in the study. Corneal blindness in at least one eye was present in 86 participants, an age, sex, and urban-rural distribution adjusted preva-lence of 0. 66 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 49 to 0. 86), which included 0. 10 % prevalence of corneal blindness in both eyes and 0. 56 % in one eye. The most frequent causes of corneal blindness in at least one eye included keratitis during childhood (36. 7 %), trauma (28. 6 %), and keratitis during adulthood (17. 7 %). Nearly 95 % of all corneal blindness was avoidable.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Coil {{embolization}} {{for very}} small aneurysms (< 3 mm in maximum diameter) {{has been considered}} a technically challenging method due to increased risk of potential aneurysm perforation during the procedure. We present our observations about the structural limitations of eight types of microcatheters and three types of detachable coils, and technical pitfalls in the coiling of very small aneurysms. METHODS: The structures of each type of microcatheter and coil were carefully evaluated under a <b>stereoscopic</b> microscope. The <b>evaluation</b> the microcatheters {{was focused on the}} distance between the distal end of the distal marker and the tip of microcatheter. The evaluation of the coils was focused on the length of the detachment zone. RESULTS: With markers of the coil delivery systems and microcatheters aligned under fluoroscopic visualization according to the manufacturers' recommendations, the stiff detachment zones protruded approximately 0. 2 - 1 mm from the microcatheter tip. The lengths of the detachment zone, which is known to be a stiff segment, of the currently available coils were approximately 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm. The distance between the distal end of the distal markers of the microcatheters and the detachment zone of the coil ranged from approximately 1. 2 to 2. 8 mm. CONCLUSION: To prevent rupture of very small aneurysms during coiling, the distal marker of the selected microcatheter should be carefully located near the aneurysm neck, considering all the structural characteristic of the currently available coils and microcatheters. Refinement of currently available devices may be essential to achieve safer coiling of very small aneurysms...|$|R
40|$|A {{dedicated}} multi {{camera system}} {{was developed by}} DLR {{with the objective of}} flap gap observation within the EC funded project AWIATOR of the 5 th frame work programme of the European Commission. Cameras mounted in the aircraft cabin of the Airbus A 340 MSN 1 were focused on targets on the spoiler trailing edge and on the flap. The special flight test requirements set the conditions, which the system had to fulfill. Hence a multi camera system was set up which can operate up to 4 cameras simultaneously all controlled by one PC. The hardware and software was designed for an automatic image acquisition procedure activated by a simple remote start button, which was placed on the test engineer’s desk. In the 1 st Flight Test campaign each of the 4 cameras had its own field of view, which limited the possibilities of the evaluation and analysis of gap width changes. In the 2 nd Flight Test campaign the 4 cameras were used as two <b>stereoscopic</b> systems. The <b>evaluation</b> worked well in spite of the small angle between the optical axes of the stereo cameras of only 9 °. The stereo set up enables the determination of the 3 D position of the targets. With that information absolute distances between spoiler and flap have been measured. Additionally, the translation and rotation of the flap with respect to the spoiler due to different wing loads can be calculated easily. Also the hardware was improved for the 2 nd flight test campaign by adapting the system for the usage of advanced cameras with a higher resolution and sensibility. The improvements of the hardware as well as the application of a stereo system enabled measurements of considerably improved quality. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{first two}} parts of the thesis address the issues related to 3 D video {{transmission}} over wireless networks and proposes cross-layer design techniques to optimise the information exchange between dif- ferent Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers or system blocks. In particular, the first section of this thesis exploits the flexibility of adjusting the checksum coverage length of the transport layer pro- tocol, UDP-lite as opposed to its counterpart UDP. The study pro- poses an optimum checksum coverage length to protect only impor- tant header information of an H. 264 encoded video transmission over wireless links, together with robust header compression (RoHC) and Automatic Retransmission Request (ARQ). The second part of the thesis investigates a content and Channel aware Medium Access Con- trol (MAC) layer scheduling algorithm by considering the layer prior- ities of an H. 264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) encoded 3 D video transmission over an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Ac- cess (OFDMA) based wireless link with a prioritised queuing tech- nique to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end users. A considerable amount of research time was devoted to investigat- ing accurate, consistent and real-time quality evaluation techniques for 3 D image/ video as cross-layer design techniques mostly rely on the quality feedbacks from end users to optimise system parameters. The first quality metric proposed is a stereoscopic image quality met- ric using the disparity histogram of the left and right views. A 3 D <b>stereoscopic</b> video quality <b>evaluation</b> technique is proposed, based on the predominant energy distribution of gradients using 3 D structural tensors in the next section. Finally, a near no reference quality metric is proposed for colour plus depth 3 D video compression and transmis- sion, using the extracted edge information of colour images and depth maps. The research investigates a number of error resilient transmission methods to combat artifacts in 3 D video delivery over wireless chan- nels. A Region-of-Interest (ROI) based transmission method for stereo- scopic videos has been proposed to mark the important areas of the video and provide Unequal Error Protection (UEP) during transmis- sion. Next, we investigate the effects of compression and packet loss on the rendered video quality and propose a model to quantify ren- dering and concealment errors at the sender-side and then use the information generated through the model to effectively deliver 3 D. Finally an asymmetric coding approach is suggested for 3 D medical video transmitted over band limited wireless networks by considering large data rates associated with 3 D medical video as they are usually captured in high resolution and pixel depth.
