40|$|A {{controlled}} oscillator {{system is}} presented for providing an output with a frequency which changes {{with respect to}} time and with a phase which is within established phase error limits. The system includes a frequency synthesizer with a symmetrical <b>search</b> <b>oscillator,</b> capable of tuning the output {{with a range of}} + or - 100 Hz about any fixed frequency to which the synthesizer is set. For a tuning range of 200 Hz (+ or - 100 Hz) an expanded <b>search</b> <b>oscillator</b> output of a frequency range of 4 MHz (from 1 MHz to 5 MHz) is provided. A counter counts continuously the expanded output cycles and at each of fixed sampling intervals, for every 0. 1 second, the count or number accumulated in the counter is read out. The sample number is compared with a theoretical number which should be present in the counter at the particular sampling instant for proper synthesizer's output frequency and phase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” In this paper, we {{consider}} linear programming (LP) and second order cone programming (SOCP) based alternatives to sum of squares (SOS) programming and apply this framework to high-dimensional problems arising in control applications. Despite the wide acceptance of SOS programming {{in the control}} and optimization communities, scalability has been a key challenge due to its reliance on semidefinite programming (SDP) as its main computational engine. While SDPs have many appealing features, current SDP solvers do not approach the scalability or numerical maturity of LP and SOCP solvers. Our approach {{is based on the}} recent work of Ahmadi and Majumdar [1], which replaces the positive semidefiniteness constraint inherent in the SOS approach with stronger conditions based on diagonal dominance and scaled diagonal dominance. This leads to the DSOS and SDSOS cones of polynomials, which can be optimized over using LP and SOCP respectively. We demonstrate this approach on four high dimensional control problems that are currently well beyond the reach of SOS programming: computing a region of attraction for a 22 dimensional system, analysis of a 50 node network of <b>oscillators,</b> <b>searching</b> for degree 3 controllers and degree 8 Lyapunov functions for an Acrobot system (with the resulting controller validated on a hardware platform), and a balancing controller for a 30 state and 14 control input model of the ATLAS humanoid robot. While there is additional conservatism introduced by our approach, extensive numerical experiments on smaller instances of our problems demonstrate that this conservatism can be small compared to SOS programming.
