5000|$|In {{a typical}} hemp system, a [...] "line set" [...] {{consists}} of multiple hemp lines running from a batten above the stage {{up to the}} grid, through loft blocks to a headblock and then down to the fly floor where they are tied off in a group to a belaying pin on the pin rail. The lift lines and hand (operating) lines {{are one and the}} same. Typically, a lift line runs from the <b>sand</b> <b>bag</b> (counterweight) assigned to a specific line set, up to [...] "a single loft block" [...] above the fly floor and back down to the fly floor. A trim clamp (a.k.a. knuckle-buster) or a [...] "Sunday" [...] (a circle of wire rope) is used to attach this sandbag to the [...] "line set" [...] to balance the load placed on the batten. The sandbags are usually filled to weigh the same as the loads, making the two weights (the weight of the batten and the weight of the bag) equal. This arrangement assures greater safety. When the flyman wishes to fly a batten (scenery or lights) [...] "In" [...] (i.e., to the floor), the flyman pulls down on the lift line thereby raising the sandbag off the fly floor and the batten descends. When the flyman wishes to fly the batten [...] "Out", he pulls down on the line set (leaving it tied off) and the batten flies out as the <b>sand</b> <b>bag</b> descends to the flyfloor.

5000|$|The Tanana River valley was {{the first}} area of Alaska to feel the effects of spring flooding.

Fairbanks North Star Borough officials set up a self-serve <b>sand</b> <b>bag</b> station at the Salcha Fairgrounds, and residents near the river erected impromptu levees.

He had been encouraged to box from a young age by his father, who had constructed a <b>sand</b> <b>bag</b> for him to train with. Later his father was jailed for debt, which destroyed Spring's relationship with him. In 1814 Spring met the legendary heavyweight champion Tom Cribb who was staying nearby. Cribb was impressed by Spring's prowess, and persuaded him to go to London under his patronage; this was the beginning of Spring's boxing career. That year, Spring travelled to Mordiford and won a fight in 11 rounds, after which he won a £3 stake.|$|E

They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The Egyptians made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered <b>sand</b> <b>bag</b> was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused [...] The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations.
