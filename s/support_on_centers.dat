50|$|The {{faceplate}} was the {{ancestor of}} lathe chucks, {{an arrangement of}} three or more adjustable 'dogs' bolted to the faceplate providing a primitive chuck arrangement. The smaller plate in the upper photo is specifically a 'dog face' with slots intended to hold a bent tail dog while the work itself was <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> <b>centers.</b> The larger plate to the right simply provides {{a variety of ways}} by which work can be bolted or clamped to the plate. The slotted plate on the lower photo accepts wedged holders which can be used to fasten the work to the plate. The plates were expendibles, so it was not unusual as shown in both photos for a machinist to drill additional holes in the plates for attaching work that could not otherwise be attached. While the Dog plates were usually fairly small regardless of the lathe size, the classic face plate is usually matched to the maximum diameter that the lathe will swing.|$|R

40|$|The model {{presented}} {{in the first part}} of this work is used here to estimate the diameter error in the most common turning operations. In fact, the diameter error is considered as a variable depending on the deflections of the tool, workpiece holder and workpiece, which are considered the main factors responsible for the machining accuracy. The proposed model has been applied to the three most common turning schemes related to workpiece fixturing, where the workpiece is clamped in a chuck, or supported between two centers, or clamped in a chuck at the spindle and <b>supported</b> <b>on</b> a <b>center</b> at the tailstock. Some numerical examples have been computed using the proposed model to predict the diameter error along the workpiece and the cutting force along the workpiece axis, as well as the influence of the cutting force components on the error prediction. The results provide additional insight into error formation in the turning process. Finally, some experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the developed model. Good agreement has been obtained between numerical and experimental results. The proposed model represents a first step towards accuracy control in machining operations and, thus, towards optimization of the manufacturing process...|$|R

Among the most contentious issues is whether change should include the option to purchase public health insurance. Existing cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the Lewin Group and the Urban Institute agree that a public option would reduce overall health care costs in the United States and save the federal government money. The Urban Institute projects savings of $ 47 billion per year (more than $ 400 billion over a decade) to the government and $ 79 billion per year ($ 800 billion over a decade) overall.

40|$|As the {{complexity}} of industrial processes increases, it {{requires the use of}} intelligent sensors or actuators (known as Intelligent Instruments) to allow for more comprehensive and efficient behavior of the system to be monitored. These components achieve some global goal called a service {{through the use of a}} set of ele-mentary actions (internal services). A challenging task in networked intelligent sensors/actuators, is to allow for automated interactions between arbitrary services on networked components. To resolve this task, two suc-cessive problems emerge, first the design of consistent control systems with appropriate knowledge and second the monitoring which concerns the dynamic behavior of such distributed control systems. In this paper, we fo-cus on the first aspect and provide an implementation of a knowledge representation model where services can be structured and related via a mereo-topological ap-proach. The domain ontologies include a system ontol-ogy which is application-dependent, a functional ontol-ogy which relies on teleology and a behavioral mereo-topology extending the functional mereology. To sup-port the behavior representation, we propose a GUI based on a modified existing formalism (DAML-S).
