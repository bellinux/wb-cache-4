40|$|Abstract. Hydraulic {{stretch forming}} {{is a very}} {{important}} technology. Punch press has achieved multi-station automatic processing in the press area, which has greatly improved the efficiency. However, the main domestic <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> is single-stretching hydraulic machine at present. Compared with punch press, hydraulic <b>stretching</b> <b>machines</b> take less space and have better security, but they make less efficiency and have lower degree of automation. Hence, in order to take the advantage of hydraulic <b>stretching</b> <b>machines</b> and enhance the automation level, studies on multi-position automatic <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> occupies an important position. This paper proposes a design scheme of Six-station Automatic Hydraulic <b>Stretching</b> <b>Machine</b> (SAHSM) according to the practical production. The overall 3 D structure of SAHSM is designed based on Solidworks to prove the theoretical possibility of the program. Then modal analysis is operated based on FEA of the key components of <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> module to improve reliability of the product and overcome the disadvantage of the traditional checking method, the first two-order modes are obtained to prove the impossibility of the resonance. At last, ADAMS-based virtual prototype is analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the SAHSM dynamic design proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{discrete}} clamp <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> based on flexible holding technology was developed to improve the performance of traditional rigid clamp <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> used for double-curvature metal sheet forming, and its forming characters were illuminated simply. The FE model of flexible discrete clamp stretch forming was set up, and extensive numerical simulations of spherical parts for both the flexible holding mode and the rigid holding mode were carried out by dynamic explicit finite element analysis. The numerical {{results show that the}} distribution of stress, strain and thickness were well-proportioned in the flexible holding mode. The larger the spherical radius is, the smaller the minimum transitional length of sheet metal is. The transitional length of 60 mm is suitable for flexible discrete clamp stretch forming in the case of considering the forming quality and material utilization. Then, the stretch forming experiment proves that the flexible holding technology is feasible, and the error contrast illustrates the {{new type of}} discrete clamp <b>stretch</b> forming <b>machine</b> is practicable...|$|R

To this end, the balloons prepared under different processing conditions are characterized in terms of mechanical properties. An ideal process condition is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Biaxially {{oriented}} polypropylene {{films are}} widely used for food packaging and industrial films. Recently, machine speed has been increasing {{in order to obtain}} higher production rate, and film thickness has become thinner to reduce the environmental load. The customers' requirements for better production ability and thinner films have been becoming more demanding, but their demands are not always met because of lack of film stretchability in the final product. To meet the demands, research on stretchability has been conducted with the goal of finding the optimum polypropylene molecular structure for developing a new product by analyzing stretching force-strain data using a table tenter, which was thought to be the parameter of stretchability. It was found that low crystallinity and wide molecular weight distribution were effective in improving the stretchability from the table tenter test. By running the test with a sequential and biaxially oriented <b>stretching</b> <b>machine,</b> it was verified that samples produced by the above designed polymer indicated good thickness uniformity, which was considered to be the barometer of stretchability. Furthermore, it was concluded that analyzing the stretching force-strain data obtained from a table tenter is a good method to predict machine speed and film thickness. © 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceIn this article, the {{development}} of an industrial prototype for manufacturing aeronautical fuselage panels is investigated. Deep drawing of large components such as aircraft fuselage panels is not an easy task in terms of dimensional accuracy, reliable material behaviour laws and failure criteria. Hot stretching processes ensure large ductility range of some materials. Nevertheless, when using high-performance aluminium alloys with acceptable low-plastic strain at ambient temperature, cold forming might be employed. A special <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> of 40 -ton (400 kN) capability was instrumented and piloted in that way. Typical operations involved in the forming of parts are carried out with a die on which the sheet metal is successively stretched and drawn in several steps. Currently, the shape of the forming tool is directly determined from CAD models of the final sheet geometry without taking into account springback or residual effects. To increase the dimensional accuracy of the final components, a methodology to define the die shape and to control the process is proposed, taking into account the parameters influencing the forming operations. A feedback loop based on digitalised physical geometry and numerical simulation is carried out {{in order to ensure that}} the final shape of the sheet will be accurately obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} {{automation}} in leather industry is quite low. This fact is mainly due to the particular features {{of this kind of}} material (non-rigid structure, irregular shape, delicate surface, etc.) that make the handling on the workstations very critical and difficult to be approached. This proposal concerns a system for the robotized manipulation of plies, made of natural leather, in order to perform fully automated loading and unloading operations on finishing <b>machines</b> (painting, <b>stretching</b> <b>machines,</b> etc.). The system is mainly formed by a 4 -axis robot, equipped with a special gripper, and an innovative spreading device used to place the grasped ply on a planar surface. The gripper has been designed in order to securely grasp different sizes of plies and different leathers. The grasping elements, formed by properly designed vacuum cups, have been developed according to a theoretical approach aimed at determining the optimal dimension of the vacuum area, in function of the porosity of the leather. The gripper moves the ply grasping it on a central area of its upper surface, determining the falling down of its borders due to the gravity. The spreader device is then used to spread the ply in order to correctly lay it on the conveyor belts of a processing machine...|$|R

40|$|The mechano-optical {{behavior}} of PET is, {{for the first}} time, investigated under temporally varying rates to influence the basic mechanisms of structural organization leading to strain-induced crystallization. For this purpose, four rate profiles, Linear, Sigmoidal, Logarithmic and Exponential, were chosen and films were stretched in Uniaxial Constrained Width mode using newly developed biaxial <b>stretching</b> <b>machine.</b> This machine allows real time direct measure of true stresses, strains, in-plane and out-of-plane birefringences during the deformation. Substantial differences in the mechano-optical behavior and resulting structural mechanism were observed {{in all of the}} chosen rate profiles. Linear profile, taken as a standard, yields three stress-optical regimes (SOR) during deformation. At early stages of deformation the birefringence remains linear with stress and material remains amorphous. This is designated as Regime I representing classical stress-optical behavior observed in large number of non-crystallizable polymers. In Regime II, a fast increase of birefringence accompanies formation of crystalline structure with establishment of long-range connected network. In the final Regime III birefringence levels off as the chains approach their finite extensibilities. All three regimes observed in Linear profile are also observed in Logarithmic and Exponential cases. However, Sigmoidal deformation shows only the first two regimes even though the film was stretched to the same total engineering strain as applied to all profiles. Logarithmic profile was found to induce early strain crystallization leading to early development of strain hardening. Exponential profile on the other hand retards the formation of ‘‘potentially constraining’’ long-range physical networks. This allowed the development of higher birefringence and crystallinity levels using this mode. A logarithmic birefringenceework relationship with two distinct stages was found to apply to all temporally varying profiles...|$|R

To assess to the effect of different type of inorganic particles (with different interaction with the polymeric matrix) in the deformation behaviour of PET composites, particles such as aluminium, bronze, nanoclay, graphite and mica, were used. Two types of processing methods, ensuring a good mixing, were adopted for the composite preparation: i) melt-blending in an asymmetric batch mini-mixer followed by compression and ii) melt-blending in a twin screw extruder followed by injection moulding. The structural and mechanical behaviours of neat PET and its composites were evaluated during uniaxial stretching at temperatures above the glass transition temperature, Tg, namely at 85, 90, 95, 100 ºC, using a standard tensile <b>stretching</b> <b>machine</b> equipped with an environmental chamber. This study aims at understanding the deformation behaviour of the materials at temperatures found in conventional transformation methods used for packaging. To interpret the structural evolution occurring in the samples, off-line techniques such as DSC, WAXD and SEM were used. A detailed structural evolution was accomplished by applying different stretching ratios to the samples up to a maximum of 5 x. Injection moulded samples were also characterized for their mechanical properties at room temperature in order to assess the materials behaviour in service. 	From all particles studied the PET/Aluminium and PET/Bronze composites are the ones showing the best combination of aesthetic effects, deformation behaviour and final mechanical properties. Comparing to neat PET, their general properties are the same during the deformation process making the new materials suitable for conventional processing techniques. It was found that both particles offer superior molecular mobility to PET at room temperature. In other words, these composites present a higher deformation capacity, however its elastic modulus and tensile strength at yield are slightly reduced...|$|R
