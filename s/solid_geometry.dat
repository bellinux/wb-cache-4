25|$|Since Euclid, {{geometry}} {{had meant}} {{the geometry of}} Euclidean space of two dimensions (plane geometry) or of three dimensions (<b>solid</b> <b>geometry).</b> In {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, Möbius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical physicists that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.|$|E
50|$|Rational {{trigonometry}} is {{a proposed}} reformulation of metrical planar and <b>solid</b> <b>geometries</b> (which includes trigonometry) by Canadian mathematician Norman J. Wildberger, currently {{an associate professor}} of mathematics at the University of New South Wales. His ideas are set out in his 2005 book Divine Proportions: Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry. According to New Scientist, part of his motivation for an alternative to traditional trigonometry was to avoid some problems that occur when infinite series are used in mathematics. Rational trigonometry avoids direct use of transcendental functions like sine and cosine by substituting their squared equivalents. Wildberger draws inspiration from mathematicians predating Georg Cantor's infinite set-theory, like Gauss and Euclid, who he claims were far more wary of using infinite sets than modern mathematicians. To date, rational trigonometry is largely unmentioned in mainstream mathematical literature.|$|R

25|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} is {{a mathematical}} system {{attributed to the}} Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid {{was the first to}} show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the <b>solid</b> <b>geometry</b> of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd century BC, {{the premier}} center of {{mathematical}} {{education and research}} was the Musaeum of Alexandria. It was there that Euclid (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The Elements introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most {{of the contents of}} the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today. In addition to the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry, the Elements was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such as number theory, algebra and <b>solid</b> <b>geometry,</b> including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid also wrote extensively on other subjects, such as conic sections, optics, spherical geometry, and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive.|$|E
25|$|The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, {{the title}} of which first {{appeared}} by 179 AD on a bronze inscription, was edited and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician Liu Hui from the Kingdom of Cao Wei. This book included many problems where geometry was applied, such as finding surface areas for squares and circles, the volumes of solids in various three-dimensional shapes, and included {{the use of the}} Pythagorean theorem. The book provided illustrated proof for the Pythagorean theorem, contained a written dialogue between of the earlier Duke of Zhou and Shang Gao on the properties of the right angle triangle and the Pythagorean theorem, while also referring to the astronomical gnomon, the circle and square, as well as measurements of heights and distances. The editor Liu Hui listed pi as 3.141014 by using a 192 sided polygon, and then calculated pi as 3.14159 using a 3072 sided polygon. This was more accurate than Liu Hui's contemporary Wang Fan, a mathematician and astronomer from Eastern Wu, would render pi as 3.1555 by using 142⁄45. Liu Hui also wrote of mathematical surveying to calculate distance measurements of depth, height, width, and surface area. In terms of <b>solid</b> <b>geometry,</b> he figured out that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a tetrahedral wedge. He also figured out that a wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid. Furthermore, Liu Hui described Cavalieri's principle on volume, as well as Gaussian elimination. From the Nine Chapters, it listed the following geometrical formulas that were known {{by the time of the}} Former Han Dynasty (202 BCE9 CE).|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of flows involving moving boundaries are challenging {{as they need}} to address the location and the conditions of the interface that interacts with the flow field. We have developed a unified, marker-based approach, which can treat moving solid and multiphase fluid dynamics using adaptively refined Cartesian grids. The interfaces separating the fluid phases are modeled using a continuous interface method, while the noslip condition on solid interfaces is imposed by a sharp interface method. A smoothly varying Heaviside-like function is used for handling discontinuous material properties between fluids and for identifying the solid-fluid interface location. Furthermore, a distance-based formulation is adopted to treat solid-fluid interface intersections. A domain decomposition method via Hilbert space filling curves and preconditioned multigrid solvers are incorporated into the staggered grid arrangement for scalar and velocity variables. To highlight the performance of the present approach, case studies are conducted for (i) interface shapes, residual volumes, formation of sloshes and corresponding wave periods in draining tank with different control parameters and flow regimes, (ii) fluid dynamics around a flapping airfoil, and (iii) fluid flow around complex <b>solid</b> <b>geometries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fluid-solid {{coupling}} typically plays {{a negligible}} role in confined converging shocks in gases {{because of the}} rigidity of the surrounding material and large acoustic impedance mismatch of wave propagation {{between it and the}} gas.

In shock focusing in water confined in a <b>solid</b> convergent <b>geometry,</b> the shock in the liquid transmits to the solid and both transverse and longitudinal waves propagate in the solid. Shock focusing in water for three types of confinement materials has been studied experimentally with schlieren and photoelasticity optical techniques.
