25|$|Structural {{analysis}} is mainly concerned with finding out {{the behavior of}} a physical structure when subjected to force. This action can be in the form of load due to the weight of things such as people, furniture, wind, snow, etc. or some other kind of excitation such as an earthquake, shaking of the ground due to a blast nearby, etc. In essence all these loads are dynamic, including the <b>self-weight</b> of the structure because {{at some point in time}} these loads were not there. The distinction is made between the dynamic and the static analysis on the basis of whether the applied action has enough acceleration in comparison to the structure's natural frequency. If a load is applied sufficiently slowly, the inertia forces (Newton's first law of motion) can be ignored and the analysis can be simplified as static analysis.|$|E

Design: Data were collected in two national surveys conducted a month apart, one using the 'weighted' measure and the other an 'unweighted' version of the UK oral health-related quality-of-life measure. In addition, sociodemographic and self-reported oral health status were recorded. Results: The UK oral health-related quality-of-life measure discriminated between groups based on age group (< 65, 65 and older) and social class (higher and lower) irrespective of the version of the questionnaire used. Both versions also showed significant associations with self-reported oral health: denture status (P < 0. 01) and number of teeth possessed (P < 0. 01). In addition, both versions demonstrated predictive ability in identifying those in prosthetic need (< 20 teeth and without recourse to a denture, P < 0. 01). Conclusion: Weighting the UK oral health-related quality-of-life instrument does not improve the psychometric properties of the instrument and thus raises questions about the value of <b>self-weighting</b> at an item level. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2004. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical method}} providing accurate unstrained lengths of all structural elements is proposed {{to find the}} optimized initial state of self-anchored suspension bridges under dead loads.

Furthermore, {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the simplified analytical method, the unstrained element length method (ULM) is applied to suspension bridge models based on the unstressed lengths of both cable and frame members calculated from the analytical method. Through numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the proposed analytical method can indeed provide an optimized initial solution by showing that both the simplified method and the nonlinear FE procedure lead to practically identical initial configurations with only localized small bending moment distributions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new {{functional}} of the domain, {{to be used}} in shape and topology optimization problems as a means to enforce the manufacturability of structures by additive manufacturing processes. Instead of considering merely the final shape, it aggregates objective functions (like compliance) for all the intermediate structures of the shape appearing in the course of its layer by layer assembly and subject to their <b>self-weights.</b> We compute its shape derivative and implement it into a shape and topology optimization algorithm based on the level set method. It turns out that this class of constraint functional is very costly to evaluate, due to the large number of successive layers required to build the final shape (each of them requiring a finite element analysis). Therefore, we introduce an interpolation algorithm which significantly accelerates the computational effort. The main idea is to build a piecewise affine approximation of the cost function and of its shape derivative by using the derivative of the elastic displacement with respect to the height of the intermediate structure (this is another application of the concept of shape derivative).

The underlying aims defining the process behind the NFNAP are: (1) evaluation of existing data; (2) identification of Key Foods and nutrients for analysis; (3) development of nationally based sampling plans; (4) analysis of samples; and (5) compilation and calculation of representative food composition data. Supported by a <b>self-weighting</b> stratified sampling design, the NFNAP approach has been applied to other sampling programs for the analysis of specific nutrients (e. g., fluoride-containing beverages and foods) and ethnic foods (e. g., American Indian foods). For select nutrients of potential health significance, additional sampling approaches allow for the estimation of serving-to-serving variability (e. g., highly processed foods). Under NFNAP, over 500 foods of the targeted 1000 important foods in the US food supply have been analyzed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{statistical sampling}} approaches for regional soil monitoring, a design-based, a model-based and a hybrid approach. In the model-based approach a space-time model is exploited to predict global statistical parameters of interest {{such as the}} space-time mean. In the hybrid approach this model is a time-series model of the spatial means. In the design-based approach no model is used: estimates are model-free. Full design-based inference requires that both sampling locations and times are selected by probability sampling, whereas the hybrid approach requires probability sampling of locations only. In a case study on soil eutrophication and acidification, a rotational panel design was implemented with probability sampling of locations and non-probability sampling of times. The hybrid and model-based predictions of the space-time means and trend of the mean for pH and ammonium at three depths in the soil profile were very similar. For pH the standard errors of the space-time means were about equal, but for ammonium the full model-based predictor was more precise than the hybrid predictor. For soil monitoring I advocate the selection of sampling locations by probability sampling so that the statistical inference approach is flexible. Selecting locations by a <b>self-weighting</b> probability sampling design ensures that the model-based predictor is not affected by selection bias...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP) was {{implemented}} in 1997 as a collaborative food composition research effort between USDA and NIH. The {{goal of this}} program is to obtain nationally representative estimates of the nutritional components of important foods consumed in the US {{for inclusion in the}} USDA National Nutrient Databank System; to date, analytical food composition data generated for over 1800 foods have vastly improved overall data quality in the database. The NFNAP sampling approach was updated in 2001 using 2000 US Census data and recently updated to use 2010 Census population estimates. This design, like the 2001 design, employs a three-stage, stratified, probability-proportional-to-size (PPS) sample selection process; 1) county selection (based on population density); 2) supermarket outlets within selected counties (based on annual sales); and 3) specific brands of foods (based on market share data). In the first stage, Census regions (4), divisions and states were used to obtain a <b>self-weighting</b> sample of population centres, ensuring geographic dispersion across the 48 conterminous states; 48 locations were selected, with nested subsets of 24, 12 and 6 locations. Due to demographic changes in the population and congressional redistricting it was necessary to revise the sampling scheme to reflect these changes. With the increased penetration of warehouse-type retail outlets into the grocery industry, the sampling frame must be adjusted to include these purchase locations. Food samples which are collected nationally according to a statistically rigorous sampling approach are consistent with national representativeness and allow better estimates of the mean and variability than convenience sampling or less rigorous options...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{people of}} any age are {{susceptible}} to HIV, youths aged 15 – 24 face disproportionate risk of contracting it because of challenges that they face with regard to correct HIV and AIDS related knowledge, attitudes and practices. This study was aimed at determining whether HIV and AIDS can be fought by targeting interventions at youths aged 15 – 24 years by assessing their current knowledge, attitudes and sexual behaviours in Zambia.   Methods: The study utilised secondary data from a <b>self-weighting</b> nationally representative sample of the 2009 Zambia Sexual Behaviour Survey. Results: Generally correct comprehensive knowledge is very low among youths (43 percent). This is in spite having good command of general and full general knowledge and the ABCs of HIV and AIDS prevention. Attitudes towards PLHIV, Condom use and HIV counselling and testing were negative. About one third (58 percent) of youths in Zambia {{have a history of}} early sexual debut (sex before age 15) with more females (64 percent) than males (51 percent) having hard sex. Male youths {{were more likely to have}} used a condom with most recent sexual partner as compared to females (AOR= 0. 265, 95 %CI: 0. 160, 0. 438; p< 0. 001).

Conclusions: Therefore, it can be seen lack of comprehensive correct knowledge, gender disparities, poor educational levels, youth’s age and place of residence are some of the contributing factors that may hinder the fight against HIV/AIDS among youths in Zambia.

40|$|The {{sampling}} design adopted {{for the study}} was a two-stage <b>self-weighting</b> design in which the first stage units were Census Enumerator Sub-Districts (ESDs) or their equivalents and the second stage were households. The sampling frame was drawn up {{on the basis of}} small clearly demarcated area units, each with a population estimate. In the sample design chosen, the area stage units were selected with probability proportional to size, based on the census population. Systematic sampling was used throughout, that is, sampling at a fixed interval in a list of ESDs, beginning at a randomly selected starting point. To ensure that the racial and geographic breakdown approximated the national population distribution, the area stage units (ESDs) were listed by statistical region and within the statistical region by urban or rural. Within these sub-statistical regions, the ESDs were then listed in order of percentage African. The sampling interval for the selection of the ESDs was obtained by dividing the 1991 ensus population of 38 120 853 by the 360 clusters to be selected. This yielded 105 800. Starting at a randomly selected point, every 105 800 th person down the cluster list was selected. In the second sampling stage the unit of analysis was the household. In selected ESD a listing or enumeration of households was carried out by means of a field operation. From the households listed in an ESD a sample of households was selected by systematic sampling. Even though the ultimate enumeration unit was the household, in most cases "stands" were used as enumeration units. However, when a stand was chosen as the enumeration unit all households on that stand had to be interviewed. The latest census population data, however, was available only for 1991. An assumption on population growth was thus made to obtain an approximation of the population size for 1993, the year of the survey. The sampling interval {{at the level of the}} household was determined in the following way: Based on the decision to have a take of 125 individuals on average pe cluster (i. e. assuming five members per household to give an average cluster size of 25 households), the interval of households to be selected was determined as the census population divided by 118. 1, i. e. allowing for population growth since the census...|$|R
