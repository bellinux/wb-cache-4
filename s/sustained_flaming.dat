50|$|Large {{differences}} exist in opening directions {{to be tested}} (EN requires both sides to be tested, UL one side only), permitted wall types (EN lists 3 types of walls, whereas UL does not differ at all), surface temperatures permitted (UL measures the first 30 minutes only, whereas EN the full duration of the test) and <b>sustained</b> <b>flaming</b> allowances (EN no flaming, UL several types and durations allowed). Another major difference is {{the treatment of the}} exchangeability of components such as locks, hinges, and frame types. The EN standard basically requires each combination to be tested as a whole, where as UL is satisfied with the single component being tested independently from the door assembly. Further the EN standard differs in its treatment of the extension of dimensions from the UL standard. EN allows for only limited dimensional extensions, but requires in such cases a surplus of test time and better gap values. Whereas the UL Standard does not allow an increase of the dimension of the tested door, you can decrease the dimension without any restriction. Last but not least, UL requires {{at the end of the}} fire exposure a hose stream test, where water from a hose is directed to the tested assembly. No water shall penetrate and the door shall withstand the impact. The EN standard does not mention anything similar.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative {{correlations}} between ground upward flammability tests and flammability testing in microgravity indicate that NASA STD 6001 Test 1 provides conservative results by <b>sustaining</b> <b>flaming</b> combustion in less severe environ-ments {{than those in}} which extinguishment occurs in quiescent microgravity environments. The upward flammabil-ity test is conducted in the most severe flaming combustion environment expected in the spacecraft. Its passifail test logic does not allow a precise quantitative comparison with other ground or microgravity materials flammability test results. Thus, although reasonable from a flammability safety point of view, the test is likely to eliminate materials that may be safe for use on spacecraft. A different test logic is suggested to address these impediments: one to determine materials self-extingnishment limits. Data to support this approach are presented, including self-extin-guishment limits in concurrent and countercurrent flows and under quiescent conditions. The proposed method will allow continued use of existing NASA flammability data and make possible quantitative {{correlations between}} ground testing and microgravity test results. These correlations will improve the aerospace materials selection process and allow realistic estimates of spacecraft fire extinguishment requirements. Theoretical analyses of flaming combustion will also be possible, leading {{to a better understanding}} of materials combustion. This will benefit not only the aerospace community but also the combustion community at large...|$|R
50|$|A {{wildfire}} {{front is}} the portion <b>sustaining</b> continuous <b>flaming</b> combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both {{the surrounding air}} and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 C. Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 C releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 C or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 C. Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 C, which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below.|$|R
30|$|Bench-scale {{methods used}} for {{generating}} toxic effluents from polyurethane foams {{have met with}} controversy. Some methods have proved incapable of properly replicating the most toxic under-ventilated fire condition, where the yields of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide are greatest, while other methods have shown good correlation with large scale test data. Bench-scale methods used for generation of toxic fire effluents ideally should be capable of reproducing individual fire stages or combustion conditions, for input into models of combustion toxicity. Full-scale fires simultaneously involve different fire stages in different places, which are changing with time. However, bench-scale methods which allow the combustion conditions to change during the test are {{much more difficult to}} relate to full-scale fires, because the duration of each condition is unknown, and the behaviour of fires changes on scale-up. Most bench-scale methods have non-constant combustion conditions, such as those in closed chambers exposed to a constant source of heat, including the smoke density chamber (SDC) (ISO 5659 – 2 2012), and static tube furnace tests, such as the NF X 70 – 100 (2006). Those with constant combustion conditions are more suited to producing data suitable for comparison and modelling: the steady state tube furnace (SSTF) (ISO/TS 19700 2013) has been specifically designed to achieve this. Intermediate between these two approaches are those that can produce quasi-steady combustion conditions, such as the cone calorimeter (ISO 5660 – 1 2002) with non-standardised controlled atmosphere attachment (CACC), and the fire propagation apparatus (FPA) (ISO 12136 2011). The difficulty of replicating the conditions of fully developed under-ventilated flaming on a bench-scale is caused by several practical problems. ϕ depends on the mass loss rate of the specimen and the available air; for most methods one or both are unknown; ϕ will be increased by an unknown factor if products are recirculated into the flame zone. Apparatus where ϕ changes rapidly allow little time for sampling and measurement of mass loss and effluent composition at a specific value of ϕ, with resultant errors and uncertainties. Progressive changes in the composition of a static specimen (for example due to char formation) provide additional complexity. In a compartment fire, the reactions of under-ventilated flaming occur in both the flame zone and in the hot upper layer. Only the SSTF has a heated reaction zone which replicates the hot layer. The applied heat flux must be large enough for burning to continue at oxygen concentrations as low as 5  %. In some bench-scale apparatus the heat flux is constant, and often insufficient to <b>sustain</b> <b>flaming</b> at such low oxygen concentrations; further, an unknown quantity of fresh air bypasses the fire plume, so the ventilation condition, and hence ϕ, remains undefined. Some fire models, such as the cone calorimeter, fire propagation apparatus and smoke density chamber use the temperature of the radiant heater to preselect the radiant heat flux, and then check this using a radiant heat flux meter. Others, such as the NF X 70 – 100, and the ISO/TS 19700 SSTF use the furnace temperature setting to ensure a consistent radiant heat flux. The radiant heat flux in the ISO/TS 19700 apparatus has been measured (Stec et al. 2008) and is 40  kW m− 2 in the centre of the furnace at 650  °C and 78  kW m− 2 at 825  °C. Each method is described briefly in the following section.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{degradation}} of chemically treated plywood of Shorea parvifolia as the facing material in timber stud partition was investigated. The plywoods {{were treated with}} Dricon, Monoammonium Phosphate, Diammonium Phosphate and mixture of Borax and Boric Acid at 20 % concentration. The cavity of the partition was filled with fibre insulating material. The fire resistance of the partitions was evaluated using 1. 5 m by 1. 5 m gas-fired furnace following the standard temperature-time curve set by the British Standard, BS 476 : Part 22 : 1987. The rating measures the integrity-ability to withstand collapse or <b>sustained</b> <b>flaming</b> and the insulation-ability to prevent excessive increase of temperature. In this study the best fire resistance rating time based on integrity failure was the partition using Shorea parvifolia plywood treated with Dricon (118 min.) followed by Diammonium Phosphate (116 min.), Monoammonium Phosphate (109 min.) and Borax and Boric Acid (97 min.) respectively.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{mechanisms of}} fires are complex. To predict {{the conditions for}} extinguishment, the combustion chemistry combined with thermodynamics and fluid dynamics should be described in detail. Several concepts have been proposed for prediction of extinguishment. The critical concentration of a fire suppressant has been widely used, and in some practical applications a minimum concentration of Oxygen in the fire atmosphere has been applied. However, these methods have limitations in their applicability to practical life, {{and in many cases}} large safety factors have been adopted to cover uncertainties. SINTEF has a long record of experiments with water based fire suppression systems, including water mist. Based on these experiments, an empirical model based on the concentration of Oxygen and the temperature in the fire atmosphere has been developed. The paper proposes a correlation between these parameters, leading to a limit for <b>sustained</b> <b>flaming</b> fire. The correlation is based on experiments in a 30 m 3 compartment, with gaseous, liquid an...|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} function, construction, geometry, and {{materials}} used in soft furnishings differ, {{there are a few}} general similarities with respect to their flammability. For example, all soft furnishing products have a supporting frame, cushioning layers, and an outer covering fabric; each of which is generally flammable to some extent. Fiber chemistry has a strong influence on the flammability behavior of a given component. For example, upon exposure to an ignition source, the outer covering fabric could ignite, char, or melt. The formation of a smoldering char may cause localized heating of the underlying components, resulting in thermal degradation of the foam and the release of volatile gases. These volatiles can ignite and support <b>sustained</b> <b>flaming</b> until all the combustible materials have been consumed. Flammability processes can be improved by preventing or delaying the ignition process using a technology that prevents thermal penetration (e.g., fire barrier material) or more thermally stable cushioning material. A melting covering fabric is another potential alternative to prevent ignition if the melting fabric self-extinguishes as it shrinks away from the ignition source. This requires a low heat release with no other easily ignitable materials on the surface. This route can be desirable to manufacturers since many lower cost fabrics have this ‘melt-shrinking’ characteristic. Since this type of covering fabric provides resistance against smoldering ignition but not against open flame, other fire retarding technology will be necessary (e.g., barrier materials and/or FR foam).|$|E

3000|$|The fire retardancy {{test was}} {{conducted}} {{according to the}} standard of International Organization for Standardization IS 05660 - 1 using CONE [9]. In the CONE, a 100 -mm square specimen was exposed to a constant external heating flux. All the tests were conducted at an irradiance level of 50  kW/m 2. All specimens were tested in the horizontal orientation. To prevent the side effects, side and back surfaces of specimen were covered with aluminum foil paper. After wrapping, the wrapped specimen shall {{be placed in the}} specimen holder and covered by a retainer frame (The size of the heating surface was 94  mm ×  94  mm). The distance between the bottom surface of the cone heater and the top of all specimens is 25  mm. The heating surface of the treated samples was coated with resin surface.
