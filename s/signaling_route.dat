However, the signaling link between cellular stress and mitochondrial proapoptotic activity of p 66 (Shc) was not known. We demonstrate that protein kinase C beta, activated by oxidative conditions in the cell, induces phosphorylation of p 66 Shc and triggers mitochondrial accumulation of the protein after it is recognized by the prolyl isomerase Pin 1. Once imported, p 66 (Shc) causes alterations of mitochondrial Ca 2 + responses and three-dimensional structure, thus inducing apoptosis.

Muscle activity leads to major swings in mitochondrial [Ca 2 +], which control aerobic metabolism, cell death, and survival pathways. We investigated in vivo the effects of mitochondrial Ca 2 + homeostasis in skeletal muscle function and trophism by overexpressing or silencing the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). The results demonstrate that in both developing and adult muscles, MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake has a marked trophic effect that {{does not depend on}} aerobic control but impinges on two major hypertrophic pathways of skeletal muscle, PGC- 1 α 4 and IGF 1 -Akt/PKB. In addition, MCU overexpression protects from denervation-induced atrophy.

40|$|AbstractThe potent neurotoxin kainate {{activates}} ion channel-forming receptors. However, it {{can also}} activate a G protein-coupled signaling pathway to inhibit transmitter release in central neurons. It remains unclear whether the same receptor complex is involved in both signaling activities. Here we show that in a population of dorsal root ganglion cells, exposure to kainate elicits a G protein-dependent increase in intracellular Ca 2 +. Furthermore, in these cells a brief exposure to kainate inhibited the K+-induced Ca 2 + increase, a process that was sensitive to the G protein inhibitor Pertussis toxin and inhibitors of protein kinase C. This metabotropic action did not require ion channel activity and was not observed in neurons prepared from mice deficient for the ion channel-forming subunit GluR 5. These results indicate that GluR 5, an ion channel-forming subunit, signals through a second messenger cascade, inhibiting voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels. Thus, such a system represents a noncanonical <b>signaling</b> <b>route</b> of ion channel-forming receptors...|$|E

The subtle changes in the dynamics and conformations of Ras upon effector binding require an analysis that targets local changes independent of global motions. Using a structural alphabet, a computational procedure is proposed to quantify local conformational changes. Positions detected by this approach were characterized as either specific for a particular effector, specific for an effector domain type, or as effector unspecific.

To understand the molecular determinants of the hypertrophic response and to achieve future rational drug design to treat heart failure, investigation currently focuses on identifying and characterizing intracellular signal transduction pathways in the heart.

40|$|In {{multicellular}} organisms {{control over}} organ {{size and shape}} is of utter importance. However, the regulation of control is rather complex. An involved <b>signalling</b> <b>route</b> is the Hippo pathway. In this review, the core cascade and downstream target of the Hippo pathway will be discussed. The first components of the pathway, Warts, Salvador, Hippo and Mats, were discovered {{in a search for}} tumour suppressors in the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster). The downstream target is the transcription co-activator Yorkie (YKI), which targets many genes implicated in proliferation and apoptosis. These processes are involved in growth control. Deregulation can, therefore, result in severe effects, such as tumourigenesis. Furthermore, the upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway will be disclosed. Various factors are shown to regulate the Hippo pathway core kinases and/or Yorkie. The vastness of the upstream regulators is required for tissue, timing and organism specificity. In order for the Hippo pathway to affect the overall tissue, communication between cells is necessary. Therefore, cell-cell interactions are required to tightly control and modulate Hippo activity between neighbouring cells. Cross talk between the Hippo pathway and other mechanisms is necessary to coordinate the complex development and homeostasis of tissue size, shape and patterning. Taken together, the Hippo pathway is important for processes, such as proliferation and apoptosis. Even though, the regulation of the pathway is understood more and more, research is required to elucidate the <b>signalling</b> <b>route</b> even further. Since deregulation of the pathway can result in tumour formations, better understanding of the pathway could help better understand tumour development and progression.

40|$|G-CSF is {{the most}} {{important}} growth factor involved in the production of neutrophilic granulocytes. Signaling routes activated upon ligand binding to the G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) control survival, proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells towards mature neutrophils. Elucidation of the signaling pathways involved in this process is important for understanding normal neutrophil development and for better insights in diseases with perturbed neutrophil production such as neutropenia and myeloid leukemia. In Chapter 1 of this thesis an overview of the current knowledge on the G-CSF-R is given and the signaling pathways activated by G-CSF are introduced. Upon GCSF binding, kinases of the JAK and Src kinase families become active and the four tyrosines of the receptor, located at positions 704, 729, 744 and 764 are phosphorylated. Multiple signaling pathways are subsequently activated via recruitment of intermediates to these phosphorylated tyrosines as well as via tyrosine independent mechanisms. A well known <b>signaling</b> <b>route</b> activated by the G-CSF-R is the JAK-STAT pathway.

Fyn is also able to stimulate the ERK/MAPK pathway in primary T cells but has little influence on the mobilization of Ca 2 +. Only Lck efficiently stimulates production of diacylglycerol and therefore RasGRP 1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of Shc, suggesting that Fyn activates ERK via a different upstream <b>signaling</b> <b>route.</b> Finally, we show that signals through Lck are essential for the development of T-cell-effector potential, particularly for effective cytokine transcription...|$|E
