The <b>sliding</b> <b>guide</b> (2) {{is a very important}} component in this study. The shape of this guide has a relation with the circular shape of the cutting tool (4). The cutting tool makes an adjustable circular movement with the cutting tool holder following the <b>sliding</b> <b>guide</b> (2). The <b>sliding</b> <b>guide</b> (1) gives linear movement freedom to the cutting tool holder when it follows the <b>sliding</b> <b>guide</b> (2). Identification of this relation and the EMCS parts were designed by Solidworks® commercial design software.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Through {{analyzing}} the structure feature of long oblique strip and requirement of machining precision, We {{introduce a new}} means of planing {{to ensure the quality}} of work-piece. By studying process feature of long oblique strip, Give the method of designing clamping apparatus for planing. Preface In mechanical structure, oblique strip is generally used to adjust fit clearance of dovetail <b>slide</b> <b>guide</b> of machine tool to assure motion precision of <b>slide</b> <b>guide</b> and prolong its service life. Oblique strip has a very small angle as well as work-piece is thin and long, so it is difficult to be clamped and easy to deform during process. Therefore, oblique strip is very difficult to planing. 1. Structure feature and processing requirements of oblique strip As shown in Figure 1, 100 oblique strip parts are processed...|$|R
50|$|The {{strain of}} side loading can be {{directly}} reduced {{with the use of}} internal stop tubes which reduce the maximum extension length, leaving some distance between the piston and bore seal, and increasing leverage to resist warping of the seals. Double pistons also spread out the forces of side loading while also reducing stroke length. Alternately, external <b>sliding</b> <b>guides</b> and hinges can support the load and reduce side loading forces applied directly on the cylinder.|$|E
30|$|Shearing is {{a widely}} used process in the sheet metal {{industry}} and has been extensively studied to increase {{the understanding of the}} shearing mechanism, but also to improve the industrial process with respect to parameters such as tool force, tool wear and sheared surface appearance. Tool forces were measured for various materials already by Izod (1906), who used a symmetric set-up with double tools to obtain a large stiffness in the lateral direction and a stable clearance. A refined set-up was devised by Gustafsson et al. (2014) which allowed the measurement of the lateral force component (the component that strives to separate the tools and increase the clearance), in addition to the force in the shearing direction, with a minimal reduction of lateral stiffness. The lateral force was previously measured by Yamasaki and Ozaki (1991) but with friction losses in <b>sliding</b> <b>guides</b> and a low stiffness in the set-up that results in tool clearance changes during shearing. The same concept was improved by Kopp et al. (2016) for increased stiffness and with compensation of friction losses through calibrations. Still, the stiffness is lower than in symmetric double shearing and there is a significant risk of misinterpreted forces due to changed conditions in the <b>sliding</b> <b>guides.</b>|$|E
40|$|The “inverted {{pendulum}} problem ” {{is perhaps}} the most widely used benchmarking study to assess the effectiveness of emerging control design techniques. In this paper the “Backpropagation Through Time ” learning method is used to train a multilayer perceptron neural network to control an actual physical system, consisting in a pendulum free to pivot on a cart, which is moved by a DC motor within a space of 60 cm on a pair of <b>slide</b> <b>guides.</b> The goal of the neural controller is to maintain the inverted pendulum balanced at the middle of the <b>slide</b> <b>guides.</b> The neural network has been implemented both with a DSP and with a Fast Prototipyng Neural System (FPNS) hardware. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the used technique: the network is able to balance the pendulum also from difficult initial conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of <b>slide</b> <b>guides</b> are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length <b>slide</b> <b>guides</b> on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|R
5000|$|Due to a {{complete}} lack of a muzzle blast, {{the action of the}} PSS is best described as [...] "Reaction action". Since no propellant gasses exit the cartridge casing after firing, rearward force is present only due to the projectile, and is used to cycle the pistol's slide. In all other respects, the PSS generally follows traditional conventions except for the <b>slide's</b> <b>guide</b> rod, which is located above the barrel and instead of guide rails on the pistol frame.|$|R
50|$|The metal <b>slide</b> <b>guide</b> rails are {{designed}} to be as long as possible to promote stability, by reducing torsion and flexing of the grip frame, during firing and a close fit between the slide and grip frame for plenty direct mechanical interaction between the slide and grip frame. Furthermore, the rails being part of the frame sub assembly that bears all internals, it is easier to assemble the mechanism for manufacturing or disassemble for maintenance and replacement.|$|R

The principle of the actuator {{is an extension of}} the principle of translational energy-efficient actuator vsaUT. A prototype based on the principle has been designed, in which ball-bearings and linear <b>slide</b> <b>guides</b> have been used in order to reduce losses due to friction...|$|R

The discrete time state space model is identified from the input and output data of this system by using a modified recursive least square method.

40|$|The {{clearances}} in the <b>slide</b> <b>guide</b> {{system of}} a hydraulic press {{are one of}} the significant factors affecting its accuracy. These clearances also affect the energy consumption of the press. An energy loss model that considers the oil leaks and friction associated with these clearances was proposed, and the size of clearances was optimized based on the model. The maximum allowable eccentric load and the energy loss on the wedge clearance condition were calculated to ensure the <b>slide</b> and <b>guide</b> pillars function properly. The stiffness of pillars and wear of guide rails were checked under an eccentric load condition. A case for rapid sheet metal forming with a 20 MN hydraulic press was examined. For this case, the optimum fit clearances were found to be approximately 0. 4 mm. The energy loss under an eccentric load condition was increased by approximately 83 % compared to a non-eccentric load condition. The pillars were optimized by reducing excessive stiffness, which served to decrease the pillar weight by nearly 20 %...|$|R

Some cordwood saws are run from a belt from a farm tractor power takeoff pulley. Others, mounted on a tractor's three-point hitch, connect to the rear power takeoff shaft. Self-powered models are equipped with small gasoline engines or even large electric motors as power sources. The mandrel is a shaft and set of bearings that support and transfer power to the blade.

In all the cases, the crack was found to have initiated at the fillet of the change of cross section of the fixing holes and propagated {{to the surface of the}} guide containing the counter bore top end.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maltoporin (which is encoded by the lamB gene) {{facilitates}} the translocation of maltodextrins across the outer membrane of E. coli. In particular, it is indispensable for {{the transport of}} long maltooligosaccharides, as these do not pass through non-specific porins. An understanding of this intriguing capability requires elucidation of the structural basis. RESULTS: The crystal structures of maltoporin in complex with maltose, maltotriose and maltohexaose reveal an extended binding site within the maltoporin channel. The maltooligosaccharides are in apolar van der Waals contact with the 'greasy slide', a hydrophobic path that is composed of aromatic residues and located at the channel lining. At the constriction of the channel the sugars are tightly surrounded by protein side chains and form an extensive hydrogen-bonding network with ionizable amino-acid residues. CONCLUSION: Hydrophobic interactions with the greasy <b>slide</b> <b>guide</b> the sugar into and through the channel constriction. The glucosyl-binding subsites at the channel constriction confer stereospecificity to the channel along {{with the ability to}} scavenge substrate at low concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of electromechanical servo presses permits greater flexibility in process kinematics. When this feature is exploited in a targeted manner, {{the result of}} the forming process is largely determined by the dynamic properties of the forming machine. Here, attunement between control and mechanics is a central criterion for ensuring good motion dynamics, positioning accuracy and component quality. The increased motion dynamics during workpiece contact require a dynamic stability of the system technology in order to ensure process reliability. They affect the reactions of the machine structure {{as a result of the}} attendant process forces and inertial loads. The resulting oscillations affect the component quality and the operational strength of the machine. The effects of the <b>slide</b> <b>guide,</b> press mounting support, mass distribution and stiffness distribution are studied on the basis of a linearly elastic model of a servo-screw press and the results of an experimental modal analysis.

40|$|Free-piston linear {{generators}} (FPLGs) have attractive application {{prospects for}} hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) owing to their high-efficiency, low-emissions and multi-fuel flexibility. In {{order to achieve}} long-term stable operation, the hybrid system design and full-cycle operation strategy are essential factors that should be considered. A 25 kW FPLG consisting of an internal combustion engine (ICE), a linear electric machine (LEM) and a gas spring (GS) is designed. To improve the power density and generating efficiency, the LEM is assembled with two modular flat-type double-sided PM LEM units, which sandwich a common moving-magnet plate supported by a middle keel beam and bilateral <b>slide</b> <b>guide</b> rails to enhance the stiffness of the moving plate. For the convenience of operation processes analysis, the coupling hybrid system is modeled mathematically and a full cycle simulation model is established. Top-level systemic control strategies including the starting, stable operating, fault recovering and stopping strategies are analyzed and discussed. The analysis results validate that the system can run stably and robustly with the proposed full cycle operation strategy.

Then the natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modals of the linear rolling guide model are obtained with two different boundary conditions. One boundary condition is that the movable joint surface of the linear rolling guide is considered, and regardless {{of the influence of}} the bolt joint surface of the guide. And another boundary condition is that the movable joint surface of the linear rolling guide and the influence of bolt joint surface of the guide are all considered.
