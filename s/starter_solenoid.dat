500|$|Razer {{dropped into}} the [...] "best of the rest" [...] competition. Therein it faced Kill-O-Amp which was {{defeated}} after Razer pulled a wheel off before crushing its opponent's battery. It then faced Rhino in the next round, losing after Rhino's spike pierced Razer's armour, breaking the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> and knocking the radio switch into the off position. This also sent Razer into an uncontrolled spin, requiring Lewis to enter the arena to manually power Razer down. Finally, Razer competed in the 13 robot Gigabot Rumble. After the time limit expired, five robots including Razer were still mobile and the result went to an audience vote. After the crowd voted in their favour, Razer became the 1999 Gigabot Rumble Champion.|$|E
50|$|An idle <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> {{can receive}} a large {{electric}} current {{from the car}} battery and a small electric current from the ignition switch. When the ignition switch is turned on, a small electric current is sent through the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid.</b> This causes the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> to close a pair of heavy contacts, thus relaying a large electric current through the starter motor, which in turn sets the engine in motion.|$|E
50|$|In {{a car or}} truck, the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> {{is part of an}} {{automobile}} starting system. The <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> receives a large electric current from the car battery and a small electric current from the ignition switch. When the ignition switch is turned on (i.e. when the key is turned to start the car), the small electric current forces the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> to close a pair of heavy contacts, thus relaying the large electric current to the starter motor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the {{straight}} eight engine. Standard 98 equipment included safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump, cigarette lighter, and a <b>solenoid</b> <b>starter</b> system. Upholstery was either custom broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] An electric clock was standard in 1947. A record 37,140 98s were sold in 1947.|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a <b>solenoid</b> <b>starter,</b> fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of <b>starter</b> eliminated the <b>solenoid,</b> {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the <b>solenoid</b> actuated <b>starter</b> relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|R
50|$|Electricals were {{fitted with}} a master battery switch and {{separate}} ignition switch and <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{automobile}} {{starter motor}} (larger cylinder). The smaller object on top is a <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> which controls {{power to the}} starter motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{ignition}} system {{is used to}} ignite the fuel-air mixture in the engine. The starter system is the {{ignition system}}, plus the battery, and starter switch, <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> and electric starter motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} system was {{powered by a}} 12 volt, lightweight, aircraft battery, which had a master battery control. It powered a <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> via starter button and switches, {{as well as an}} array of instruments, including tachometer (0-10,000 rpm), oil pressure, water temperature, and oil temperature.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] The <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> {{is above}} the starter motor. The {{threaded}} terminal at left would connect to the battery through a heavy cable. At the right end of the solenoid coil, a linkage inside the housing would engage the pinion visible in the housing at {{the right side of}} the motor.|$|E
50|$|The LAP is a 2.2 L——version of the Ecotec, {{based on}} the Gen II block with {{cylinder}} head improvements, new camshaft design, E37 engine control module, 58X crankshaft reluctor ring, digital crank and cam sensors, individual coil-on-plug ignition, vented <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid,</b> new MAP sensor, new intake manifold seals, new oil filter element, a 32-bit computer, and improved emissions performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid,</b> usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> (or starter relay) is {{the part}} of an {{automobile}} which switches a large electric current to the starter motor, in response to a small control current, and which in turn sets the engine in motion. Its function is thus identical to that of a transistor, but using an electromagnetic solenoid rather than semiconductor to perform the switching. In many vehicles the solenoid also engages the starter pinion with the ring gear of the engine.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> {{receives}} insufficient {{power from}} the battery, it will fail to start the motor, and may produce a rapid clicking sound. The lack of power {{can be caused by}} a low battery, by corroded or loose connections in the battery cable, or by a damaged positive (red) cable from the battery. Any of these problems will result in some, but not enough, power being sent to the solenoid, which means that the solenoid will only begin to push the engagement gear, making the metallic click sound.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, {{the term}} may also {{refer to a}} variety of {{transducer}} devices that convert energy into linear motion. The term is also often used to refer to a solenoid valve, which is an integrated device containing an electromechanical solenoid which actuates either a pneumatic or hydraulic valve, or a solenoid switch, which is a specific type of relay that internally uses an electromechanical solenoid to operate an electrical switch; for example, an automobile <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid,</b> or a linear solenoid, which is an electromechanical solenoid. Solenoid bolts, a type of electronic-mechanical locking mechanism, also exist.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or cranking motor {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Starter {{solenoids}} {{can also}} be built into the starter itself, often visible {{on the outside of}} the starter. If a <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> receives insufficient power from the battery, it will fail to start the motor, and may produce a rapid 'clicking' or 'clacking' sound. This can be caused by a low or dead battery, by corroded or loose connections in the cable, or by a broken or damaged positive (red) cable from the battery. Any of these will result in some power to the solenoid, but not enough to hold the heavy contacts closed, so the starter motor itself never spins, and the engine doesn't start.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ignition}} switch or starter switch is a switch {{in the control}} system of an internal combustion engined motor vehicle that activates the main electrical systems for the vehicle. Besides providing power to the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> and the ignition system components (including the engine control unit and ignition coil) it also usually switches on power to many [...] "accessories" [...] (radio, power windows, etc.). The {{ignition switch}} usually requires a key be inserted that works a lock built into the switch mechanism. It is frequently combined with the starter switch which activates the starter motor. The ignition locking system may be bypassed by disconnecting the wiring to the switch and manipulating it directly; {{this is known as}} hotwiring.|$|E
5000|$|To wire the system, the ballast {{resistor}} unit (early vehicles) or {{ballast resistor}} wire feeding the points-type coil {{needs to be}} bypassed with regular copper wire. This is because the points system used this resistor to reduce the voltage to the coil to around 9 volts while the ignition switch is in the [...] "run" [...] position to prevent overheating the points. The points system has a [...] "bypass" [...] wire from the ignition switch or the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> to deliver full battery voltage to the coil during cranking. The HEI system needs the full battery voltage at all times to work its best. One common hookup method is to replace the ballast resistor or wire with a normal copper wire and attach both wires to the HEI's power input terminal. This ensures the HEI receives full power while running.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bell housing}} bolt pattern {{for the old}} AMC 196 Straight-6 engine {{is the same as}} for the more modern early 199 and 232 (used from 1964 to 1971), but the 196 had {{different}} dowel pin sizes. AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different bell housing bolt pattern that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the bell housing changed; all 1966-up V8 bell housing bolt patterns are the same. The bell housing for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid)</b> - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|E
5000|$|Before series {{three of}} Robot Wars, Razer was {{entered into the}} American robot combat {{programme}} BattleBots in Los Angeles after the team won an international scholarship along with fellow British robots, Killerhurtz and Mortis. Razer's first battle was against Voltarc. It flipped Razer, but Lewis self-righted and Scott pierced Voltarc's armour. Razer was given the victory on a crowd's vote. Its next fight was against Agrippa, which Razer defeated by crushing through its opponent's electrical system. Razer's next adversary, Tazbot, beat it after flipping it onto the arena saws which severed a cable and left Razer unable to self-right. Razer dropped into the [...] "best of the rest" [...] competition. Therein it faced Kill-O-Amp which was defeated after Razer pulled a wheel off before crushing its opponent's battery. It then faced Rhino in the next round, losing after Rhino's spike pierced Razer's armour, breaking the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> and knocking the radio switch into the off position. This also sent Razer into an uncontrolled spin, requiring Lewis to enter the arena to manually power Razer down. Finally, Razer competed in the 13 robot Gigabot Rumble. After the time limit expired, five robots including Razer were still mobile and the result went to an audience vote. After the crowd voted in their favour, Razer became the 1999 Gigabot Rumble Champion.|$|E
50|$|After finally {{making it}} out of the Delta, Clarkson and May removed their animal {{protection}} from their cars, at which point the Lancia suffered another problem - the <b>starter</b> <b>solenoid</b> had packed in and thus had to be repaired for the car to start up again. Although it was able to move off, it was now unable to drive in anything other than second gear. Eventually, the car suffered another breakdown along the road, resulting in much of the support team and film crew choosing to leave it behind after being so fed up with the constant problems it had caused (some of the breakdowns were not aired in the broadcast), leaving Clarkson with only two bush mechanics staying behind to fix several issues that had developed, including the engine stalling after it started up every time by going into third gear. Miraculously, the Lancia was able to move off again, and reached the border with Namibia, behind Hammond and May. Upon deciding which was best, Clarkson ruled out the Lancia as the winner because of the issues it had caused, May's Mercedes was ruled out for having had to be modified to shed weight, while Hammond was shocked to learn the Beetle was declared the best choice for Surrey, after it was pointed out that it had not needed repairs or any modifications, compared to the Opel which had needed repairs.|$|E
