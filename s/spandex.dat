5|$|In {{creating}} Selina Kyle's catsuit, {{two layers}} of material were used, with the outer layer being polyurethane coated <b>spandex,</b> embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.|$|E
5|$|The Man {{with the}} Iron Fists premiered on October 25, 2012, at Mann's Chinese 6 theater in Hollywood. David Bautista {{attended}} {{in a yellow}} <b>spandex</b> suit, which he wore {{as a tribute to}} Bruce Lee, who wore a similar outfit in Game of Death (1972). The film was released in North America on November 2, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Other stories include {{recollections}} {{about the}} dress purchased for the {{date with a}} guy who subsequently married someone else; the foibles of <b>spandex</b> bras that result in a look known as the monoboob; issues involving toe cleavage; the Juicy Couture tracksuit that is a prominent staple of California wardrobes; wardrobe choice on the wrong day of the month; and the story about an incarcerated lover and the strategic hole in a certain pair of pants.|$|E
5|$|Tony Gardner ({{designer}}) and {{his company}} Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics {{on his head and}} neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a <b>spandex</b> and foam body suit.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, <b>spandex,</b> and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May, Carlsen {{played an}} {{exhibition}} game at Oslo City against the people of Norway, assisted by a grandmaster panel consisting of Simen Agdestein, Jon Ludvig Hammer, and Leif Erlend Johannessen. Each of the panel members proposed a move and the public could then vote over the proposed moves. Each panel member was allowed three chances to let chess engine Houdini propose a move during the game. Norway's moves were executed by Oddvar Brå who was disguised in a red <b>spandex</b> suit for the occasion. The game was drawn when Carlsen forced a perpetual check.|$|E
5|$|Robert Blackman {{joined the}} crew {{prior to the}} start of the season as costume designer. He had been {{recommended}} by his predecessor, Durinda Rice Wood. He later recalled that he wasn't interested in the job and only took the interview as a favor, but he was so struck by producer David Livingston's enthusiasm that he accepted the post. One of his tasks was to redesign the Starfleet costumes which had been used for the first two seasons. The previous versions were made of <b>spandex</b> and caused back problems in the cast. The new costumes cost $3,000, and were made out of a wool gabardine.|$|E
5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The <b>spandex</b> environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear <b>spandex</b> or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight <b>spandex</b> that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E

25|$|To {{coincide}} with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team introduced pullover <b>spandex</b> uniforms, the first such team in baseball, and a look that would quickly be adopted by most other teams {{by the end of}} the decade. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.|$|E
25|$|Captain Barbell first {{appeared}} in the series finale of Darna. He wore the usual hero's <b>spandex</b> costume with the big CB logo on his chest. However, neither the actor's face was shown nor was he credited, since the producers had not decided yet who will take the role. It was intentionally done to drum beat the promotions for the upcoming series.|$|E
25|$|Batman: Batgirl has {{appeared}} in various forms of the catsuit throughout the Batman film, TV and comic book franchises. Catwoman has worn a variety of lurex, PVC, leather and <b>spandex</b> catsuits in the TV series, film and comic book franchises. The villainess Harley Quinn is renowned for her distinctive costume - a red and black diamond-checked catsuit {{in the style of}} a harlequin jester.|$|E
25|$|Warp knits do not stretch {{as much as}} a weft knit, and it is run-resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but {{stretches}} more. This {{is especially}} true if spools of <b>spandex</b> are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more flexibility and making it less prone to having a 'baggy' appearance. The average t-shirt is a weft knit.|$|E
25|$|While rubber {{is still}} used in textile manufacturing, its low {{tenacity}} limits {{its use in}} lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to neoprene (polymer of chloroprene), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, <b>spandex</b> (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{fashion in}} the mid-1980s became more {{colorful}} around 1984. This included long wool coats, long flared skirts, slim miniskirts, slightly tapered pants and stirrup ones, designer jeans, <b>spandex</b> cycling shorts, extremely long and bulky sweaters, jumpsuits, pastel colors, leather trenchcoats, fur coats, extremely large scarves, beanies, leather gloves, and dresses worn with wide or thin belts. The aerobics craze of the early 1980s continued into the mid 1980s, but the clothes became more colorful than they were before.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1950s, {{underwear}} {{consisted of}} simple, white pieces of clothing {{which were not}} to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like Dacron, nylon and <b>Spandex.</b> By 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters.|$|E
25|$|Nina Williams has blonde {{ponytail and}} blue eyes, and voluptuous yet {{powerful}} build. Her look contrasts {{that of her}} sister, Anna, who is a brunette. Nina dresses primarily in purple fitted costumes and is commonly seen wearing a military style outfit (to suit her occupation), sometimes also in costumes made of materials resembling <b>spandex,</b> PVC and leather; most of her shoes also consist of heels. In Tekken 6, one of Nina's extra outfits {{is one of her}} Death by Degrees costumes.|$|E
25|$|Lint {{contamination}} {{also presents}} {{what may be}} the most serious threat of damage to delicate mechanical devices. In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering clean rooms are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from artificial fibers that are longer and thicker, and therefore much less likely to shed any material. Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like <b>spandex</b> (or Lycra), for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break, and longer, stronger non-woven polyolefin fibers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any <b>spandex</b> or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E
25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated <b>Spandex,</b> is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E
