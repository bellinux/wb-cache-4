Penicillium roqueforti, a species of high industrial importance, would benefit from functional data yielded by molecular genetic approaches. This work provides the first example of gene replacement by homologous recombination in P. roqueforti, demonstrating that knockout experiments can be performed in this fungus. To do so, we improved the existing transformation method to integrate transgenes into P. roqueforti genome. In the meantime, we cloned the PrNiaD gene, which encodes a NADPH-dependent nitrate reductase that reduces nitrate to nitrite. Then, we performed a deletion of the PrNiaD gene from P. roqueforti strain AGO. The ΔPrNiaD mutant strain is more resistant to chlorate-containing medium than the wild-type strain, but did not grow on nitrate-containing medium.

Neuronal deletion of Atg 7 prevented HI-induced autophagy, resulted in 42 % decrease of tissue loss compared to wild-type mice after the insult, and reduced cell death in multiple brain regions, including apoptosis, as shown by decreased caspase-dependent and -independent cell death.

Podocytes that overexpressed COX- 2 were virtually indistinguishable from wild-type podocytes but were significantly more sensitive to PAN-induced injury, produced more prostaglandin E 2 and thromboxane B 2, and had greater expression of prostaglandin E 2 receptor subtype 4 (EP 4) and thromboxane receptor (TP).

This review evaluates the evidence that aquaporin-type water channels are involved in GI fluid transport. The aquaporins are a family of small (≈ 30 kDa) integral membrane proteins that function as water channels. At least seven aquaporins are expressed in various tissues in the GI tract: AQP 1 in intrahepatic cholangiocytes, AQP 4 in gastric parietal cells, AQP 3 and AQP 4 in colonic surface epithelium, AQP 5 in salivary gland, AQP 7 in small intestine, AQP 8 in liver, pancreas and colon, and AQP 9 in liver.

Despite these strain-specific determinants, subregions of V 3 are highly conserved, and the effects of different portions of the V 3 loop on Env tropism and immunogenicity have not been well delineated. For this report, <b>selective</b> <b>deletions</b> in V 3 were introduced by shortening of the stem of the V 3 loop. These mutations were explored in combination with deletions of selected V regions. Progressive shortening of the stem of V 3 abolished the immunogenicity as well as the functional activity of HIV Env; however, two small deletions on both arms of the V 3 stem altered the tropism of the dualtropic 89. 6 P viral strain so that it infected only CXCR 4 + cells.

Methods and Results—We investigated the role of ABCA 1 in atherosclerosis using a combination of overexpression and <b>selective</b> <b>deletion</b> models. First, we examined the effect of transgenic overexpression of a full-length human ABCA 1 -containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) in the presence or absence of the endogenous mouse Abca 1 gene. ABCA 1 overexpression in the atherosclerosis-susceptible Ldlr/ background significantly reduced the development of atheroscle-rosis in both the presence and absence of mouse Abca 1. Next, we used mice with tissue-specific inactivation of Abca 1 to dissect the discrete roles of Abca 1 in different tissues on susceptibility to atherosclerosis. On the Apoe/ background, mice lacking hepatic Abca 1 had significantly reduced HDL cholesterol and accelerated atherosclerosis, indicating that the liver is an important site at which Abca 1 plays an antiatherogenic role. In contrast, mice with macrophage-specific inactivation of Abca 1 on the Ldlr/ background displayed no change in atherosclerotic lesion area. Conclusions—These data indicate that physiological expression of Abca 1 modulates the susceptibility to atherosclerosis and establish hepatic Abca 1 expression as an important site of atheroprotection.

40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} mechanisms underlying depression {{are still}} poorly understood. An initial hypothesis postulated {{to explain the}} substrates of depression {{was based on the}} involvement of monoaminergic systems. This early theory was proposed from different findings obtained using pharmacological tools and can explain the mechanism of action of the drugs currently used to treat depression. However, more recent studies have revealed that other neurobiological processes different from monoamines also participate in the substrates of depression. These mechanisms include the participation of several neuromodulatory systems, stress-related circuits and neuroplastic changes that could represent a direct substrate for these pathophysiological processes. The lack of selective pharmacological tools for several of these potential targets of depression represents an important limitation to study their potential involvement. In the last two decades, different lines of genetically modified mice have been generated with <b>selective</b> <b>deletions</b> in specific genes related to the control of emotional responses. This review summarizes the main findings that have been obtained with these novel genetic tools to clarify the neurobiological substrates of depression.

Here, using a <b>selective</b> cell <b>deletion</b> strategy, we demonstrate that a subset of mesenchymal cells expressing osterix, a marker of bone precursors in the adult, serve to regulate the maturation of early B lymphoid precursors by promoting pro-B to pre-B cell transition through {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) production. Loss of Osx+ cells or Osx-specific deletion of IGF- 1 led to a failure of B cell maturation and the impaired adaptive immune response. These data highlight the notion that bone marrow is a composite of specialized niches formed by pairings of specific mesenchymal cells with parenchymal stem or lineage committed progenitor cells, thereby providing distinctive functional units to regulate hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{availability}} of plant genome sequences, {{combined with a}} robust evolutionary scenario of the modern monocot and eudicot karyotypes from their diploid ancestors, offers an opportunity to gain insights into microRNA (miRNA) gene paleohistory in plants. Characterization and comparison of miRNAs and associated protein-coding targets in plants allowed us to unravel (1) contrasted genome conservation patterns of miRNAs in monocots and eudicots after whole-genome duplication (WGD), (2) an ancestral miRNA founder pool in the monocot genomes dating back to 100 million years ago, (3) miRNA subgenome dominance during the post-WGD diploidization process with <b>selective</b> miRNA <b>deletion</b> complemented with possible transposable element-mediated return flows, and (4) the miRNA/target interaction-directed differential loss/retention of miRNAs following the gene dosage balance rule. Together, our data suggest that overretained miRNAs in grass genomes may be implicated in connected gene regulations for stress responses, which is essential for plant adaptation and useful for crop variety innovation...|$|R
