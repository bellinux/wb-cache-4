5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. <b>Spells</b> are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. <b>Spells</b> are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black <b>spells</b> per level. Each character may learn only three <b>spells</b> per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective <b>spells,</b> while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of two studies on the <b>spelling</b> {{performance}} of 1 st graders in a transparent writing system. The <b>spelling</b> performance of Italian children was assessed to determine the cross-task relationship between <b>spelling</b> to dictation and spontaneous <b>spelling</b> at the single word level (Study 1) and at the text level (Study 2), respectively. In study 1, 132 Italian children's <b>spelling</b> performance was assessed in 1 st grade through two standardized tasks, i. e., word dictation, and spontaneous word <b>spelling.</b> In study 2, <b>spelling</b> performance of 81 Italian children was assessed in 1 st grade through two tasks, i. e., text dictation, and spontaneous text <b>spelling.</b> In Study 1, <b>spelling</b> words and pseudo-words to dictation {{was found to be}} more difficult than spontaneous <b>spelling</b> of words. This effect was verified for all children (including low achievers and <b>spelling</b> impaired). The moderate correlation found between <b>spelling</b> to dictation and spontaneous <b>spelling</b> indicated that the two tasks are supported by partially different <b>spelling</b> processes and confirmed suggestions for including both types of <b>spelling</b> assessments in the school. In Study 2, children's <b>spelling</b> performances were not dependent across the two tasks (i. e., <b>spelling</b> a text under dictation or spontaneously). The two tasks shared the level of difficulty but performance in one task was not predictive of performance in the second task. Strong individual differences between children were found at the text level as a function of task. Similar to Study 1, the moderate correlation between <b>spelling</b> text to dictation and spontaneous <b>spelling</b> confirmed the usefulness of adopting both <b>spelling</b> assessments at school...|$|R

5|$|Alchemical {{magic was}} used to create or alter potions to achieve more {{powerful}} effects, repair or enchant items, identify unknown items or creatures, and combine different Order or Chaos <b>spells</b> to create <b>spells</b> with multiple elements (such as earth and fire <b>spells</b> creating a molten metal spell). Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes; for example, a warrior imbued with the Water element would deal extra cold-type damage but receive additional heat-type damage.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{designed}} to teach <b>spelling</b> {{based on the assumption}} that <b>spelling</b> is a memorization (as opposed to rule-based) task. The program presents a series of <b>spelling</b> words within sentences, and then requires the learner to type in the <b>spelling</b> words. In [...] "learning" [...] mode, the program would ignore incorrect letters, with the idea being that seeing an incorrect <b>spelling</b> on the screen would interfere with memorizing a correct <b>spelling.</b> (The user could continually guess at the next correct letter or press ESC to show the correct <b>spelling.)</b> Misspelled words are presented again to learners, who must retype <b>spelling</b> words until they are <b>spelled</b> correctly. The program periodically presents <b>spelling</b> words from previous lessons to reinforce memoirization.|$|R

5|$|Magical healing <b>spells,</b> {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The <b>spells</b> identify a sick person with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The <b>spells</b> are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue the water with the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing <b>spells</b> that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E

5|$|The Book of the Dead first {{developed}} in Thebes toward {{the beginning of}} the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE. The earliest known occurrence of the <b>spells</b> included in the Book of the Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new <b>spells</b> were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the <b>spells</b> introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E
40|$|This poster {{introduces}} research based {{information for}} teaching <b>spelling</b> in the classroom. The {{focus of the}} poster further explains “Why is <b>spelling</b> important?” and “How <b>spelling</b> can be effectively implemented into the classroom?” Research was conducted by examining multiple media sources such as textbooks, journal articles, and online databases using the keywords: <b>spelling,</b> strategies, and interventions. The reviewed research showed that <b>spelling</b> correlates with reading, writing, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Research-based strategies that are effective in the primary classroom include weekly <b>spelling</b> stories, <b>spelling</b> magnet boards, and various <b>spelling</b> games. Incorporating fun word games into a daily or weekly routine helps to reinforce/improve effective <b>spelling</b> habits. A variety of techniques are used to assess <b>spelling.</b> It is important to supplement the assessment with student work to get an accurate picture of a student’s <b>spelling</b> abilities and limitations. It {{is essential for the}} teacher to create an effective environment in the classroom to support <b>spelling.</b> An effective environment includes many opportunities for students to practice strategies they have learned and for the teacher to conduct ongoing <b>spelling</b> assessments...|$|R

5|$|The Book of the Dead {{was part}} of a {{tradition}} of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the <b>spells</b> included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other <b>spells</b> were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the <b>spells</b> which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as had always been the <b>spells</b> from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spells</b> of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of <b>spells</b> are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these <b>spells</b> appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of <b>spells</b> also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E
5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in both black and red ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of <b>spells,</b> opening and closing sections of <b>spells,</b> the instructions to perform <b>spells</b> correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
5000|$|Advocates {{note that}} <b>spelling</b> reforms {{have taken place}} already, just slowly and often not in an {{organized}} way. There are many words that were once <b>spelled</b> un-phonetically but have since been reformed. For example, music was <b>spelled</b> [...] until the 1880s, and fantasy was <b>spelled</b> [...] until the 1920s. For a time, almost all words with the -or ending (such as error) were once <b>spelled</b> -our (...) , and almost all words with the -er ending (such as member) were once <b>spelled</b> -re (...) [...] In American <b>spelling,</b> most of them now use -or and -er, but in British <b>spelling,</b> only some have been reformed.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{one other}} way for a <b>spell</b> to be [...] "countered". If the <b>spell</b> targets {{something}} (such as Giant Growth or Shock), then the target must be legal both when the <b>spell</b> is cast and when it resolves. A <b>spell</b> can't be cast without a legal target; if the target becomes illegal while the <b>spell</b> is on the stack, then the <b>spell</b> is countered by the game rules (for having an illegal target) just before it would start to resolve. If a <b>spell</b> is countered this way, then {{no part of the}} <b>spell</b> — even a non-targeting part of the <b>spell's</b> effect — takes place. This is referred to as 'Countered Upon Resolution' (formerly [...] "Fizzling").|$|R

5|$|During battle, players cast <b>spells</b> {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest possible. As the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful <b>spells.</b> In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of <b>spells,</b> they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical <b>spells.</b> The effectiveness of <b>spells</b> depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting <b>spells,</b> or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
40|$|The task of {{recognition}} of oral <b>spelling</b> (stimulus: “C-A-T”, response: “cat”) is often administered to individuals with acquired written language disorders, {{yet there is}} no consensus about the underlying cognitive processes. We adjudicate between two existing hypotheses: Recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> uses central reading processes, or recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> uses central <b>spelling</b> processes in reverse. We tested the recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> and <b>spelling</b> to dictation abilities of a single individual with acquired dyslexia and dysgraphia. She was impaired relative to matched controls in <b>spelling</b> to dictation but unimpaired in recognition of oral <b>spelling.</b> Recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> for exception words (e. g., colonel) and pronounceable nonwords (e. g., larth) was intact. Our results were predicted by the hypothesis that recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> involves the central reading processes. We conclude that recognition of oral <b>spelling</b> is a useful tool for probing the integrity of the central reading processes. 9 page(s...|$|R
50|$|There are {{generally}} {{four types of}} <b>spelling</b> tests. In an oral <b>spelling</b> test, the teacher pronounces each word out loud and the students write each word down. In a <b>spelling</b> bee-type test (see <b>spelling</b> bee below), each student is asked individually one-at-a-time to <b>spell</b> a (different) specific word out loud. In a proofreading-style test, sentences or paragraphs are given to the student on one or more sheets of paper, and the student must find the incorrectly <b>spelled</b> words and supply the correct spellings in the spaces provided. In a multiple choice <b>spelling</b> test, two or more spellings are given for each word in the test, and the student must place a mark next {{to the one that}} is correct. The main difference between most <b>spelling</b> tests at school and a <b>spelling</b> bee is that in a <b>spelling</b> bee the students do not get to know in advance which words will be tested, but for regular <b>spelling</b> tests they do.|$|R
40|$|A common {{feature of}} text input tools is <b>spell</b> checking. It exists in search engines, email clients {{and of course}} in word {{processors}} like Microsoft Word.
