He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> there's this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E

500|$|According to Burks, Hubbard [...] "was so {{sure he had}} {{something}} 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' {{and that they were}} to meet him at Penn Station, and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer." [...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position."

Each of the 22 plots here is allowed to append its name to that of the vineyard, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Corton Le Corton, Corton Clos du Roi, Corton-Bressandes, Corton-Renardes and so on. [...] At their best the red wines of Corton combine the muscularity of the Côte de Nuits with the elegance of the Côte de Beaune.|$|E

According to creator Vince Gilligan, [...] "After the first Breaking Bad episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef — we have Walt and others like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Hitchcock {{was once}} again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont British. His first film for the company The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) was a success and his second The 39 Steps (1935) is often {{considered}} one of the best films from his early period, with the British Film Institute ranking it the fourth best British film of the 20th century. The film was acclaimed in the UK, and it made Hitchcock a star in the US, and established the quintessential English [...] "Hitchcock blonde" [...] Madeleine Carroll as the template for his succession of ice cold and elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter Robert Towne remarked, [...] "It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with The 39 Steps." [...] This film {{was one of the first}} to exploit a [...] "MacGuffin", a rather peripheral driver of the narrative. In The 39 Steps, the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans. In 1966, Hitchcock explained to French director François Truffaut: might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men in a train. One man says, [...] "What's that package up there in the baggage rack?" [...] And the other answers, [...] "Oh, that's a Macguffin." [...] The first man asks, [...] "What's a Macguffin?" [...] "Well," [...] the other man says, [...] "It's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands." [...] The first man says, [...] "But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands, and the other one answers, [...] "Well then, that's no Macguffin!" [...] <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> that a Macguffin is actually nothing at all.|$|E
