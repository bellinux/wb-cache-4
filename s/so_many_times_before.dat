25|$|Essex and Worcestershire {{took notice}} of the bad weather forecasts, racking up runs swiftly at Chelmsford. The Essex batting effort was not very spectacular, and only Ronnie Irani's 85 saved some grace for Essex as wickets tumbled amid showers on the first day. They {{finished}} 220 all out as Worcestershire's bowlers teamed up, Matthew Mason the best with four for 48. In reply, Ben Smith made a century including fourteen fours, and with help of Gareth Batty (54) and Kabir Ali (53), both former England players, Worcestershire got to 383 all out - a lead of 163. Alastair Cook, Essex' 20-year-old prodigy, made a quick 46, but it was their 37-year-old Zimbabwean Andy Flower who, as <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before,</b> was the top scorer and the rock of the Essex innings with 85 - which led them to 329.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Pakistan, Lahore was made capital of the Punjab province in the new state of Pakistan. Almost immediately, large scale riots broke out among Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus, causing many deaths as well as damage to historic monuments—including the Lahore Fort, Badshahi mosque and colonial buildings. After independence and its deep impact, Lahore as <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before,</b> once again gained its significance as an economic and cultural powerhouse of the region, through government reforms. The second Islamic Summit Conference {{was held in the}} city in 1974. With United Nations assistance, the government was able to rebuild Lahore, and most scars of the communal violence of independence were erased. Less than 20 years later, however, Lahore once again became a battleground in the War of 1965. The battlefield and trenches can still be observed today close to the Wagah border area. In 1996, the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup final match was held at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.|$|E
500|$|On March 18 Katsura trounced Art Rubin 50–28 in 58 innings. but {{was handed}} a worse defeat in her next match on March 20, losing to Bozeman 50 to 18 in 52 innings. In her last match on March 21, Katsura {{pulled off a}} 50–46 win against Kilgore in 61 innings. This was the biggest upset of the tournament. Kilgore, the [...] "Giant Killer", was the only player other than Matsuyama who was {{considered}} to have a fighting chance at dethroning Hoppe. Between this win and her earlier win over Procita, Katsura had beaten the only two players in the tournament that had won their matches against Hoppe. That evening a separate exhibition match between Katsura and Kilgore was featured on KRON-TV, with commentary provided by Cochran. The next day the tournament concluded with Hoppe repeating as champion as he had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before.</b> Katsura took seventh place, ahead of Procita at eighth place, Chamaco at ninth and Rubin at tenth. Above her were Crane at sixth, Rubin at fifth, Kilgore at fourth, Bozeman at third and Matsuyama as runner-up.|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006 Macedonian Community was struck by {{unexpected}} temptation-in an act of arson the old Church in Whitehall burnt almost to the ground. Following Holy Liturgies were held in the Church hall, with congregation holding their tears, in constant prayer to God our Lord and His Most Holy Mother, and in search for {{the right way to}} turn events in our favor. And <b>so,</b> as <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> in our history, Macedonians have sung their old song, song of persistence, song of salvation, song of Faith. The very next month after the fire, on October 22, 2006, the dedication and consecration Liturgy for our new Church was celebrated, preceded by the relocation of the holy relicts of Saint Clement of Ohrid, from the Holy Altar of the old to the Holy Altar of the new Church and with participation of Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia, His Beatitude Stefan, Metropolitan Metodij of American-Canadian Diocese, and Metropolitan Kiril of Polog and Kumanovo Diocese, numerous priests of the American-Canadian Diocese of Macedonian Orthodox Church, in presence of multitude of the faithful.|$|R
50|$|Jack Reacher {{breaks a}} bully's nose and finger after being {{repeatedly}} provoked in a Texas saloon, {{so when the}} bully {{turns out to be}} a local sheriff and shows up with three of his colleagues the following day to arrest him, Reacher decides it's time to move on. He chooses hitchhiking as the fastest escape and hooks up with a driver of Mexican heritage named Carmen Greer. She says that the only reason she stopped, however, is because she has a problem, a really big problem. Her tax-evading husband, Sloop, is coming out of prison soon, and he will inevitably continue beating her as he did <b>so</b> <b>many,</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before.</b> Carmen has been diligently searching for candidates to kill him, and she thinks Reacher's military background may qualify him for the job. Reacher initially refuses and even leaps out of the car and back into the sweltering 110-degree (Fahrenheit) heat, but then he expeditiously changes his mind and agrees to accept a ride back to the ranch. It is there that Carmen, her husband Sloop and the rest of his family live, and Reacher is promising nothing more than to look into the situation and, if necessary, to act as her bodyguard. Carmen and Jack then proceed to pick up her daughter Ellie who gets on well with Reacher.|$|R

Her attorney, Robert Golger, released the following statement: [...] "Ms. Herold had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years, beginning with the death of her daughter who was killed in a car accident, then her husband, then her beloved chimp Travis, as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash.

2500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{stated that}} the fourth season risked {{predictability}} by returning to a successful formula of storytelling, but he nonetheless preferred those episodes to those of season three. Maureen Ryan reviewed the fourth season positively. She praised the addition of Lincoln Potter (played by Ray McKinnon), comparing the character's quality to that of Breaking Bads antagonist, Gustavo Fring. The A.V. Club called the fourth season more [...] "focused" [...] and [...] "operatic". A.V. Club reviewer Zack Handlen was fond of the season but felt disappointed with the finale, saying it featured a [...] "lousy case of dictated convenience, of an arbitrary and unbelievable reveal used to shift characters around to where the writers {{want them to be}} for next season, as opposed to where they might land organically." [...] However, the review did praise Charlie Hunnam's performance in the finale. TIME said the fourth season was the strongest since season two, but the show needed to end sooner rather than later. TIME also agreed that the finale's contrivances were sometimes too visible, stating [...] "it's the principle: you can only turn up alive at your own funeral <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> it starts to lose its impact." ...|$|E

60|$|And now ensued a {{surprise}} which, though {{of a happy}} kind, was almost {{too much for him}} to bear; for it made his heart beat considerably faster than the wise rules of his manuscript prescribed. Going up on his hill-top, as summer wore away (he had not been there for some time), and walking by the little flowery hillock, as <b>so</b> <b>many</b> a hundred <b>times</b> <b>before,</b> what should he see there but a new flower, that during the time he had been poring over the manuscript so sedulously had developed itself, blossomed, put forth its petals, bloomed into full perfection, and now, with the dew of the morning upon it, was waiting to offer itself to Septimius? He trembled as he looked at it, it was too much almost to bear,--it was so very beautiful, so very stately, so very rich, so very mysterious and wonderful. It was like a person, like a life! Whence did it come? He stood apart from it, gazing in wonder; tremulously taking in its aspect, and thinking of the legends he had heard from Aunt Keziah and from Sibyl Dacy; and how that this flower, like the one that their wild traditions told of, had grown out of a grave,--out of a grave in which he had laid one slain by himself.|$|R
6000|$|On the day apointed for the Canada Bill, Fox {{called at}} Burke's house, and after some talk on Burke's {{intention}} to speak, {{and on other}} matters, they walked down to Westminster and entered the House together, as they had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> a <b>time</b> done <b>before,</b> but were never to do again. They found that the debate had been adjourned, {{and it was not}} until May 6th that Burke had an opportunity of explaining himself on the Revolution in France. He had no sooner risen than interruptions broke out from his own side, and a scene of great disorder followed. Burke was incensed beyond endurance by this treatment, for even Fox and Windham had taken part in the tumult against him. With much bitterness he commented on Fox's previous eulogies of the Revolution, and finally there came the fatal words of severance. [...] "It is indiscreet," [...] he said, [...] "at any period, but especially at my time of life, to provoke enemies, or give my friends occasion to desert me. Yet if my firm and steady adherence to the British Constitution place me in such a dilemma, I am ready to risk it, and with, my last words to exclaim, 'Fly from the French Constitution.'" [...] Fox at this point eagerly called to him that there was no loss of friends. [...] "Yes, yes," [...] cried Burke, [...] "there is a loss of friends. I know the price of my conduct. I have done my duty at the price of my friend. Our friendship is at an end." ...|$|R

60|$|As {{he mused}} drowsily on these portents, the distant {{sound of a}} bell came to his ears and {{completed}} the cure. It was the bell for chapel. He dragged his watch from under his pillow, {{and looked at it}} with consternation. Four minutes to seven. And chapel was at seven. Now Harrison had been late for chapel before. It was not the thought of missing the service that worried him. What really was serious was that he had been late <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> that Merevale had hinted at serious steps to be taken if he were late again, or, at any rate, until a considerable interval of punctuality had elapsed.|$|E
60|$|In this {{there was}} a {{substratum}} of truth.

So close was the lion to the fleeing man-thing that Tarzan had no time carefully to choose the method of his attack.

60|$|He {{patted the}} top of her sunbonnet, gave a little pull to the short brown braid that hung behind her temptingly,--which no miner was ever known to resist,--and watched her flutter off with her spoils.

She was part of the nature that kept them young. Her truancies and vagrancies concerned them not: she was a law to herself, like the birds and squirrels. There were bearded lips to hail her wherever she went, and a blue or red-shirted arm always stretched out in any perilous pass or dangerous crossing.|$|E
60|$|The {{spell of}} it all, against {{which he had}} so often fought, came over John anew. He set his chair {{back against the wall}} and watched and listened, a veritable sense of hypnotism {{creeping}} over his senses. Presently the same impulse which had come to him <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> induced him to turn his head, to read in the faces of the audience the reflection of her genius. He had often watched those long lines of faces changing, each in its own way, under the magic of her art. To-night he looked beyond. He knew very well that his search had a special object. Suddenly he gripped the arms of his chair. In the front row of the pit, sitting head and shoulders taller than {{the men and women who}} lounged over the wooden rest in front of them, was Stephen. More than ever, among these unappropriate surroundings, he seemed to represent something almost patriarchal, a forbidding and disapproving spirit sitting in judgment upon some modern and unworthy wantonness. His face, stern and grave, showed little sign of approval or disapproval, but to John's apprehending eyes the critical sense was there, the verdict foredoomed. He understood as in a flash that Stephen had come there to judge once more the woman whom his brother desired.|$|E
