Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 Southern Excursion Talks marked a turning point, as portentous as the 1989 crackdown, on the {{calendar}} of China’s market reform and cultural transformation. What do economists and humanist elites mean {{when they talk about}} this historical “transition” (zhuangui) in China, in celebratory or condemning rhetoric, and each in their own disciplinary perspective? Can such a transition be characterized as China’s “progressive” movement from socialist <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> to capitalist market economy, or in terms of a cultural transformation, from elitist to popular...|$|E
40|$|Ordoliberalism is a German {{school of}} {{economic}} thought that advocates {{regulation of the}} free market economy based on a set of state-imposed rules guaranteed by the economic constitution, to impose a competitive order in society. It proposes an alternative method to pure laissez-faire and <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> for the better regulation of the market economy, where the goals are the protection of the competitive process and individual freedom. In this paper I submit that ordoliberalism, an indigenous European competition policy, is an adequate economic and analytical tool upon which to base the practice and decision-making of competition law. My aim is twofold: to contribute to the discussion on what ordoliberalism is, in general, and in particular concerning competition policy, and offer a fresh perspective on an ordoliberal-oriented competition policy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the selective adaptation of international norms of corporate governance and mechanisms in China {{in the past}} two decades as China moved from the <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> to the market economy. From the adoption of the concept of corporate legal personality and limited liability to the two-tier board structure (the board of directors and the supervisory board), to the introduction of independent director system and directors fiduciary duties and shareholders right to sue for wrong done to the company (derivative action) or damage to their right personally (personal action), there are ample examples of selective adaptation of international (mostly German and Anglo-American) norms or mechanisms in China. Whilst selective adaptation seems to be the best way forward, this paper concludes that there are still areas of concern in institutional capacity building which needs to be addressed in order to make selective adaptation works...|$|E
5000|$|In his [...] work An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957), Downs {{introduced}} a left-right axis (later known as Downs' axis) to economic theory. On the [...] "left" [...] he placed communist parties that want entirely <b>state-planned</b> <b>economies,</b> {{and on the}} [...] "right" [...] he placed conservative parties that demand an entirely deregulated economy. He claimed that most voters have incomplete information when voting for political candidates in a democracy, and therefore will resort to economic issues of [...] "how much government intervention in the economy there should be" [...] and how parties will control this. Downs borrowed the curve from Harold Hotelling, who developed it to explain how grocery stores targeted customers. Downs' book has since {{become one of the}} most cited books in political science. His left-right axis model has been integrated into the median voter theory first articulated by Duncan Black.|$|R
40|$|The {{debate over}} how far governments should {{intervene}} in economies {{in order to promote}} economic growth, a debate which from the 1980 s seemed settled in favour of the neo-liberal, non-interventionist consensus, has taken on new vigour since the financial crisis of 2008 and after. Some countries, most of them in industrialised Asia, have survived the crisis, and secured equitable economic growth, by adopting a developmental state model, whereby governments have intervened in their economies, often through explicit support for individual companies. This book explores debates about government intervention, assesses interventionist policies, including industrial and innovation policies, and examines in particular the key institutions which {{play a crucial role in}} implementing government policies and in building the bridge between the state and the private sector. The countries covered include China, India, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan, together with representative countries from Europe and Latin America.

40|$|Industrial {{complexes}} {{and global}} financial risks This report {{is devoted to}} preliminary appraisal of contemporary processes in world financial markets that influence the main subject of geography of industry: the forms of spatial loca-tion of industrial activity. One {{of the most prominent}} events in Soviet spatial planning was the creation of so-cal-led Territorial Production Complexes (TPC), mainly in Siberian resource regions with low development (1, 3). They were based on the sources of abundant natural resources and desi-gnated to produce industrial goods of primary processing. The base of their development was the abundant source of power – usually a hydroelectric station or a coal basin. These com-plexes gave appreciable results of economies of scale and other savings due to the combined use of land and infrastructure by interconnected enterprises. It was a rather effective way to withstand the prevailing sectoral planning and management of the industry in the ex-USSR. However, this type of spatial organization of industry was subjected to substantial trials in the transitional period. It had started to be regarded as a form of allocation of the industry only for <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> that cannot be developed under market conditions, althoug...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} „Broadcasting in Estonia under the {{influences}} of <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> 1959 - 1969 “ is {{to look into the}} Estonian broadcasting organisation during the Soviet era, 1959 - 1969. During the Soviet era's state-capitalism the Estonian broadcasting organisation was centrally managed by the Communist Party, mainly by the plans which stated the capacities of the production. Thesis looks into archive documents of the Estonias Planning Commitee and thru them analyses the growth of the production capacities and developement of the organisation. The reasearch consisted of two steps. Firstly, gathering and selecting data from the archives. Secondly analysing the selected data, using descriptive structural analysis. Thesis also includes interviews with three long time employees of the broadcasting organisation. Main idea of the interviews is to provide a wider picture for the analysis of the Soviet era and the state-social economy. Interviews describe how work and different organisationial and economical tasks were carried out, they also provide the knowledge of how different steps during planning were carried out and it all was examined by different control mechanisms. The thesis is a primary overlook of the 1959 - 1969 era and problems for the broadcasting organisation and for the people working on and off the air. The document includes a CD with audio files of the interviews with three long time broadcasting employees...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{case against}} Iran {{is based on}} Iran's deceptions {{regarding}} nuclear weapons development. This case is buttressed by assertions that a state so petroleum-rich cannot need nuclear power to preserve exports, as Iran claims. The U. S. infers, therefore, that Iran's entire nuclear technology program must pertain to weapons development. However, some industry analysts project an Irani oil export decline [e. g., Clark JR (2005) Oil Gas J 103 (18) : 34 – 39]. If such a decline is occurring, Iran's claim to need nuclear power could be genuine. Because Iran's government relies on monopoly proceeds from oil exports for most revenue, it could become politically vulnerable if exports decline. Here, we survey {{the political economy of}} Irani petroleum for evidence of this decline. We define Iran's export decline rate (edr) as its summed rates of depletion and domestic demand growth, which we find equals 10 – 12 %. We estimate marginal cost per barrel for additions to Irani production capacity, from which we derive the “standstill” investment required to offset edr. We then compare the standstill investment to actual investment, which has been inadequate to offset edr. Even if a relatively optimistic schedule of future capacity addition is met, the ratio of 2011 to 2006 exports will be only 0. 40 – 0. 52. A more probable scenario is that, absent some change in Irani policy, this ratio will be 0. 33 – 0. 46 with exports declining to zero by 2014 – 2015. Energy subsidies, hostility to foreign investment, and inefficiencies of its <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> underlie Iran's problem, which has no relation to “peak oil. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine, through {{literature}} review, whether China and Russia are in need of accounting education reforms when they are not English-speaking, do not have developed accounting systems as major English-speaking countries do, have a different political orientation from the selected Englishspeaking countries and are at a transition stage from a <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> to a market-driven economy. The paper is based entirely on literature review of global forces at play on accounting education reform, accounting education change in selected English-speaking countries and developments in accounting education in Russia and China. The review indicates that the two countries have a desperate need for accounting education change and that gradual changes are taking place in both countries, although China is at a more advanced stage of development because of its international trade. There are signs of both countries leaning towards the direction of the Accounting Education Change Commission’s (AECC) initiatives. China is focusing more on breadth of education than specialization and Russia is at a preliminary stage having to enhance its financial reporting system. The available literature on accounting education in Russia and China is limited, particularly in Russia as the Soviet’s old system did not offer accounting degrees. However, this does not present a problem in identifying an accounting education trend in these two countries from the available literature as explained in the final section of this paper “Limitations of This Study and Future Research”. With major English-speaking and non English-speaking countries leaning towards AECC in their accounting education reforms regardless of the political orientation of the country, one may conclude that AECC is the direction that developing countries having the same need for change should consider. The comparison made in this paper provides insights into an area that received little or no attention in the past...|$|E
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the role of}} the state in the Eurasian doctrine, one of the most distinctive and significant movements of the Russian sociological and political-philosophical thought abroad in the 1920 - 1930 ’s. The issues addressed by the Eurasians are still relevant under the current epoch of the new Russian statehood construction and to a certain extent are implemented in the contemporary political practice. According to the classical Eurasian doctrine, all nations of “Russia-Eurasia” are united by the “place of development” and constitute a single historical and socio-cultural world, which organically combines elements of the East and the West. The Eurasian doctrine of the state proclaims the idea of strong government and powerful state, which represents the interests of the people and maintains direct connections with its citizens by combining the law and justice principles with the norms of morality, welfare and conscience. The article examines the key Eurasian concept “ideocratic state” and the essential characteristics of the Eurasian concept of the state system, such as ideocracy, autarchy, idea-ruler, and ruling selection. The key state-forming concept is “Pan-Eurasian nationalism” interpreted by the Eurasians as an archetype of ideology, a basis of the national idea. The authors consider basic principles of the socio-economic structure of the Eurasian state, including active participation of the state in the economic life of the country, the coexistence of public and private properties. According to the Eurasian doctrine, the <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> and the state regulation of culture form the foundations of autarchic states that protect the country from economic and humanitarian intervention. The authors come to the conclusion that Eurasian theory of the state can significantly enrich nowadays scientific theory and help to solve the tasks of modernization of the Russian society at the present stage for it takes into account specific national, geopolitical, historical, and cultural characteristics of our state and allows to preserve the identity and diversity of the Eurasian world...|$|E
40|$|The {{promotion}} of 'democracy' abroad {{has been a}} feature of US foriegn policy since {{the early part of}} the twentieth century, accompanying its rise as an international actor. It provided the ideological basis for its opposition to rivals in the form of imperialism, fascism and communism. The end of the Cold War, which signalled the emergence of the US as the sole superpower, accelerated this process. With the ideological fusion of democracy and capitalism credited in large measure for the defeat of capitalism and <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy,</b> the {{promotion of}} democracy alongside capitalism as the only viable, legitimate mode of governance emerged as an increasingly important component of US foreign policy. Countries as diverse as the Philippines, Chile and Poland have all been subject to US democracy promotion initiatives. In the Middle East though, the US traditionally engaged authoritarian governments as a means of ensuring its core interests in the region. However the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the G. W. Bush administration's perception of the Middle East's 'democratic deficit' as underlying cause, initiated a significant departure in the traditional direction of US policy. Democracy promotion subsequently emerged as a central tenet of US policy to the Middle East. This thesis argues that, as part of the strategy of democracy promotion in the Middle East, the US has sought to gradually replace proxy authoritarian governments with elite-based democracies. From a neo-Gramscian perspective, this strategic shift can be seen as a move from coercive to consensual forms of social control, the underlying aim being to ensure a more enduring form of stability in the states concerned. This is part of a long-term US strategy, evidences prior in other regions such as Latin America, which ultimately aims at the achievement of a Gramscian hegemony; that is the internalisation by other societies of the US interpretation of 'democracy', and associated norms and values, as the natural order. Utilising an analytical framework derived from the neo-Gramscian approach, the thesis focuses in the main on the Clinton (1993 - 2001) and G. W. Bush (2001 - 2008) administrations, and uses the following case studies - Egypt, Irag and Kuwait - to examine the US strategy of democracy promotion in the Middle East...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study is to examine attitudes and values, through questionnaires, among students and teachers in the last grade of primary school (grade 8) regarding issues related to authoritarianism, democracy, human rights, children rights, conflict resolution and legislation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A second aim is to explore and analyze the role of the international community in the democratization and education processes in the light of globalization in this country through secondary sources of data, site visits and observations. Analysis of the student sample reveals suspicion towards democracy, especially when democracy was associated with politics and politicians. When the issue of democracy was de-contextualized from Bosnia and Herzegovina realities in the questionnaire, students showed more positive attitudes towards it. Students generally agreed with very strong authoritarian statements. High achieving students were more democratic, more socially responsible, more tolerant regarding attitudes towards religion, race and disabilities, and less authoritarian compared to low achievers. High achievers felt that they had influence over daily events, and were positive towards social and civil engagement. High achievers viewed politics negatively, but had high scores on the democracy scale. High achievers also agreed to a larger extent that it is acceptable to break the law. The more authoritarian students were somewhat more prone to respond that it is not acceptable to break the law. The major findings from the teacher sample show that teachers who agreed with non-peaceful mediation, and had a non-forgiving and rigid approach to interpersonal conflicts, also agreed with strong authoritarian statements and were less democratic. In general, teachers valued students who behave respectfully, have a good upbringing and are obedient. They were very concerned about the general status of education in society, which they felt was becoming marginalized. Teachers were not happy with the overloaded curricula and they showed an interest in more knowledge and skills to help children with traumatic war experiences. When asked about positive reforms, teachers were highly critical of, and dissatisfied with, the educational situation. Bosnia and Herzegovina is undergoing a transition from a <b>state-planned</b> <b>economy</b> and one party system to a market economy and a multi party system. During this transition, the country has become more involved in the globalization process than ever. Today the country is a semi-protectorate where international authorities intervene when necessary. The International community is attempting to introduce western democracy and some of the many complexities in this process are discussed in this study. Globalization processes imply contradictory demands and pressures on the education system. On one hand, economic liberalization has affected education policies —a closer alignment between education and economic competitiveness. On the other hand, there is a political and ideological globalization process underlying the importance of human rights, and the inclusiveness of education for all children. Students and teachers are caught between two opposing ideals — competition and cooperation...|$|E
