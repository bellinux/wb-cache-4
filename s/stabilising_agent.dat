40|$|Hollow Gold Nanospheres (HGNs) {{exhibit a}} unique {{combination}} of properties which provide great scope {{for their use}} in many biomedical applications. However, they are highly unstable to changes in their surrounding environment and {{have a tendency to}} aggregate, particularly when exposed to high salt concentrations or changes in pH which is not ideal for applications such as cell imaging and drug delivery where stable solutions are required for efficient cellular uptake. Therefore there is a significant need to find a suitable <b>stabilising</b> <b>agent</b> for HGNs, however potential stabilising agents for these nanostructures have not previously been compared. Within this work we present an improved method for stabilising HGNs which simultaneously shifts the SPR from around 700 nm to 800 nm or greater.

40|$|Polysaccharides provide high {{potential}} {{to be used as}} rheology modifying admixtures in mineral binder systems for the construction industry such as concrete or mortar. Since superplasticizers have become state of technology, today, concrete is more and more adjusted to flowable consistencies. This often goes along with the risk of segregation, which can be effectively avoided by adding <b>stabilising</b> <b>agents</b> supplementary to superplasticizers. <b>Stabilising</b> <b>agents</b> are typically based on polysaccharides such as cellulose, sphingan gum, or starch. Starch clearly distinguishes in its effect on rheology from other polysaccharides, mainly due to the strong influence of amylopectin on the dispersion and stabilisation of particles. Based on rheometric investigations on cementitious and limestone based dispersions with different volumetric water to solid ratios, the mode of operation of modified potato starch is explained in comparison to a sphingan gum. It is shown that the stabilising effect of starch in a coarsely dispersed system is mainly depending upon the water to solid ratio and that above a certain particle volume threshold starch mainly affects the dynamic yield stress of dispersions, while plastic viscosity is affected only to a minor degree. Sphingans operate more independent of the particle volume in a coarsely dispersed system and show significantly higher effect on the plastic viscosity than on the yield stress. In systems incorporating superplasticizers, influences of both <b>stabilising</b> <b>agents</b> on yield stress retreat into the background, while both observed polysaccharides maintain their effect on the plastic viscosity...|$|R

A total of 681 records were identified through a database search, a hand search and via additional industry requests. Studies were selected according to predefined criteria. In the end, 56 studies met our inclusion criteria. Several studies have shown that oxerutin-containing agents (Venoruton®), flavonoid-fraction-containing agents (Daflon®), 50 mg of aescin-containing agents (Venosin retard®) and calcium dobesilate-containing agents (Doxium®) can improve the signs and symptoms of CVI compared to placebo, especially when added to compression stockings. Thus, the strength of evidence of the studies was mostly low. For a treatment of HD, the studies for oxerutin-containing agents and flavonoid fraction containing agents have shown that the severity of signs and symptoms of HD can be reduced slightly further with the agents than with placebo.

40|$|Microtubule <b>stabilising</b> <b>agents</b> are a {{class of}} {{cytotoxic}} compounds that cause mitotic arrest through inhibition of microtubule function. They specifically target β-tubulin subunits promoting tubulin polymerisation, which eventually leads to cell death. Members of this drug class include the cancer chemotherapeutics paclitaxel and ixabepilone. However, like many cytotoxic agents, tumour cells often develop multi-drug resistance phenotypes limiting the effectiveness of such compounds. This results from the expulsion of these drugs from cells by efflux pumps, as well as mutation of their binding site. Much effort {{has been focused on}} improving the utility of this important drug class in the ongoing fight against cancer. The microtubule <b>stabilising</b> <b>agents</b> peloruside A and laulimalide originate from marine sponge species native to the South Pacific. They have similar pharmacological profiles to paclitaxel and ixabepilone, however with several unique properties. They are poor substrates for efflux pumps and target a different region on β-tubulin subunits, giving them the potential for treatment of resistant tumours. This represents a novel mechanism of action that may be exploited for drug development, and further characterisation of the binding site is warranted. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the contribution of two amino acids of human βItubulin to the interactions with peloruside A and laulimalide. Specifically, glu 127 and lys 124 have been predicted by computational modelling and analogue studies to form hydrogen bonds and other associations with the two compounds. These amino acids are located on β-tubulin subunits adjacent to the main binding pocket of peloruside A and laulimalide, and represent a potential inter-protofilament interaction that does not occur with other microtubule <b>stabilising</b> <b>agents.</b> This binding mechanism has not yet been shown by crystallography and is hence based solely on in silico work, requiring biological validation. HEK 293 cells were transfected with βI-tubulin with these amino acids mutated to alanines to prevent hydrogen bond formation. Cell proliferation assays, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting were used to study the effect loss of the inter-protofilament interaction has on the bioactivity of peloruside A and laulimalide. These mutations did not significantly alter the concentration-response of cells to either drug in the cell proliferation assay. However, accumulation of cells in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle and the proportion of transfected cells showing signs of mitotic arrest significantly decreased for E 127 A mutant cells compared to wild type βI-tubulin transfected control cells treated with peloruside A. Furthermore, a similar reduction in cell cycle block was also seen in E 127 A mutant cells treated with the negative control ixabepilone, which binds to a different site on β-tubulin. No evidence seen in this study suggests that either amino acid plays a major role in peloruside A or laulimalide target binding. However, the amino acid E 127 is important for inter-protofilament associations independent of drug treatment, as its mutation appeared to reduce global stability of microtubule structures. This information requires further validation, it may be useful in the design of future analogue syntheses as development of these promising drug candidates continues...|$|R

In this project, acquired resistance of neuroblastoma cell lines to tubulin-binding agents was studied. We investigated the resistance profiles of 10 clonal sub-lines of the docetaxel-resistant neuroblastoma cell line, UKF-NB- 3 rDOCE 10 and 4 epothilone B-resistant UKF-NB- 3 sub-lines that had been established in independent experiments against the tubulin-binding agents: combretastatin A 4, 2 -methoxyestradiol (destabilising agents, target the colchicine domain), vincristine, vinblastine (destabilising agents, target the vinca-domain), docetaxel, and epothilone B (<b>stabilising</b> <b>agents,</b> bind at the taxoid domain). Remarkable differences were detected in the resistance profiles of the UKF-NB- 3 rDOCE 10 sub-clones and the epothilone B-resistant UKF-NB- 3 sub-lines. Further, we started to establish a protocol for the standardised adaptation of cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. In uneven weeks, 40000 UKF-NB- 3 cells per cm 2 were treated with the IC 50 concentration of the selected drug. In even weeks, 4000 UKF-NB- 3 cells per cm 2 were allowed {{to grow in the}} absence of drug. We started to establish 10 cabazitaxel-, 10 epothilone B- and 10 paclitaxel-resistant UKF-NB- 3 sub-lines by this approach. The paclitaxel-treated sub-lines displayed a trend towards decreased paclitaxel sensitivity relative to UKF-NB- 3 after four and eight weeks, while the epothilone B- and cabazitaxel-treated sub-lines displayed a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to the respective drugs. In conclusion, our data suggest 1) that the repeated adaptation of a cell line to the same drug results in heterogenic sub-lines, 2) that the adaptation of a cancer cell line to a drug results in heterogeneity in the resulting resistant sub-line (as opposed to the selection of a pre-existing drug-resistant sub-population) and 3) that exposure of a cell population to different drugs with a similar mechanism of action may result in varying outcomes...|$|R

However, some of the hemicelluloses, primarily glucomannan, and lignin were lost during the impregnation. To improve the carbohydrate yield, three glucomannan modification agents: sodium borohydride, polysulphide and anthraquinone, were used, which increased the yields of the impregnated materials from 76. 6 % to 89. 6 %, 81. 3 % and 80. 0 %, respectively. Through the use of additives, most of the glucomannan could be retained in the wood while still allowing the enzymes to penetrate the wood and attack the polymers. The additives also increased the extraction yield from 9 to 12 % w/w wood. Gamanase treatment prior to the extraction increased the extraction yield to 14 %. Of the three <b>stabilising</b> <b>agents,</b> sodium borohydride was the most efficient, providing the highest extraction yields. Updated from manuscript to article in journal.
