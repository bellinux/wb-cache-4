40|$|This report {{provides}} the latest available information on national {{land use and}} land use change in Australia. SummaryLand use describes the purposes assigned to land. It refers to the purpose for which the land is committed. It is fundamental to understanding landscapes, agricultural production and the management of natural resources. Land use can include the production of goods (such as crops, timber and manufactures) and services (such as defence, recreations, biodiversity and natural resources protection). It also includes urban and rural settlement. Land use choices have a major effect on food production, the natural environment and communities. Land use change is central to much current debate in Australia around agriculture and food and <b>fibre</b> <b>security,</b> forestry, water management, mining, climate change mitigation and adaptation, population, urban expansion, biodiversity protection, community development and landscape aesthetics. This report {{provides the}} latest available information on national land use and land use change. It draws heavily on the ABARES time series of national scale land use maps and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) agricultural statistics as {{these are the most}} reliable and consistent for reporting on land use change at the national level. The strength of the ABARES national scale land use maps is that they combine ABS agricultural statistics with other land use information into one complete spatial dataset for Australia. The broad trends in agricultural land use change are as follows:Agriculture remains Australia 2 ̆ 7 s dominant land use, covering around 456 million hectares (ha) or 59 per cent of the continent in 2005 ‐ 06, a decrease of around 18. 8 million ha (4 per cent of the agricultural area) since 1992 ‐ 93. The most common agricultural land use by area is grazing on native vegetation and modified pastures which occupies 428 million ha or around 56 per cent of Australia and occurs mostly in the arid and semi‐arid regions of inland Australia. The area of grazing decreased by 6 per cent between 1992 ‐ 93 and 2005 ‐ 06. Over the same period, the area of land used for cropping increased by 39 per cent to 27 million ha (3. 5 per cent of Australia’s land area). These changes vary across the country, see Maps S 1 and S 2. In 2005 ‐ 06, areas of minimal use, nature conservation and other protected areas including Indigenous uses occupied around 282 million hectares or 37 per cent of Australia. Based on the Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database (CAPAD), between 1992 ‐ 93 and 2005 ‐ 06, the area of formal nature conservation increased by 15 million ha (37 per cent). In some regions, decreases in the area of land used for grazing are associated with increases in the area of land used for cropping and nature conservation although locations where direct conversions from one land use to another have occurred cannot be identified from the national‐scale data reviewed in this report. The number of farm businesses decreased from 144 860 in 1997 ‐ 98 to 135 447 in 2010 ‐ 11. However, decreases by farm size were only reflected in the medium (50 to 2 500 ha) category. The number of large farms (greater than 2 500 ha) and small farms (less than 50 ha) both increased between 1997 ‐ 98 and 2010 ‐ 11. Changes in farm size can arise from a range of factors including pressures to increase economic productivity and efficiency as well as sub‐division for peri‐urban lifestyle blocks or for more intensive production. While the growth in peri‐urban areas (those that lie on the fringe of the major built‐up areas of cities) can compete with agricultural land and the loss of agricultural land to urban growth is important, these changes do not necessarily translate into a decrease in the value of agricultural production. The Melbourne Statistical Division, for example, had only 2 per cent of the total area of Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural holdings in 2010 ‐ 11, but this area produced 13. 4 per cent (1. 2 billion) of the State’s agricultural commodities by value. Mining is also expanding into agricultural lands and some new coal seam gas developments occur in areas of high value agricultural activity. While the national picture suggests relatively modest changes in area for key land uses (grazing, cropping and nature conservation) over the period 1992 ‐ 93 to 2005 ‐ 06, regional land use change patterns can vary significantly from national trends. Over the longer term the impacts of increased climate variability and population pressure may strongly impact the location of agricultural and non‐agricultural activities. Changes in the location of traditional agricultural activities (grazing and cropping) are already emerging. Australia is improving its capacity to track land use change, drawing on information sources including satellite remote sensing and statistical collections. The next national scale land use map, based on 2010 ‐ 11 agricultural census information, is due for release by ABARES late in 2013 and will provide the opportunity to analyse change across the country for a number of key land uses (grazing, cropping and conservation) from 1992 ‐ 93 to 2010 ‐ 11. It will also be possible to analyse change for a wider range of land uses between 2005 ‐ 06 and 2010 ‐ 11. This is being developed by the Australian Collaborative Land Use and Management Program (ACLUMP), a consortium of national and state agencies coordinated by ABARES.  Authored by Jodie Mewett, Justyna Paplinska, Georgina Kelley, Rob Lesslie, Phil Pritchard and Christine Atyeo...|$|R

40|$|The {{counterfeit}} banknote {{is a growing}} threat to the society since the advancements {{in the field of}} computers, scanners and photocopiers, as they have made the duplication process for banknote much simpler. The fake note detection systems developed so far have many drawbacks such as high cost, poor accuracy, unavailability, lack of user-friendliness and lower effectiveness. One possible solution to this problem could be the use of a system uniquely linked to the banknote itself. In this paper, we present a unique identification and authentication process for the banknote using chaotic elements embedded in it. A chaotic element means that the physical elements are formed from a random process independent from human intervention. The chaotic elements used in this paper are the random distribution patterns of such <b>security</b> <b>fibres</b> set into the paper pulp. A unique ID is generated from the fibre pattern obtained from UV image of the note, which can be verified by any person who receives the banknote to decide whether the banknote is authentic or not. Performance analysis of the system is also studied in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{research is}} based on past years studies on innovation in biometric systems, {{which has led to}} verifying how, in all the biometry approach, exists a similar approach, defined in the research Biometry Paradigm, which {{is based on}} the identification and utilization of particular characteristics, having the properties to be univocal and measurable. Typical examples are fingerprint, iris, retina, hand geometry, face and so on. Starting from this consideration, we have tried to verify if a similar approach could be applied to valuable objects, such as banknotes, artworks, identification documents and, in general, to all the objects which have the necessity to be verified to fight against their counterfeiting. The research work was based on the identification of some characteristics, which can be measured in a non-destructive way, inside some notable case studies, such as banknotes, passports, drug packages, lithography, with the aim to create a method, starting from the past experiences in the biometric analysis, which allows to verify with a great accuracy objects’ authenticity. The methods developed in this research have been defined as Hylemetric Authentication, from Greek words ὕλη (hyle), for inanimate objects and μετρον (metros) for measurement. The study started from the analysis of the existing solutions adopted to put in secureness banknotes, documents, artworks’ certificates and drug packages. Starting from this analysis, in each case study, has been possible identify a set of different security systems and approach. In particular, it is possible define two categories of security approach:  Overt Authentication/Identification System, visible at human eye and verifiable in a simple manner by the final utilizer.  Covert Authentication/Identification System, not simply visible or visible under particular environmental conditions and/or using particular instrumentations. Typical examples of overt systems are holograms and intaglio printing on banknotes, shifting and changing inks, used on pharmacologic packages. Covert systems are typically ultraviolet inks, infrared patterns and so on, used always on banknotes. Sometimes, mixed systems are also proposed, such as 1 D and 2 D barcodes, which at first analysis can be considered as overt systems, but the necessity to use dedicated and sometimes also complex decoding systems, allows to catalogue it as mixed system. In fact, its presence is sometimes considered as proof of originality, but in reality the originality can be proven only analysing the content of the barcode, which sometimes results encrypted. Focusing on research case studying, banknotes presents both overt and covert solutions, whereas overt or mixed ones in general characterize drugs packages. Lithography and artworks in general have been authenticated using only paper certificate of authenticity, without any automatic or semi-automatic verification system. In any case, this approach can be categorized as overt, because the presence of a Certificate of Authenticity with signature and stamp on it is generally considered sufficient to be sure on the artwork originality. Starting from this state-of-art, the research has tried to verify the possibility to apply the biometric approach to these case studies, with the aim to enforce the authentication and anti-counterfeiting process with an innovative solution. For making this, the first step is the identification, for each case study, of at least one univocal characteristic, present on the analyzed object at priori (e. g. Banknotes <b>security</b> <b>fibres),</b> or added on it (e. g. white light speckles added on drug packages), which has the requested requirements to be categorized as Hylemetric Characteristic. In particular a characteristic, to be considered as usable in the Hylemetric approach, has to have the following basic properties:  Uniqueness: every objects should be identifiable and distinguishable from all others;  Consistency: feature vector should be verifiable by multiple parties over the lifetime of the object;  Conciseness: feature vector should be short and easily computable;  Robustness: {{it should be possible to}} verify the feature vector even if the object has been subjected to harsh treatment;  Resistance to Forgery: it should be very difficult and costly, or impossible for an adversary, to forge a document by coercing a second object to express the same feature vector as the original one. For any of the case study analyzed during the research course, it has been possible to identify proper characteristics which have all these properties. The acquisition of them changes from object to object, has in biometry paradigm, depending on the object physical characteristics, but the verification approach is similar for all the analyzed ones. In banknote case, we have used metallic <b>security</b> <b>fibres</b> as Hylemetric characteristic. They have the physical property to shine in the visible spectrum when illuminated by ultraviolet light at a precise wavelength. We have acquired the fibres distribution, creating a unique identification pattern based on them. This pattern has been encrypted and then coded in a bidimensional barcode, based on DataMatrix ECC 200 Standard. The proposed encryption has been made by means of Elliptic Curve, to reduce dimensions of pattern encrypted version and cope with DataMatrix maximum storage constraint. For artworks in general, we have made some experiments on lithography and then on oil and statue. The proposed approach has to modify the Certificate of Authenticity, introducing both new information on the paper version and a new digital version of it. All the modifications are based on the extraction of an Hylemetric characteristic from the artwork. In Lithography case, the typical stone impression leave a unique grain pattern, acquirable using a digital camera. For oil paints and statue using particular image manipulations and filters is possible from the acquired image obtaining a speckle-like pattern from the object structure. Analyzing the pharmacologic products packaging, we have decided to add on them the Hylemetric characteristic, using the so called White Light Speckle technique. We have used ultraviolet ink sprayed on a package’ particular area. In this way each package has been stamped with a different Speckle Pattern. In any studied cases, independently from the acquired characteristic, has been possible defining a Hylemetric Template, which allows to authenticate the related object. In some cases the defined template has been converted into a 2 D Barcode to be directly put on the object (e. g. banknotes, drug packages), or has been codified to be inserted in a Digital Certificate of Authenticity (e. g. artworks). In the case of barcodes, we have used both standard DataMatrix, or a new 2 D Barcode based on Computer Generated Holograms, defined HoloBarcode. In some case the barcode has been proposed to be put on the object using infrared ink, to maintain the original object aspect and to increase the system security as well. The usage of infrared ink starting from the necessity to put it on banknotes, plenty of visible and invisible security artefacts. The infrared band is empty on over the 80 % of the banknote surface in both sides and it is possible to find the proper area where to put the barcode. Otherwise, the introduction of a non-standard bidirectional barcode, based on CGH, has been proposed in such cases where the object to be analysed can be heavily manipulated and ruined. HoloBarcode has the great advantage to be highly resistant to loss of information (i. e. loss of part of the barcode area) and to offer the possibility to extract information also starting from only a little part of the barcode. However, the storage capacity of these barcodes is very poor, if compared with standard 2 D Barcodes with same dimensions. In conclusion, during this research we have analysed the state-of-art of security features applied to valuable objects. Then, starting from a biometric approach, has been proposed an Hylemetric paradigm, which allows to authenticate objects starting from their intrinsic characteristics. We have made tests on different type of objects, such as banknotes, passports, lithography, oil paints, drug packages, obtaining in any case the correct definition of a Hylemetric Procedure, similar in any case, and a Hylemetric Template to be used in verification phase. After that we have also proposed a new bi-dimensional barcode, based on Synthetic Holograms, to be used in particular cases instead of Standard ones to store the Hylemetric Template for offline verification activities...|$|E
