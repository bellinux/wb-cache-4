2500|$|Globally, opium has {{gradually}} been superseded {{by a variety}} of purified, semi-synthetic, and synthetic opioids with progressively stronger effects, and by other general anesthetics. This process began in 1804, when Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner first isolated morphine from the opium poppy. The process continued until 1817, when Sertürner published the isolation of pure morphine from opium after at least thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys. The great advantage of purified morphine was that a patient could be treated with a known dose—whereas with raw plant material, as Gabriel Fallopius once lamented, [...] "if <b>soporifics</b> are weak they do not help; if they are strong they are exceedingly dangerous." [...] Morphine was the first pharmaceutical isolated from a natural product, and this success encouraged the isolation of other alkaloids: by 1820, isolations of noscapine, strychnine, veratrine, colchicine, caffeine, and quinine were reported. Morphine sales began in 1827, by Heinrich Emanuel Merck of Darmstadt, and helped him expand his family pharmacy into the Merck KGaA pharmaceutical company.|$|E

Upon <b>soporifics,</b> sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, I am told, unequalled. He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, and I suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his making, little glades of illumination, that, until he sees fit to publish his results, are still inaccessible to every other living man. And {{in the last few years}} he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants, and already, before the discovery of the New Accelerator, very successful with them. Medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men. In cases of exhaustion the preparation known as Gibberne's B Syrup has, I suppose, saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the coast.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of all this, poor Lionel's {{threatened}} misfortune gave Caroline, as it were, a glimpse down a long dark road, where nothing had ever yet caused her to look; yet who could say whether it might not be her's to tread it? Affliction, sickness, sorrow, death, certain at last,--there was but one stay in them; and what if she should lose it,--if she was losing it already? I She thought of bearing them with him,--of the hollowness, the fallacy, the utter misery of trying to be sustained by aught that had not its foundations firmly fixed beyond the grave,--of not looking as sorrow as fatherly chastisement. (Caroline hardly yet entered into its still higher claim,) or at death as the gate of life. And O! if she loved him as her husband, what would it be to see him die, thinking, or even having thought, as he too surely did? All the train of fallacies about sincerity rather than forms of faith,--all the hopes that he might yet be brought to see the truth, and that she might be the means, were only <b>soporifics</b> for a moment, which failed to still the ever growing agony. She knew there was nothing in them, and that they were only extenuations; but still, amid all her unhappiness, there was a resolution to persevere, a want of moral courage which determined her to go on, and enter on such a life as this, rather than go through all that would ensue on an attempt to break off the match. Thus, though her reluctance was increasing, and she now sought to put off the decisive day, instead of precipitating it, as at first, all she attempted was to have the wedding deferred in consequence of her brother's condition; and though, logically taken, there was no great reason in the request, every one agreed it was a very amiable feeling, and so her desire was complied with. She would have avoided Marian more than ever, but this could hardly be, now that her cousin was in fuller sympathy, with all the family than she had ever been before; and little as was her immediate power with Lionel, Caroline would have given worlds even for that. Thus, as has been shown, the old sympathy grew up again; the root, blighted months ago, shot out once more, and at last accident and impulse led Caroline to do what she had little expected ever to have done,--to pour out all her griefs, cares, and doubts to Marian, knowing all the time what she would say, and resolved against her advice, yet irresistibly impelled to go on, as if talking would relieve her of her burthen, and resting on the solid, firm truth of that deep love, which manifested itself by few tokens indeed, but those were of extreme worth.|$|E
6000|$|Before I {{consider}} these Remarks {{along with the}} other reasonings which I hear on the same subject, I beg leave to recall to your mind the observation I made early in our correspondence, and which ought to attend us quite through the discussion of this proposed peace, amity, or fraternity, or whatever you may call it,--that is, the real quality and character of the party you have to deal with. This I find, as a thing of no importance, has everywhere escaped the author of the October Remarks. That hostile power, to the period of the fourth week in that month, has been ever called and considered as an usurpation. In that week, for the first time, it changed its name of an usurped power, and took the simple name of France. The word France is slipped in just as if the government stood exactly as before that Revolution which has astonished, terrified, and almost overpowered Europe. [...] "France," [...] says the author, [...] "will do this,"--"it is the interest of France,"--"the returning honor and generosity of France," [...] &c., &c.--always merely France: just as if we were in a common political war with an old recognized member of the commonwealth of Christian Europe,--and as if our dispute had turned upon a mere matter of territorial or commercial controversy, which a peace might settle by the imposition or the taking off a duty, with the gain or the loss of a remote island or a frontier town or two, on the one side or the other. This shifting of persons could not be done without the hocus-pocus of abstraction. We have been in a grievous error: we thought that we had been at war with rebels against the lawful government, but that we were friends and allies of what is properly France, friends and allies to the legal body politic of France. But by sleight of hand the Jacobins are clean vanished, and it is France we have got under our cup. [...] "Blessings on his soul that first invented sleep!" [...] said Don Sancho Panza the Wise. All those blessings, and ten thousand times more, on him who found out abstraction, personification, and impersonals! In certain cases they are the first of all <b>soporifics.</b> Terribly alarmed we should be, if things were proposed to us in the concrete, and if fraternity was held out to us with the individuals who compose this France by their proper names and descriptions,--if we were told that it was very proper to enter into the closest bonds of amity and good correspondence with the devout, pacific, and tender-hearted Sieyès, with the all-accomplished Reubell, with the humane guillotinists of Bordeaux, Tallien and Isabeau, with the meek butcher, Legendre, and with [...] "the returned humanity and generosity" [...] (that had been only on a visit abroad) of the virtuous regicide brewer, Santerre. This would seem at the outset a very strange scheme of amity and concord,--nay, though we had held out to us, as an additional douceur, an assurance of the cordial fraternal embrace of our pious and patriotic countryman, Thomas Paine. But plain truth would here be shocking and absurd; therefore comes in abstraction and personification. [...] "Make your peace with France." [...] That word France sounds quite as well as any other; and it conveys no idea but that of a very pleasant country and very hospitable inhabitants. Nothing absurd and shocking in amity and good correspondence with France. Permit me to say, that I am not yet well acquainted with this new-coined France, and without a careful assay I am not willing to receive it in currency in place of the old Louis-d'or.|$|E

5000|$|... «Problems {{of general}} {{pharmacology}} occupied {{a prominent place}} among Professor Kravkov's works. He studied the relationship between dose and effect of preparations, the combined effect of medicaments, the influence of temperature on pharmacologic effect and tissue adaptation to poisons. He elaborated the teaching on the phasic effect of drugs, showing that this effect depended on {{the difference between the}} drug's concentration in the tissue and in the environment. Professor Kravkov was an ardent supporter of the idea of relationship between chemical composition of a substance and its pharmacologic effect. He found in particular that the narcotic effect of aliphatic spirits in the homologous sequence increases with the growth of the number of carbon atoms in their molecules, and that the effect of sugar on the heart depends on its stereo chemical structure. A comparative study of diverse <b>soporifics</b> conducted by Professor Kravkov resulted in materialization of his idea of aplying non-volatile somnifacients for general anesthesia. Thus, Professor Kravkov suggested application of Hedonal for intravenous anesthesia, which was immediately tested in clinics, and enjoys general recognition today. Professor Kravkov also suggested using Hedonal in combination with chloroform, which started application of so-called combined anesthesia with volatile and non-volatile or basic narcotics.|$|E
5000|$|One {{treatment}} for obstructive hypopnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is a treatment {{in which the}} patient wears a mask over the nose and/or mouth. An air blower forces air through the upper airway. The air pressure is adjusted {{so that it is}} just enough to maintain the oxygen saturation levels in the blood. Another treatment is sometimes a custom fitted oral appliance. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's protocol for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) recommends oral appliances for those who prefer them to CPAP and have mild to moderate sleep apnea or those that do not respond to/cannot wear a CPAP. Severe cases of OSA may be treated with an oral appliance if the patient has had a trial run with a CPAP. Oral Appliances should be custom made by a dentist with training in dental sleep medicine. [...] Mild obstructive hypopnea can often be treated by losing weight or by avoiding sleeping on one's back. Also quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol, sedatives and hypnotics (<b>soporifics)</b> before sleep can be quite effective. Surgery is generally a last resort in hypopnea treatment, but is a site-specific option for the upper airway. Depending on the cause of obstruction, surgery may focus on the soft palate, the uvula, tonsils, adenoids or the tongue. There are also more complex surgeries that are performed with the adjustment of other bone structures - the mouth, nose and facial bones.|$|E

40|$|Recently the {{publication}} of papers by Pick (1), von Economo (2), Demole (3, 4), Keeser and Keeser (5, 6) has caused much discussion about the point of action of <b>soporifics.</b> In general these authors divided these drugs into two groups: Those acting upon the cerebrum and those acting upon the brain stem. The barbiturates were classed as representatives of the latter group. Three methods were used by these authors to determine the point of action of soporifics: (a), administration of the drug after abla-tion of {{different parts of the}} central nervous system; (b), local application of solutions of these drugs to different parts of the brain; and (c), determining the quantities of drugs deposited in the various parts of the brain following systemic administration. Having developed methods of extraction and means of colon-metric determination of barbiturates, we endeavored to apply these methods to the elucidation of the above, and in our opinion, still moot question of the locus of action of these drugs in the central nervous system. EXPERIMENTAL Dogs were used throughout the experiments. Different barbi-turates were administered in alkaline aqueous solutions intra-venously. Anesthetic doses were injected in each case.

The importance of removing these medications from the patients ’ therapeutic regimes prior to obtaining specimens for such endo-crine procedures is stressed. I N RECENT YEARS, many new pharmaceuticals such as tranquilizers, diuretics, etc., have achieved a new high in professional acceptance and usage.

Knowledge about the movement of problem birds is essential for determining those points in their daily and seasonal movement cycles where {{they are likely to be}} more vulnerable to control. Banding and marking programs are presently the primary means of gathering movement data. Since 1960, Denver personnel and cooperators have banded nearly 200, 000 starlings and blackbirds in Arizona, Nevada, California, Colorado, Oregon, South Dakota, and North Dakota. About 60, 000 of these birds were also color-tagged with leg streamers to increase the normally low recovery rate of starlings and blackbirds and to provide data on the feeding, movement, and roosting patterns of local populations. The most successful and efficient trapping technique used to capture these birds was the use of bait traps such as the modified Australian crow trap and the decoy trap used successfully by Patuxent Research Center biologists. Use of long-handled dip-nets in frozen marsh roosts at night and cannon nets and chemical <b>soporifics</b> in feeding and preroosting areas also resulted in thousands of banded birds.
