5|$|Developing as a {{tropical}} depression near Nassau in the Bahamas on September 12, Felice had {{its origins in}} a persistent upper-level trough over the area. The nascent depression tracked <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> the west-southwest without much intensification, ultimately passing just north of Key West, Florida as it entered the Gulf of Mexico. Over the open waters of the Gulf, the system accelerated toward the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a large ridge of high pressure to the north. While reconnaissance aircraft data on the storm suggested that the depression strengthened into {{a tropical}} storm midday on September 14, the official Atlantic tropical cyclone database known as HURDAT indicates the disturbance attained tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on September 15.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Grant's career {{suffered}} temporarily in {{the aftermath}} of Shiloh. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. Meanwhile, Beauregard remained in command of the Army of Mississippi and led it back to Corinth. In late April and May, the Union armies, under Halleck's personal command, advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> Corinth and captured it, while an amphibious force on the Mississippi River destroyed the Confederates' River Defense Fleet and captured Memphis, Tennessee. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies. With Halleck's departure to the East, Grant was restored to command and eventually pushed down the Mississippi River to besiege Vicksburg, Mississippi. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, the Mississippi River was under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in two.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very <b>slowly,</b> <b>toward</b> the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{cut across}} the Elle River and advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> Saint-Lô, fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedge rows. German reserves formed a new defensive front outside the town, and American forces fought a fierce battle with them two miles outside of the town. German forces used the dense bocage foliage to their advantage, mounting fierce resistance in house-to-house fighting in the ravaged Saint-Lô. By {{the end of the}} fight, the Germans were relying on artillery support to hold the town following the depletion of the infantry contingent. The 29th Division, which was already undermanned after heavy casualties on D-Day, was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint-Lô. Eventually, the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault, supported by airstrikes from P-47 Thunderbolts.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7, it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia, becoming a hurricane the next day. It churned nearly stationary {{for two days}} {{off the coast of}} Florida where significant coastal erosion resulted from the churning waves. On September 12, the storm began moving <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> North Carolina, at times nearly stalling and alternating between tropical storm and hurricane intensity. The hurricane did not make landfall, although the western eyewall reached the coastal areas of North Carolina, causing extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Ophelia moved north and became extratropical late on September 17 near Nova Scotia, but it continued northeastward, producing strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
25|$|When {{a female}} comes to mate, she {{lands on the}} perch site. The male will then either lunge or walk <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> the female. The male mounts the female for {{approximately}} 8 seconds and extends its curled antennae and draws the female antennae upward in a behavior called lassoing. Following mating, females will walk {{over the surface of}} the perch site, dragging their abdomens, before flying off.|$|E

The French Army has captured the city of Toledo and the Inquisition has fallen into its enemies' hands.|$|E
25|$|With all the {{locomotives}} shut down, the {{air compressor}} no longer supplied {{air to the}} air brake system. As air leaked from the brake system, the main air reservoirs were slowly depleted, gradually reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} locomotive air brakes. At 00:56, the air pressure had dropped to a point at which the combination of locomotive air brakes and hand brakes could no longer hold the train, and it began to roll downhill toward Lac-Mégantic, just over seven miles away. A witness recalled watching the train moving <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> Lac-Mégantic without the locomotive lights on. The track was not equipped with signals to alert the rail traffic controller to the presence of a runaway train.|$|E
25|$|On 22 July, NLA insurgent {{positions}} in the villages north of Tetovo, {{as well as in}} the Drenovec suburb, started a massive onslaught against the Macedonian police near the villages as well as inside Tetovo. The attacks started at 11:00 with an attack on the police positions at the city stadium, Drenovec 2, and the army barracks on the outskirts of the city. The police answered fire leading to an outburst of heavy fighting. Fighting continued uninterrupted for a second day, and the insurgents moved <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> the city stadium, and Drenovec 2 suburb, and approached the city centre. On the same day the Defence Minister warned the NLA to withdraw from ground it had taken during the truce or face an all-out attack.|$|E

25|$|In early April 1862, McClellan, having landed {{his troops}} at Fort Monroe {{at the tip}} of the Virginia Peninsula, began to move <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> Yorktown. Johnston's plan for the defense of the Confederate capital was controversial. Knowing that his army was half the size of McClellan's and that the Union Navy could provide direct support to McClellan from either river, Johnston {{attempted}} to convince Davis and Lee that the best course would be to concentrate in fortifications around Richmond. He was unsuccessful in persuading them and deployed most of his force on the Peninsula. Following lengthy siege preparations by McClellan at Yorktown, Johnston withdrew and fought a sharp defensive fight at Williamsburg (May 5) and turned back an attempt at an amphibious turning movement at Eltham's Landing (May 7). By late May the Union army was within six miles of Richmond.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Napoleon invaded Spain {{with a huge}} army in late 1808, {{scattered}} the Spanish forces, {{and seized}} Madrid. However, {{the appearance of a}} British army commanded by John Moore caused the French emperor to order his army to pursue the British into northwest Spain. With their enemies spread thin, the Spanish armies began to revive. In late December 1808, the Army of the Center led by Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> Madrid, causing alarm among the scanty French forces guarding the capital. The cautious Infantado sent his lieutenant Venegas with a strong vanguard to annoy the French. After Venegas won a minor action at Tarancón, Victor concentrated his corps and marched against him in mid-January 1809. Without instructions or support from Infantado, Venegas unwisely tried to hold a strong position at Uclés. Victor overwhelmed the Spanish defenders with one division and herded many of them into the arms of his second division which had marched around their flank. Gathering up Venegas' survivors, Infantado led his crippled army into the mountains but not before losing much of his artillery. Blamed for the fiasco, Infantado was relieved of command. The next action in the area was the Battle of Ciudad Real in March.|$|E
500|$|The {{depression}} moved <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> {{the southwest}} and became better organized, despite {{a decrease in the}} coverage of deep convection. By late September 28 the depression was approaching tropical storm status; it turned to the northwest and attained winds of [...] at 0600 UTC on September 29, at which time it was assigned the name Otis. That evening, wind shear relented and conditions became more favorable for the storm's intensification. Convection wrapped almost fully around the center, and early on September 3, Otis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye feature developed; it quickly became better defined as it entered the scope of weather radar in Cabo San Lucas.|$|E

500|$|After the war ended, Compton {{resigned}} {{his chair}} as Charles H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago {{and returned to}} Washington University in St. Louis, where [...] he was inaugurated as the university's ninth Chancellor in 1946. During Compton's time as Chancellor, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952, named its first female full professor, and enrolled record numbers of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States. His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university. Despite Compton's accomplishments, he was criticized then, and subsequently by historians, for moving too <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> full racial integration, making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in St. Louis to open its doors to African Americans.|$|E
500|$|Before Charles could regroup, orders {{arrived from}} the Aulic Council, the {{imperial}} body in Vienna charged with conduct of war, to overset his plan; Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the supposedly capable hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and march north to Mainz. Charles stalled this operation {{as long as he}} could, but eventually he had to concede to Vienna's orders. Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander in the strategically important city. Charles withdrew his force {{to the north of the}} Rhine and marched <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> Mainz. In Italy, the Russian generalissimo, Alexander Suvorov, was horrified when he heard this: [...] he depended upon a stable Austro-Russian presence in Switzerland to protect his flank and he expected to join this army by September or October at the latest. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached him, he had gone too far to return to Zurich in time.|$|E
500|$|The overall {{sound of}} Until the Whole World Hears has been {{described}} as 'pure American rock', 'soft adult contemporary', and 'CCM'. Robert Ham of Christianity Today regarded the album as comparable to the sound of rock bands Creed and Nickelback. One critic observed that most of the songs on the album [...] "start off with chords plunked out on a piano or strummed slowly on a guitar, letting the song build <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> a massive wave of sound". The title track {{has been described}} as having a [...] "real rock vibe" [...] infused by electric guitar riffs, while [...] "Shadow of Your Wings" [...] {{has been described as}} an [...] "unashamed rock-n-roll jam". [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is driven by a [...] "pulsing" [...] and [...] "driving" [...] string section that [...] "calls to mind Coldplay's 'Viva la Vida'". [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Blessed Redeemer" [...] feature female-fronted vocals, the former sung by Megan Garrett and the latter sung by Melodee DeVevo; on [...] "At Your Feet", Hector Cervantes and Juan DeVevo joining Mark Hall on vocals.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} week of May2015, a strong cold front became {{stationary}} {{to the north of the}} Greater Antilles, where warm ocean waters dissipated the temperature gradient across the front. The western section of the front drifted westward as a surface trough of low pressure. Arriving at the Bahamas by May 5, the trough was attended by an expanse of showers and thunderstorms extending from the northwestern Caribbean Sea to southern Florida. A sharp mid- to upper-level trough interacted with the system and facilitated gradual cyclogenesis, and early on May 6, a distinct, non-tropical center of low pressure developed off southeastern Florida. Tracking <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> the north over the next two days, the system showed signs of increased organization, and a Hurricane Hunter aircraft found tropical storm-force winds to the north and west of the center on May 7. With the development of deep convection, the system was classified Subtropical Storm Ana at 00:00 UTC on May 8, while situated about [...] to the south-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Due to its involvement with the upper trough, as well as its large wind field, the system was considered subtropical, as opposed to fully tropical.|$|E
500|$|The {{team was}} formed in August 1995 when Scott Antol signed a WCW {{contract}} and was placed with [...] "tag team specialist" [...] Marcus Alexander Bagwell. In the process, both men changed their ring names, Antol changing his last name to [...] "Riggs" [...] and Bagwell shortening his name to simply Marcus Bagwell. Once together, they both wore short shorts and leather vests [...] (later wrestling tights and suspenders) to the ring and began clapping their hands over their head in time with their entrance music, which sang their praises between choruses of the team name being repeated over and over. They wrestled on the first episode of Nitro, defeating World Tag Team Champions Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck in a non-title match. [...] Their first major appearance together came at the Fall Brawl pay-per-view, where they defeated The Nasty Boys in a match that aired on Main Event. Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine stated that the team [...] "work well as a unit and could soon challenge for the belts". Bagwell commented on the team in a scripted interview, saying that he believed that his previous tag teams had failed {{because they were in}} a rush to win the title belts and that he planned to work <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> a title victory with Riggs.|$|E
