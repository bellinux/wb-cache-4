40|$|The {{basis for}} {{determining}} {{the size of the}} random sample of tubes to be inspected in replacement steam generators is revisited in this paper. A procedure to estimate the maximum number of defective tubes left in the steam generator after no defective tubes have been detected in the randomly selected inspection sample is proposed. A Bayesian estimation is used to obtain closed-form solutions for uniform, triangular and binomial prior densities describing the number of failed tubes in steam generators. It is shown that the particular way of selecting the random inspection sample (e. g., one sample from both SG, one sample from each SG, etc.) does not affect the results of the inspection and also the information obtained {{about the state of the}} uninspected tubing, as long as the inspected steam generators belong to the same population. Numerical examples further demonstrate two possible states of the knowledge existing before the inspection of the tubing. First, virtually no knowledge about the state of the steam generator tubing before the inspection is modeled using uniform and triangular prior densities. It is shown that the knowledge about the uninspected part of the tubing strongly depends on the size of the <b>sample</b> <b>inspected.</b> Further, even small inspection samples may significantly improve our knowledge about the uninspected part. On the other hand, rather strong belief on the state of the tubing prior to the inspection is modeled using binomial prior density. In this case, the knowledge about the uninspected part of the tubing is virtually independent on the size of the sample. Furthermore, it is shown qualitatively and quantitatively that such inspection brings no additional knowledge on the uninspected part of the tubing. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘environmental awareness’ has {{recently}} had {{a major impact on}} the textile industry and on the fashion world as well. In this context, the use of natural fibres and the development of natural dyeing processes gradually became important goals of the textile industry. Of all natural textile fibres, hemp is considered {{to be one of the}} strongest and most durable. A wide range of natural extracts have been used for natural textile coloration and dyeing. Dyes deriving from natural sources have emerged as an important alternative to synthetic dyes. Ecofriendly, nontoxic, sustainable and renewable natural dyes and pigments have been used for colouring the food substrate, leather, wood, natural fibres and fabrics from the dawn of human history. The purpose of the research is to obtain ecologically coloured fabrics for textiles by using a method of dyeing that relies on natural ingredients extracted from red beet, onion leaves and black tea. The experiments are conducted on three different types of hemp fabrics.

Despite a {{significant}} amount of research and management of Adelges tsugae (Homoptera: Adelgindae), no statistically based sampling method exists for this tiny and numerous pest. Binomial sequential sampling is currently very popular because it is one sampling plan that gives significant savings of cost and time.

The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine the potential role of frugivorous birds as seed dispersers in a restinga habitat. Data were collected in Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba, southeastern Brazil, where the main physiognomy (Open Clusia Formation) is characterized by the presence of patches of vegetation covering 20 to 48 % of the sandy soil and reaching a height of 5 m. Birds were captured with mist nets (12 x 2. 5 m; 36 mm mesh; 1 680 net-hrs) and had their fecal and regurgitate <b>samples</b> <b>inspected</b> for seeds. Six plant species found in these bird samples were studied. The germination of seeds obtained from plants was compared to those from the birds. Both groups of seeds were set on Petri dishes at room temperature and washed when infected with fungi. In general, there was no effect on germination rate, and the effect on germination speed was negative. Germination of seeds from Pilosocereus arrabidae treated by the birds seemed to be influenced by storage of defecated seeds, while few Miconia cinnamomifolia seeds both from plants and from birds germinated.

40|$|Colonies {{of honey}} bees (Apis mellifera L.) were {{surveyed}} {{for the presence}} of the honey bee tracheal mite (Acarapis woodi Rennie) in Finland between 1991 and 1997. Colony background information and winter loss data were obtained from beekeepers who had taken tracheal mite infested samples. A total of 2116 samples from honey bee colonies of 402 beekeepers were investigated. Infestations were found in 8 % of the beekeeping operations and in 10 % of the <b>samples</b> <b>inspected.</b> In the last years of the survey more than 20 % of apiaries were infested. This increase may be partly explained by tracheal mite infestations found in commercial queen-rearing apiaries. A field experiment with colonies infested at different levels showed that colonies in which 20 % or more of bees are infested with tracheal mites have an increased risk of dying during the winter under Finnish conditions. This infestation level was found among colonies in 92 % of the infested apiaries. Comparison of the tracheal mite prevalence in apiaries with their winter losses indicated that infestations were associated with colony mortality. The results of this survey point to the high pest potential of the tracheal mite in Finland, in contrast to findings on tracheal mites from elsewhere in Europe. Therefore, strategies to prevent further spread of the mite are highly recommended and methods for effective control should be sought. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the flaw detection sensitivity of advanced nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques with respect to structural applications. The techniques analyzed exemplify the incorporation of digital technology into NDT and includes the following: meandering winding magnetometer array (MWM-array@) eddy current, phased-array ultrasonic (PA-UT), three dimensional computed tomography (3 DCT), and digital radiography (DR). The three classes of <b>samples</b> <b>inspected</b> with these techniques consisted of alloy block specimens containing flat bottom hole (FBH) arrays, probability of detection (POD) wedding cake samples, and actual airplane engine components. Results from the sensitivity analyses were compared to current NDT techniques used industrially. An image analysis program called Cellprofiler was used to optimize the threshold correction factor for selected results. The Cellprofiler output was analyzed in conjunction with POD software, and the integration of digitally advanced NDT techniques with image analysis software resulted in approximately a threefold improvement in the minimum detectable flaw size at the 90 / 95 POD/CL level. An improved inspection methodology was presented which incorporated redundancy in the in-service inspection plan {{with the use of}} Bayesian updating techniques to forecast remnant life. Reliability block diagrams for structural disk and blade aircraft engine components were presented as examples of the methodology.
