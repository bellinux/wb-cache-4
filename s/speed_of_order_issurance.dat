Theoretically, Sokoloff has treated a simplified model for which an inverse velocity dependence for g, the coefficient of sliding friction, has been predicted. In lieu of experimental work and as an incentive to perform relevant experiments it is of interest to perform numerical experiments. Of particular relevance are molecular dynamics (MD) experiments for materials with well characterized density dependent interatomic interaction potentials. For ductile metals (e. g., copper, nickel, aluminum), such potentials exist and are capable of reproducing equations of state and defect properties have shown.

The spatial variations of the rotation vector generate strong singularities within the boundary layer, which have repercussions on the interior part of the solution. The second part of the article is devoted to the analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional waves. It is shown that the thin layer effect modifies the propagation of three-dimensional Poincaré waves by creating small scales.

40|$|Through {{the process}} of thermal ionization, intense stellar {{irradiation}} renders Hot Jupiter atmospheres electrically conductive. Simultaneously, lateral variability in the irradiation drives the global circulation with peak wind <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> ~ km/s. In turn, the interactions between the atmospheric flows and the background magnetic field give rise to Lorentz forces that can act to perturb the flow away from its purely hydrodynamical counterpart. Using analytical theory and numerical simulations, here we show that significant deviations away from axisymmetric circulation are unstable in presence of a non-negligible axisymmetric magnetic field. Specifically, our results suggest that dayside-to-nightside flows, often obtained {{within the context of}} three-dimensional circulation models, only exist on objects with anomalously low magnetic fields, while the majority of highly irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres are entirely dominated by zonal jets.
