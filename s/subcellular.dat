5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of <b>subcellular</b> objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of <b>subcellular</b> objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other <b>subcellular</b> organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Purified MAM from <b>subcellular</b> {{fractionation}} {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in phospholipid exchange, in addition to channels associated with Ca2+ signaling. These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of cellular lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated cellular phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for cellular metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear receptors are {{multifunctional}} {{proteins that}} transduce signals of their cognate ligands. Nuclear receptors (NRs) may be classified into two broad classes {{according to their}} mechanism of action and <b>subcellular</b> distribution {{in the absence of}} ligand.|$|E

25|$|The polyhistidine-tag {{can also}} be used to detect the protein via anti-polyhistidine-tag {{antibodies}} or alternatively by in-gel staining (SDS-PAGE) with fluorescent probes bearing metal ions.

25|$|EPAC1 is a {{multifunctional}} protein whose cellular {{functions are}} tightly regulated in {{spatial and temporal}} manners. EPAC1 is localized to various <b>subcellular</b> locations during different stages of the cell cycle. Through interactions {{with an array of}} cellular partners, EPAC1 has been shown to form discrete signalsomes at plasma membrane, nuclear-envelope, and cytoskeleton, where EPAC1 regulates numerous cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>subcellular</b> {{localization}} of Bok {{protein is}} controversial. In proliferating cells, Bok {{is found in}} the nucleus. Upon induction of apoptosis, it was found to tightly associate with mitochondrial membranes. On the other hand, another group found Bok shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In their experiments, increased nuclear (not mitochondrial) localization correlated with a stronger apoptotic activity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{more recent}} {{research}} has revealed {{that at least some}} prokaryotes have microcompartments such as carboxysomes. These <b>subcellular</b> compartments are 100–200nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins. Even more striking is the description of membrane-bound magnetosomes in bacteria, reported in 2006, as well as the nucleus-like structures of the Planctomycetes that are surrounded by lipid membranes, reported in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Enrichment in {{groupings of}} similar {{proteins}} – Motif often evolve convergently {{to carry out}} similar tasks in different proteins such as mediating binding to a specific partner or targeting proteins to a particular <b>subcellular</b> localisation. Often in such cases these grouping the motif occurs more often than is expected by chance and can be detected by searching for enriched motifs.|$|E
25|$|When {{scanning}} the fluorescent intensity across a plane one has fluorescence microscopy of tissues, cells, or <b>subcellular</b> structures, which {{is accomplished by}} labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labelling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image (multiple channels). DNA microarrays are a variant of this.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>subcellular</b> level, KCC2 {{has been}} found in {{membranes}} of the somata and dendrites of neurons, with no evidence of expression on axons. KCC2 has also been shown to colocalize with GABAA receptors, which serve as ligand-gated ion channels to allow chloride ion movement across the cell membrane. Under normal conditions, the opening of GABAA receptors permits the hyperpolarizing influx of chloride ions to inhibit postsynaptic neurons from firing.|$|E
25|$|The Melding Plague is a nanotech {{virus that}} attacks {{anything}} that has nanotechnology present within it and does not discriminate between organic and synthetic structures. It attempts to hybridise or meld the nanomachines and nanotechnological cybernetics that are commonly present in the bodies of humans with the biological structure of their tissues at a <b>subcellular</b> level. This results in horrific, uncontrolled, and invariably fatal modifications to the infected body.|$|E
25|$|At {{several places}} on the fossil muscle tissue is present. The degree of {{preservation}} is often exceptional, with not only the individual fibres still discernible but also the individual cells and even the <b>subcellular</b> sarcomeres. Among dinosaur fossils such sarcomeres are only known from Santanaraptor, whose muscle fibres are four times as thick. The original organic material {{has been replaced by}} small hollow globes, the walls of which consist of euhedric crystals of apatite.|$|E
25|$|The G protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinases (GRKs) are protein kinases that phosphorylate only active GPCRs. G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are key modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. They {{constitute a}} family of seven mammalian serine-threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate agonist-bound receptor. GRKs-mediated receptor phosphorylation rapidly initiates profound impairment of receptor signaling and desensitization. Activity of GRKs and <b>subcellular</b> targeting is tightly regulated by interaction with receptor domains, G protein subunits, lipids, anchoring proteins and calcium-sensitive proteins.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} classically thought of working only together, GPCRs may signal through G-protein-independent mechanisms, and heterotrimeric G-proteins may play {{functional}} roles independent of GPCRs. GPCRs may signal independently through many proteins already mentioned for {{their roles in}} G-protein-dependent signaling such as β-arrs, GRKs, and Srcs. In addition, further scaffolding proteins involved in <b>subcellular</b> localization of GPCRs (e.g., PDZ-domain-containing proteins) may also act as signal transducers. Most often the effector {{is a member of}} the MAPK family.|$|E
25|$|Translocation: The {{receptor}} is, {{along with}} {{the part of the}} membrane it is embedded in, brought {{to the inside of the}} cell, where it is dephosphorylated within the acidic vesicular environment and then brought back. This mechanism is used to regulate long-term exposure, for example, to a hormone, by allowing resensitisation to follow desensitisation. Alternatively, the receptor may undergo lysozomal degradation, or remain internalised, where it is thought to participate in the initiation of signalling events, the nature of which depending on the internalised vesicle's <b>subcellular</b> localisation.|$|E
25|$|Protein Ser/Thr phosphatases were {{originally}} classified using biochemical assays as either, type 1 (PP1) or type 2 (PP2), and were further subdivided based on metal-ion requirement (PP2A, no metal ion; PP2B, Ca2+ stimulated; PP2C, Mg2+ dependent) (Moorhead et al., 2007). The protein Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1, PP2A and PP2B of the PPP family, together with PP2C of the PPM family, {{account for the}} majority of Ser/Thr PP activity in vivo (Barford et al., 1998). In the brain, they are present in different <b>subcellular</b> compartments in neuronal and glial cells, and contribute to different neuronal functions.|$|E
25|$|This tandem {{activation}} loop phosphorylation (that {{was proposed}} {{to be either}} distributive or processive, dependent on cellular environment) is performed {{by members of the}} Ste7 protein kinase family, also known as MAP2 kinases. MAP2 kinases in turn, are also activated by phosphorylation, by a number of different upstream serine-threonine kinases (MAP3 kinases). Because MAP2 kinases display very little activity on substrates other than their cognate MAPK, classical MAPK pathways form multi-tiered, but relatively linear pathways. These pathways can effectively convey stimuli from the cell membrane (where many MAP3Ks are activated) to the nucleus (where only MAPKs may enter) or to many other <b>subcellular</b> targets.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Harden and William Young {{along with}} Nick Sheppard determined, {{in a second}} experiment, that a {{heat-sensitive}} high-molecular-weight <b>subcellular</b> fraction (the enzymes) and a heat-insensitive low-molecular-weight cytoplasm fraction (ADP, ATP and NAD+ and other cofactors) are required together for fermentation to proceed. This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed (purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate. This mixture was rescued {{with the addition of}} undialyzed yeast extract that had been boiled. Boiling the yeast extract renders all proteins inactive (as it denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed juice to complete fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.|$|E
25|$|The <b>subcellular</b> {{localization}} of the Golgi apparatus varies among eukaryotes. In mammals, {{a single}} Golgi apparatus is usually {{located near the}} cell nucleus, close to the centrosome. Tubular connections are responsible for linking the stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the Golgi apparatus are dependent on microtubules. If microtubules are experimentally depolymerized, then the Golgi apparatus loses connections and becomes individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm. In yeast, multiple Golgi apparatuses are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons. Organization of the plant Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules. The common feature among Golgi {{is that they are}} adjacent to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.|$|E
25|$|Microstructure and nanostructure, {{along with}} {{superstructure}} are three main levels of scaffold structure that deserve consideration when creating scaffold topography. While the superstructure {{refers to the}} overall shape of the scaffold, the microstructure refers to the cellular level structure of the surface and the nanostructure refers to the <b>subcellular</b> level structure of the surface. All three levels of structure are capable of eliciting cell responses; however, there is significant interest in the response of cells to nanoscale topography motivated {{by the presence of}} numerous nanoscale structures within the extracellular matrix. There are a growing number of methods for the manufacture of micro- and nanostructures (many originating from the semiconductor industry) allowing for the creation of various topographies with controlled size, shape, and chemistry.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the <b>subcellular</b> enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} and metabolism of copper in living organisms {{is currently the}} subject of much active research. Copper transport at the cellular level involves the movement of extracellular copper across the cell membrane and into the cell by specialized transporters. In the bloodstream, copper is carried throughout the body by albumin, ceruloplasmin, and other proteins. The majority of blood copper (or serum copper) is bound to ceruloplasmin. The proportion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper can range from 70-95% and differs between individuals, depending, for example, on hormonal cycle, season, and copper status. Intracellular copper is routed to sites of synthesis of copper-requiring enzymes and to organelles by specialized proteins called metallochaperones. Another set of these transporters carries copper into <b>subcellular</b> compartments. Certain mechanisms exist to release copper from the cell. Specialized transporters return excess unstored copper to the liver for additional storage and/or biliary excretion. These mechanisms ensure that free unbound toxic ionic copper is unlikely to exist in {{the majority of the population}} (i.e., those without genetic copper metabolism defects).|$|E

500|$|Optical interferometry, {{applied to}} biology and medicine, {{provides}} sensitive metrology capabilities for {{the measurement of}} biomolecules, <b>subcellular</b> components, cells and tissues. [...] Many forms of label-free biosensors rely on interferometry because the direct interaction of electromagnetic fields with local molecular polarizability {{eliminates the need for}} fluorescent tags or nanoparticle markers. [...] At a larger scale, cellular interferometry shares aspects with phase-contrast microscopy, but comprises a much larger class of phase-sensitive optical configurations that rely on optical interference among cellular constituents through refraction and diffraction. [...] At the tissue scale, partially-coherent forward-scattered light propagation through the micro aberrations and heterogeneity of tissue structure provides opportunities to use phase-sensitive gating (optical coherence tomography) as well as phase-sensitive fluctuation spectroscopy to image subtle structural and dynamical properties.|$|E
500|$|The {{bacterial}} cell {{is surrounded by}} a cell membrane (also known as a lipid, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane). This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell. As they are prokaryotes, bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm, and thus contain few large intracellular structures. They lack a true nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells. Bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm, but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localisation of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered. These <b>subcellular</b> levels of organisation have been called [...] "bacterial hyperstructures".|$|E
500|$|Another {{key event}} {{in the history of}} PKA {{occurred}} when Susan Taylor and Janusz Sowadski at the University of California San Diego solved the three dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. It was also realized that inside cells, PKA catalytic subunits are found in complex with regulatory subunits and inhibitor proteins that block the activity of the enzyme. [...] An additional facet of PKA action that was pioneered by John Scott at the University of Washington and Kjetil Tasken at the University of Oslo is that the enzyme is tethered within the cell through its association with a family of A-kinase Anchoring proteins (AKAPs). [...] This led to the hypothesis that the <b>subcellular</b> localization of anchored PKA controls what proteins are regulated by the kinase.|$|E
500|$|Molecules {{are moved}} within plants by {{transport}} processes that operate {{at a variety}} of spatial scales. <b>Subcellular</b> transport of ions, electrons and molecules such as water and enzymes occurs across cell membranes. Minerals and water are transported from roots {{to other parts of the}} plant in the transpiration stream. Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport and mass flow are all different ways transport can occur. Examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem. Most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals. [...] Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported by a variety of processes.|$|E
500|$|Inactive PKA {{holoenzyme}} {{exists as}} a tetramer {{composed of two}} regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Biochemical studies demonstrated {{that there are two}} types of R subunits. The type I R subunits of which there are two isoforms (RIα, and RIβ) bind the catalytic subunits to create the type I PKA holoenzyme. Likewise type II R subunits, of which there are two isoforms (RIIα, and RIIβ), create the type II PKA holoenzyme. In the presence of cAMP, each R subunit binds 2 cAMP molecules and causes a conformational change in the R subunits that releases the C subunits to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The different R subunits differ in their sensitivity to cAMP, expression levels and <b>subcellular</b> locations. A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) bind a surface formed between both R subunits and target the kinase to different locations in the cell. This optimizes where and when cellular communication occurs within the cell.|$|E
