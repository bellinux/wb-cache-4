The vocal style is varied, using the screamed style often employed in extreme metal, with the death growl style predominantly used in death metal, in addition to clean vocals and higher <b>screams.</b> <b>At</b> times, death metal growls and clean vocals are mixed to create an aggressive but melodic effect.|$|E

When Gustave plays a {{haunting}} melody of his own composition on the piano, the Phantom is once again reminded of his one night with Christine and he is struck by the possibility that this musically gifted child could actually be his son ("Beautiful").

To his dismay, Gustave is horrified and <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> the sight, but Christine enters just in time to calm the boy. When the Phantom confronts her with his suspicions regarding Gustave's paternity, Christine confesses that the child is indeed his son, prompting the Phantom to vow that all his life's work will henceforth be for Gustave ("The Phantom Confronts Christine"). Unbeknownst to them, Madame Giry has overheard their conversation and is enraged, fearing that everything she and Meg have done for the Phantom over the years has been for nothing, as Gustave will be the sole beneficiary of his wealth and property.|$|E
500|$|Performances often sounded amateurish, naïve, or {{intentionally}} raw, {{with typical}} themes revolving around the traumas {{of high school}} life and songs about [...] "lying girls" [...] being particularly common. [...] The lyrics and delivery were frequently more aggressive than the more polished acts of the time, often with nasal, growled, or shouted vocals, sometimes punctuated by shrieks or <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> climactic moments of release. [...] Instrumentation was characterized by basic chord structures played on electric guitars or keyboards often distorted through a , teamed with bass and drums. [...] Guitarists sometimes played using aggressive-sounding bar chords, {{sometimes referred to as}} power chords. [...] Organs such as the Farfisa were commonly used as well as harmonicas or hand-held percussion such as tambourines.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Lyon observes, [...] "The plot {{revolves}} around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke." [...] While noting that the device is [...] "striking", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely [...] "warped" [...] individuals. She suggests that [...] "Neal and Berti... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other." [...] Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal {{seems to think that}} his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of [...] "elaborate fiction". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> him, [...] "It was like a book... a book!" ...|$|E

500|$|Don Perry guest starred as an {{airplane}} passenger next to Jerry, when {{he wakes up}} from his nightmare. Perry states {{that he might be}} the last person Jerry will see alive. This line was not in the original script, but was added because Perry, as Charles explained, [...] "just had the right look". Christine Dunford was cast as Leslie, Charles commented [...] "she just came in; gave a great reading. At this point in our show business history, I don't think we knew anybody". Dunford would return later as a saleswoman in the season five episode [...] "The Pie". Margaret Reed, best known for her role on the soap opera As the World Turns, appeared as Mary Cantardi, a woman who <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> Jerry for not calling her back after a date. Vic Polizos and James Lashly guest-starred as the Russian cable installers. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra in the first scene of the episode, standing at the counter at Monk's Cafe.|$|E
500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E

2500|$|What {{follows is}} a series of musical numbers {{performed}} by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in counterpoint of their hopes for the future ("You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through"). Buddy then appears, dressed in [...] "plaid baggy pants, garish jacket and a shiny derby hat", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him. ("The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past- and her obsession with him now ("Losing My Mind"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them ("The Story of Lucy and Jessie"). [...] Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy ("Live, Laugh, Love"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.|$|E

In order to not lose her again, An-Mei moves out with her mother to Wu-Tsing's house against her relatives' wishes for her to remain with them. They claim that in allowing An-Mei live with her and Wu-Tsing, the mother will ruin her future. She finds that Wu-Tsing has another three wives, making An-Mei's mother the Fourth Wife. Later, she learns that the Second Wife (Elizabeth Sung) tricked An-Mei's mother into being raped and impregnated by Wu-Tsing. When the relatives did not believe An-Mei's mother and kicked her out, she reluctantly became Wu-Tsing's Fourth Wife as she had nowhere else to turn. After An-Mei's mother {{gave birth to a}} boy, the Second Wife took him away from her and claimed him as her own. After An-Mei discovers the past, her mother ultimately commits suicide by eating [...] "sticky rice balls" [...] laced with opium, choosing the day of her death carefully to threaten Wu-Tsing with the vengeance of her angry ghost. Afraid of this curse, Wu-Tsing vows to raise An-Mei and her half-brother with great care and promises to honor their mother as an honorable first wife. When Second Wife tries to pay respects to An-Mei's late mother, An-Mei <b>screams</b> <b>at</b> the Second Wife, destroys the Second Wife's faux pearl necklace (the Second Wife initially tried to win An-Mei over with a similar necklace), and loudly yells out [...] "Mama!" ...|$|E
