40|$|A key {{aspect of}} the United Nations’ {{sustainable}} development approach centres on creating markets for financialized ‘natural capital’ products, particularly in resource-rich, lower-income countries. The appeal of this comes from a set of policy promises termed the ‘triple-win’: achieving environmental sustainability, <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and poverty alleviation. Yet, these policies are controversial for many reasons, including their potential to foster inequitable property regimes, leading to increased potential for conflict. There {{is a need to}} understand the context and relationships among the green economy, resource financialization and emerging areas of conflict within the Southern African region.

40|$|Minimum wages {{may be an}} {{important}} instrument to reduce income inequality in a society and to promote <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> While higher minimum wages can support the Chinese transformation towards consumption driven growth, they can worsen the price competitiveness in export markets. As they differ throughout the country, this paper investigates their determinants at the regional level. In addition to a broad set of economic determinants, such as per capita income and consumption, consumer prices, unemployment and industrial structures, spatial effects are taken into account. They might arise for different reasons, including competition of local policymakers. The results show that the impact of economic variables declines, once spatial spillovers are considered. Although the minimum wage regulation pursues the relevance of economic factors in the determination of the appropriate levels, the actual development is largely driven by regional dependencies. As minimum wage standards set by local officials do not fully reflect the regional economic development, further reforms should be on the agenda...|$|E

40|$|Free Trade Reimagined {{begins with}} a {{sustained}} criticism of {{the heart of the}} emerging world economy, the theory and practice of free trade. Roberto Mangabeira Unger does not, however, defend protectionism against free trade. Instead, he attacks and revises the terms on which the traditional debate between free traders and protectionists has been joined. Unger's intervention in this major contemporary debate serves as a point of departure for a proposal to rethink the basic ideas with which we explain economic activity. He suggests, by example as well as by theory, a way of understanding contemporary economies that is both more realistic and more revealing of hidden possibilities for transformation than are the established forms of economics. One message of the book is that we need not choose between accepting and rejecting globalization; we can have a different globalization. Traditional free trade doctrine rests on shaky empirical and theoretical ground. Unger takes a new approach to show when international trade is likely to be useful or harmful to the <b>socially</b> <b>inclusive</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> that every nation wants. Another message is that the movement of people and ideas {{is more important than the}} movement of things and money, and that freedom to change the institutions defining a market economy is just as important as freedom to exchange goods on the basis of those institutions. Free Trade Reimagined ranges broadly within and outside economics. Presenting technical issues in plain language, it appeals to the general reader. It puts a disciplined imagination in the service of rebellion against the dictatorship of no alternatives that characterizes life and thought today. free trade, world economy, protectionism, economic activity, transformation, globalization, economic growth, mobility, institutional change, market economy, freedom...|$|E

40|$|Poverty {{is a daily}} reality which a {{majority}} of South Africans live with. Social security {{in the form of}} cash grants has been the main poverty reduction instrument, albeit with limited success. The thesis aims to propose improvements which can be made in the government’s current social protection system and formulate alternative directions towards reducing poverty. An overview of the three most researched social security strategies around the world (i. e. Nordic, Latin American, and U. S. models) revealed two dominant instruments: conditionality and universalism. If applied in South Africa, universalism may be costly and unsustainable unless the right funding method is used. Attaching education and health attainment conditions to an adult grant would be inefficient and even burdensome to recipients. In terms of child grants, there is little evidence to suggest that the demand for and private levels of investment in education and health are insufficient. Therefore attaching health and education conditions to social grants may only serve to highlight the severe supply side inefficiencies in South Africa. Attaching marriage as an alternative condition may disadvantage poor and needy beneficiaries as marriage is an expensive institution in South Africa. Furthermore, enforcing the marriage condition would violate the constitutional rights of recipients who do not necessarily place a high value on the institution. To strengthen the poverty reduction efficiency of social grants and reduce dependency, the thesis suggests that social cash grants, regardless of whether universal and/or conditional or neither, should be temporary and used in conjunction with other strategies which encourage <b>inclusive</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> Social assistance alone will not reduce poverty and ultimately, <b>inclusive</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> remains a more viable approach to reducing poverty.
