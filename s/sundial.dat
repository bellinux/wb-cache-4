5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal <b>sundial</b> that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the <b>sundial</b> in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or <b>sundial</b> blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest <b>sundial</b> ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal <b>sundial.</b> Pliny the Elder records that the first <b>sundial</b> in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|This type of <b>sundial</b> {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} <b>sundial</b> because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial <b>sundial</b> changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of <b>sundials.</b> Some <b>sundials</b> use a shadow or {{the edge of a}} shadow while others use a line or spot of light to indicate the time.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} <b>sundials</b> are {{designed}} with a fixed gnomon that is not aligned with the celestial poles like a vertical obelisk. Such <b>sundials</b> are covered below under the section, [...] "Nodus-based sundials".|$|R
50|$|The later {{division}} of the day into 12 hours was accomplished by <b>sundials</b> marked with ten equal divisions. The morning and evening periods when the <b>sundials</b> failed to note time were observed as {{the first and last}} hours.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Sundial</b> Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a <b>sundial,</b> and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to {{the ceiling of the}} Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The <b>sundial</b> consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{clock is}} set at three or nine o'clock. The point of the clocks was to teach the viewer to view the <b>sundial</b> at the end upside down.|$|E

5000|$|The Romans {{adopted the}} Greek <b>sundials,</b> {{and the first}} record of a sun-dial in Rome is 293 BC {{according}} to Pliny. [...] Plautus complained {{in one of his}} plays about his day being [...] "chopped into pieces" [...] by the ubiquitous <b>sundials.</b> Writing in ca. 25 BC, the Roman author Vitruvius listed all the known types of dials in Book IX of his De Architectura, together with their Greek inventors. [...] All of these are believed to be nodus-type <b>sundials,</b> differing mainly in the surface that receives the shadow of the nodus.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sundials</b> can be {{designed}} with a gnomon that is placed in a different position each day throughout the year. In other words, {{the position of the}} gnomon relative to the centre of the hour lines varies. The gnomon need not be aligned with the celestial poles and may even be perfectly vertical (the analemmatic dial). These dials, when combined with fixed-gnomon <b>sundials,</b> allow the user to determine true North with no other aid; the two <b>sundials</b> are correctly aligned if and only if they both show the same time.|$|R

5|$|DST {{inherits}} and can magnify {{the disadvantages}} of standard time. For example, when reading a <b>sundial,</b> one must compensate for {{it along with}} time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and 18th Centuries, {{equation}} clocks were made, which allowed {{the user to}} see or calculate apparent solar time, as would be shown by a <b>sundial.</b> Before {{the invention of the}} pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a <b>sundial,</b> depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.|$|E

5|$|On {{the western}} end of the chapel is the narthex, which has entrances on the north, west, and south walls. An {{additional}} door on the chapel's north side opens onto the Hibben Garden, named in recognition of John Grier Hibben's role in the chapel's construction and dedication. The garden of evergreens was designed by H. Russell Butler, Jr. On the chapel's south side are an additional door at ground level to the east and an exterior pulpit, designed after one at Magdalen College, Oxford, and named Bright Pulpit, in honor of John Bright. The chapel is connected on its eastern side to Dickinson Hall by the Rothschild arch, symbolizing a connection between religion and scholarship. Cram resigned as Princeton's supervising architect over the inclusion of the arch, which he disliked; nonetheless, he participated in the chapel's 1928 dedication ceremony. Nearby is the Mather <b>Sundial,</b> a replica of the Turnbull <b>Sundial</b> in the courtyard of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. A statue of a pelican, a religious symbol associated with Corpus Christi, sits atop the <b>sundial,</b> which was presented to Princeton in 1907 by William Mather, then the governor of Victoria University of Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The King {{was fascinated}} by astronomy; his {{personal}} association with the science was illustrated {{by the fact that}} the <b>sundial</b> was not only his personal pride and joy but was also designed to serve as a symbol of the Stuart family. It had glass portraits mounted on it, depicting Charles, Queen Catherine, the Duke of York, the Queen Mother and Prince Rupert. A watchman was posted to guard it against the kind of vandalism that had wrecked the earlier <b>sundial,</b> but in June 1675 it was severely damaged when it was attacked by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, much to the king's fury. The fate of the ruined dial is unknown; it was last recorded standing at Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace) in 1710.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate of}} Craigie is {{recorded}} {{as belonging to}} one John de Craigie in the reign of David I (1124–1153). In 1387 the estate passed by marriage to John Stewart, son of Sir Robert Stewart of Durisdeer. The Stewarts sold the estate, which by this time had a tower house, in 1643 to John Fairholm, treasurer to the City of Edinburgh. In 1682 John Fairholm's granddaughter Sophia, aged only 14, married William Johnstone, 2nd Earl of Annandale, and Craigiehall changed ownership again. Only two built features on the estate date from before this time; the 17th century east <b>sundial,</b> and the ruined doocot, or pigeon house, dated 1672. The east <b>sundial</b> {{is one of only}} 25 obelisk-type sundials in Scotland, and was re-erected to the east of the house in 1965, after being found in a field to the south of the house.|$|E

Ancient Egyptian obelisks, constructed about 3500, are also among the earliest shadow clocks.|$|E
