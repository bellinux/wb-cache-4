40|$|INTRODUCTION: Functional {{capacity}} {{tests are}} standardized instruments to evaluate patients' capacities to execute work-related activities. Functional capacity test results {{are associated with}} biopsychosocial factors, making it unclear what is being measured in capacity testing. An overview of these factors was missing. The objective of this review {{was to investigate the}} level of evidence for factors that are associated with functional capacity test results in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed identifying relevant studies from an electronic journal databases search. Candidate studies employed a cross-sectional or RCT design and were published between 1980 and October 2010. The quality of these studies was determined and level of evidence was reported for factors that were associated with capacity results in at least 3 studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. The level of evidence was reported for lifting low, lifting high, carrying, and <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> capacity. Lifting low test results were associated with self-reported disability and specific self-efficacy but not with pain duration. There was conflicting evidence for associations of lifting low with pain intensity, fear of movement/(re) injury, depression, gender and age. Lifting high was associated with gender and specific self-efficacy, but not with pain intensity or age. There is conflicting evidence for the association of lifting high with the factors self-reported disability, pain duration and depression. Carrying was associated with self-reported disability and not with pain intensity and there is conflicting evidence for associations with specific self-efficacy, gender and age. <b>Static</b> <b>lifting</b> was associated with fear of movement/(re) injury. CONCLUSIONS: Much heterogeneity was observed in investigated capacity tests and candidate associated factors. There was some evidence for biological and psychological factors that are or are not associated with capacity results but there is also much conflicting evidence.

40|$|Objective: Lower back {{problems}} {{are a common}} cause of sick leave of employees in Dutch care homes and hospitals. In the Netherlands over 40 % of reported sick leave is due to {{back problems}}, mainly caused by carrying out heavy work. The goal of the iLift project {{was to develop a}} game for nursing personnel to train them in lifting and transfer techniques. The main focus was not on testing for the effectiveness of the game itself, but rather on the design of the game as an autogenous trigger and its place in a behavioral change support system. In this article, the design and development of such a health behavior change support system is addressed, describing cycles of design and evaluation. Methods: (a) To define the problem space, use context and user context, focus group interviews were conducted with Occupational Therapists (n = 4), Nurses (n = 10) and Caregivers (n = 12) and a thematic analysis was performed. We interviewed experts (n = 5) on the subject of lifting and transferring techniques. (b) A design science research approach resulted in a playable prototype. An expert panel conducted analysis of video-recorded playing activities. (c) Field experiment: We performed a dynamic analysis in order to investigate the feasibility of the prototype through biometric data from player sessions (n = 620) by healthcare professionals (n = 37). Results: (a) Occupational Therapists, Nurses and Caregivers did not recognise a lack of knowledge with training in lifting and transferring techniques. All groups considered their workload, time pressure and a culturally determined habit to place the patient's well being above their own as the main reason not to apply appropriate lifting and transferring techniques. This led to a shift in focus from a serious game teaching lifting and transferring techniques to a health behavior change support system containing a game with the intention to influence behavior. (b) Building and testing (subcomponents of) the prototype resulted in design choices regarding players perspective, auditory and visual feedback, overall playability and perceived immersiveness. This design process also addressed the behavior shaping capacities of the game and its place within the health behavior change support system. An expert panel on lifting and transferring techniques validated the provoked in-game activities as being authentic. (c) Regression analysis showed an increase of the game score and dashboard score when more sessions were played, indicating an in-game training effect. A post-hoc test revealed that from an average of 10 playing sessions or more, the dashboard score and the game score align, which indicates behavioral change towards executing appropriate <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> and transferring techniques. Conclusions: Data gathered in the final field test shows an in-game training effect, causing players to exhibit correct techniques for <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> and transferring techniques but also revealed the necessity for future social system development and especially regarding intervention acceptance. Social system factors showed a strong impact on the games persuasive capacities and its autogenous intent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Study design : Electromyographic and biomechanical {{methods were}} {{utilized}} to investigate correlations between indexes of localized muscle fatigue {{and changes in}} the kinematics and kinetics of motion during a cyclic lifting task. Summary of background data : Recent advances in time-frequency analysis procedures for electromyographicic signal processing provide a new way of studying localized muscle fatigue during dynamic contractions. These methods provide a means to investigate fatigue-related functional impairments in patients with low back pain. Objectives : To study the relationship between localized muscle fatigue and the biomechanics of lifting and lowering a weighted box. Fatigue-related changes in the electromyographicic signal of trunk and limb muscles were evaluated and compared to kinematic and kinetic measures in order to determine whether lifting strategy is modified with fatigue. Methods : A total of 14 healthy male subjects (26 +/- 5 years) cyclically lifted and lowered a 13 kg box (12 lifts/min) for 4. 5 minutes. A 5 -second static maximum lifting task was included immediately before and after the cyclic lifting task to measure changes in lifting strength and static electromyographicic fatigue indexes. Electromyographic signals from 14 muscle sites (including paravertebral and limb muscles) were measured. Changes in the electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency, a fatigue index, were computed using time-frequency analysis methods. This index was compared with more standardized measures of fatigue, such as those based on electromyographicic median frequency acquired during a static trunk extension test, subjective fatigue measures, and maximal <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> strength. Biomechanical measures were gathered using a motion analysis system to study kinematic and kinetic changes during the lifting task. Results : During the cyclic lifting task, the electromyographic Instantaneous Median Frequency significantly decreased over time in the paravertebral muscles, but not in the limb muscles. Paravertebral electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency changes were consistent with self-reports of fatigue as well as decreases in trunk extension strength. The magnitude of muscle-specific changes in electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency was not significantly correlated with electromyographicic median frequency changes from the static trunk extension task. The load of the box relative to the maximal <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> strength significantly affected the electromyographicic Instantaneous Median Frequency changes of paravertebral back muscles. Significant changes with fatigue during the task were found in the angular displacements at the knee, hip, trunk, and elbow. These biomechanical changes were associated with increased peak torque and forces at the L 4 -L 5 vertebral segment. Conclusions : Our results demonstrate correlation between localized muscle fatigue and biomechanical adaptations that occur during a cyclic lifting task. This new technique may provide researchers and clinicians with a means to investigate fatigue-related effects of repetitive work tasks or assessment procedures that might be useful in improving education, lifting ergonomy, and back school programs. Although both the dynamic and static tasks resulted in spectral shifts in the electromyographicic data, the fact that these methods led to different muscle-specific findings indicates that they should not be considered as equivalent assessment procedures. </br...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{considerable}} professional debate over which technique {{is the best}} for lifting. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare three <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> styles, the stoop, semi-squat and arm lift, using maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) as one indicator for recommending a lifting style. Methods: Thirty healthy women (mean age: 22. 37 years) participated in this quasi-experimental study. They performed the tests in static postures by standing on the platform of the Lift TrackTM and pulling the dynamometer of the instrument with maximum effort in three lifting styles: the stoop, semi-squat and arm lift. The subjects warmed-up by practicing the lifts first. The mean MIVC from the two other sets of lifts were used for statistical analysis by repeated measurements and SPSS (ver. 10) software. Results: There were significant differences between the MIVC of the three lifting styles in this study. The largest MIVC was for the semi-squat lift and was the least was for the arm lift (p< 0. 001). The MIVC of the stoop lift was larger than that of the arm lift (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The largest MIVC for the semi-squat lift suggests that this style is useful for lifting objects from the floor. The differences in biomechanical and muscle pattern activity changes could explain these results. It seems that activation of the quadriceps muscles in the semi-squat lift was a main factor for producing more MIVC, so when this style is recommended for lifting, attention to the power of the quadriceps is important...|$|E
40|$|Slipforming is a {{construction}} method {{that has been}} used in several decades for production of concrete structures. It is a wide range of different structures that are slipformed, but typical are vertical structures such as towers, bridge columns and offshore platforms. Slipforming are not only used for straight vertical concrete structures, but also on structures where the geometry of the structure and the wall thickness is changed. Slipforming is normally a continuous working operation (24 hours a day), which require a well-planned supply of materials. Problems that occur during this process needs to be solved instantly. Slipforming is a rather complicated operation compared to other construction techniques. The requirements to the materials, personnel and the execution of the work are therefore accordingly higher. Slipforming of concrete structures has in most cases been carried out successfully with no or only minor supplementary work. However, in some cases, surface damages have occurred during slipforming. Typical surface damages are lifting cracks and vertical lined damages caused by lumps formed on the slipform panel. These problems have during recent years caused discussion and partly also scepticism to slipforming as a reliable construction technique. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended in Publication 77 that some concrete structures should not be slipformed depending on the environmental impact at the location, geometric degree of difficulties of the concrete structure and the type of concrete. Also in other countries there are scepticism to slipforming as {{a construction}} technique. The prime objective of the research program is to improve the understanding of the slipform technique as a construction method in order to ensure high quality concrete structures. The objective is to identify the parameters affecting the net lifting stress (friction) that occur during lifting of the slipform panel. Focus is given to the importance of the concrete properties that will influence the forces that occur between the slipform panel and the concrete. Also any connection between the friction level and the surface damages is investigated. Based on the result {{it should be possible to}} define requirements for materials, mix composition and method of execution to ensure that the specified quality in the structure is obtained. The lifting stress can be divided in <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress and sliding lifting stress, where the <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress represents the friction that has to be overcome in order to start sliding and the sliding lifting stress is the minimum friction that occurs during sliding. The difference between the static and sliding lifting stress is caused by the decreasing effective pressure during lifting at the sliding zone and the adhesion that occurs because of no movement of the slipform panel between two lifts. Both static and sliding lifting stress are closely related, but the <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress can be extremely large compared to the sliding lifting stress. The friction law can be used to describe the correlation between the net lifting stress and the effective pressure. This correlation is almost linear and applicable for both the net static and sliding lifting stress. The effective pressure, which represents the pressure between the solid particles and the slipform panel, is the difference between the normal pressure (concrete pressure against the slipform panel) and the pore water pressure. It is primarily the pressure in the pore water that is responsible for most of the variation in the effective pressure during the plastic phase and the transition period, which means that it is mainly the variation in the pore water pressure that controls the level of the lifting stress. The pore water pressure is decreasing slightly in early phase because of the settlement in the concrete. During the elastic phase, the pore water pressure start to decrease faster as an effect of the chemical shrinkage that occurs because of the cement reaction. The pore water pressure development can be characterised by the decrease rate of the pore water pressure and the minimum pore water pressure. The minimum pore water pressure is defined as the pore water pressure at the time of maximum lifting stress. The minimum pore water pressure occurs just before the pressure is increasing at the sliding zone close to the slipform panel. It is primarily the level of the minimum pore water pressure that will decide the maximum level of the static and sliding lifting stress. The pore water pressure decrease rate and the minimum pore water pressure depends on the particle concentration and particle size distribution for the finer particles and also the air content in the concrete. Higher particle concentration and finer particle size distribution will both result in a faster pore water pressure decrease rate and a lower minimum pore water pressure. A higher air content will reduce the effect from the chemical shrinkage because the existing air volume will act as a pressure release volume, resulting in a lower pore water pressure decrease rate and a higher minimum pore water pressure. Also the compaction method will have an impact on the decrease rate of the pore water pressure and the minimum pore water pressure, because the air content will be reduced with prolonged vibration time. Prolonged vibration will in general result in a higher lifting stress, depending on the response on the concrete during vibration. When lightweight aggregate is used in the concrete, the entrapped air in the lightweight aggregate will increase the pore water pressure and result in a lower lifting stress. Porous lightweight aggregate will have larger impact on the pore water pressure than denser lightweight aggregate. Pressure gradients that occur between two concrete layers will affect the decrease rate of the pore water pressure. Water will “flow” from layers with younger concrete without any negative pressure to concrete layers with lower pore water pressure. This will reduce the decrease rate in the concrete layer that receives the water. In later stage the same concrete that supplied the concrete layer below with water will receive water from the concrete layer above. The pressure gradient at the joint (between two concrete layers) will be more even as a result of the water communications between the concrete layers. Evaporation of water from a fresh concrete surface will result in a faster decrease rate and a lower minimum pore water pressure because of the drying process will form menisci near the surface. The water communication is in general good in the concrete in this phase. The time at which the minimum pore water pressure occurs will also have an impact on the minimum pressure level. A shorter period of time from the minimum pore water pressure occur to the time of initial set will result in a relatively higher minimum pore water pressure and a lower lifting stress. The minimum pore water pressure has occurred earlier when water has evaporated from an exposed concrete surface. Also when very rough slipform panel is used, the incipient vacuum between the slipform panel and the concrete is punctured early (collapse of the capillary system at the sliding zone) because of the rough panel surface and will result in a relative low lifting stress. Both the lifting frequency and the lifting height has a considerable effect on the <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress. Lower lifting height or decreased lifting frequency will both result in a lower pore water pressure and a higher <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> stress. This is probably because the interface zone is disturbed each time the slipform panel is lifted. Less disturbance of the interface will result in a lower minimum pore water pressure. The lifting stress is decreasing during lifting as an effect of the decreasing effective pressure at the sliding zone and the reduced adhesion. The effective pressure at the sliding zone is probably at minimum and the adhesion is completely broken when the lifting stress is stabilized on a minimum level. The sliding lifting stress is also affected of the lifting frequency and the lifting height if not the minimum level is reached during the lift. Surface damages caused by high lifting stress are not demonstrated in the vertical slipform rig. However, similar concrete mix design {{that has been used}} in a field project, where surface damages occurred, has been tested in the vertical slipform rig. The concrete mix in this field project was replaced with a new concrete mix, where no or only minor surface damages occurred after the replacement. Both concrete mixes is tested in the vertical slipform rig and the result show a considerable higher static and sliding lifting stress for the concrete mix that was used when surface damages occurred. This indicates that there are a connection between high lifting stress and risk for surface damages. This means also that concrete mixes that obtains high lifting stress in the vertical slipform rig is more exposed to surface damages than concrete mixes that has obtained lower lifting stress. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|Tilting ducted fans {{present a}} {{solution}} for the lifting and forward flight propulsion requirements of VTOL aircraft. However, the geometry of the duct enshrouding the propeller has great a effect on {{the efficiency of the}} fan in various flight modes. Shroud geometry controls the velocity and pressure at the face of the fan, while maintaining a finite loading out at the tips of the fan blades. A duct tailored for most efficient generation of <b>static</b> <b>lifting</b> thrust will generally suffer from performance deficiencies in forward flight. The converse is true as well, leaving the designer with a difficult trade affecting the overall performance and sizing of the aircraft. Ideally, the shroud of a vertical lifting fan features a generous bell mouth inlet promoting acceleration of flow into the face of the fan, and terminating in a converging nozzle at the exit. Flow entering the inlet is accelerated into the fan by the circulation about the shroud, resulting in an overall increase in thrust compared to an open propeller operating under the same conditions. The accelerating shroud design is often employed in lifting ducted fans to benefit from the thrust augmentation; however, such shroud designs produce significant drag penalties in axial flight, thus are unsuitable for efficient forward flight applications. Decelerating, or diffusing, duct designs are employed for higher speed forward flight configurations. The lower circulation on the shroud tends to decelerate the flow into the face of the fan, which is detrimental to static thrust development; however, net thrust is developed on the shroud while the benefits of finite blade loading are retained. With judicious shroud design for intended flight speeds, a net increase in efficiency can be obtained over an open propeller. In this experiment, conducted under contract to NASA LaRC (contract NAG- 1 - 02093) circulation control is being applied to a mildly diffusing shroud design, intended for improved forward flight performance, to generate circulation in the sense of an accelerating duct design. The intent is to improve static thrust performance of a ducted fan tailored for high speed axial flight, {{while at the same time}} significantly reduce the pressure signature on the ground plane. Circulation control on the fan shroud is achieved by the Coanda effect...|$|E

Finally, the configuration overall noise levels are related to <b>static</b> <b>lift</b> and thrust measurements {{in order to provide}} insight into possible acoustic/aerodynamic performance trade-off benefits...|$|R
40|$|An {{existing}} {{method for}} calculating {{the effect of}} <b>static</b> <b>lift</b> of the horizontal stabilizer in yaw {{and the effect of}} static deflection of the horizontal stabilizer on T-tail flutter is appended to the MSC/NASTRAN flutter solution. The application of the method to a T-tail of interest shows the expected trends. A strip theory correction scheme is proposed to permit separation and factoring of CLα and Clβ on the horizontal stabilizer by different factors. A refinement of the T-tail transonic dip calculated with classical methods is obtainable this way...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} force tests of {{models of the}} Basic Finner missile {{configuration}} in fully wetted flow in the High Speed Water Tunnel are presented. The <b>static</b> <b>lift,</b> pitching moment and drag were measured for angles of attack up to 14 degrees and for Reynolds numbers from 0. 7 to 8. 5 x 10 ^ 6. The results of these tests performed on the static force balance are in good agreement with coefficients determined from free flight drag studies in the Controlled Atmosphere Launching Tank and at the U. S. Naval Ordnance Test Station, Pasadena...|$|R
50|$|The aerial vehicle {{combines}} <b>static</b> {{and dynamic}} <b>lift,</b> mirror or symmetric rotation flight modes and consequently uses functions commonly known from Balloon (aeronautics), Airplanes and Helicopters. It has a gas cell and two wings with a symmetric profile {{which can be}} twisted by 180° and one Electric motor {{at the end of}} each wing. As usual with balloons, the <b>static</b> <b>lift</b> vector (buoyant gas) and the vector of payload with batteries are positioned opposed to each other. The cell does not resemble a cigar form but rather reminds of a rotation-symmetric Frisbee disc. The vectors of the carried components - unlike with airships - are not distributed over the total length of the body between prow, cabin and stern. Opposed to this hybrid universal aircraft shows high potentials to more efficient sustainable flight missions and therefore applications with longer abidance in the air.|$|R
