40|$|Abstract-The {{effect of}} {{fluorine}} incorporation on PtSi/Si structure is studied systematically. It is {{observed that the}} flu-orine incorporation from ion implantation improves the high-temperature stability of the PtSi/Si structure. The optimum implantation energy is determined to be the energy at which the maximum percentage of the as-implanted fluorine ion lo-cates at the PtSi/Si interface region. The SIMS analysis shows that the fluorine atom piles up at the PtSi/Si interface. The XPS analysis indicates that the fluorine atoms at the PtSi/Si interface are bonded to the silicon atoms in a form of SiF 2 or SiF 3.
