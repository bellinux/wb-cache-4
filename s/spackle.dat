2500|$|Jane Frank's {{preoccupation with}} space was evident even before her {{paintings}} became overtly [...] "sculptural" [...] {{in their use}} of mixed media. Of the paintings in the 1962 Corcoran Gallery show, she tells Phoebe Stanton: [...] "I was trying to pit mass against void and make it look as though there were passages that went way back - that's why 'crevice' is in so many of the titles" [...] (Stanton, p.15). [...] Indeed, [...] "Crags and Crevices" [...] (70"x50", oil and <b>spackle</b> on canvas), completed in 1961, dominated the show.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} month-long Corcoran Gallery solo exhibition, Jane Frank began to apply not just <b>spackle</b> but {{a variety of}} other {{materials}} - sea-weathered or broken glass, charred driftwood, pebbles, what appears to be crushed graphite or silica, and even glued-on patches of separately painted and encrusted canvas (canvas collage) - to her jagged, abstract expressionist paintings. [...] "I wanted work that was painterly but with an actual three-dimensional space", she later wrote (Yoseloff 1975, pp.37–39). Jane Frank's first solo show at New York City's Bodley Gallery (1963), as well as her 1965 solo show at Baltimore's International Gallery, featured many of these radically dense and variegated mixed media paintings.|$|E

Coyle {{attempts}} to manipulate Viola to use the scout ship, and when Todd is in danger, she launches a missile that kills most <b>Spackle</b> warriors. The Return argues with the Sky, {{the leader of the}} <b>Spackle,</b> demanding more attacks. The Sky refuses, but reveals a captured, hibernating Ben, Todd's adoptive father. The Sky promises Ben to The Return if the two armies reach peace. The <b>Spackle</b> begin attacking the town at random. During a raid, Todd knocks the failing Mayor unconscious and takes over. The Mayor praises him for having such ability.|$|E
50|$|Todd {{is made to}} {{work with}} the enslaved <b>Spackle</b> of New Prentisstown with Davy Prentiss. Todd hopes that by {{complying}} he is ensuring Viola’s health and safety, while the Mayor hopes that Davy will become a better person with Todd's influence. Todd is disgusted at the treatment of the <b>Spackle,</b> yet Davy is proud of his authority. As the <b>Spackle</b> speak via Noise, cure has been placed into the Spackle's food to prevent communication.|$|E

50|$|Phenolphthalein's pH {{sensitivity}} is exploited {{in other}} applications: Concrete has naturally high pH {{due to the}} calcium hydroxide formed when Portland cement reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5-9. When a 1% phenolphthalein solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, <b>spackling</b> used to repair holes in drywall contains phenolphthalein. When applied, the basic <b>spackling</b> material retains a pink coloration; when the <b>spackling</b> has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{issues at}} a {{manufacturer}} of customized- and standard messenger bags, we develop an iterative two-stage framework (involving marketing and operations models) to determine {{the conditions under which}} a firm benefits from production <b>spackling.</b> With <b>spackling,</b> the firm uses flexible capacity to produce custom products as demanded each period, and then fills in, or <b>spackles,</b> the production schedule with make-to-stock output of standard products to restock inventory. <b>Spackling</b> broadly addresses market preferences, while mitigating the effects of "bumpy" demand for custom products by smoothing production, thereby improving capacity utilization as compared to a focused approach, where standard items are made with efficient capacity and custom products with flexible capacity. The marketing model employs logit-based choice and, given product costs and customer preferences, identifies optimal pricing, expected demand, and demand variability. Interestingly, we find that, under certain assumptions, the firm should price all products to achieve a constant absolute dollar markup. The resultant demand parameters are fed into an operations model, which specifies optimal efficient and flexible capacities (and decides between <b>spackling</b> and focus), thereby determining product costs, which are fed back into the marketing model to solve iteratively. That is, we link operations decisions regarding capacity to marketing decisions regarding price, and vice-versa. We examine conditions under which convergence of the two models is achieved, and illustrate our framework with data from the messenger bag manufacturer...|$|R

50|$|The {{township}} was fused {{from several}} medieval villages (Bugy, Vány, Ráda, Ürbo). The region’s natural {{and economic development}} was defined by the Danube’s ancient river bank, which was drained in the 1920s. As {{a result of its}} various soil types and micro climate, the region is especially well suited for agricultural production; hence, its important role in providing the capital with fresh produce. The town neighbors an area of gravel mines, so its geography is <b>spackled</b> with mining lakes.|$|R

5000|$|Hammer {{paint is}} often used to beautify {{technical}} apparatus and not so commonly as a protective coating. The optical advantage of hammer paint is that surfaces look acceptable even if the underlying surface is not flat and smooth. To get a regular paint to look smooth the surface would have to be prepared first, for example by <b>spackling,</b> sanding, [...] grinding or polishing. With hammer paint, this step can be omitted. Some hammer paints (e.g. by Hammerite) are formulated to be usable directly on rusted steel without surface preparation other than brushing to remove the loose rust.|$|R
50|$|Since their {{introduction}} to the US market in 1997, low VOC, odorless stain-blocking primers have become known for their unique combination of highly effective stain blocking. These properties are traditionally associated with solvent-based products. They also display comfortable application and low odor - characteristics commonly associated with water-based products. A good primer has to be compatible {{with a wide variety}} of substrates that may be encountered in an interior situation such as: drywall, cement, concrete, plaster and <b>spackling,</b> wood, paneling, old paint, metals, fiberboard, etc. Very frequently, particularly in renovation work, the surfaces encountered will be covered with a variety of stains such as water-soluble types from water leaks, smoke, nicotine, inks, etc., as well as solvent soluble stains such as tar, tannin, and others.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for determining whether the production process should be designed as make-to-stock (MTS) and/or make-to-order (MTO), given the firm’s assessment of market preferences for standard product designs and custom product designs and the firm’s production capabilities in terms of efficient versus flexible production. These process and product design decisions can in turn impact supply chain design since standard products might typically involve retail outlets, while custom products can often be sold directly. If the firm chooses to offer only standard products we suggest considering a process strategy called texturing, if it offers both standard and custom designs we suggest considering a process strategy called <b>spackling,</b> and if it offers custom products we suggest considering a process strategy called jointing. All three strategies involve both MTS and MTO...|$|R

40|$|We present Resource <b>Spackling,</b> a {{framework}} for integrating register allocation and instruction scheduling {{that is based on}} a Measure and Reduce paradigm. The technique first measures the resource requirements of a program and then uses these measurements to distribute code for better resource allocation. The technique is general in that it is applicable to both local and global scheduling and the allocation of different types of resources. A program's resource requirements for both register and functional unit resources are first measured using a unified representation. These measurements are used to find areas where resources are either under-utilized or over-utilized, called resource holes and excessive sets, respectively. Conditions are determined for increasing resource utilization in the resource holes. A local scheduler that moves sets of instructions into resource holes to reduce the excessive sets for all resources is presented. We develop a global scheduling algorithm that mo [...] ...|$|R
