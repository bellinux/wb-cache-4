40|$|International audienceType III {{secretion}} (T 3 S) systems {{play key}} roles in pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria and are employed to inject toxins {{directly into the}} cytoplasm of target cells. They are composed of over 20 different proteins that associate into a basal structure that traverses both inner and outer bacterial membranes and a hollow, needle-like structure through which toxins travel. The PscF protein is {{the main component of}} the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle.</b> Here we demonstrate that PscF, when purified on its own, is able to form needle-like fibers of 8 nm in width and > 1 microm in length. In addition, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> subunit requires two cytoplasmic partners, PscE and PscG, in P. aeruginosa, which trap PscF in a ternary, 1 : 1 : 1 complex, thus blocking it in a monomeric state. Knock-out mutants deficient in PscE and PscG are non-cytotoxic, lack PscF, and are unable to export PscF encoded extrachromosomally. Temperature-scanning circular dichroism measurements show that the PscE-PscF-PscG complex is thermally stable and displays a cooperative unfolding/refolding pattern. Thus, PscE and PscG prevent PscF from polymerizing prematurely in the P. aeruginosa cytoplasm and keep it in a secretion prone conformation, strategies which may be shared by other pathogens that employ the T 3 S system for infection...|$|R

40|$|It {{was pointed}} out in the {{introductory}} remarks of the preceding paper (Osterman and Rettger, 1941) that the boundaries of the Friedlander group of organisms are not well defined, and that the usual definition of the group does not necessarily exclude or-ganisms of the coli-aerogenes group when these are in the mucoid phase. The importance of considering variational phenomena in all attempts at classification and species description was em-phasized, and it was suggested that the confusion has been due in part to a failure to consider carefully these aspects of the problem. Further understanding was sought in a comparative study of normal and variant forms of 100 freshly isolated strains belonging to both the Friedlinder and coli-aerogenes groups.

40|$|Abstract Background The chlamydial {{developmental}} cycle {{involves the}} alternation between the metabolically inert elementary body (EB) and the replicating reticulate body (RB). The triggers that mediate the interchange between these particle types are unknown {{and yet this}} is crucial for understanding basic Chlamydia biology. Presentation of the hypothesis We have proposed a hypothesis to explain key chlamydial developmental events whereby RBs are replicating strictly whilst {{in contact with the}} host cell membrane-derived inclusion via type three secretion (T 3 S) injectisomes. As the inclusion expands, the contact between each RB and the inclusion membrane decreases, eventually reaching a threshold, beyond which T 3 S is inactivated upon detachment and this is the signal for RB-to-EB differentiation. Testing the hypothesis We explore this hypothesis through the development of a detailed mathematical model. The model uses knowledge and data of the biological system wherever available and simulates the chlamydial developmental cycle under the assumptions of the hypothesis in order to predict various outcomes and implications under a number of scenarios. Implications of the hypothesis We show that the concept of in vitro persistent infection is not only consistent with the hypothesis but in fact an implication of it. We show that increasing the RB radius, and/or the maximum length of T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needles</b> mediating contact between RBs and the inclusion membrane, and/or the number of inclusions per infected cell, will {{contribute to the development of}} persistent infection. The RB radius is the most important determinant of whether persistent infection would ensue, and subsequently, the magnitude of the EB yield. We determine relationships between the length of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> and the RB radius within an inclusion, and between the RB radius and the number of inclusions per host cell to predict whether persistent infection or normal development would occur within a host cell. These results are all testable experimentally and could lead to significantly greater understanding of one of the most crucial steps in chlamydial development. </p...|$|R
