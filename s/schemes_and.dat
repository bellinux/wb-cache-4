5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of naming, {{tropical}} cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An Attribute Based Group Signature (ABGS) {{allows a}} {{verifier}} {{to request a}} signature from {{a member of a}} group who possesses certain attributes. Therefore, a signature should authenticate a person in a group and prove ownership of certain properties. The major difference between our <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> previous group signatures, is that the verifier can determine the role of the actual signer within the group. In this paper we define the first ABGS <b>scheme,</b> <b>and</b> security notions such as anonymity and traceability. We then construct the <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> prove it secure. ...|$|R

5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme <b>schemes,</b> <b>and</b> served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E

In 1908 he {{was appointed}} General Manager, a position he was to hold until 1930. Selbie realised that Watkin's <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> the expensive electrification project had left the company with major financial liabilities, and that the MR's core business in central London would come under significant pressure {{as the use of}} automobiles increased and as the new Underground Electric Railways of London tube lines improved their services.

40|$|Twenty {{years ago}} Abelson and Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs radically changed the {{intellectual}} landscape of introductory computing courses.

40|$|Abstract. In 1999, two {{signature}} schemes {{based on}} the flexible RSA problem (a. k. a. strong RSA problem) were independently introduced: the Gennaro-Halevi-Rabin (GHR) signature <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> the Cramer-Shoup (CS) signature scheme. Remarkably, these schemes meet the highest se-curity notion in the standard model. They however differ in their imple-mentation. The CS <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> its subsequent variants and extensions proposed so far feature a loose security reduction, which, in turn, im-plies larger security parameters. The security of the GHR <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> of its twinning-based variant are shown to be tightly {{based on the}} flex-ible RSA problem but additionally (i) either assumes the existence of division-intractable hash functions, or (ii) requires an injective mapping into the prime numbers in both the signing and verification algorithms. In this paper, we revisit the GHR signature <b>scheme</b> <b>and</b> completely re-move the extra assumption made on the hash functions without relying on injective prime mappings. As a result, we obtain a practical signature <b>scheme</b> (<b>and</b> an on-line/off-line variant thereof) whose security is solely and tightly related to the strong RSA assumption...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> camera movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E
5|$|Military {{camouflage}} was {{spurred by}} the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with the rifle made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the First World War. On land, artists such as André Mare designed camouflage <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> observation posts disguised as trees. At sea, merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in dazzle patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the Second World War, a variety of camouflage schemes were used for aircraft and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th century has largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management <b>schemes</b> <b>and</b> wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten the recreational cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
