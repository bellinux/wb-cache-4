5|$|Berrios {{maintained}} {{his job in}} Chicago as chief clerk of the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals while serving part-time as a legislator in the state capital in downstate Springfield, Illinois. In December, 1985 {{he was one of}} 21 <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> criticised for holding a second, taxpayer-salaried government job in a report issued by the Coalition for Political Honesty, founded by Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Patrick Quinn, later Illinois Treasurer, Lieutenant Governor and Governor.|$|E
5|$|On May 10 Daniels {{signed into}} law two {{immigration}} bills; one denying in-state tuition prices to illegal immigrants and another creating fines for employers that employed illegal immigrants. Several protestors, at least five of whom were illegal immigrants, were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when they broke into Daniels' office after being denied a meeting. Student leaders called for their release, while some <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> called for their deportation.|$|E
5|$|Van Rensselaer had {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} history of the United States. The American Van Rensselaers all descend from Kiliaen's son Jeremias and the {{subsequent}} Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States, producing multiple <b>State</b> <b>Legislators,</b> Congressmen, and two Lieutenant Governors in New York.|$|E

5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{constitutional}} convention, {{it appeared that}} Garrard's political career was drawing to a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on {{his work in the}} Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|In {{a special}} congressional {{election}} held June 20, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats. Confederate sympathizers won only the Jackson Purchase region, which was economically linked to Tennessee by the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Believing defeat {{at the polls}} was certain, many Southern Rightists had boycotted the election; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000. Confederate sympathizers were dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for <b>state</b> <b>legislators.</b> This election resulted in veto-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the House and 27–11 in the Senate. From then on, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Stevenson also {{advocated}} {{careful study}} of the state's finances to deal with increasing expenditures. He insisted that the state stop covering its short-term indebtedness using bonds. However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit segregation in schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of significant value, the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. <b>State</b> <b>legislators</b> rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau of immigration and statistics to spur interest in and migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for juvenile offenders.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, {{construction}} on a full-size {{model of a}} H. missouriensis was completed and placed {{on display at the}} museum. Jetton, then Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, sponsored a dinner event for <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> to celebrate the completion of the exhibit on March 7, 2008. The two-year project was directed by Darrough, who was also in charge of excavations at the Chronister excavation site, and is the only permanent museum exhibit to feature the species. At the opening of the exhibit, Jetton mentioned that he hoped the dig site would become part of a state park one day. Currently, excavation is being conducted by the Missouri Ozark Dinosaur Project. The site has been covered to prevent water from flowing over dig material. The Chronister dig site near Glen Allen, currently under private ownership by Stinchcomb, is the only location in Missouri where dinosaur bones have been found.|$|E

5|$|On April 28, 2014, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the station was partially cut off when the abutting landowner erected a fence on the station's primary access point, forcing riders to walk a short distance along the tracks to a different business lot, {{in an effort to}} stop commuters from parking on his business lots. He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a plan that would have created a pedestrian access path and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that the landowner had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E
5|$|On December 4, 2008, Illinois State Representative Robert S. Molaro {{resigned}} {{after serving}} about 15 {{years in the}} state legislature, and was eligible to receive a public pension of about $64,000 per year based on the standard of 85% of his roughly $75,000 annual salary. Burke hired the newly retired Molaro for $12,000 for one month to write a 19-page white paper about Chicago's perennially under-funded pensions. When Molaro officially retired on January 1, 2009, his pensionable salary was annualized as $144,000, nearly doubling his pension. On August 16, 2012 Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a bill which limited the state's liability when former <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> bolster their state pensions with short-term jobs with cities, counties and other local governments.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, <b>State</b> <b>legislators,</b> and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), {{and a majority of}} African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 1994 FBI agents {{executed}} {{a search warrant}} to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals {{as part of an}} ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a federal grand jury subpoenaed the contracts. A federal grand jury in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former <b>state</b> <b>legislators,</b> including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the tuition and fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Post-war Kentucky Democrats {{had split}} into two factions—the more {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and the more progressive New Departure Democrats. Stevenson governed moderately, giving concessions to both sides. He urged the immediate restoration of all rights to ex-Confederates and denounced Congress for failing to seat {{a portion of the}} Kentucky delegation because they had sided with the Confederacy. A champion of states' rights, he resisted federal measures he saw as violating the sovereignty of the states and vehemently denounced the proposed Fifteenth Amendment. Following Stevenson's lead, the General Assembly refused to pass either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, but after their passage by a constitutional majority of the states Stevenson generally insisted that blacks' newly granted rights not be infringed upon. He was silent, however, when <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> and officials from various cities used lengthy residency restrictions and redrawn district and municipal boundaries to exclude black voters from specific elections. His 1867 plea for legislators to call a constitutional convention to revise the state's pro-slavery constitution to better conform to post-war reality was completely ignored.|$|E

5|$|What was {{ultimately}} {{included in the}} constitution was a modified form of this plan. In the Grand Committee, Benjamin Franklin successfully proposed the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house. But the final July 16 vote on the compromise still left the Senate looking like the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this reason. Then on July 23, just before most of the convention's work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as {{they had in the}} Confederation Congress. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a leading proponent of the compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it. As the personally powerful senators were to receive terms much longer than the <b>state</b> <b>legislators</b> who appointed them, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who were assured of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.|$|E
