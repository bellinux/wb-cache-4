25|$|On January 20, 1970, {{the two men}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> lunch. With a red {{felt-tip}} pen, Osborn {{began to}} scrawl a Saint Andrew's cross circumscribed inside a chalice on his placemat.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, {{more than}} 500 monks {{demonstrated}} {{in front of}} the National Assembly in Saigon. The Buddhists had evaded a ban on public assembly by hiring four buses and filling up and pulling the blinds down. They drove around the city before the convoy stopped at the designated time and the monks disembarked. This {{was the first time that}} an open protest had been held in Saigon against Diệm in his eight years of rule. They unfurled banners and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> four hours before disbanding and returning to the pagodas to begin a nationwide 48-hour hunger strike organised by the Buddhist patriarch Thich Tinh Khiet.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1847 crisis, invalids {{were placed}} in {{hospitals}} while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left {{lying on the ground}} without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a moment, and died'. Many children were orphaned.|$|E

25|$|On January 21, 2015, the United States and Cuba began {{bilateral}} {{talks in}} Havana to discuss further normalization issues. The U.S. delegation led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson, and Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, Cuba's head of North American affairs, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> {{the first day}} of closed-door talks in the capital’s Convention Center. The talks reportedly centered around migration policy. In particular, Cuban representatives urged the U.S. to end its immigration privileges to Cuban refugees, also known as the wet feet, dry feet policy, which allows any fleeing Cuban citizens U.S. residency and citizenship, {{as long as they are}} found on U.S. soil and not at sea. Reuters reported that civilian uncertainty about the status of U.S. immigration policy following the thaw was promoting a surge of emigrants fleeing Cuba for the U.S.|$|E
500|$|The table read {{took place}} in August 2008, and {{production}} on the episode began soon after that. Rogen later said that [...] "we <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a read-through and three hours later I'm in a studio improv-ing with Homer Simpson, it was the single greatest day of my life." [...] Rogen also guest stars in the episode as the character Lyle McCarthy, making him the second guest star to both write an episode and appear in it; Gervais also appeared in the episode he wrote. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening also makes an appearance in the episode.|$|E

It included remastered highlights from all of Ono's solo albums, as well as unreleased material from the 1974 [...] "lost weekend" [...] sessions. She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from Onobox, simply titled Walking on Thin Ice. That year, she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine Option. The story took a revisionist look at Ono's music {{for a new generation}} of fans more accepting of her role as a pioneer in the merger of pop and the avant-garde.|$|E

6000|$|... "Too late!" [...] {{he said in}} a {{voice of}} despair, as he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and <b>for</b> a moment covered his face with his hands. Slagg looked at him with a bewildered rather than a despairing expression.|$|R
60|$|And then Mary Margaret <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> just <b>for</b> a moment, {{intending}} {{to get right}} up and help her mother light the fire, laid her head on her father's shoulder, and fell sound asleep before she ever suspected it.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Kennedy <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> an {{interview}} with entertainer Jack Paar. The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do {{you think that is}} going to be my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What did you think when you heard that Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country." ...|$|E
500|$|The play {{opened for}} tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. [...] The first act was well-received; {{the second act}} was not. [...] Casto {{recalled}} that the second act finished about 1:30a.m. [...] The staff immediately <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a two-hour conference. [...] Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. [...] John Fearnley commented, [...] "Now I see why these people have hits. [...] I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life." [...] De Mille said of this conference, [...] "not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. [...] Nor was there any idle joking.... We cut and cut and cut {{and then we went}} to bed." [...] By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.|$|E
500|$|Regardless, Lee {{received}} Goodman's {{approval for}} the name Spider-Man and the [...] "ordinary teen" [...] concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby [...] "immediately <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, [...] "I hated {{the way he was}} doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{fire was}} leaping from her eyesah, the heroic little figure! can't you see her? There {{was a great}} burst of acclamations, and she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> blushing, <b>for</b> {{it was not in}} her {{delicate}} nature to like being conspicuous.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> but <b>for</b> {{a moment}} or two Nasmyth and Laura stood still in the glare of the fire, and the eyes of {{everyone}} were fixed upon them. Laura's face was flushed, but Nasmyth was calm with a new dignity.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} face toward him, and there was {{something}} in its expression that showed him that he looked to her more serious than he had ever looked. He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again; <b>for</b> some moments he hesitated to go on.|$|R

The backdrop during the performances displayed the New York skyline sliding off and stars respectively. [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was accompanied by her dancers in new wave style dance, while wearing black clothes and white ties. An energetic rendition of [...] "Let It Will Be" [...] followed before she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> some minutes {{to talk with her}} audience. She later started singing [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] without any choreography or backdrop video, only sitting on the floor, and then recalled co-singer Yitzhak Sinwani out for an acoustic version of [...] "Paradise (Not for Me)". The final segment Disco started after a brief radio-style mini-mix of old hits. Madonna emerged in a butterfly-collared suit influenced by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever for a mash-up of [...] "Music" [...] and The Trammps' 1976 single [...] "Disco Inferno" [...] This also included a sample of her 1986 song [...] "Where's The Party" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} song while dancers rollerskated circles around her. Stuart Price's remixed dance version of [...] "Erotica", which sampled the song's original demo [...] "You Thrill Me", is performed. The next song was a Tropical-Dance version of [...] "La Isla Bonita", where the screens displayed clips of different beautiful islands, the sea and its fauna.
