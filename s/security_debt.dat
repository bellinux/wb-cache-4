40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{sustainability}} of pension system in Slovakia on the local institutional, socio- economic and political background, analyzing the past and current reforms {{and their impact on}} public finance. In the first, theoretical part of the paper, the World Bank strategy is sketched out to provide general framework for sustainability of reforms and their goals, and actual past reforms that took place in Slovakia from 2004 until present are dissected. These reforms are most notable for their reorientation from pure pay-as-you-go system to combined PAYG and fully funded system. While this step alleviates the crushing implicit social <b>security</b> <b>debt</b> to some extent, it is shown that not even the latest reforms alone will suffice to cover the increasing burden of the pension system on public spending. Therefore, in the empirical part of the paper, several parametric reforms are proposed and are analyzed from long term perspective (until 2100) using the World Bank PROST economic model. These scenarios approximately represent some of the reforms currently on the table that could be carried out in the near future.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that developing countries need {{substantial amounts of}} net transfer of resources at early stages of development in order to close their savings and foreign exchange gaps. External 3 borrowing is a core element in nearly all developing countries’ development strategies. Foreign loans {{can be used to}} finance public spending aimed at increasing growth, development, and <b>security.</b> <b>Debt</b> sustainability and holding the debt burden at a reasonable level are the two main cornerstones of achieving macroeconomic stability. Solvency is derived from the intertemporal budget constraint which shows sustainability of current policies. Generally, when the expected value of the future resources devoted to debt service equals the current debt stock, solvency condition is satisfied. Developing countries' debt is external debt incurred by Third World countries, generally in quantities beyond that country's ability to repay. Unpayable debt is a term used to describe external debt where the interest on the debt exceeds the amount that the country produces, thus preventing the debt ever being repaid.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this PhD thesis is to {{investigate}} the unconventional monetary policy tools introduced by the Bank of England (BoE) in its response to the recent financial crisis and to analyse {{its impact on the}} UK economy and especially the banking sector. The thesis consists of four chapters; an introductory chapter and three self-contained chapters. The first chapter mainly inspects the types and the sizes of the unconventional interventions of the monetary authorities in the UK, the US, and the EU after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. It also describes the transmission channels through which the impact of the unconventional monetary policies is delivered into the wide economy, and includes a survey of the literature of quantitative easing. The second chapter employs a flow of funds (FOFs) analysis based on Godley and Lavoie (2007) balance sheet framework using ONS sectoral data for the period between 2007 and 2011. It focuses on two distinct sub-periods (2007 - 2008 and 2009 - 2011) to assess the initial effects of mid- 2007 financial crisis on the UK economy and examine the influence of BoE’s asset purchase program (APP) on the sectoral financial positions in the main financial asset categories. The analysis implicates five main results. First, APP was unsuccessful in expanding bank lending which dropped by about £ 208 billion in the 2009 - 2011 period. Second, APP might have positive effects on debt securities and equity prices and hence consumer wealth. Third, through reducing the cost of borrowing, it appears that APP induced the majority of sectors to issue more debt securities. Fourth, after the introduction of APP early in 2009, several sectors relied more on equity rather than debt capital. Finally, domestic productive sectors (NFCs, MFIs, OFIs, and INSs) showed some abroad bias and sent massive amounts of money out of the country. The third chapter explains the drop in total bank lending after the introduction of APP from an agent-based computational economics (ACE) point of view. The baseline model contains four types of agents -households (HHs), big firms (BFs), small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and banks-. These agents interact monthly for a period of 50 months in an environment that simulates bank lending markets in the UK after APP was introduced in 2009. The ACE model is anchored to the actual values of several variables -such as homeownership statistics and nonfinancial firms leverage ratio- {{around the time of the}} program initiation. The lower bond yields caused by APP encourage BFs to substitute bank borrowing with <b>security</b> <b>debt</b> (bonds). In addition, the risk weight regime of Basel capital adequacy requirements induces banks to favour mortgages over business loans to SMEs. My analysis contrasts the implications on bank behaviour of Basel III capital adequacy requirements (scenario 3) with Basel I (simple capital adequacy requirements with no risk weights) and the case of no capital requirements (scenarios 1 and 2 respectively). The scenario analysis shows that in the absence of risk weighting (i. e. scenarios 1 and 2), both lending to SMEs and total lending would have been higher. The combination of lower bond yields and Basel III capital adequacy requirements on banks appears to play a role in the drop in the amount of bank loans to businesses. Similar to the actual data, simulation results indicate that the rise in the amount of mortgages was not enough to counter the decrease in business loans which represents the main cause of the shrinkage in total bank lending. The fourth chapter tries to analyse the same issue of falling bank lending after APP introduction using a three-sector DSGE model. The main results show that a negative shock in gilts yield -initiated by massive asset purchases under the program- induces big unrestricted firms to shift from bank borrowing to <b>security</b> <b>debt</b> (bonds). The fall in BFs bank borrowing decreases the share of the loans to BFs in banks asset compositions and hence increases the amount of risk weighted assets. Induced by Basel III capital requirements, banks start to adjust their portfolios to accommodate more mortgages and less loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The analysis of the role of capital adequacy requirements points out that while the introduction of strong enough capital requirements decreases the risks in the banking system, it may deprive the bank financing from SMEs...|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} revived {{topic of}} interest in the economics literature has been the effect of certain aspects of goverment behaviour on the economy. In particular, {{it has been argued that}} increases in social security pension payments and the use of debt rather than tax finance for government spending both tend to depress savings, and thereby capital formation. These assertions contradict a long-standing neutrality theorem that dates back to David Ricardo. The essence of the early argument supporting neutrality was that individuals would only change their behaviour if the government action caused them to feel richer or poorer. Social security pensions involve a transfer from the young to the old. From the individual’s point of view he receives when he is old approximately what he pays in when young. Similarly, debt involves a deferring of current taxation for future taxation. The interest on the debt, like social security, involves a transfer from one group to another and thereby no net leakage from the system. The neutrality argument rested on the assertion that a rational man would be aware of these transfer implications, realise that he and his descendants were no better or worse off, and therefore not alter his behaviour. The modern explanation of neutrality, usually attributed to Robert Barro, is more complex. To begin with, it recognises that behaviour may alter even if life-time wealth is unaltered. The dominant impact of both social security and debt is an imposed rearranging of the individual’s life-time consumption pattern. Neutrality will only occur if the individual can undo these intertemporal allocation effects through his own behaviour. In this paper we show that if the economy behaves as a composite individual, then full neutrality is possible. Social security and debt both reduce consumption during youth and increase it during retirement; the rate of transfer being determined by the rate of population growth. However, if the economy has a system of operative intergenerational transfers (gifts or bequests) it is able to neutralise the reallocation effects by reversing the transfer, at a rate determined once again by the rate of population growth. This argument is only valid when we view the economy as a composite individual. The individuals themselves will not observe this perfect substitutability between social <b>security,</b> <b>debt,</b> and bequests due to corner solutions, illusions, and distribution effects. Whether or not the aggregate economy will display neutrality is an empirical question of the relative strengths of these forces. The paper reports the results of estimating savings functions using annual and quarterly data for the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s. On the basis of these equations we are unable to reject either of the neutrality hypotheses. The implications of these results are twofold: increases in the scale of our pension system should not be regarded as having a depressing effect on savings; and, the financing mix between taxes and debt is not important, in particular, there is no support for the argument that the public debt should be reduced by raising taxes. ...|$|E
