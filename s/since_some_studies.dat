50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> on nerve {{allotransplantation}} {{determined the}} outcomes of sensory, motor and mixed nerves separately, the meaningful recovery for each nerve type has been assessed. Comparison of these outcomes has found no difference in successful recovery. In other words, the sensation and movement of the affected body parts, in most studies the forearm, equally improved. Successful recovery of all three nerve types was achieved in approximately 80 to 85% of cases. Mixed nerves had a slightly lower recovery rate than sensory and motor nerves, but the success rate was still within the range just mentioned. Concluding, allograft surgery can be appropriately used for the functional repair of nerve injury in sensory, motor and mixed nerves.|$|E

One of the main arguments against the Special Olympics organization, according to Storey, {{is that there is a}} lack of normalization and promotion of negative images. The lack of normalization comes from the differences in reaction to events. For example, in previous years the Special Olympics would find people to stand at the finish line to hug the athletes once they've completed a race. Also, the Special Olympics do not announce anyone who's lost a race.|$|E

Recreational literature based on experience use theory suggests that WTP is positively related to duration and frequency of participation in a certain activity or program (Kyle et al. 2006; López-Mosquera and Sánchez 2013). Some studies suggest that WTP is positively related to experiences in leisure-time sport and (former) sports club membership (Pawlowski et al. 2009; Prins et al. 2010; Downward and Rasciute 2011). People who are or were member of a sport club {{are more willing to}} pay for leisure-time sport {{and physical}} activity than people with no history in sports (Bauman et al. 2002), and are good estimators of the costs. McCarville (1991) indicates that the level of membership fee can be regarded as the reference fee.
