40|$|<b>Shelf</b> <b>time</b> (idle {{time that}} exceeds {{acceptable}} duration) can contribute (significantly) to overall process execution time. In this paper we describe a process mining-based approach to <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> analysis. The technique takes as input an event log extracted from historical executions {{of a business}} process and requires each event have timestamp attributes representing both the start and completion times of each event. The essence of our <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> identification technique is finding events which do not temporally overlap other events in the same case in the log. The major contributions of this paper include (i) an approach for identifying and quantifying periods of <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> in an event log triggered by an event activity, (ii) an analysis of a portfolio of claims of commercial CTP insurer to identify <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> periods and triggering activities and (iii) a discussion of {{an extension of the}} approach to include identification of <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> periods associated with other event attributes, e. g. the resource.

40|$|Storage and {{transport}} of litchi fruit at low temperature is widely practiced commercially. In this study, no pericarp browning was evident at out-turn on litchi fruit stored for 10 and 20 days at cold temperature of 3 – 5 °C, but fruit stored for 10 days at 3 – 5 °C gradually browned after 12 h of <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> {{at ambient temperature}} of 25 °C, with the browning index (BI) being elevated to 2. 5 at 24 h of shelf life. Furthermore, fruit stored for 30 days began to rot and had a decay incidence of about 30 % after 24 h on the shelf. The temperature increment from 3 – 5 to 25 °C induced marked increases in activities of lipase, phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX). Litchi fruit stored for 10 days at 3 – 5 °C followed by the <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> at 25 °C had lower activities of lipase, PLD and LOX, and also lower levels of membrane permeability, than did fruit stored for 20 and 30 days. Energy level of the pericarp tissue of cold-stored litchi fruit was similarly dependent on storage time at 3 – 5 °C plus <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> at 25 °C. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and adenylate energy charge (AEC) level in pericarp tissues decreased as cold storage progressed. However, ATP and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) contents, and the AEC levels, in cold-stored litchi fruit increased during <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> at 25 °C, reaching a peak after 6 h, and then decreasing. Fruit stored for 30 days at 3 – 5 °C had much lower ATP content and AEC level than fruit stored for 10 and 20 days. Increased activities of lipase, PLD and LOX, and energy shortage in cold-stored pericarp tissues during subsequent <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> at 25 °C suggest that the deterioration of membrane integrity and loss of compartmentation gives rise to accelerated browning and fruit quality deterioration...|$|E

30|$|Because of high {{moisture}} content, {{the shelf}} life of fresh noodles and CSB is largely shortened by the microbial growth. Therefore, chemical and natural preservatives {{were commonly used}} to prolong the <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> of traditional cereal products. Varieties of preservatives with different properties were involved into the production of fresh noodles. Inorganic acids, such as benzoic acid, sorbic acid and propionate as well as organic acids including glycine, lactic acid and citric acid were widely used as antimicrobial agents due to their pH-regulating capacity [31]. A complex preservative, consisting of ε-polylysine 120  mg/kg, citric acid 0.5 %, potassium sorbate 0.08 %, sodium diacetate 0.04 % and calcium propionate 0.015 %, developed by Zhang et al. [106] has been proved for extending the <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> of fresh noodle to 60  h at 20  °C. Some oxidants were used as antimicrobial agents in fresh noodles. Chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide at 0.04 and 0.03 % in wheat flour has prolonged noodle <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> to 4 and 6  days, respectively [107]. Composite preservatives consisting of natural products, such as nisin, lysozyme, natamycin, chitosan and Chinese herb medicine extracts, were also incorporated in fresh noodles.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite the {{introduction}} of smaller cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits for paediatrics, it is frequently necessary to add irradiated {{red blood cell concentrate}} (IRBC) to maintain adequate haemoglobin levels and the oxygen carrying capacity. Irradiation of blood weakens the cell membranes and results in an increase of lactate and potassium concentration. In addition, prolonged <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> of IRBC may enhance its lactate level. To avoid the adverse effects of increased lactate and potassium concentration during paediatric bypass, prewashing of homologous blood in a cell-saving device was implemented at our institution. A retrospective audit of clinical data was performed to assess the relevance of this method. METHODS: Preceding {{the introduction}} of the blood pre-washing, we investigated 14 units of IRBC for lactate, potassium levels and <b>shelf</b> <b>time.</b> Afterwards, we evaluated the CPB and laboratory data from 69 patients with body weight < 10 kg and the lactate levels in the priming of the bypass circuit. RESULTS: The <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> of blood units was 7. 6 ± 2. 7 days (minimum 5, maximum 14 days) with lactate concentration of 12. 6 ± 2 mmol/ land potassium concentration of 16. 2 ± 4. 7 mmol/l. In the priming after pre-washing, the lactate concentration was significantly lower than the standard priming (2. 5 ± 0. 9 vs 4. 5 ± 20 mmol/l, p = 0. 002). At the start of bypass, the lactate concentration after pre-washing was still lower (1. 5 ± 0. 4 vs 1. 9 ± 0. 9 mmol/l; p = 0. 04), {{but at the end of}} bypass we detected a significant increase of lactate in the pre-washed group (1. 5 ± 0. 4 vs 2. 2 ± 1. 1 mmol/l, p = 0. 01).

40|$|Information sharing {{dynamics}} of social networks {{rely on a}} small set of influencers to effectively reach a large audience. Our recent results and observations demonstrate that the shape and identity of this elite, especially those contributing original content, is difficult to predict. Information acquisition is often cited {{as an example of}} a public good. However, this emerging and powerful theory has yet to provably offer qualitative insights on how specialization of users into active and passive participants occurs. This paper bridges, for the first time, the theory of public goods and the analysis of diffusion in social media. We introduce a non-linear model of perishable public goods, leveraging new observations about sharing of media sources. The primary contribution of this work is to show that <b>shelf</b> <b>time,</b> which characterizes the rate at which content get renewed, is a critical factor in audience participation. Our model proves a fundamental dichotomy in information diffusion: While short-lived content has simple and predictable diffusion, long-lived content has complex specialization.

From the biomedical perspective, {{the advantages of}} SERS include amount of sample for analysis is minimal; preparation for spectroscopy is minimal; analysis is simple and fast; test is non-destructive and easily reproducible. However the quality of Raman spectra obtained from SERS analysis is highly dependent on the substrate types. Characteristics of an ideal SERS substrate are maximum intensity enhancement, less deviation in enhancement, stable for a long <b>shelf</b> <b>time</b> and clean enough to study weak adsorbates.

This system uses an existing logging system, murmur, to log the beginning and ending times of tracked circumstances, including activities, weather, and problems which effect observing. Operations software automatically generates most entries for routine observing activities; in a night of routine observing, time tracking requires little or no attention from the observing staff. A graphical user interface allows observers to make entries marking time lost to weather and equipment, and to correct inaccurate entries made by the observing software.

40|$|To {{determine}} how physical processes and biological behaviors influence larval dispersal {{on the inner}} <b>shelf,</b> <b>time</b> series of larval concentrations were quantified during August 1994, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, U.

Physical variables and larvae were sampled at similar time and space scales. Larval concentrations were typically 102 – 104 m 23 for polychaetes, bivalves, and gastropods and 10 – 102 m 23 for brachyuran crab zoeae. There were two dominant scales of variability, 3 – 6 h and 2 – 10 d. The high-frequency signal is partially explained by diel vertical migrations—nocturnal ascent and daytime descent. This pattern would allow larvae to feed in subthermocline waters while avoiding visual predators. Low-frequency variations tracked with water temperature. Highest concentrations of worm larvae occurred in cool (upwelled) water and of crab zoeae in warm (downwelled) water. At least two larval groups comprised the clam and snail time series, one with fairly high abundances in cool water {{and the other with}} peak concentrations in warm water. Wind-driven cross-shelf transport is the most plausible explanation for these low-frequency fluctuations. For example, dense patches of worm larvae overlying parental habitat (offshore muds) would be carried shoreward in cool, upwelling flows. In contrast, brachyuran zoeae in near-surface waters would descend at the coast during downwelling and, together with larvae aloft nearshore sediments...|$|E
