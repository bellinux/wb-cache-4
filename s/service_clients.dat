30|$|Different HASH methods: HASH in STRFINDUNI {{applies the}} 1 -stage HASH {{followed}} by two stages of indexing to construct. During the search process, the first 6  bytes of the head address of chain list of the network data <b>service</b> <b>client</b> pattern string list are found through the screening process and then matched to the network data <b>service</b> <b>client</b> pattern string in the linked list one by one. However, the HASH process in MWM uses only 1 -stage HASH level to accelerate the finding, matching {{them one by one}} in the network data <b>service</b> <b>client</b> pattern string array. This difference in HASH approach is magnified by testing with dictionary files because the number of phrases that begin with the same first 2  bytes is too large, often up to more than 100, and the number of words beginning with the same first 6  bytes is greatly reduced, usually less than three.|$|R

The software will not <b>service</b> <b>clients</b> unless there are valid CALs installed, and it will authenticate and serve the number of clients licensed under the CALs. Once that number is met, the server can either accept a small number of additional connections and then warn administrators before refusing to serve further connections, however usually it will simply refuse to authenticate additional clients until one or more of them disconnects. In this way, the server electronically enforces the Client Access licensing.|$|E
