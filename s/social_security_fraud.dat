25|$|Gabrion is {{a suspect}} in the disappearances of several other people. The house where he was living when Rachel's body was found was owned by a man named Robert Allen. Allen was a mentally {{disabled}} transient and had been receiving social security when he went missing in 1995. Gabrion cashed Allen's checks and lived in his home until 1997. His impersonation of Allen led authorities to him following Rachel's murder when he opened a post office box in Allen's name and directed that his social security check be sent there. Gabrion was convicted of <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> in July 1998 for his use of Allen's checks and sentenced to five years in federal prison.|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 1975 Private Eye {{included}} another short teasing {{piece by}} Auberon Waugh which ended: [...] "My only {{hope is that}} sorrow over his friend's dog will not cause Mr Thorpe's premature retirement from public life". By this time most newspapers knew of the stories surrounding Thorpe and Scott, but were wary of libel; according to Parris, by keeping silent they were [...] "serving notice on Thorpe that they knew a bigger story must break, and could wait for it". In January 1976 Scott appeared before magistrates on a minor <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> charge, and stated {{that he was being}} hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This claim, made in court and therefore protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the years}} Scott made several {{attempts}} to publicise his story, but no newspapers were interested. The satirical magazine Private Eye [...] decided in late 1972 {{that the story}} [...] "was defamatory, unproveable, and above all was ten years old". Even when, in October 1975, Newton's bungled attempt to shoot Scott resulted {{in the death of}} the latter's dog (a Great Dane named Rinka) and Newton's arrest on charges of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, the press remained muted, possibly awaiting the bigger story that they hoped would break. Their reticence ended in January 1976 when Scott, in court on a minor <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fraud</b> charge, claimed he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. [...] This statement, made in court and thus protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.|$|E

In 2005, {{the head of the}} agency estimated that 7 000 of the 150 000 Income Maintenance recipients succeed in defrauding the system every year. In a 2013 study, 34 of 49 welfare recipients unequivocally admitted to fraud.|$|R
50|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1989, Trevor manages to get himself into trouble with the Department of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> for benefit <b>fraud.</b> It is {{revealed}} that Trevor has been signing on for unemployment benefit while being employed at Pete's stall. For a while it looks as if Trevor will face prosecution or a heavy fine, and he reacts with typical hysteria at the prospect of going to prison. In the end, he manages to avoid this by signing off of 'the dole' and promising to never fraudulently claim benefits again.|$|R

30|$|Some {{examples}} {{will help}} to illustrate this point. One occurred after the early emergence of computerized trading and ECNs in late 1990 s. The U.S. stock exchanges revised their price quotation rules in 2001 to allow trade to be priced in decimals, which encouraged algorithm trades via the ECNs. In the following several years from 2001 to 2012, algorithmic trading grew rapidly. This showed the regulatory concerns about the over-heated growth of algorithmic trading activities. Following the chaos of NASDAQ’s problems with Facebook’s IPO in May 2012 and Knight Capital’s failure in August 2012, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) started to investigate the role of <b>social</b> media in <b>securities</b> <b>fraud</b> in November 2012 (Goldstein & Ablan 2012). The Securities and Exchange Commission (2013) laid out new restrictions {{on the use of}} social media behavior related to public company announcements in 2013. From these past cases, we are able to observe the relationship between regulation and financial market operations, and their mutual actions and reactions.|$|R
40|$|Since 1997 {{successive}} {{governments have}} pursued {{a range of}} policies {{to reduce the amount}} of money lost to the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> budget through <b>fraud</b> and error. While levels of fraud have consistently decreased, the problem of error has persisted and its reduction has therefore become an important policy objective. Qualitative research was carried out by the Social Policy Research Unit at the University of York in 2006 - 07 to explore benefit claimants' knowledge and understanding concerning changes in circumstances and obligations to report them. This research was based on a longitudinal panel of 51 claimants who were interviewed three times over the course of nine months. The objectives of the overall study were focused on the key areas of: * how claimants experience changes in circumstances * their knowledge and perceptions about reporting changes in circumstances * their sources of knowledge * their experiences of reporting changes * experiences and responses to overpayment recovery due to error...|$|R
500|$|Authorities in the Atlanta area {{discovered}} Cox's activities, {{and eventually}} his identity. On August 6, 2004, the United States Secret Service issued arrest warrants for Cox, alleging conspiracy, identity theft, mail and wire fraud, money laundering, and <b>social</b> <b>security</b> number <b>fraud.</b> News broadcasts showed photos of Cox and Hauck and requested that viewers provide any information pertaining to their whereabouts. By spring 2005, {{the couple had}} eluded authorities for eighteen months, using dozens of identities, including ones stolen from former co-workers and acquaintances. Cox also stole identities from the homeless by posing as a survey–taking Red Cross worker to acquire their <b>social</b> <b>security</b> numbers. At this point, due to remorse and anxiety, Arnold called the FBI and confessed. She was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison for numerous offenses, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud and identity theft. Arnold was also ordered to pay $300,000 dollars in restitution to her victims. Shortly thereafter, Cox filed multiple mortgages on two houses for $886,318 in Columbia, South Carolina in less than a week. An abstractor noticed this, and a fraud alert was issued on one of Cox's money-laundering bank accounts. He was arrested {{when he returned to the}} bank to make a transaction, but he told authorities his name was [...] "Gary Lee Sullivan", one of about thirty aliases Cox had at the time; because [...] "Sullivan" [...] had no open warrants, the police released him. Shortly afterwards, Cox and Hauck moved to Houston, but they separated and she remained there in hiding under an assumed name. A year later the Secret Service found Hauck and arrested her. Convicted on numerous counts, Hauck was sentenced to six years in prison, and five years of supervised release. In May 2006, after being on the run from authorities for two and a half years, Cox was placed on the Secret Service's Most Wanted Fugitives List.|$|R
