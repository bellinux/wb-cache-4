40|$|New Ploughing Effects on Cyperus rotundus L. in New Caledonia. I. Effects of Rotary Hoe and Circular <b>Spike</b> <b>Harrow.</b> Because of {{the biology}} of Cyperus rotundus, the worst weed in {{vegetable}} crops in New Caledonia, tillage may imply positive or negative effects on it's development. Consequently, in two fields with low and high densities of C. rotundus, a study was undertaken {{of the impact of}} a rotary hoe (Rotavator) and a circular <b>spike</b> <b>harrow</b> during new ploughing on the state and the distribution in the soil of tubers and chains of tubers. The main effect of the circular <b>spike</b> <b>harrow,</b> with its round teeth, is to bring tubers up to the surface. The rotary hoe, with its blades, cuts off more tubers and chains of tubers than the circular <b>spike</b> <b>harrow,</b> especially in field with a high weed invasion. By cutting off the chains of tubers, the rotary hoe can stimulate new growth of C. rotundus, consequently the frequent use of the rotary hoe may rapidly increase the numbers of tubers in the soil. These results give {{a better understanding of the}} effects of mechanical practices on the development and growth of C. rotundus and lay the groundwork for an effective weed integrated management in New Caledonia...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc harrows, tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag <b>harrows,</b> and <b>spike</b> <b>harrows),</b> chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
50|$|In cooler climates {{the most}} common types are the disc harrow, the chain harrow, the tine <b>harrow</b> or <b>spike</b> <b>harrow</b> and the spring tine harrow. Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as {{levelling}} the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing {{to break up the}} sod. In addition, there are various types of power harrow, in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.|$|R
5000|$|Drag harrows {{can be a}} name {{used for}} several {{different}} types of equipment. A <b>spike</b> tooth <b>harrow</b> or flex harrow is often called a drag harrow and is in use extensively throughout the US for seedbed preparation and for grooming grassland pastures. See also: ...|$|R

40|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War II {{augmented}} {{the necessity of}} utilizing agriculture 2 Ì† 7 s resources to the fullest extent in meeting increased food demands with reduced supplies of labor. One of the principal means of expanding production under such conditions is by fuller use of available farm machinery. Unfortunately, however, when a state of national emergency was declared in May, 1941, little was known either about the utilization of Iowa farm machinery or about the numbers of various types of machines available on the farms. To provide the needed information a survey was conducted in August and September of 1941 {{with the cooperation of}} the Work Projects Administration and the Agricultural Marketing Service. Information was collected in August from 2, 911 farms regarding corn planters, grain binders, grain drills, double disks, single disks, hay loaders, manure spreaders, mowers, plows, rakes, rollers, seeders, <b>spike</b> <b>harrows</b> and spring tooth harrows. The September survey obtained information from 3, 012 farms on. cornpickers, combines, ensilage cutters, grain elevators, corn shellers, feed grinders, milking machines, tractors, trucks, trailers and wagons 2 (table 1) ...|$|R

60|$|At first, Mulford {{naturally}} enough {{suspected that}} Spike intended {{to push for}} some Mexican port, by thus blinding his eyes as {{to the position of}} the vessel. The direction steered, however, soon relieved the mate from this apprehension. From the eastern extremity of Yucatan, the Mexican coast trends to the westward, and even to the south of west, for a long distance, whereas the course <b>steered</b> by <b>Spike</b> was north, easterly. This was diverging from the enemy's coast instead of approaching it, and the circumstance greatly relieved the apprehensions of Mulford.|$|R

At every sheeted cloud, {{whipping}} {{back from the}} hoofs of the horses and the steel <b>spikes</b> of the <b>harrow,</b> he had to bat his eyes {{to keep from being}} blinded. The smell of dust clogged his nostrils. As soon as he began to sweat under the hot sun the dust caked on his face, itching, stinging, burning. There was dust between his teeth.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} in-situ soil {{moisture}} conservation in arid and semi-arid regions due to insufficient rainfall for agriculture. For this purpose, a combination implement [integrated reservoir tillage system (RT) ] comprised of a single-row chisel plow, single-row <b>spike</b> tooth <b>harrow,</b> modified seeder, and spiked roller was developed and compared to the popular tillage practices, viz., minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) in an arid Mediterranean environment in Egypt. The different tillage practices were conducted at tillage depths of 15, 20, and 25 cm and forward speeds of 0. 69, 1, 1. 25, and 1. 53 m s- 1. Some soil physical properties, runoff, soil loss, water harvesting efficiency and yield of wheat were evaluated. The different tillage practices caused significant differences in soil physical properties as the RT increased soil infiltration, producing a rate of 48...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{conventional}} (mouldboard plough+ cultivator + <b>spike</b> tooth <b>harrow)</b> and conservational (reduced) tillage system (chisel + <b>spike</b> tooth <b>harrow)</b> and flat and ridge planting systems on soil physical properties (soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance) and plant characteristics of second crop silage maize grown in Tokat province situated in Mid-Blacksea Transition Climate Belt were investigated. Plant emergence and harvesting properties investigated were mean emergence dates, emerged rate index, percentage of emerged seedling, plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield. Soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance varied from 24. 39 to 25. 42 %, and from 1. 24 to 1. 33 g/cm 3, and from 0. 58 to 1. 60 MPa, at 0 - 10 cm soil depth respectively; the same properties varied from 24. 65 to 25. 95 %, and from 1. 25 to 1. 34 g/cm 3, and from 0. 95 to 1. 60 MPa, at 10 - 20 cm soil depth respectively. For plant properties; mean emerged dates, emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged varied from 12. 80 to 12. 85 days, and from 0. 335 to 0. 346 seedling/m day, and from 86. 11 to 88. 61, respectively. Plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield varied from 244. 7 to 266. 2 cm, from 2. 88 to 3. 13 cm, from 7525. 89 to 7580. 80 kg/da, and from 1523. 36 to 1534. 35 kg/da, respectively. The results indicated that soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance in conservational tillage system were higher than the conventional tillage system. Ridge planting system yielded higher values {{than that of the}} flat planting system. The emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged seedling in conservational tillage and flat planting systems were lower than conventional tillage and ridge planting system. The mean plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield were higher in conservational tillage and ridge planting systems than the conventional tillage and flat planting systems. The results of this study indicated conservational tillage system and ridge planting system could be advised for the second crop sillage maize production...|$|R

To get the full text please contact the other at Abusuwar @ yahoo. comA study was carried out for two seasons (2000 / 01 and 2001 / 02) at Agleri village (40 km north east of Neyala town) western Sudan in a semi-arid zone under rainfed conditions. The objective of the research was to evaluate the adaptability of introduced perennial legumes and grass pastures in a semi-arid environment. Four introduced perennial pasture species; namely, Stylosanthes hamata, Macroptilium atropurpurium and Clitoria ternata (legumes) and Cenchrus ciliaris (grass), were studied. Two ploughing methods, viz, spring toothed cultivator and <b>spiked</b> toothed <b>harrow,</b> were used. A split-plot deign with three replications was applied. Ploughing methods were assigned to the main plots and the pasture species to the subplots. The plot size was 15 x 20 m. Data were collected on soil moisture percentage, using the gravimetric method, and plant growth parameters (plant density, survival rate and plant cover). Generally, ploughing methods and pasture species had no significant effect on soil moisture content, but pasture species had a significant effect on plant growth (plant density, survival rate and plant cover). Stylosanthes hamata in a pure stand and in a mixture with Cenchrus ciliaris was better in growth parameters than the other pasture species. Stylosanthes hamata and Cenchrus ciliaris were able to compete with the native plant species. The study indicated that there was no significant effect of ploughing methods on growth parameters, but the spring toothed cultivator gave better results in plant density, plant survival and plant cover...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the Swash had her boat in the water, manned with four {{powerful}} oars, Spike steering {{it in his own}} person. Our young mate placed Tier in the bows, to point out the deepest water, and kept his sail a rap full, in order to get ahead as fast as possible. Ahead he did get, but it was on a course that soon brought him out in the open water of the main passage through the reef, leaving Spike materially astern. The latter now rose in his boat, and made a signal with his hat, which the boatswain perfectly understood. The latter caused the brig to ware short round on her heel, and boarded his foretack in chase, hauling up into the passage as soon as he could again round the reef. Mulford soon saw that it would never do for him to venture far from the rocks, the brig going two feet to his one, though not looking quite as high as he did in the boat. But the Swash had her guns, and it was probable they would be used rather than he should escape. When distant two hundred yards from the reef, therefore, he tacked. The new course brought the fugitives nearly at right angles to that <b>steered</b> by <b>Spike,</b> who stood directly on, as if conscious that, sooner or later, such a rencounter must occur. It would seem that the tide was setting through the passage, for when the boat of Mulford again reached the reef, it was considerably to windward of the channel out of which she had issued, and opposite to another which offered very opportunely for her entrance. Into this new channel, then, the mate somewhat blindly ran, feeling the necessity of getting out of gun-shot of the brig at every hazard. She at least could not follow him among the rocks, let Spike, in his boat, proceed as he might.|$|R
5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, steering clutches were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and steering clutches. Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, <b>spiked</b> tooth <b>harrows,</b> trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R
