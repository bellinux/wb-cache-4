5000|$|Centraalstaal {{initially}} {{started as}} a pre-processing plant with the sole purpose to support the shipbuilding industry {{in the north of}} the Netherlands. In 1972, several shipyards in the north of the Netherlands decided cooperate with each other, rather than compete against each other, in order to cut costs and to obtain a stronger position in the international shipbuilding industry. A result of this cooperation was the decision to cut production costs by starting a company that would provide prefabricated (precut and preformed) steel to the shipyards, thereby eliminating the necessity for each shipyard to invest in expensive prefabrication equipment. This resulted {{in the creation of a}} prefabrication factory and head office in the city of Groningen, which became known by the name of Centraalstaal BV. In 1977, Centraalstaal became part of the Central Industry Group, a holding company which currently owns 10 companies that offer a wide range of services to the international shipbuilding industry including engineering services, engineering software development, ship's equipment and <b>steel</b> <b>prefabrication.</b>|$|E
