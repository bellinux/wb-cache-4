2500|$|Technically speaking, every Malaysian name {{regardless}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ethnicity is <b>of</b> this type: <b>SURNAME,</b> FIRST NAME UNKNOWN (FNU) {{when only}} the Machine Readable Zone area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passport Biodata Page is considered.

5000|$|Since then <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manor {{and village}} (alias Coletone, Coleton, etc) has changed many times, {{dependant}} on <b>the</b> <b>surname</b> <b>of</b> its <b>holders,</b> <b>the</b> first suffix being Coleton Clavill (or Colaton Clavell), after the Claville family. Walter I de Claville (floruit 1086) (alias de Clarville and Latinised to de Clavilla) was an Anglo-Norman magnate and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 52 Devon Domesday Book tenants-in-chief <b>of</b> King William <b>the</b> Conqueror. He also held lands in Dorset. His Devonshire estates later formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feudal barony <b>of</b> Gloucester. <b>The</b> subsequent <b>holder</b> was <b>the</b> Dennis family, Latinized to Dacus, [...] "the Dane/Danish", which had branches at Orleigh and at Holcombe Burnell, also in Devon. It later {{became known as}} Collaton-Kirkham, after <b>the</b> Kirkham family <b>of</b> Blagdon. During <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> King Edward I (1272-1307) Sir Nicholas Kirkham, Sheriff of Devon in 1308/9, of Ashcombe, married Agatha Dennis, sister and heiress of Sir Robert Dennis (d.pre-1307) of Blagdon, and following <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Sir Robert Dennis <b>the</b> manor <b>of</b> Blagdon and others including Colaton-Clavil, passed to the Kirkham family, which shortly thereafter moved their seat to Blagdon. The Kirkham family held it for many generations. Finally the name changed to Collaton St Mary, when it became an ecclesiastical parish. The parish was created in 1864 and <b>the</b> foundation stone <b>of</b> St Mary's church was laid on 21 September of that year.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> history <b>of</b> a colonized {{country can}} often {{be seen in the}} {{indigenous}} people's surnames. For various reasons, mostly coming under <b>the</b> heading <b>of</b> [...] "expedient," [...] new governments and regimes have often added or markedly changed <b>the</b> <b>surnames</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous or targeted people. Thus, surnames {{can often be}}lie origin especially for those living in another country or have families who have emigrated. For the present generation, a surname might produce an inaccurate analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name <b>holder's</b> national/racial origins, or lead to legal/contractual problems. For later generations, it can present a broken link in searching for one's roots.|$|R
