40|$|Abstract Background The {{husbandry}} {{systems for}} <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> were changed in Sweden {{during the years}} 2001 – 2004, {{and an increase in}} the number of submissions for necropsy from <b>laying</b> <b>hen</b> farms was noted. Hence, this study was initiated to compare causes of mortality in different housing systems for commercial <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> during this change. Methods Based on results from routine necropsies of 914 <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> performed at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) in Uppsala, Sweden between 2001 and 2004, a retrospective study on the occurrence of diseases and cannibalism, i. e., pecking leading to mortality, in different housing systems was carried out. Using the number of disease outbreaks in caged flocks as the baseline, the expected number of flocks with a certain category of disease in the other housing systems was estimated having regard to the total number of birds in the population. Whether the actual number of flocks significantly exceeded the expected number was determined using a Poisson distribution for the variance of the baseline number, a continuity correction and the exact value for the Poisson distribution function in Excel 2000. Results Common causes of mortality in necropsied <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> included colibacillosis, erysipelas, coccidiosis, red mite infestation, lymphoid leukosis and cannibalism. Less common diagnoses were Newcastle Disease, pasteurellosis and botulism. Considering the size of the populations in the different housing systems, a larger proportion of <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> than expected was submitted for necropsy from litter-based systems and free range production compared to hens in cages (P P P Conclusion The results of the present study indicated that during 2001 – 2004 <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> housed in litter-based housing systems, with or without access to outdoor areas, were at higher risk of infectious diseases and cannibalistic behaviour compared to <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> in cages.

A feed mixture was served to <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> 825 g per day. The <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> had free access to drinking water, grazing, ground pecking, ground scratching and dust-bathing and in the free range. We focused investigation of on the egg laying intensity, selected parameters of physical egg quality and chemical egg contents. Time to relax of <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> was adjusted according to the summer and winter breeding seasons. The main activities of free-range hens are grazing, ground pecking, ground scratching and dust-bathing. The main activities of free-range hens are grazing, ground pecking, ground scratching and dust-bathing. These activities were investigated in <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> too in dependent of year period, more in the summer. Housing of the hens was equipped with the perch. The <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> regularly used a perch. A beginning of occupation the perch was at the time of time growing dark, at the end of the light day. A nesting material was selected regular, monthly exchange. It was meadow hay of excellent quality for the collection of high quality and safe eggs from nests in the <b>hen</b> house. The <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> had unlimited access to feed and water. The commercial feed mixture was available ad libitum and fresh kitchen remnants were added in a small amount, provided that they fed in the short term, so that not subject to harmful degradation process. The management of our experiment was scheduled at age of <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> 30 to 90 weeks. The egg laying intensity was observed 50 % in a moment of the experimental 1 st week (age of <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> 30 weeks). High egg laying intensity of <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> was at their age between 39 to 63 weeks. At the end of the experiment, at age of <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> 90 weeks was decreased egg laying intensity at 26. 19 %, which represents almost half of egg laying intensity recorded at the beginning of the experiment. An indicator of egg production in the our experiment was studied under defined conditions for small-scale breeding, i. e. in alternative production system with free range, under defined conditions of nutrition and timing of investigation more than one year, from the end of October to the end of December of the following year. The results of our experiment can be related to the season, months of the year. The <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> laid the eggs by individual weeks 33 - 90 weeks of age about average weight from 57. 5 to 75. 0 g. The fat content of an egg mass was 11. 3 g. 100 - 1 and protein 12. 39. g. 100 - 1. The table eggs from conditions of small-scale breeding are an important source of foodstuffs for the population, especially in rural areas. It must be given to this source of table eggs for human nutrition the highest quality and health safety too. <br /...|$|R
50|$|European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC is {{legislation}} {{passed by the}} European Union on the minimum standards for keeping egg <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> which effectively bans conventional battery cages. The directive, passed in 1999, banned conventional battery cages in the EU from January 1, 2012 after a 13-year phase-out. Battery cages were already banned in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden prior to 2012. The directive {{does not apply to}} establishments with fewer than 350 <b>laying</b> <b>hens</b> or establishments rearing breeding <b>laying</b> <b>hens.</b> Such establishments are, however, subject to the requirements of Directive 98/58/EC.
