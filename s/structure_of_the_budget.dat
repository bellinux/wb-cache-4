40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact {{and significance of}} independent budget analysis and advocacy initiatives {{that are designed to}} improve budget transparency and the poverty focus of government expenditure priorities. It draws on case study research of six budget groups in Brazil, Croatia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Uganda, which include non-governmental organisations, research institutions and social movements. The findings demonstrate that civil society budget initiatives contribute to improvements in the transparency of budgetary decisions and the budget process, increased budget awareness and literacy, and deeper engagement in the budget process on the part of legislators, the media and civil society organisations. While the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> process makes substantial changes in expenditure priorities difficult to achieve, budget groups directly contribute to positive impacts on budget allocations and improved implementation, thereby increasing the accountability of decision-makers. Tracking of budgetary expenditures and impacts was also found to be effective in ensuring effective utilisation of education and health expenditures. Increased budget allocations and improved utilisation of public funds that benefit poor and disadvantaged groups can ensure greater equity in budget priorities and further social justice objectives. The activities of budget groups strengthen democracy by fostering accountability, enhancing transparency and deepening participation and voice.

The article deals with the current structure, constraints and contradictions of the EU budget from 2000 to 2006, both from the background of global developments, intra-EU interests and the requirements of successful accession. Special attention is paid to the preparation of the new member countries to efficiently and quickly absorb available EU resources (both in agriculture and in the framework of structural and cohesion funds). It is pointed out that, although net resource flow will substantially fall short of that to the more developed but still net beneficiary present member countries, it could generate budgetary constraints in the new member countries, particularly in the first and decisive years of membership. The last chapter addresses some key issues, concerns and uncertainties of the volume and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> for the next period covering the years from 2007 to 2013.

40|$|It is my {{intention}} {{in this paper}} {{to comment on the}} <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and on Rhodesian fiscal policy in the light of this budgetary structure. I have two basic observations to make. The first is that the 1972 budget is, in structural terms, entirely as was to be expected and it may, in fact, be interpreted as one further budget which has the effect of maintaining a gradual but consistent regressive shift in the fiscal structure. The second is that the structure is not only regressive, but also fairly rigid, and the budgetary principles that have formed the basis of not only this, but also a succession of budgets prior to this, have had the net effect of reducing the impact of fiscal policy on the general level of economic activity. This second observation should not be interpreted as implying a reduction in the influence of the state in the economy but rather as an implication that other, non-fiscal methods, have been increasingly employed in an effort to achieve desired objectives. Generalisations, by definition, seek to simplify complex situations by reference to dominant characteristics. The test of validity, when applied to generalisations, is not whether simplification obscures detail, but whether this suppression of detail is in fact misleading. My basic thesis is that discussion and analysis of the Rhodesian budget is very often concerned with detail, to the extent that general principles are often overlooked. Further, the details themselves are carefully woven into the general fabric of this structure, and thus an overview is the most efficient way of gaining an insight into the detail...|$|E
