40|$|Abstract Objective: Incidental {{recall of}} {{information}} used during a problem solving task is relatively insensitive to reduced motivation due to depression, and recognition tasks are relatively unaffected by memory impairment. This study validated a new test designed to identify intentional memory difficulties using incidental recognition for Similarities word pairs. Method:Recognition items {{were created by}} pairing Similarities words with incorrect semantically or phonemically related alternatives. The 38 -item forced choice test required recognition of the Similarities items immediately after the <b>subtest</b> (<b>e.</b> g., orange or juice?) and again following Block Design (e. g., apple or orange?). The test was administered to 56 nonlitigants with TBI (n = 24), dementia (n = 18), CVA (n = 7), and other disorders. Patients had significant immediate memory impairment on the HVLTR or Logical Memory (mean = 35 T) and reduced FSIQ (mean = 89). Thirty-four individuals instructed to malinger cognitive impairment for financial compensation, and four litigants that failed the TOMM also completed incidental recognition. Results: Patients accurately recognized an average of 89 % immediate, 92 % of delayed, and 90 % of total items. Malingerers were significantly less accurate, with 62 % immediate, 58 % delayed, and 60 % total items correct. A cutoff of 75 % correct accurately identified 87 % of the validation sample and all four litigants. Scores that were lower than those obtained by any patient with neurological disorder were obtained by 47 % of malingerers on delayed or total recognition. Three of four litigants scored more poorly than any patients. Conclusions: Incidental recognition of Similarities items may identify exaggerated memory difficulty.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. (Psychology) The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect that hypertension has on brain function. A neuropsychological test battery comprising of the following tests was employed as a multivariate measure of brain dysfunction in a quasiexperimental, matched group design: a) The Complex Figure Test of Rey (copy, immediate recall and delayed recall), b) the Logical Memory Test, c) the Digits Span Test, d) the Verbal Paired Associate Learning <b>Subtest,</b> <b>e)</b> the Controlled Oral Word Generation Test, fr the Trail Making Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Subtest, This permitted a comparison in brain functioning between a group of hypertensive and a group of normotensive participants that were matched according to age, handedness, level of education and sex. The matching of variables increased the sensitivity of the study by controlling extraneous variables and ensured that the groups were compatible on the paired variables. The results were statistically analyzed by employing the Mann-Whitney U statistic for small groups and the Chi-square statistic on the measured variables. Further, content analysis was employed to test for significant differences in strategies of coping, immediate recall and delayed recall of the Complex Figure of Rey. The results indicated that: 1. there were significant differences in attention and concentration, motor functioning, perceptual abilities, information processing, memory, and planning and organisation between the two groups, with the hypertensive group obtaininq significantly lower scores on test measuring these variables; and 2. there were no significant differences in the verbal abilities (word fluency) of the two groups. The results support previous research, finding indications of vocal lesions located across the brains of people suffering from hypertension. Practical implications of the results are discussed and recommendations for future research have been made [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the suitability of}} radar satellite images for monitoring small reservoir surfaces, the suitability of remotely sensed time series of their surface areas to calibrate hydrological models, and small reservoir evaporation losses. Radar remote sensing of small reservoirs is suitable especially during the rainy season, but is affected by wind and lack of vegetation context during the dry season. Reservoirs could be extracted from the radar images most often with a quasi-manual classification approach, as stringent classification rules often failed under less than optimal conditions. Failure to extract reservoirs {{was due to the}} backscattered radar signal that occurred above wind speeds of 2. 6 m s exp(- 1) (Bragg scattering). Due to lower wind speeds, the use of night time acquisitions was more effective than the use of daytime images. As optical systems perform well under low vegetation contrast, and independent of wind conditions, radar and optical systems can be used complimentary. Time series of remotely sensed small reservoir surface areas, translated into storage volume changes, were successfully used to calibrate hydrological rainfall-runoff models. Eight small reservoirs in the Upper East Region of Ghana, and Togo, were monitored to calibrate modified Thornthwaite-Mather models, in which increasing precipitation leads to exponentially increasing contributing areas. The model results indicate that the overall impact of the reservoirs largely depends on the ratios of reservoir and watershed areas. For this two year study, the reservoirs captured on the average 34 % of quick flow, and 15 % of overall watershed runoff. Reservoir evaporation losses were measured directly with a floating evaporation pan (E sub(o)) and were compared to evaporation rates determined from the reservoir?s energy budget (E sub(B)) and Penman's equation (<b>E</b> <b>sub(t)).</b> The direct <b>E</b> sub(o) measurements were generally lower than <b>E</b> <b>sub(t)</b> and <b>E</b> sub(B). Compared to land based <b>E</b> <b>sub(t)</b> Land, the reservoir evaporation <b>E</b> <b>sub(t)</b> was not excessive. Regional wind patterns influence evaporation dynamics from the reservoir. Northeast winds with a high saturation deficit lead to significant evaporation losses, while the evaporation losses under moister, more prevalent southwest winds were moderate...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative {{analysis}} of neuropsychological instruments {{has been a}} long tradition in neuropsychological assessment. This study extended this type of analysis to the Matrix Reasoning (MR) subtest of the WAIS-III. The study compared the performance of TBI participants on the item types identified within the MR <b>subtest</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> pattern completion, classification, analogy and serial reasoning) with a group of normal controls. MR items were classified into categories (as defined respectively by the Psychological Corporation and by our own research definition). Ninety-three non brain-injured control and 72 brain injured control participants were included in the study. One way {{analysis of}} variance indicated that the TBI group performed significantly worse than the non brain injured group the MR performance overall as well as for both the Psychological Corporation classification and on the research defined categories. Within group analysis revealed that both groups performed significantly differently across the item categories with the most difficult categories being analogy and serial reasoning for the research defined categories and the classification and serial reasoning categories for the Psychological Corporation-defined groups. The results of the study indicate that an item type analysis of the MR performance may further contribute to the qualitative aspects of diagnostic formulation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} errorless {{learning}} approach using a procedural memory task (i. e. learning of actual routes) {{in patients with}} amnesia, as compared to trial-and-error learning. DESIGN: Counterbalanced self-controlled cases series. SETTING: Psychiatric hospital (Korsakoff clinic). SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 10 patients with the Korsakoff amnestic syndrome. INTERVENTION: All patients learned a route in four sessions on separate days using an errorless approach and a different route using trial-and-error. MAIN MEASURES: Error rate was scored during route learning and standard neuro-psychological tests were administered (i. <b>e.</b> <b>subtest</b> route recall of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and the Dutch version of the California Verbal Learning Test (VLGT)). RESULTS: A significant learning effect {{was found in the}} trial-and-error condition over consecutive sessions (P = 0. 006), but no performance difference was found between errorless and trial-and-error learning of the routes. VLGT performance was significantly correlated with a trial-and-error advantage (P < 0. 05); no significant correlation was found between the RBMT subtest and the learning conditions. CONCLUSION: Errorless learning was no more successful than trial-and-error learning of a procedural spatial task in patients with the Korsakoff syndrome (severe amnesia) ...|$|R
40|$|Base-rate data on subtest scatter for the WAIS-R was {{obtained}} from a sample of 200 healthy subjects recruited to match the adult UK population in terms of age, sex and social class distribution. Tables are presented which permit {{an assessment of the}} abnormality (i. e. rarity) of an individual's pattern of WAIS—R performance in terms of subtest range and subtest deviations from an individual's subtest mean. Guidance on the appropriate use of the tables is offered and the data are compared with data from the US WAIS—R standardization sample where appropriate. The distinction between reliable and abnormal differences is highlighted. In clinical interpretation of WAIS—R performance, considerable emphasis is placed on the examination of <b>subtest</b> scatter, i. <b>e.</b> the <b>subtest</b> profile is used to identify a client's relative strengths and weaknesses (Crawford, 1992; Kaufman, 1990; Lezak, 1983). When conducting such an analysis {{it is important to be}} aware of the distinction between the reliability and abnormality of any subtest differences. A reliable difference is one that is unlikely to have arisen from measurement error and simply indicates that a client is genuinely superior on the abilities tapped by one measure over thos...|$|R
