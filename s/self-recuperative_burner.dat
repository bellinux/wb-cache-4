40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} drying and heating the metallurgical ladles. The ladle heating parameters significantly affect the metallurgical processes. The heating process target of the ceramic ladle lining can reduce the steel temperature in the furnace. It resulted in reduction of energy consumption what is an economic benefit. Adopted drying and heating rate of the ladle depends on the ladle refractory lining - an alkaline or an aluminosilicate. The temperature field uniformity of ceramic lining is a basic technological requirement. The presented industrial research shows {{the way of the}} ladle heating where the <b>self-recuperative</b> <b>burner</b> was used. The recuperative burner application gives the rapid increasing of the preheated air temperature what has resulted in the reduction of fuel consumption for the same thermal power. The examinations of the two ladles heating process were presented and the energy efficiency of that process was identified...|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{advances}} {{in recent years}} have been made in combustion engineering and the recovery of heat from flue gas for preheating combustion air. Flameless oxidation, direct fuel gas injection (Japan) and the development of ceramic <b>self-recuperative</b> and regenerative <b>burners</b> are examples of innovatory developments. These systems allow combustion efficiencies of over 85 %. They have not yet become state-of-the-art in furnace engineering in Germany. The objective of a new Research and Development project is to develop a new generation of furnaces which differs from state-of-the-art installations by a reduction in size of up to 30 % and compliance with very strict environmental standards. The new combustion systems will allow a notable increase in heat transfer from the furnace chamber to the load {{and at the same time}} a considerable decrease in flue gas losses. Following the completion of the Research and Development project, the new industrial furnaces will be built and tested in a demonstration project. ...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{implementation}} into CFD codes of large kinetic mechanisms for {{the prediction of}} pollutant emissions is still unfeasible, due to computer time limitations which become particularly relevant when considering the typical scale of the industrial applications. Therefore, simplified modeling approaches are generally adopted, as they allow reducing the computational effort associated with the numerical simulations. With regard to NO formation, simple one-step mechanisms are used to describe each of the relevant routes contributing to the overall generation of NO, i. e., thermal, prompt. The main drawback associated to a simplified NO formation approach lies, however, in the extreme sensitivity of the lumped rates on the thermo chemical state which define the combustion system of interest. Then, a proper description of turbulence/chemistry interactions must be employed in the CFD model, to provide a realistic background for the estimation of NO emissions. This becomes particularly important in MILD combustion regime, which generally requires an accurate description of the gas-phase oxidation, due to the kinetic control on the overall combustion process. The present paper discusses key aspects and requisite for predicting NO formation in MILD combustion regime. The approach {{is based on the}} direct coupling of simplified NO mechanisms to the CFD calculation and is applied to different MILD conditions. Simulations are carried out for a set of experimental runs performed on a <b>self-recuperative</b> MILD <b>burner,</b> varying the hydrogen content in the fuel stream from 0 % up to 50 % by wt.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation performed upon a single-ended <b>self-recuperative</b> radiant tube <b>burner</b> fuelled by natural gas in the non-premixed mode, which is used in the steel industry for surface treatment. The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12. 8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0. 5 (very lean flame) to 0. 95 (quasi-stoichiometric condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring {{at the same time the}} thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the exhaust gases recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal recirculation mechanism (exhaust gases recirculation, EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a pre-combustion chamber terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote exhaust gas entrainment into the flame tube. The most important result of this solution was a decrease of NOx emissions at the exhaust of the order of 50...|$|R
