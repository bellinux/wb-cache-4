Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies.|$|E

30|$|The ZIP {{regression}} model {{indicates that the}} number of segments when <b>students</b> were <b>working</b> are 2.2 [1.6, 2.9] times greater for CoP instructors while controlling for other factors (p <. 001).

The number of segments when <b>students</b> were <b>working</b> are 1.6 [1.04, 2.4] times greater for foundational courses (p =. 01).

25|$|The {{oldest of}} the {{mandolin}} orchestras, which has been continuously active since the 1940s, is the Shfeya Orchestra, founded by Moshe Medalia, and today made up of graduates from the Shfeya Youth Village. The village is a boarding school for at-risk junior and senior high-school students. Part of the education includes <b>students</b> <b>working</b> together in small groups, teaching music to one another. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of learning materials when Moshe Jacobson, founder of the music program arrived in 1942. So he wrote text books for the instruments and composed music and songs.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Kolmogorov went on {{his first}} long trip abroad, {{traveling}} to Göttingen and Munich, and then to Paris. He had various scientific contacts in Göttingen. First of all with Courant and his <b>students</b> <b>working</b> on limit theorems, where diffusion processes {{turned out to be}} the limits of discrete random processes, then with Hermann Weyl in intuitionistic logic, and lastly with Edmund Landau in function theory. His pioneering work, About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory, was published (in German) in 1931. Also in 1931, he became a professor at the Moscow State University.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, {{results from}} the {{collapsed}} COPUS categories suggest that instructors’ use of active learning techniques—as captured by instructor guiding—does not guarantee increases in active learning for students—as captured by <b>student</b> <b>working.</b> Although <b>student</b> <b>working</b> does increase with instructor guiding (Fig.  3), this relationship was much stronger in the CoP instructor classes (r 2 = 0.54) than in the non-CoP instructor classes ((r 2 = 0.14). In other words, the time that CoP instructors spent guiding was more readily transformed into <b>student</b> <b>working</b> {{than it was for}} non-CoP instructors. The relationship between instructor guiding and student talking demonstrated the opposite pattern. When non-CoP instructors spent more time guiding, their students {{were more likely to be}} recorded as talking (r 2 = 0.76). Conversely, for CoP instructors, there was essentially no correlation between instructor guiding and student talking (r 2 = 0.04).|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{published}} research conducted in Second Life {{is associated with}} education and learning.

One such study tested the usefuleness of SL as an action learning environment in a senior course for management information systems students. Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using SL as a platform. Both problem-based learning and constructionism acted as framing pedagogies for the task, with <b>students</b> <b>working</b> in teams to design and build a learning experience which could be possible in real life.|$|E
