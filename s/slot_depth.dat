40|$|Abstract: On the {{nondestructive}} testing, {{not only}} detection but also sizing of crack is desirable because the crack depth {{is one of}} the most important parameter to evaluate the impact of the crack to the material, to estimate crack growth and ultimately to predict lifetime of the component. Moreover, accurate measurement of the crack depth optimizes countermeasures and timing of repairs, and eventually reduces total cost for plant maintenance. Laserultrasonic is a technique that uses two laser beams; one with a short pulse for the generation of ultrasound and another one, long pulse or continuous, coupled to an optical interferometer for detection. The technique features a large detection bandwidth, which is important for small defect inspection. Another feature of laser-ultrasonics is the remote optical scanning of generation and detection points, which enables to inspect components in narrow space and/or having complex shapes. A purpose of this paper is to describe the performance of a laser-ultrasonic testing (LUT) system on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) inspection. We have developed a new technique for sizing shallow cracks, say 0. 5 - 1. 5 mm, based on the laser-induced surface wave and its frequency analysis. First, sizing capability of the system will be demonstrated by using an artificial surface-breaking <b>slot</b> having <b>depth</b> of 0 - 2 mm in a stainless steel plate.

The main objective was to identify the optimum extension of the casing treatment with reference to rotor leading edge which results in maximum stall margin improvements with minimum loss in the stage efficiency. At each axial extension the compressor performance is distinctive. The improvement in the stall margin was very significant at some axial extensions with 4 %– 5 % penalty in the stage efficiency. The compressors stage shows recovery in terms of efficiency at lower axial extensions of 20 % and 40 % with increase in the peak stage efficiency. Measurements of flow parameters showed the typical behaviors at near stall flow conditions. Hot wire sensor was placed at the rotor upstream in the tip region to capture the oscillations in the inlet axial and tangential velocities at stall conditions. In the absence of casing treatment the compressor exhibit abrupt stall with very high oscillations in the inlet axial and tangential velocity of the flow. The extents of oscillations reduce with bend skewed casing treatment. Few measurements were also performed in the plenum chamber and salient results are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} how multidimensional spatial analysis of hydrograph data enables the 3 D mapping of hydraulic pathways through complex sedimentary aquifer {{systems in the}} Namoi Catchment (New South Wales, Australia). Historical groundwater head records over the past 40 years capture the influence of irrigation extractions. Analysing the head change throughout the aquifer in 3 D and with respect to time clearly shows both the yearly and long term impacts of groundwater extractions on river-aquifer interactions. The 3 D analysis also maps the recharge pathways, delineating the primary zones of recharge. The hydraulic data were analysed and cross validated with lithological logs, groundwater temperature and pH values. Data analysis was undertaken using spatial analysis techniques available in ArcGIS and EarthVision facilitated by extensive use of Python scripting. Some hydrographs show that aquifer heads respond to variations in extraction differently at different depths, indicating that there are impervious or leaky semi-impervious layers. Other hydrographs show heads from different depths all responding {{in the same way}} to extraction and subsequent recovery, indicating that locally the system is vertically hydraulically connected. The head data were analysed over one year periods with no flood events. During low rainfall years, groundwater usage is at its highest level, resulting in maximum pumping related head change throughout the aquifer. Positioning the head values in 3 D space at the <b>slotted</b> <b>depth</b> of the boreholes highlights hydraulic connectivity between boreholes and through the alluvial sequence. Correlating lithological logs in sedimentary environments containing numerous sand and clay units is difficult. Mapping the horizontal continuity in head change aided the borehole log correlation, showing which sedimentary units are hydraulically connected. The 3 D mapping of head change due to pumping stress enabled the 3 D mapping of palaeochannels, clearly delineating the meandering path of pre-existing water courses and the link to the present day stream channels. Spatial data analysis techniques adopted for this research have successfully enhanced the understanding of river and aquifer interactions and our knowledge of the 3 D geometry of the aquifers, showing that shallow and deep aquifers are more complex than previously conceptualised for the region. The resulting 3 D conceptual models have provided an improved framework for the construction of 3 D groundwater flow models. Presenting the data in 3 D has also proved to be a powerful communication tool {{that can be used in}} public meetings, improving the conceptual understanding of water dynamics for all stakeholders.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} two of {{the mechanisms}} that limit the attainable force density in slotted low-speed permanent-magnet (PM) electric machines. Most of the interest {{is focused on the}} force density limits imposed by heating of the windings and by stator reactance. The study is based on analytical models for the force and reactance calculations and a lumped parameter thermal model. It is found that in a machine with an indirectly cooled stator, it is difficult to achieve a force density greater than 100 kN m 2 due to temperature limits. A high force density is achieved by using deep slots, which lead to high reactance. The high reactance severely increases the converter kilovolt-ampere requirement and total system cost. It is also shown that the cost caused by the high reactance will also limit the force density reached. In machines with one slot per pole per phase, the reactance limited the useful <b>slot</b> <b>depth</b> to approximately 200 mm.
