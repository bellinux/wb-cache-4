5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and <b>sound</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

Asymmetric double glazing, using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU.

25|$|The Allied {{technical}} experts found much to praise about her design and construction.

The British and the Americans who examined graph singled out her Zeiss periscope for particular praise. The American officers {{who carried out}} her initial inspection in Iceland recommended it be copied {{as quickly as possible}} for possible US Navy use. Her underwater acoustic equipment was found to be a sophisticated array of hydrophones that was significantly better than the British equivalents. The main criticism of the boat was poor and cramped crew accommodation, which would degrade crew performance on long patrols.|$|E
25|$|A {{staircase}} {{near the}} main chamber, {{at the level}} of the radio room and toilet facility, led up to the east observation post. It was decided that the aerial would be hidden by withdrawing it into a pipe after use, with the pipe extending down the stairs which led to the main room. While it had initially been planned that the observation apertures would both be slits, the final choice was for the eastern aperture over the Mediterranean to be larger, overlooking a narrow ledge, yet still completely concealed. The opening and ledge were sufficiently large that a man could climb out onto the platform for fresh air. Part way up the main set of stairs was another set which led to the west observation post. The western slit over the bay was concealed with a concrete wedge. The entirety of the main chamber had been plastered and its floor covered in cork tiles, both methods to reduce <b>sound</b> <b>transmission.</b> The entrance passage had loose soil, to facilitate burials if needed. It also had loose bricks to further brick up the tunnel access once the six men had been sealed inside the cave.|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of direct and indirect (flanking) <b>sound</b> <b>transmissions</b> is presented. It {{can be applied to}} geometries with extrusion symmetry. The structures are modelled with spectral finite elements. The acoustic domains are described by means of a modal expansion of the pressure field and must be cuboid-shaped. These reasonable simplifications in the geometry allow the use of more efficient numerical methods. Consequently the coupled vibroacoustic problem in structures such as junctions is efficiently solved. The vibration reduction index of T-junctions with acoustic excitation and with point force excitation is compared. The differences due to the excitation type obey quite general trends that could be taken into account by prediction formulas. However, they are smaller than other uncertainties not considered in practice. The model is also used to check if the <b>sound</b> <b>transmissions</b> of a fully vibroacoustic problem involving several flanking paths can be reproduced by superposition of independent paths. There exist some differences caused by the interaction between paths, which are more important at low frequencies. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

Also important are the construction details of the framing with steel studs, wider stud spacing, double studding, insulation, and other details reducing <b>sound</b> <b>transmission.</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>transmission</b> class (STC) ratings can be increased from 33 for an ordinary stud-wall to as high as 59 with double 1/2" [...] drywall {{on both sides of}} a wood stud wall with resilient channels on one side and fiberglass batt insulation between the studs.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} to have two or more {{vibratory}} machines of the same type mounted on the same supporting structure. These vibratory machines transmit structure-borne sound to adjacent walls or floors and the structure-borne sound is eventually emitted as noise into indoor spaces. The interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines increase the structure-borne <b>sound</b> power <b>transmission</b> significantly at some frequencies and decrease it considerably at some other frequencies. However, {{there is still no}} general design frameworks of supporting structure optimization strategy that target on minimizing structure-borne <b>sound</b> power <b>transmission</b> by utilizing the interactions of the mounting points among coherent machines properly. This paper for the first time develops a practical design framework to obtain an optimal set of geometrical parameters for a supporting structure by using a genetic algorithm with parametric finite element models. A steel-made supporting structure with two coherent fans installed on were analyzed. Experiments were conducted to obtain the source mobilities and free velocities of the coherent fans that are required for the calculation of structure-borne <b>sound</b> power <b>transmission.</b> Parametric finite element analysis was conducted to obtain the receiver mobility of the supporting structure. A genetic algorithm solved the optimal solution. The results shown that the proposed approach is sufficiently capable of minimizing the structure-borne <b>sound</b> power <b>transmission</b> on a supporting structure with coherent machines mounted on a supporting structure.

5000|$|The {{electrolytic}} detector, or the bare-point electrolytic detector as it {{was also}} called, was a type of detector (demodulator) used in early radio receivers. First used by Canadian radio researcher Reginald Fessenden in 1903, it was used until about 1913, after which it was superseded by vacuum tube detectors such as the Fleming valve and the Audion.

50|$|Seti’s {{music is}} ambient, with few songs {{containing}} readily apparent rhythms (those with rhythm tend toward the trip hop-ambient-IDM genres). The {{mood of the}} music is pervasively mysterious, grandiose and occasionally spooky; the sounds used are expansive, even alien in nature.

Many other sounds give the impressions of quiet computers, signals travelling immense distances, garbled radio transmissions, and electrical energies. The net effect of the music is that the listener feels transported to the deep recesses of space, or feels s/he is listening to <b>sounds,</b> <b>transmissions,</b> or events in deep space.
