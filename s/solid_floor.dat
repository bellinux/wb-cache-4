There were no molehills within the smaller building, which had suggested that, unlike its neighbour, it has a buried <b>solid</b> <b>floor,</b> and this was confirmed by excavation. This had a floor originally made of mortar, relaid at least once, but then covered with a layer of flint cobbles, suggesting that it was a working area. The old hearth was not covered, so it may have still been used. A new fireplace was also added, apparently of a domestic design, although the context makes that function improbable. A well-marked track led southwest down the slope from S1, and a large midden was close to the path. It has been suggested that a [...] "clean" [...] pit north of S1 was a well, with fresh water floating above the saltwater below, a phenomenon known from Blakeney Point and elsewhere on the Norfolk coast.|$|E

However, <b>solid</b> wood <b>floors</b> are still common and popular. <b>Solid</b> wood <b>floors</b> have a thicker wear surface and can be sanded and finished more times than an engineered wood floor.

40|$|Summary: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to directly compare Salmonella isolation rates from pig slaughtered after ~ 4 hours holding on slatted or <b>solid</b> concrete <b>floors.</b> Seven truckloads (replicates) of market swine (~ 120 kg) from a fully integrated farrow-to-slaughter operation were studied. At unloading, groups of pigs (15 - 30) were sorted to 1) no-hold (20 - 45 minutes waiting), 2) pens with <b>solid</b> concrete <b>floors</b> (~ 4 hours), 3) slatted concrete floors (~ 4 hours). Postmortem samples were cultured for Salmonella. Those pigs held in pens with slatted floors (63. 6 %) had significantly (P < 0. 05) less Salmonella in their ceca than those held on <b>solid</b> <b>floors</b> (72. 7 %) ...|$|R

60|$|But to my {{surprise}} I ran against a blank wall before I {{reached a point where}} the waters came to the roof of the corridor. Could I be mistaken? I felt around. No, I had come to the main corridor, and still there was a breathing space between {{the surface of the water}} and the rocky ceiling above. And then I turned up the main corridor in the direction that Carthoris and the head of the column had passed a half-hour before. On and on I swam, my heart growing lighter at every stroke, for I knew that I was approaching closer and closer to the point where there would be no chance that the waters ahead could be deeper than they were about me. I was positive that I must soon feel the <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> beneath my feet again and that once more my chance would come to reach the Temple of Issus and the side of the fair prisoner who languished there.|$|E

[...] "You must jump," [...] she cried: and all wounded as I was, I jumped with wild force on to the <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> of the upper platform. My broken leg thrilled through with pain. But I was safe--safe. I was standing by her side on the Floor of the Strangers. The lava sank down again with a hideous sob, as if disappointed of its living prey. I gazed around me for the priest and his acolytes. Not a sign or a mark of them anywhere was to be seen. I stood alone with Kea by the brink of the precipice. The rest had melted away to their hidden lairs as if by magic.|$|E

These were placed half a mile in front of the men-of-war, and lay in shelter of an immense boom, specially designed to arrest the approach of an enemy at night. In addition to the fire-ships, Cochrane had prepared two or three vessels as what he called explosion-ships. These were intended not so much to damage the enemy as to terrify them, and to prevent their sending boats to divert the course of the fire-ships. A solid foundation of logs had been first laid on the keel, so as to form an extremely <b>solid</b> <b>floor</b> and to give the explosion an upward tendency. On these were placed a large number of empty spirit and water casks set on end. Into these fifteen hundred barrels of powder were emptied; the space around them was filled in with timber and sand, so as to form a solid mass, and over the powder casks were laid several hundred shells and some three thousand hand-grenades.|$|E

The ammonia emission of each compartment was determined by continuously measuring the ventilation rate and the concentration of the ammonia in the exhaust air. The emission from the compartments with the <b>solid</b> <b>floors</b> was about 50 % of the emission of the compartment with the slatted floors.

40|$|Abstract. Environmental impacts {{associated}} with building materials are under increasing scrutiny in the US. A gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory (LCI) of solid strip and <b>solid</b> plank hardwood <b>flooring</b> production {{was conducted in}} the eastern US for the reporting year 2006. Survey responses from hardwood flooring manufacturing facilities in this region accounted for nearly 28 % of total US <b>solid</b> hardwood <b>flooring</b> production for that year. This study examined the materials, fuels, and energy required to produce <b>solid</b> hardwood <b>flooring,</b> coproducts, and the emissions to air, land, and water. SimaPro software was used to quantify the environmental impacts {{associated with}} the reported materials use and emissions. Impact data were allocated on their mass contribution to all product and coproduct production of 1. 0 m 3 (oven-dry mass basis) of <b>solid</b> hardwood <b>flooring.</b> Carbon flow and transportation data are provided {{in addition to the}} LCI data. Results of this study are useful for creating a cradle-to-gate inventory when linked to LCIs for the hardwood forest resource and the production of solid hardwood lumber in the same region...|$|R
