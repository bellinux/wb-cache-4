60|$|The {{secretion}} {{from the}} glands is extremely viscid, {{so that it}} can be drawn out into long threads. It appears colourless, but stains little balls of paper pale pink. An object of any kind placed on a gland always causes it, as I believe, to secrete more freely; but the mere presence of the object renders this difficult to ascertain. In some cases, however, the effect was strongly marked, as when particles of sugar were added; but the result in this case is probably due merely to exosmose. Particles of carbonate and phosphate of ammonia and of some other salts, for instance <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc,</b> likewise increase the secretion. Immersion in a solution of one part of chloride of gold, or of some other salts, to 437 of water, excites the glands to largely increased secretion; on the other hand, tartrate of antimony produces no such effect. Immersion in many acids (of the strength of one part to 437 of water) likewise causes a wonderful amount of [page 14] secretion, so that when the leaves are lifted out, long ropes of extremely viscid fluid hang from them. Some acids, on the other hand, do not act in this manner. Increased secretion is not necessarily dependent on the inflection of the tentacle, for particles of sugar and of <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> cause no movement.|$|E
30|$|The ATR-FTIR imaging on the priming in the {{cross-section}} from Titian’s Portrait of a Man gave two distinct FTIR spectra. One of these exhibits a complex sulphate infrared absorption band with the maximum centred around 1040  cm− 1 together with additional small sharp bands at c. 1157 and 966  cm− 1, and correlates with areas found by SEM–EDX to contain only Zn, S and O; the other, {{with a single}} broad band at c. 1060 ‒ 70  cm− 1, corresponds to areas containing some potassium in addition [23]. The spectra from the potassium-containing areas are not an exact match to published data for known potassium zinc sulphates such as K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O [30], and further work is needed to fully identify these species. Nevertheless similar results were obtained from two other paintings by Titian where {{it was possible to}} carry out ATR-FTIR imaging, and from the painting by François Quesnel (Table  3 and [23]). The samples from the other paintings in the table were either not suitable for ATR-FTIR imaging, or where this was possible the spectra were not sufficiently distinct. Reassessment of the SEM–EDX results did, however, confirm the presence of potassium in conjunction with the zinc sulphate in every case, at least where no potassium-containing pigments such as red lake or ultramarine were present to interfere with the analyses, including in the portrait by François Quesnel, as illustrated in Fig.  2. The source of white vitriol was the mineral goslarite (ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O), and although potassium could be present as an impurity {{it is also possible that}} it was introduced through some sort of processing before use. Zinc acts as a secondary or auxiliary drier, but it may be that its effectiveness is dependent on its preparation, since the experiments using pure zinc sulphate in the heptahydrate form published so far have shown rather variable results [31]. Comments in the historical literature also seem to indicate it might not always be reliable for this purpose. Laurie (1895, [32]) states that it is ineffective, but that the <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> mentioned in early treatises worked as a drier because it was not pure (although he speculates that this was because manganese was present as an impurity), and Church (1915, [33]) comments that ‘Another dryer in common use is white vitriol or <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc.</b> Its siccative character is very slight.’ Interestingly, given the potassium content in the zinc sulphate found in paintings, Samuel Frederick Gray (1830), under the heading ‘boiled oil’ states: ‘The pure <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> made in England has not the same drying quality as the common white vitriol imported from Germany’ [34].|$|E

Playgrounds and schools are now closed. Playgrounds expose children to unhealthy damp conditions. Soda fountains must also close. • Stores and public baths will remain open. Authorities argue that public baths may remain open because they provide showers only, and they serve people who have no other options to maintain cleanliness. Swimming pools, public bath-tubs, and Turkish baths must close. • New York and Boston report improved conditions. • Dr. Gram has reported that he will request the city rescind the ban on public gathering at the nearest safe opportunity. He has also indicated that he has received many complaints about allowing five-and-ten cent stores to remain open. Dr. Gram commented on allowing lunchrooms in five-and-dime stores to remain open in relation to department stores and expensive restaurants. He reminds everyone of the value of masks and clean handkerchiefs. Dr. Gram reiterates that it is not necessary to treat a mask with <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc</b> for it to be effective. • There is some debate surrounding the appropriate cost of caskets offered by the city’s undertakers. Some citizens need inexpensive coffins, but undertakers do not want the health department to compete by offering cheap caskets. • Masks: The Red Cross headquarters on Franklin Street has received many requests from the Italian district for masks; a number of deaths occurred there during the previous day. There was a large demand for masks at the Larkin Company, based on the rumor that the company was providing free masks for the community; many masks were distributed freely. A group of several hundred children from below “The Terrace” came to the health department rooms at Church- and Franklin Streets to request masks. Police officers are now be required to wear masks by order of Chief Girvin. Chief Murphy does not feel it is necessary to require firefighters to wear masks.

Women may wear veils if they desire. • Dr. Gram also opposes open air church gatherings {{because of the risk}} posed by exposure to dampness. Because of this many churches are canceling the scheduled services. • Dr. Gram has telegraphed the adjutant general at Albany to request that physicians serving on draft boards be reassigned to aid during the epidemic. These physicians will be paid by the health department. • Dr. Meyer has drafted the entire upper class of the University of Buffalo medical school with Lieutenant Riley’s consent. Several members of the class entered hospital work immediately; others are subject to call. • A request has been issued that the Red Cross nurses aiding at Fort Niagara return to Buffalo. Additionally, the health commissioner has requested that retired nurses return to work and that nurses performing non-essential duties be released to aid influenza cases. • Dr. John F. Ryan, superintendent of the medical and dispensary departments of the city hospitals, has died of influenza. He is the first death of hospital staff. • H. W. Belnap of the Interstate Service Commission has died of influenza, and his wife is currently ill. • Other figures reported the previous night were: 1, 726 cases, 27 deaths from influenza, eight deaths from lobar pneumonia, and ten deaths from broncho-pneumonia. • Deaths within visitors to Buffalo included two from influenza, three from lobar pneumonia, and three from broncho-pneumonia. • Dr. Gram has explained that earlier reports of five-and-ten cent store closings were exaggerated. These stores are not closed. • Not all city departments requested to use influenza masks have used them. The Red Cross is prepared to manufacture more influenza masks. Masks manufactured by the Red Cross have been saturated in a solution of <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>zinc,</b> an odorless germicide that does not irritate the skin. • Dr. Edward J. Meyer has announced the availability of 540 hospital beds and listed where these are available. • Chairman Edward J. Meyer and Superintendent Walter S. Goodale have reported that doctors and nurses are needed at area hospitals. The health commissioner has reassigned school nurses and tuberculosis nurses to support hospital staff. • Under “Police Ranks Suffer,” 38 policemen are off-duty because of illness. Only a few of the policemen have developed influenza. The grip has affected most of the rest. 25 firemen have reported themselves ill within the previous 24 hours, explained police chief Girwin and fire chief Edward P. Murphy. This has taxed the effectiveness of both departments. One policeman, Officer Matthew J. Gormanly, has died of pneumonia. • 14 members of the Kiwanis club have volunteered to patrol the city to ensure that the closing order is obeyed. • Surgeon General Blue has urged citizens to learn about home care of influenza. He hopes that this will reduce the demands on overworked physicians and nurses. • Patients who seem unusually sick or expectorate pinkish sputum, or who breathe rapidly or painfully, should receive a doctor’s attention immediately. • Polish-speaking nurses have responded to the need at the Polish-speaking army camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake. • The epidemic appears to be subsiding in Massachusetts’ coastal cities and Virginia, but it appears to be spreading in the Mid-West and on the Pacific coast.

40|$|Alum- {{and black}} shales are lithologies rich in {{sulphides}} and trace elements including uranium, and may pose {{harm to the}} environment during weathering. Acidification of surface- and groundwater and swelling may occur. During construction of a road tunnel through Gran, Norway, an alum shale deposit was established. Reducing conditions in the deposit groundwater are supposed to prevent weathering of alum shale, but it is uncertain if release of elements of environmental concern is primarily controlled by redox conditions. This study investigated the distribution of elements in alum shale from Gran and Jevnaker to understand the potential risk of release of these elements. This was done by examinations of the materials utilizing X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and by performing leaching experiments in both laboratory and natural environments together with inverse modelling in PHREEQC. Zinc, cadmium, cobalt, arsenic, copper and lead were identified in sulphides, while uranium was identified in phosphates. Weathering is suggested to release large amounts <b>of</b> <b>sulphate,</b> <b>zinc,</b> nickel and uranium to percolating water, though acidity is buffered through dissolution of calcite. The PHREEQC inverse model was applied to a depot water sample, and gave a similar output as an average of leaching water samples.
