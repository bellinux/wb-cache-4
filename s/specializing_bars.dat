40|$|Efficient {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) homeostasis in {{skeletal muscle}} requires intact triad junctional complexes comprised of t-tubule invaginations of plasma membrane and terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Bin 1 {{consists of a}} <b>specialized</b> <b>BAR</b> domain {{that is associated with}} t-tubule development in skeletal muscle and involved in tethering the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) to the t-tubule. Here, we show that Bin 1 is important for Ca 2 + homeostasis in adult skeletal muscle. Since systemic ablation of Bin 1 in mice results in postnatal lethality, in vivo electroporation mediated transfection method was used to deliver RFP-tagged plasmid that produced short –hairpin (sh) RNA targeting Bin 1 (shRNA-Bin 1) to study the effect of Bin 1 knockdown in adult mouse FDB skeletal muscle. Upon confirming the reduction of endogenous Bin 1 expression, we showed that shRNA-Bin 1 muscle displayed swollen t-tubule structures, indicating that Bin 1 is required for the maintenance of intact membrane structure in adult skeletal muscle. Reduced Bin 1 expression led to disruption of t-tubule structure that was linked with alterations to intracellular Ca 2 + release. Voltage-induced Ca 2 + released in isolated single muscle fibers of shRNA-Bin 1 showed that both the mean amplitude of Ca 2 + current and SR Ca 2 + transient were reduced when compared to the shRNA-control, indicating compromised coupling between DHPR and ryanodine receptor 1.

Their L_CO' and L_IR are higher than that of local spiral galaxies which have been detected in CO so far, and L_IR/L'_CO, which is a measure of star formation efficiency, is comparable to or slightly higher than that of local ones.

40|$|As a {{field of}} legal study and practice, {{administrative}} law rests {{on the premise that}} legal principles concerning agency structure, administrative process, and judicial review cut across multiple agencies. In practice, however, judicial precedents addressing the application of administrative law doctrines to a given agency tend to rely most heavily on other cases involving the same agency, and use verbal formulations or doctrinal approaches reflected in those cases. Over time, the doctrine often begins to develop its own unique characteristics when applied to that particular agency. These “agency-specific precedents” deviate from the conventional understanding of the relevant principles as a matter of administrative law and raise fundamental questions for administrative law scholars and practitioners. Our central thesis is that agency-specific precedents are a manifestation of the “silo effect,” a phrase commonly used in the literature concerning the operation of large organizations to describe the tendency of subdivisions to develop their own bureaucratic imperatives that create obstacles to information sharing and other forms of cooperation. After describing the emergence of administrative law as a body of generally applicable legal doctrine and introducing the silo effect and the related concept of information silos, the article presents five case studies of agency-specific precedents: (1) the treatment of “interpretive regulations” promulgated by the IRS; (2) the “reasoned decisionmaking” concept in judicial review of the FCC (and a few other agencies); (3) the requirement that EPA must docket ex parte communications of “central relevance” in rulemaking; (4) the treating physician rule in judicial review of SSA disability determinations; and (5) cases limiting the NLRB’s ability to overturn an administrative law judge’s credibility determinations based on demeanor. These agency-specific precedents cannot be fully explained by agency-specific statutes, programs, or practices that prompt specific judicial responses. We postulate that agency-specific precedents are a manifestation of the silo effect and discuss how the dynamics of information costs, the <b>specialized</b> <b>bar,</b> and the process of judicial review tend to produce them. Precedents are a type of information that is costly to gather and apply and whose value in litigation depends on its precedential weight or authority. Because attorneys who practice in most administrative law fields tend to be specialized, the information costs of finding and citing cases involving the agency are much lower than the costs of doing so for cases involving other agencies, while the precedential weight of decisions involving the agency will be higher than that of cases involving other agencies. Courts rely heavily on the attorneys litigating a case to gather and present information concerning precedent, so the information costs of finding and analyzing precedents outside the agency in question will be passed along to the courts. In addition to considering the dynamic that contributes to the formation of agency-specific precedents, we discuss their normative implications in terms of consistency with statutory provisions (particularly the APA), promoting legal certainty, and the development of optimal administrative law doctrines. Although the balance of costs and benefits from agency-specific precedents varies according to the circumstances, some agency-specific precedents would appear to be unjustified. We suggest that greater attention to the phenomenon by attorneys, courts, and scholars would help to break down such undesirable agency-specific precedential silos...|$|R

Spectrophotometric analysis of 79 Fischer rat livers (40 female and 39 male) for lipid peroxidation (LPO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was conducted using Bioxytech LPO- 587 (TM) assay kit and SOD- 525 (Tm) assay kit, respectively. The treatment groups consisted of 20 male CHOW and 19 male FOOD BAR rats and 20 female CHOW and 20 female FOOD BAR rats. Statistical analysis to compare differences between groups was performed by standard analysis of variance procedures. The male FOOD BAR group LPO mean (3. 6 +/- 0. 2 mmol/g) was significantly (p {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05) greater than that of the male CHOW group (2. 1 +/- 0. 1 mmol/g).

The mean values for SOD in both male and female groups showed no significant differences between CHOW and FOOD BAR groups. These results show that LPO levels were significantly higher in both the male and female FOOD BAR groups compared to CHOW groups and that there was no concomitant increase in SOD levels across the group. In addition, males showed a greater difference than females in terms of LPO levels.
