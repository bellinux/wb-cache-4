He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} anything he wanted to do on The Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E

In response to Western complaints {{of human rights abuses}} in Iran he has stated that the American administration has committed many crimes and is therefore not fit to judge the Islamic Republic.|$|E

500|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{compared}} Pru to other artists, with a Billboard reviewer attributing the singer as {{writing in the}} same style as contemporary neo soul performers. The singer's voice was compared to Lauryn Hill, Macy Gray, and Erykah Badu by AllMusic's Stacia Proefrock. She was classified {{as part of an}} [...] "emerging school of poetics" [...] by Ross, who said that she was [...] "subtly changing the landscape of contemporary R lyricism". A Billboard reviewer also placed the singer as a member of [...] "the new soul movement", and compared her work to that of Angie Stone, Amel Larrieux, Jill Scott, and Badu. A writer from the journal Today's Black Woman saw Pru as part of the neo soul genre along with Badu and Scott, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> singers incorporated in their music [...] "traditional R as well as its new millennium, hip-hop inspired modern counterpart". Pru responded positively to the comparisons, saying: [...] "What I think is being classified as the neo-soul classic movement has artists that are individually different in their own right, but aren't different from modern R" ...|$|E
500|$|The Laming {{report was}} criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of NCH as too narrow, {{focusing}} {{too much on}} the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection. According to Harry Ferguson, a professor of social work at the University of the West of England, [...] "Laming's report focuses too heavily on the implementation of new structures and fails to understand the keen intuition that child protection work demands". He criticised the approach to child protection of focusing {{too much on the}} worst cases and trying too much to prevent them, rather than having an approach that also celebrates success; and said that focusing too much on any individual case and basing reforms on that was [...] "deeply problematic". Laming responded to criticism by the Association of Directors of Social Services that his recommendations would require much more funding by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> arguments lacked [...] "intellectual rigour", and he dismissed claims that his reforms would be too bureaucratic. The Guardian said that the report does not address the issues of frontline staff. Deryk Mead of NCH said, [...] "I do believe that inquiry reports have made a positive difference to the child protection system, and I have every confidence that Lord Laming's report will do so too".|$|E

[...] The Washington Post {{editorial board}} hailed the sentence, writing that Hastert's victims [...] "should not have had to struggle with what Mr. Hastert did to them all the while they watched him rise in stature and power." [...] The Post called for extending statutes of limitations in sex-abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote that Hastert's case underscored the danger that comes with the [...] "quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude," [...] noting that Hastert's public displays of Christian faith during his time in office were [...] "a factor in his colleagues' assessments of him as safe, uncontroversial." [...] Bruni also critiqued the testimonials that prominent Republicans submitted on Hastert's behalf before sentencing, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> [...] "affirm the degree to which pacts rather than principle govern partisan politics today." ...|$|E

The centre and left wing together would {{then make a}} night-march to Brussels. The Coalition forces would thus be irremediably sundered, and all that remained would be to destroy them in detail. Napoleon now awaited further information from his wing commanders at Charleroi, where he massed the VI Corps (Lobau), to save it, if possible, from a harassing countermarch, as it appeared likely that {{it would only be}} wanted for the march to Brussels. Ney spent the morning in massing his I and II corps, and in reconnoitring the enemy at Quatre Bras, who, as he was informed, had been reinforced. But up till noon he took no serious step to capture the cross-roads, which then lay at his mercy. Grouchy meantime reported from Fleurus that Prussians were coming up from Namur, but Napoleon {{does not appear to have}} attached much importance to this report. He was still at Charleroi when, between 09:00 and 10:00, further news reached him from the left that considerable hostile forces were visible at Quatre Bras. He at once wrote to Ney <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> could only be some of Wellington's troops, and that Ney was to concentrate his force and crush what was in front of him, adding that he was to send all reports to Fleurus.
