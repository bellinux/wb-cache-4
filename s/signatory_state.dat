25|$|The Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia is vested with {{a number}} of {{governmental}} duties. One such task unique to the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia is authenticating with the Great Seal of British Columbia notarized documents to be used outside of the province. However, the issuance of a Certificate of Authentication only means the signature of the notary public matched the ones on file and not the authenticity or truthfulness of the texts themselves. Because Canada is not a <b>signatory</b> <b>state</b> to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, this procedure is simply called authentication instead of apostille.|$|E
