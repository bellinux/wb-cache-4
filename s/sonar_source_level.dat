40|$|For {{conservation}} purposes, it {{is important}} to evaluate potential population consequences of noise disturbance. Based on maximum reported sound levels of no response to sonar, a mathematical model is used to predict the potential risk to the population of herring (Clupea harengus) when these levels are exceeded. Results show that risk varies with season depending on density of fish. During widespread feeding, the risk of any population consequences is loweven at <b>sonar</b> <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> up to 235 dB (re 1 mPa m) and exercise durations exceeding 24 h at sonar frequencies 1 – 2 kHz. The risk of population effects increases in periods when the population aggregates, but given that our response estimates are conservative, it seems unlikely that today’s naval sonar activity will lead to population consequences in Atlantic herring...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of noise}} {{disturbance}} to fish populations may be predicted {{by using the}} four steps in the population consequences of acoustic disturbance (PCAD) model, with small scale exposure experiments as input. We have used the results from experimental studies on mortality and behavior of juvenile and adult herring exposed to naval sonar as input to the PCAD model. Based on reported threshold values of SEL and SPL at which adult herring {{do not respond to}} naval search sonar, we used a mathematical model to predict the potential risk to the population when these levels are exceeded. Our results show the risk to vary with the populations. During periods of low population density, e. g. during feeding, the risk of any population consequences is low even at relatively high <b>sonar</b> <b>source</b> <b>levels</b> (up to 225 dB[re 1 μPa m]) and long duration exercises (> 24 h). In periods when the population is densely packed, e. g. during the traditional overwintering, the risk of consequences at the population level increases. The actual risk depends on the threshold of response, which is unknown. Our calculations, based on thresholds of known ignorance, are conservative...|$|R

40|$|Ping-to-ping {{variations}} in echo level {{can be caused}} by time {{variations in}} <b>sonar</b> parameters (<b>source</b> <b>level,</b> orientation), target aspect, relative and absolute motion of sonar and target, and time varying environment (e. g. surface waves). Quantifying and understanding such fluctuations are important, since they enable an appropriate choice of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, and suggest strategies for optimizing parameters such as the sonar frequency. One important aspect of this problem is given by the target echo fluctuations due to changes in target aspect and in sonar bandwidth. In some regions of aspect angle-frequency space the fluctuations are stronger and apparently less organized than in other regions. These effects can be explained in terms of scattering physics, and analyzed with high-fidelity target scatter modeling tools, such as those based on finite element methods. This paper presents a numerical study in which one target is analyzed over a broad range of aspect angles and frequencies. The fluctuations in target echo amplitude are studied and characterized in the angle-frequency space, with the objective of obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} underlying target-specific echo strength distribution.

We investigated the effectiveness of ramp-up procedures in reducing the area within which changes in hearing thresholds can occur. We modeled the level of sound killer whales (Orcinus orca) were exposed to from a generic sonar operation preceded by different ramp-up schemes. In our model, ramp-up procedures reduced the risk of killer whales receiving sounds of sufficient intensity to affect their hearing. The effectiveness of the ramp-up procedure depended strongly on the assumed response threshold and differed with ramp-up duration, although extending the duration of the ramp up beyond 5 min did not add much to its predicted mitigating effect. The main factors that limited effectiveness of ramp up in a typical antisubmarine warfare scenario were high <b>source</b> <b>level,</b> rapid moving <b>sonar</b> <b>source,</b> and long silences between consecutive sonar transmissions.

40|$|The {{potential}} effects of exposing marine mammals to military sonar is a current concern. Dose-response relationships {{are useful for}} predicting potential environmental impacts of specific operations. To reveal behavioral response thresholds of exposure to sonar, we conducted 18 exposure/control approaches to 6 long-finned pilot whales. <b>Source</b> <b>level</b> and proximity of sonar transmitting one of two frequency bands (1 - 2 kHz and 6 - 7 kHz) were increased during exposure sessions. The 2 -dimensional movement tracks were analyzed using a changepoint method to identify the avoidance response thresholds which were used to estimate dose-response relationships. No support for an effect of sonar frequency or previous exposures on the probability of response was found. Estimated response thresholds at which 50 % of population show avoidance (SPLmax= 170 dB re 1 μPa, SELcum= 173 dB re 1 μPa 2 s) were higher than previously found for other cetaceans.

It is based on modules comprising 8 or 16 elements of the transducer grouped on the transmitting channel.

40|$|Ramp-up (or soft-start) {{procedures}} {{are commonly used}} to mitigate the impact of sound on marine mammals. Although this procedure is often adopted as a common-sense approach, studies that quantify the effectiveness of ramp-up are currently lacking. The effectiveness of ramp-up is investigated by modelling the sound exposure of animals caused by a moving sonar. A naval sonar operation is considered that is preceded by different ramp-up schemes, and {{the reduction of the}} area over which hearing threshold shifts are predicted to occur is quantified. The animal behaviour model is based on avoidance responses observed with free-ranging killer whales responding to sonar sounds during controlled exposure experiments. Our simulations indicate that ramp-up procedures can reduce the risk of receiving sound exposure sufficient to induce physiological responses with animals. The predicted effectiveness of the ramp-up procedure was found to depend strongly upon the assumed response threshold and to vary with ramp-up duration. It was found that extending the duration of the ramp-up beyond a few minutes did not add much to the predicted reduction in hearing impact on killer whales, unless a large fraction of animals responds at very low received levels. The main factors that limit the effectiveness of ramp-up in a typical anti-submarine warfare scenario is the combination of high <b>source</b> <b>level,</b> a rapidly moving <b>sonar</b> <b>source,</b> and long silences between consecutive sonar transmissions.

In order to provide appropriate echo quality necessary for depth determination and seafloor shape recording, a high acoustic <b>source</b> <b>level</b> is needed. The main factors affecting the sound level of the emitted sonar pulse during the travel through the water column are geometrical spreading, absorption and the backscattering strength of the seabed. The reception threshold of the acoustic receiver determines the sound level needed to detect the acoustic pulse. Common deep sea multibeam systems use the determined depth as an indication to control the <b>source</b> <b>level</b> necessary for the successive ping. Lowering the transmission <b>level</b> of hydroacoustic <b>sources</b> is a general demand to reduce the impact of sonar signals on the marine life.

The free-field energy of a single source, defined as the total acoustic energy that would exist in the source’s free field, is shown to be closely related to the total cumulative exposure added over a population of animals. On this basis, the free-field energy of an underwater sound source, referred to as its “energy cost”, is proposed as an indicator of its environmental risk. For otherwise the same conditions, the environmental cost so defined of a multi-beam echo sounder (frequency 100 kHz) is about 40 000 times less than that of a search sonar (1 kHz) of the same <b>source</b> <b>level.</b> In turn, the cost of the same sonar is about 300 times less than that of a pile driver of the same energy <b>source</b> <b>level,</b> implying that <b>source</b> <b>level</b> (or energy <b>source</b> <b>level)</b> alone is a poor indicator of environmental risk.
