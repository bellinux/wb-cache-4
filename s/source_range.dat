5000|$|The [...] "Dirty War" [...] (Guerra Sucia), was {{the name}} used by the Argentine Military Government {{for a period of}} state {{terrorism}} in Argentina from roughly 1974 to 1983 (some sources date the beginning to 1969), during which military and security forces and right-wing death squads {{in the form of the}} Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) hunted down and killed left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism. About 30,000 people disappeared, many of which were impossible to be formally reported due to the nature of the issue: state terrorism. The targets were left-wing activists, guerrillas and militants, trade unionists, students, journalists and Marxists and Peronist guerrillas and their support network in the Montoneros believed to be 150,000-250,000-strong and 60,000-strong in the ERP, as well as alleged sympathizers. Some 10,000 of the [...] "disappeared" [...] were guerrillas of the Montoneros (MPM) and the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) although the lowest estimate is that the Montoneros and ERP had a combined strength of 5,000. The [...] "disappeared" [...] included those thought to be a political or ideological threat to the military junta, even vaguely, and they were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the opposition and break the determination of the guerrillas. The worst repression reportedly occurred after the guerillas were largely defeated in 1977, when the church, labor unions, artists, intellectuals and university students and professors were targeted. Although the Montoneros reported having carried out some 600 armed attacks in 1977, the guerrilla threat had greatly declined. The junta justified this mass terror by exaggerating the guerrilla threat, and even staged attacks to be blamed on guerillas and used frozen dead bodies of guerilla fighters that had been kept in storage for this purpose. In late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup. That year, a special study by the New York City Bar concluded that around 10,000 Argentines had disappeared since the coup. According to Registro Unificado de Víctimas del Terrorismo de Estado (Ruvte), 662 were disappeared under the presidency of Isabel Perón and 6,348 were disappeared during the military dictatorship. During his years as US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger had congratulated Argentina’s military junta for combating the left, stating that in his opinion the government of Argentina had done an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces."

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a problem of}} near-field source localization using the sensor-angle distribution (SAD) that views the <b>source</b> <b>range</b> and direction-of-arrival (DOA) information as sensor-dependent phase progression. The SAD draws parallel to quadratic time-frequency distributions and, as such, is able to reveal {{the changes in the}} spatial frequency over sensor positions. In particular, for a moderate <b>source</b> <b>range,</b> the SAD signature is of polynomial shape, thus simplifying the parameter estimation. We consider sparse arrays where the array sensors are located on a grid but with missing positions. Sparse reconstruction techniques are used to estimate the SAD in the joint space and spatial frequency domain, and the results are then mapped back to <b>source</b> <b>range</b> and DOA estimation for source localization.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for localization of narrowband near-field sources is presented. The technique utilizes the sensor-angle distribution (SAD) that treats the <b>source</b> <b>range</b> and direction-of-arrival (DOA) information as sensor-dependent phase progression. The SAD draws parallel to quadratic time-frequency distributions and, as such, {{is able to}} reveal {{the changes in the}} spatial frequency over sensor positions. For a moderate <b>source</b> <b>range,</b> the SAD signature is of a polynomial shape, thus simplifying the parameter estimation. Both uniform and sparse linear arrays are considered in this work. To exploit the sparsity and continuity of the SAD signature in the joint space and spatial frequency domain, a modified Bayesian compressive sensing algorithm is exploited to estimate the SAD signature. In this method, a spike-and-slab prior is used to statistically encourage sparsity of the SAD across each segmented SAD region, and a patterned prior is imposed to enforce the continuous structure of the SAD. The results are then mapped back to <b>source</b> <b>range</b> and DOA estimation for source localization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified using simulation results with uniform and sparse linear arrays where the array sensors are located on a grid but with consecutive and missing positions...|$|E

The acoustic transmission duct is the well-known reliable acoustic path (RAP). The ambiguity surface of the combined estimation is a dimensionless ad hoc function.

40|$|A mixed statistical-deterministic {{model of}} {{earthquake}} rupture is developed {{for evaluating the}} strong ground motion in the near <b>source</b> <b>range</b> (receiver distance comparable to the fault length). The source parametrization {{is based on the}} k-square model and the propagation is computed by asymptotic Green’s functions. The method is applied to the case of 1976, Friuli earthquake (M = 6. 5) in northern Italy which occurred on a low-dip thrusting fault. Acceleration records at 29 stations are computed for 100 simulations of rupture histories. The mean value map of peak ground accelerations shows clearly a maximum to the south due to the inner geometry and directivity of the source. The variation of the estimated PGA versus the epicentral distance is strongly dependent on azimuth and is not decreasing monotonically. The comparison of these curves with those predicted by empirical acceleration– distance relationships shows discrepancies in the near source distance range. This study shows the importance of considering the complexity of the source rupture process for strong motion estimate in the near <b>source</b> <b>range...</b>|$|E

The design of hydrophone configurations is evaluated for sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) range estimation to meet the requirements of the current mitigation regulations for a safety zone and behaviour research. This thesis uses the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) of cetacean vocalisations with a three-dimensional hyperbolic localisation algorithm. A MATLAB simulator has been developed to model array-configurations and to assess their performance in <b>source</b> <b>range</b> estimation for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous sound speed profiles (SSP). The non-homogeneous medium is modelled on a Bellhop ray trace model, using data collected from the Gulf of Mexico. The sperm whale clicks are chosen as an exemplar of a distinctive underwater sound. The simulator is tested with a separate synthetic source generator which produced a set of TDOAs from a known source location. The performance in <b>source</b> <b>range</b> estimation for Square, Trapezium, Triangular, Shifted-pair and Y-shape geometries is tested. The Y-shape geometry, with four elements and aperture-length of 120 m, is the most accurate, giving an error of ± 10 m over slant ranges of 500 m in a homogeneous medium, and 300 m in a non-homogeneous medium. However, for towed array deployments, the Y-shape array is sensitive to angle-positioning-error when the geometry is seriously distorted. The Shifted-pair geometry overcomes these limits, performing an initial accuracy of ± 30 m when the vessel either moves in a straight line or turns to port or starboard. It constitutes a recommendable array-configuration for towed array deployments. The thesis demonstrates that the number of receivers, the array-geometry and the arrayaperture are important parameters to consider when designing and deploying a hydrophone array. It is shown that certain array-configurations can significantly improve the accuracy of <b>source</b> <b>range</b> estimation. Recommendations are made concerning preferred array-configurations for use with PAM systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
