An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots <b>saw</b> <b>anything</b> exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E

500|$|The {{city was}} unable {{to raise money to}} build the museum, and the stones were damaged in five fires. The first came soon after the crates were set down in Golden Gate Park. Morgan said that [...] "piles of burning boxes were pulled over and down by the Fire Department, many hurled over a hundred and fifty feet." [...] Hearst died in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957; neither of them <b>saw</b> <b>anything</b> built with the stones. Two fires in 1959 {{appeared}} to be arson, and many of the fire-heated stones were weakened or cracked from sudden cooling by water. In 1960, Steilberg was hired to inspect the stones once again; he used a ball-peen hammer to lightly strike each stone and listen for a solid ringing tone, or a dull thud which indicated cracking. He found that a little more than half the stones were sound.|$|E

500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he <b>saw</b> <b>anything</b> of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|Following its new route, Bounty reached Cape Town on 24 May 1788. Here, Heywood wrote a {{long letter}} to his family {{describing}} the voyage to date, with vivid descriptions of life at sea. Initially, Heywood relates, sailing had been [...] "in the most pleasurable weather imaginable". In describing the attempts to round Cape Horn he writes: [...] "I suppose there never were seas, {{in any part of}} the known world, to compare with those we met ... for height, and length of swell; the oldest seamen on board never <b>saw</b> <b>anything</b> to equal that..." [...] Bligh's decision to turn east was, Heywood records, [...] "to the great joy of everyone on board". Historian Greg Dening records a story, unmentioned in Heywood's letter, that {{at the height of the}} Cape Horn storms Bligh had punished Heywood for some minor wrongdoing by ordering him to climb the mast and to [...] "stay there beyond the point of all endurance"; this, Dening concedes, was possibly a later fabrication to discredit Bligh.|$|E

Since late 2007, Raonic {{had been working}} with Tennis Canada coaches—including Guillaume Marx, Head Boys National Coach—based out of the National Training Centre at Jarry Park in Montreal. In November 2009, with Raonic's world ranking at No. 377, Tennis Canada hired recently retired former player Frédéric Niemeyer to coach Raonic and travel with him for 18 weeks during the 2010 season. Toward the end of 2010, however, Niemeyer decided to travel less owing to [...] "family considerations." [...] As a result, Tennis Canada arranged for a two-week trial period with former world No. 40 Galo Blanco in co-operation with Niemeyer, including tournaments in Malaysia and Japan in late September and early October. Over this period, Raonic climbed from No. 237 to No. 155. [...] Tennis Canada hired Blanco, and Raonic moved to Barcelona to train with Blanco and trainer Tony Estalella. Commenting on the training regiment, Blanco said [...] "the off-season Milos had this winter in Barcelona was amazing.

All the men trooped in in the wake of Pierre. The entire hillock was now a blaze of light--lurid and red and flickering--alternately teased and fanned and subdued by the gale, so that at times every object stood out clearly cut, every blade of grass, every stone in bold relief, and in the ruts and fissures, every tiny pool of muddy water shimmered like strings of fire-opals: whilst at others, a pall of inky darkness, smoke-laden and impenetrable would lie over the ground and erase the outline of farm-buildings and distant mill and of the pushing and struggling mass of humanity inside the barn.|$|R

2500|$|The Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth, was {{a pioneer}} of {{hospital}} design in having [...] "pavilions" [...] to minimize the spread of infection.

They were impressed and the [...] "pavilion" [...] design was copied in France and throughout Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Under Italian army {{commander}} Mario Roatta's watch, {{the violence}} against the Slovene civil population in the Province of Ljubljana easily matched that of the Germans with summary executions, hostage-taking and hostage killing, reprisals, internments to Rab and Gonars concentration camps and the burning of houses and whole villages. Roatta issued additional special instructions stating that the repression orders must be [...] "carried out most energetically and without any false compassion". According to historians James Walston and Carlo Spartaco Capogeco, the annual mortality rate in the Italian concentration camps was {{higher than the average}} mortality rate in Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald (which was 15%), at least 18%. On 5 August 1943, Monsignor Joze Srebnic, Bishop of Veglia (Krk island), reported to Pope Pius XII that [...] "witnesses, {{who took part in the}} burials, state unequivocally that the number of the dead totals at least 3,500". After the war, Yugoslavia, Greece and Ethiopia requested the extradition of 1,200 Italian war criminals for trial, but they never <b>saw</b> <b>anything</b> like the Nuremberg trials because the British government with the beginning of the Cold War saw in Pietro Badoglio a guarantee of an anti-communist post-war Italy. The repression of memory led to historical revisionism in Italy about the country's actions during the war. In 1963, anthology [...] "Notte sul'Europa", a photograph of an internee from Rab concentration camp, was included while claiming to be a photograph of an internee from a German Nazi camp when in fact the internee was a Slovene Janez Mihelčič, born 1885 in Babna Gorica and died at Rab in 1943. In 2003, the Italian media published Silvio Berlusconi's statement that Mussolini merely [...] "used to send people on vacation".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{incidents}} cited {{to imply}} Eleanor's {{lack of interest}} in her children are easily explained in the contexts of medieval royal childrearing in general, and of particular events surrounding Edward and Eleanor's family. When their six-year-old son Henry lay dying at Guildford in 1274, neither parent made the short journey from London to see him; but Henry was tended by Edward's mother Eleanor of Provence. The boy had lived with his grandmother while his parents were absent on crusade, and since he was barely two years old when they left England in 1270, he could not have had many substantial memories of them at the time they returned to England in August 1274, only weeks before his last illness and death. In other words, the dowager queen was a more familiar and comforting presence to her grandson than his parents would have been at that time, and it was in all respects better that she tended him then. Furthermore, Eleanor was pregnant {{at the time of his}} final illness and death; even given the limited thirteenth-century understanding of contagion, exposure to a sickroom might have been discouraged. [...] Similarly, Edward and Eleanor allowed her mother, Joan of Dammartin, to raise their daughter Joan of Acre in Ponthieu (1274–78). This implies no parental {{lack of interest in}} the girl; the practice of fostering noble children in other households of sufficient dignity was not unknown and Eleanor's mother was, of course, dowager queen of Castile. Her household was safe and dignified, but it does appear that Edward and Eleanor had cause to regret their generosity in letting Joan of Dammartin foster young Joan. When the girl reached England in 1278, aged six, it turned out that she was badly spoiled. She was spirited and at times defiant in childhood, and in adulthood remained a handful for Edward, defying his plans for a prestigious second marriage for her by secretly marrying one of her late first husband's squires. When the marriage was revealed in 1297 because Joan was pregnant, Edward was enraged that his dignity had been insulted by her marriage to a commoner of no importance. Joan, at twenty-five, reportedly defended her conduct to her father by saying that nobody <b>saw</b> <b>anything</b> wrong if a great earl married a poor woman, so there could be nothing wrong with a countess marrying a promising young man. Whether or not her retort ultimately changed his mind, Edward restored to Joan all the lands he had confiscated when he learned of her marriage, and accepted her new husband as a son-in-law in good standing. Joan marked her restoration to favour by having masses celebrated for the soul of her mother Eleanor.|$|E
