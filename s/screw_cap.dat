2500|$|The 30A plug is {{the largest}} of the family. [...] This was used for high power {{industrial}} equipment up to 7.2kW, such as industrial kitchen appliances, [...] or dimmer racks for stage lighting. Plugs and sockets were usually of an industrial waterproof design with a screw locking ring on the plug to hold it in the socket against waterproof seals, and sockets often had a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> chained to them to be used when no plug was inserted to keep them waterproof. Use of the BS546 30A plugs and sockets diminished through the 1970s as they were replaced with BS 4343 (which later became IEC 60309) industrial combo plugs and sockets.|$|E
2500|$|Hand grenades {{were mostly}} of Communist Chinese manufacture. These were stick grenades, with a wood handle {{at the bottom}} of which was a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> whereupon {{unscrewing}} out fell (if holding right) a porcelain-bead with a thread attached. [...] Pull this and in an unknown time (for these were badly stored and old weapons) it might explode. [...] Despite this there were numerous troops wounded by this weapon. RPG-2's and RPG-7's were prevalent, sometimes one or two to a section of ten men, though hardly ever used against Fireforce (there was usually only one present and the difficulties of targeting the helicopters was extreme).|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of purification {{of drinking water}} by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian Medical Service, Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account, [...] "It {{occurred to me that}} chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a <b>screw</b> <b>cap.</b> The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts." ...|$|E

50|$|Improvements in cork and {{winemaking}} methodology {{continue to}} strive {{to lower the}} incidence, but the media attention given to cork taint has created a controversy in the winemaking community, with traditional cork growers {{on one side and}} the makers of newer synthetic closures and <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> on the other. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> and synthetic corks, however, are thought be prone to another aroma taint: sulphidisation. This may arise from the reduced oxygen supply which concentrates sulphurous smells arising from wines with universal preservatives, however it is more likely that these wines contain excessive/imbalanced amounts of sulphite based preservatives to begin with.|$|R

50|$|Zork is an {{alternative}} wine closure for still wines, that seals like a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> and pops like a cork, created by an Australian company of the same name. The closure has three parts: an outer cap providing a tamper-evident clamp that locks onto the band of a standard cork mouth bottle; an inner metal foil which provides an oxygen barrier similar to a <b>screw</b> <b>cap,</b> and an inner plunger which creates the ‘pop’ on extraction and reseals after use. Introduced in 2010, {{it is the first}} on-bottle, resealable closure for sparkling wines.|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{two types}} of pressure-fuze {{available}} for Teller mines, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze was notable for featuring an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is inserted and the pressure plate (or <b>screw</b> <b>cap)</b> is screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin inside the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, any attempt to disarm the mine by unscrewing the pressure plate (or <b>screw</b> <b>cap)</b> to remove the fuze will automatically release the spring-loaded firing pin inside it, triggering detonation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, fatigue {{strength}} of the engine damper <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> bolt is determined. Engine damper <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> is critical fastener. Critical fastener is a term used to describe a <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until <b>cap</b> <b>screws</b> begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in fasteners, ultrasonic bolt gauging method is used. It has been observed that fatigue failure takes place on the thread of <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> bolt due to high stress concentration on the thread...|$|R
5000|$|Screw caps {{met with}} {{customer}} resistance in Australia and New Zealand, and were phased {{out in the}} early 1980s, only to be reintroduced gradually in the 1990s. Since reintroduction, ever-increasing numbers of winemakers are using the <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> within Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, adoption went from 1% in 2001 to 70% in 2004. <b>Screw</b> <b>cap</b> adoption in fine wines in Australia has proceeded in fits and starts. In July 2000, a group of Clare Valley Riesling producers, led by Jeffrey Grosset bottled {{a portion of their}} wines in <b>screw</b> <b>cap,</b> and earlier that year PlumpJack Winery announced it would bottle half its production of US$130 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon in screwcap. Other announcements have followed, including one from Bonny Doon Vineyard in July 2002 that 80,000 cases of its [...] "Big House" [...] red and white wine would be bottled under screwcaps - followed by almost all the rest of its production by late 2004 (200,000 cases total).|$|E
