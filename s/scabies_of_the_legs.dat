5000|$|Because Vandals {{full-time}} drummer Josh Freese {{was involved}} with other musical projects at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's recording, a number of fill-in drummers were recruited to play most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum tracks on the album: Brooks Wackerman of Infectious Grooves, Suicidal Tendencies and future drummer of Bad Religion, Erik Sandin of NOFX, and Rat <b>Scabies</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Damned. Freese did play on three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's tracks, and both his brother Jason Freese and father Stan Freese also appeared playing horns.

50|$|In 2004, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Watershed members, Gawel and Oestreich, {{joined with}} vocalist Lou Brutus and Twin Cam guitarist Mike Sammons on drums {{to form the}} punk band Dead Schembechlers based on the Ohio State-Michigan football game and rivalry. The side project's name, a play on the Dead Kennedys, was a lighthearted jab at former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler, who upon hearing about the band name was reportedly quite amused. The four members go by <b>the</b> pseudonyms <b>of</b> Bo Vicious (after Sex Pistols frontman Sid Vicious), Bo Biafra (after Jello Biafra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead Kennedys), Bo Scabies (after Rat <b>Scabies</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Damned), and Bo Thunders (after Johnny Thunders).

In 2009, Carroll recorded a concept album, The Golborne Variations, with Guy Pratt, Nick Cash, Chester Kamen, Chris Payne and Jennifer Pearl. Long-term collaborator and producer David M.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONBilateral acute {{compartment}} syndrome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> {{is a rare}} presentation requiring emergent surgical intervention. PRESENTATION <b>OF</b> CASEWe report <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> 41 -year-old woman who presented with acute bilateral {{compartment syndrome}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs,</b> complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. DISCUSSIONThere are very few previously reported cases of bilateral compartment syndrome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs.</b> In <b>the</b> present case, despite any clear causative factor, we suggest that the aetiology is related to inadvertent posture during sleep. CONCLUSIONThe diagnosis of acute bilateral compartment syndrome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> requires a high index of suspicion, particularly in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> obvious aetiology. A successful outcome can be achieved with early diagnosis, prompt surgical intervention and a multidisciplinary approach...|$|R
50|$|This is a {{variation}} upon <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> wrap where instead <b>of</b> outstretching <b>the</b> <b>leg,</b> it is bent to 90 degrees at the knee, with <b>the</b> lower portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> {{turned out to}} the side. The string/chain then contacts with and winds round <b>the</b> ankle instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> <b>The</b> ankle wrap is usually not carried out on both legs at once as this requires jumping, which is exceptionally difficult to carry out at the required height and speed to complete the move before requiring to land.|$|R
40|$|A 55 {{year old}} woman {{with pain and}} {{swelling}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> was heparinized on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a clinically diagnosed ilio-femoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Subsequent investigation showed her to have extensive rhabdomyolysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> Rhabdomyolysis can mimic <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> deep vein thrombosis and this case further illustrates <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> venography in <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swollen <b>leg...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{frequently}} {{observe a}} tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saphenous vein with the origin in <b>the</b> saphenous compartment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> It runs transversally in the interfascial compartment toward <b>the</b> lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> Constantly it feeds by reflux varicose veins clinically {{visible in the}} paratibial region and/or in <b>the</b> lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg.</b> For <b>the</b> peculiarity <b>of</b> its anatomical shape as well as duplex appearance, we defined it as the "T" vein. OBJECTIVES: To assess how frequently <b>the</b> "T" vein <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> is involved in varicose networks. METHODS: A total of 218 consecutive patients affected by primary varicose veins have been evaluated by <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> duplex scanning. We assessed both <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above-mentioned tributary and <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> its hemodynamic involvement in the varicose network. RESULTS: In 15 of 218 cases (7 %) we demonstrated the above-mentioned tributary with an interfascial length ranging between 5 and 12 cm involved in varicose networks. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> anterior tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saphenous vein <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterolateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> is a neglected clinical entity, whose existence {{is important to know}} for <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> varicose veins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leg...</b>|$|R

The kinematic modeling proposes necessary conditions for stable walk on flat terrain.
