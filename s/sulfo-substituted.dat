40|$|There is big {{interest}} in cheap, sensitive and selective gas sensors. In this work, substituted soluble phthalocyanines are proposed as a sensing materials for several gases. Optical, electrical and gas sensing properties of several phthalocyanines were studied and {{the mechanisms of}} their interaction with several analyte gases are described. It was found, that <b>sulfo-substituted</b> Pcs has good sensitivity to humidity. Sulfonamide-substituted phthalocyanines are promising for nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds detection. tert-Butyl-substituted phthalocyanines are sensitive to NO 2 under higher temperature {{and seems to be}} used for environmental monitoring. Commercial gas sensors for NO 2, ethanol and humidity were successfully created...|$|E
40|$|The {{phthalocyanine}} analogue containing non-peripheral, long alkyl-substituted benzenoid {{rings and}} pyridine rings, zinc bis(1, 4 -didecylbenzo) -bis(2, 3 -pyrido) porphyrazine was synthesized. The synthesized product {{is an interesting}} compound because quaternization of the pyridine nitrogen is expected to impart cationic amphiphilic character. Zinc bis(1, 4 -didecylbenzo) -bis(2, 3 -pyrido) porphyrazine was reacted with dimethyl sulfate and monochloroacetic acid to produce the quaternized products and with diethyl sulfate to produce the <b>sulfo-substituted</b> product; all such compounds displayed amphiphilic character. Identical peaks in cyclic voltammograms were obtained for the products before and after quaternization. Zinc bis(1, 4 -didecylbenzo) -bis(2, 3 -pyrido) porphyrazine had no changes in its reduction or oxidation properties compared to phthalocyanine analogues...|$|E

Zinc bis(1, 4 -didecylbenzo) -bis(2, 3 -pyrido) porphyrazine reacted with dimethyl sulfate and monochloroacetic acid {{to produce the}}ir quaternized products and diethyl sulfate to produce the sulfosubstituted products. All quaternized and <b>sulfo-substituted</b> showed amphiphilic character. Identical peaks in cyclic voltammograms appeared for these products before and after quaternization. During the evaluation of zinc bis(1, 4 -didecylbenzo) -bis(2, 3 pyrido) porphyrazine for its photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) efficacy by cancer cell culture, the light exposed dimethyl sulfate quaternized zinc bis(1, 4 -didecylbenzo) -bis(2, 3 -pyrido) porphyrazines in IU- 002 cells produce cell disruption that can be detected as a decrease in fluorescence.
