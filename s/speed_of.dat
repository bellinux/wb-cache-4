5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, from an observer's {{point of view}} its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> an electron can approach, but never reach, the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> photons.|$|E
5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light is much faster than the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound.|$|E

5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source {{was interrupted by}} a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for {{the diameter of the}} Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E
5|$|The {{interference}} pattern {{between the two}} beams when the light is recombined at the observer depends upon the transit times over the two paths, {{and can be used}} to calculate the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> light {{as a function of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> {{light has}} become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions {{of a second}} ahead of other traders.

5|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> {{sound in}} helium is {{nearly three times}} the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity {{is proportional to the}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the top <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E
