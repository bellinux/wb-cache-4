5|$|Although not <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> missing serial, {{production}} of the 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician's strike partway through recording. To prevent the half-finished material from being junked, incoming Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner placed a preservation order on it with an intention to later finish the production. Although repeated attempts to remount the serial failed, a clip from Episode 1 was later used in the 1983 story The Five Doctors after Tom Baker declined to reprise his role.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).|$|E

5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, athletes are not able to practice on ski flying hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which {{were also}} {{produced}} by Bay, Form, and Fullerit {{was decided that}} Friday the 13th {{would not be a}} period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s. In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th. Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel. Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project. Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only {{recently}} {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche, and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet. Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion and diet, acting as a manual grazer (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds. Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator. More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and Hadropithecus, indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer, but <b>strictly</b> <b>a</b> hard object processor.|$|E
