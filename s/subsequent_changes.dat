Her reversal (followed by two <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> of heart, {{back to the original}} mission and then in opposition to it) counterbalance the wickedness of Madame du Gua and Corentin. Her ultimate fidelity to the object of her desire demonstrates the possibility of sincere passion, even as the other pair speak to the venom of the slighted heart.|$|E
5|$|Muni began {{service on}} December 28, 1912, when the A Geary-Park line was inaugurated, running between the Financial District and the Richmond District {{on the western}} side of the city. Expansion of the system and {{consolidation}} with other transit companies eventually made Muni the city's sole public transit operator in 1952, when it acquired the bankrupt California Street Cable Railroad. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> and adjustments to the system gave rise to the lines in use today.|$|E
5|$|Named for an English {{immigrant}} to the area, Davison Avenue {{was originally}} the only street connecting across Highland Park to Detroit. It was rebuilt {{by the city}} and Wayne County as a freeway during World War II. The roadway {{was transferred to the}} jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 1993 and numbered as M-8. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> by the state rebuilt the freeway and extended the M-8 designation to connect to the Jeffries Freeway (I-96).|$|E

5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{reaction}} of the crew to the casting of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), and the <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> made to The Girlie Show. This becomes evident when Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) changes the title of the show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) dismay. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) struggles to keep the cast and crew happy, so together with Tracy, she throws a party on a yacht.|$|E

5|$|Heublein {{promoted}} Michael A. Miles to run {{the chain}} in 1977 and Miles is credited with saving the ailing company by instituting its back-to-basics formula. Miles refurbished the stores, and introduced indoor seating and drive-thru windows. Electronic tills produced daily customer counts, inventories and profit and loss statements, so that problems could be identified quickly. KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> resulted in 30 months of consecutive per store sales increases by late 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept and}} {{scenario}} draft {{was written by}} Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Episode II was the last main Xenosaga game worked on by Saga prior to her leaving the project in 2005. Their draft was then turned into the game's full script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who was allowed by Takahashi to handle the storyline of the Xenosaga series following Episode I using his extensive notes. According to Takahashi, Yonesaka's role was to take his and Saga's notes {{and turn them into}} a workable game script, something which required parts of the planned scenario to be condensed or cut. According to Arai, the changes were made in consultation with Takahashi, with them treating his plan as a novel and the game as its movie adaptation. In a later interview, Saga said the changes made to the overall scenario for Episode II resulted in <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> to the planned Xenosaga plotline. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of Beyond Good and Evil, a novel written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series; in the context of Episode II, the subtitle was said to represent the blurring of boundaries between concepts of right and wrong, in addition to symbolizing the complex relations between Jr. and Albedo. As with the other Xenosaga titles, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology.|$|E
40|$|Based on theorizing {{about the}} dynamic {{relationship}} between change in {{job satisfaction and}} turnover intentions, {{this study examined the}} effect of change in job satisfaction on <b>subsequent</b> <b>change</b> in retirement intentions among older workers. It was hypothesized that change in job satisfaction negatively predicts <b>subsequent</b> <b>change</b> in retirement intentions. Data for this study came from 189 older workers between 45 and 81 years who responded to 3 surveys across 1 year. Consistent with expectations, results of a latent change score model showed that change in job satisfaction over 6 months negatively predicted change in retirement intentions over the following 6 months. Results of an alternative causal model and a full bivariate latent change score model additionally showed that change in retirement intentions did not significantly predict <b>subsequent</b> <b>change</b> in job satisfaction. Implications for future research and practice regarding the dynamic effect of job satisfaction on retirement intentions are discussed...|$|R

25|$|In 1936 Bonham-Carter was {{appointed}} Governor and Commander in Chief of Malta {{following the death}} of General Sir David Campbell. It was a time of political unrest on the island and a constitutional body was formed to find a more representative form of self-government, the earlier constitution having been suspended. The <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> overseen by Bonham-Carter was to create something more representative and acceptable to the population.

Three hundred and forty seven individuals who had experienced a recent interpersonal transgression were surveyed on four occasions {{over the course of}} six weeks. Forgiveness was assessed with scales measuring interpersonal avoidance and revenge motivation and psychological adjustment was assessed with scales measuring depression and rumination. Latent growth curve analyses showed that intraindividual changes in forgiveness were positively correlated with changes in adjustment. Latent difference score analyses indicated that adjustment predicted <b>subsequent</b> <b>change</b> in forgiveness, but that forgiveness did not predict <b>subsequent</b> <b>change</b> in adjustment. The results suggest that adjustment facilitates forgiveness, but not that forgiveness facilitates adjustment...|$|R
25|$|In 2000 the {{government}} published the first strategic plan {{for water and}} sanitation, further promoting the modernization of the sector and the consolidation of service provision.

Sector policies continued to be stable after <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> of government in the elections of 2002 won by the Social Democrats and of 2005 won by the Socialists. A judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of 29 September 2005 found against Portugal for not complying with a series of drinking water parameters laid down in the EU drinking water directive.

25|$|Most of Cape Cod's {{geological}} history {{involves the}} advance and retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet {{in the late}} Pleistocene geological era and the <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> in sea level. Using radiocarbon dating techniques, researchers have determined that around 23,000 years ago, the ice sheet reached its maximum southward advance over North America, and then started to retreat. Many kettle ponds – clear, cold lakes – were formed and remain on Cape Cod {{as a result of}} the receding glacier. By about 18,000 years ago, the ice sheet had retreated past Cape Cod. By roughly 15,000 years ago, it had retreated past southern New England. When so much of Earth's water was locked up in massive ice sheets, the sea level was lower. Truro's bayside beaches used to be a petrified forest, before it became a beach.|$|E
25|$|Several Acts of Parliament {{allowed the}} {{building}} of the Asylum, and statutes have driven the <b>subsequent</b> <b>changes</b> in mental health care. The background {{to the creation of the}} asylum included the 1808 County Asylums Act which was passed after an expensive war against France. This recognised lunatics as being ill, as being held in the wrong institutions and perhaps having a chance to recover if given the right type of treatment. Non-recovery would mean that the insane pauper would always need to be looked after, which would cost more in the long run. Some parishes were growing in population due to industrialisation, and the existing charitable institutions and workhouses could not cope with the increasing demand. The recognition of insanity as an illness can almost be seen as a cost-saving measure rather than a humane one.|$|E
