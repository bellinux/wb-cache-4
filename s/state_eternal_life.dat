He does not say, This is to know God and Jesus Christ, in order that they may have <b>eternal</b> <b>life.</b> Whatever He says, He does not say that. Nay, more, if we are to be very exact (and can we be too exact?) with the Lord's words, He says, that 'This is <b>eternal</b> <b>life,</b> in order that they may know God and Jesus Christ.'

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{research}} the avenues in which to have <b>Eternal</b> <b>Life</b> Bible Baptist Church transition to a small group system. This thesis was done through field analysis and literature research, {{as well as the}} case study of <b>Eternal</b> <b>Life</b> Bible Baptist Church (ELBBC). The case study was totally focused on the process of changing to a small group system at <b>Eternal</b> <b>Life.</b> The author was a minister at <b>Eternal</b> <b>Life</b> for 8 years, and an associate pastor for a year. In a few years the author will become the next senior pastor of <b>Eternal</b> <b>life</b> Bible Baptist Church. Therefore, this thesis was based upon the author 2 ̆ 7 s personal ministry experiences at the church, and the positive effects of the transition were also recorded. The author is sure that the small group system at <b>Eternal</b> <b>Life</b> will lead to a reproduction in the number Christ 2 ̆ 7 s disciples, and hopes that this thesis will be a tool for many traditional Korean churches who wish to switch to small groups...|$|R
