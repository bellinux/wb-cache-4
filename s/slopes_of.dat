5|$|Parts of Juniata County {{are fairly}} flat, {{but there are}} areas in the county with <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> 25% or greater. However, most {{development}} in the county is confined to areas with <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> 15% or less. Many of the county's steepest slopes, with grades of 25% of more, are located {{on the edges of}} the county. These slopes are generally found on mountainous ridges. However, there are some similarly steep slopes {{in the middle of the}} county. All four boroughs in the county have slopes with a grade of 25% or more near them. <b>Slopes</b> <b>of</b> 15% to 25% can be found throughout the county.|$|E
5|$|This {{ensures that}} the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the {{indifference}} curves and the production set are the same.|$|E
5|$|A thick {{regolith}} {{layer on}} the lower <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the mountains and a thin cover of debris on the upper slopes are suggested by the relative absence of large boulders {{on the lower}} mountain flanks.|$|E
50|$|The centre {{has three}} dry ski slopes: a main <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 110 metres; a second <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 90 metres and a nursery <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 30 metres long. All slopes are fully floodlit.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> this secant line {{differs from}} the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the tangent line by an amount that is {{approximately}} proportional to h. As h approaches zero, the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the secant line approaches the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the tangent line.

30|$|We {{compared}} preoperative {{and postoperative}} results by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The correlations among preoperative and postoperative canting of the canines, canting <b>of</b> the molars, <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the canines, <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the molars, canting of the lips at rest, and <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the lips at rest were examined by regression analyses. Similarly, the correlations among preoperative and postoperative canting of the canines, canting <b>of</b> the molars, <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the canines, <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the molars, and canting and <b>slope</b> angle <b>of</b> the lips while smiling {{were analyzed by}} regression analyses. The statistical significances of the results were verified using the IBM SPSS statistics 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) program. The level of significance was set at 0.05.|$|R
5|$|The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an {{elevation}} of , is dominated by māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found on the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The long barrow gained {{its name}} from the Chestnuts, an area of {{woodland}} that crowns the hill on the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> which the barrow is located. Prior to the adoption of this name, the site was known locally as Stony or Long Warren.|$|E
5|$|The shaded north <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> cinder cones {{provide more}} {{protection}} from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder cones are therefore colonized by plants first.|$|E

5|$|The <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Licancabur are {{unstable}} {{and prone to}} rock falls. Some of the instability {{may be due to}} earthquakes, snow, wind or geothermal effects (resulting in thermal stress), and it frustrated a 1920s attempt by a Chuquicamata engineer to climb the mountain.|$|E

5|$|A. r. ruficeps, the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{was described}} by Cassin in 1852. It {{is found in the}} coastal ranges of California and on the western <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the Sierra Nevada.

5|$|After being spotted, the German {{ships in}} Førde Fjord sailed further up the fjord and {{prepared}} for an Allied attack. Z33 and several of her escorts anchored close to the steep southern <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the fjord {{near the village of}} Bjørkedal. Meanwhile, other ships moored near the northern shore after breaking up pack ice with gunfire. This anchorage was also protected by flak batteries on the shore of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up on the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Uhud. A small faction was cut off {{and tried to make}} its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E

5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes occurs {{throughout}} much of the Southwest Botanical Province, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from Shark Bay (25°30′S) in the north, to Kojonup (33°50'S) and Jerramungup (34°24'S 118°55'E) in the south and south-east respectively. It grows among tall shrubland or low woodland, mostly in the swales and lower <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> dunes, and shows a very strong preference for deep white or yellow sand.|$|E
5|$|Barton Camp, {{which is}} on the {{northern}} <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Crook Peak, is run by the Bristol Children's Help Society which was founded in 1884 to help needy children.
