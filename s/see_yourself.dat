500|$|Brosnan {{also raises}} money for {{charitable}} causes through sales of his paintings. After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I {{always wanted to be}} an artist, a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> in the world…from a very hard time in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities." [...] Since Harris' death, Brosnan has been an advocate for cancer awareness and, in 2006, he served as spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, a breast cancer fundraiser which raises millions of dollars and raises more money in a single day than any other breast cancer fundraiser.|$|E
500|$|John J. O'Connor of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "With only the premiere to go on, The Cosby Show {{is by far}} the classiest and most {{entertaining}} new situation comedy of the season." [...] After the pilot aired, David Bianculli wrote in the Sunday Philadelphia Inquirer that [...] "This sitcom will lose to CBS's Magnum, P.I., but it's too funny, and Cosby is too good, for NBC to dump it." [...] In a separate article in the same edition, he spoke more glowingly describing it as [...] "the best TV sitcom since Cheers, and a good bet to become an instant classic. Cosby is delightful, and his series is both funny and intelligent." [...] He also described the family as [...] "amazingly real". According to Associated Press syndicated writer Jerry Buck, in the episode, [...] "Cosby handles his son {{in a manner that is}} not only funny but intelligent." [...] Mike Boone of The Gazette described Cosby and Ayers-Allen as [...] "credible parents" [...] and Cosby's fatherly advice as a [...] "delightful confrontation". Boone also noted that [...] "understanding the special world of children" [...] has always been a part of Cosby's comedy, and that this was present in the comical scene where Cliff and Theo discuss serious matters using play money. Star-Banner said [...] "The dialogue is typically Cosby [...] easy and funny [...] and you can just <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> getting to like these people very much." [...] According to Associated Press writer Fred Rothenberg, the response to the opening episode was glowing with the Los Angeles Times praising the show as [...] "the best comedy of the fall season by a long, long, lonnnnnnng shot."; The New York Times saying [...] "by far the classiest and most entertaining situation comedy."; and The Washington Post calling it [...] "the best, funniest, most humane new show of the season." [...] He also noted that marketing executives were not surprised at the reaction to the show.|$|E

500|$|Marco Pérez (who plays Andrade in the film) {{referred}} to Espinosa's performance as [...] "a fascinating freshness", praising her musical {{training for the}} role and her attention to detail, further detailing that [...] "it {{would have been easy}} to create a sensationalized, one-dimensional portrait of Gloria, but Sofía goes behind the public persona {{to the heart of the}} woman". The film premiered in Mexico on January 1, 2015, as it was distributed by Universal Pictures with about 1,000 copies. Espinosa and Pérez received positive reviews for their performances from Jessica Oliva of Cine Premiere magazine, who stated that the actors [...] "seem to blend in with their characters. Sofía Espinosa stands out with her voice (singing all the songs), and her physical interpretation and charisma, while Marco Pérez, Sergio Andrade, manages to embody the duality of that genius of the industry, perverse and visionary at the same time". Sofía Ochoa Rodríguez and Verónica Sánchez of En Filme were [...] "surprised by [...] performance" [...] as it was [...] "very close to Gloria Trevi's, albeit with a nasally accent, and cadence which lets through the hoarse, sarcastic and melancholic style that permeates on every one of the songs the actress sings. Her acting work and physical resemblance let her move naturally from comedy to pain, loneliness to longing, to the easy smile, to the dance, to the jumps on stage and the twinkle in her eyes". In contrast, David Noh of Film Journal International was not impressed by Espinosa's acting, saying that she [...] "lacks appeal and is quite ordinary in a role that calls for some of the electricity the very young Jennifer Lopez managed to ratchet up in her musical biopic, Selena". Gloria Trevi praised the work of Espinosa in the film, stating that [...] "it is shocking to <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> on film, the girl [...] did an extraordinary job". Espinosa won the Diosa de Plata and the Ariel Award for Best Actress for Gloria.|$|E
2500|$|Bernard {{wrote of}} Mary {{under the title}} [...] "Our Lady, Star of the Sea".When the storms to temptation burst upon you, when you <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> driven upon the rocks of tribulation, look at the star, call upon Mary. When {{swallowed}} by pride or ambition, or hatred, or jealousy, look at the star, call upon Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary. If troubled {{on account of the}} heinousness of your sins, distressed at the filthy state of your conscience, and terrified at the thought of the awful judgment to come, you are beginning to sink into the bottomless gulf of sadness and to be swallowed in the abyss of despair, then think of Mary. In dangers, in doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name leave thy lips, never suffer it to leave your heart.|$|E
2500|$|Shyamalan {{commented on}} the issues {{regarding}} fans' perceptions of the casting {{in an interview with}} Washington Post columnist Jen Chaney, saying, [...] "Anime is based on ambiguous facial features. It's meant to be interpretive. It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> in all these characters...This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in my approach to its casting. There's African-Americans in the movie...so it's a source of pride for me. The irony that [...] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and my name on it. I don't know what else to do." [...] In this quote, Shyamalan's reference to Noah Ringer can be explained by Noah's self-identification of his ancestry as [...] "American Indian," [...] although critics of the film's casting have presumed that the actor is simply [...] "white" [...] when making their complaints.|$|E
