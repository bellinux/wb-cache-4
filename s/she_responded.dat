5|$|A doctor {{performed}} an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but <b>she</b> <b>responded</b> by giving more interviews about mesmerism. Fraser {{wrote that the}} articles made Eddy a household name, a real-life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians (1885–1886), with her interest in spiritualism, women's rights and the mind cure. Shortly after the death, Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students. The following year, 1883, she founded the Journal of Christian Science (later called the Christian Science Journal), which spread news of her ideas across the United States.|$|E

He also objects {{that she was}} too young to merit such a high position through her works. <b>She</b> <b>responds</b> that no one envies Mary's position as Queen of courtesy, but that all are members of the body of Christ.

5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. <b>She</b> <b>responded</b> by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which <b>she</b> <b>responded</b> to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed {{it off with a}} humorous comment.|$|E

She began working as a n'anga, a traditional healer, telling people the causes of their illnesses in exchange for a payment of two shillings and sixpence.

A widely reported and commented upon controversy emerged from the related tour when she asked for local musicians to volunteer to play with her for exposure, fun, beer, and hugs instead of money. <b>She</b> <b>responded</b> in the press and changed her policy to one of paying local musicians who volunteered to play with her on this tour.|$|E
25|$|Churchill first {{sought the}} opinion of friends and {{relations}} about the book. He asked his grandmother, Frances, Duchess of Marlborough, to comment, with particular reference {{to the character of}} Lucile. <b>She</b> <b>responded</b> that she felt the book was worthy of publication, particularly since it already had the prospect of a reasonable financial return, but felt the plot might be improved. She was impressed by the descriptions of fighting, but agreed with Churchill's concerns about Lucile, suggesting that the character betrayed his lack of experience of women. However, an offer of £100 from the Morning Post for the right to serialise the book left Churchill no time for amendments, and it was published as it stood.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientists}} also measured Genie's conversational competence. Most verbal {{interactions with}} her consisted either of someone asking her a question several times until <b>she</b> <b>responded</b> or her saying something {{to which the}} other person responded, and unless she actively attempted to control a conversation's direction she relied on the other person to achieve and maintain its flow. She typically did not acknowledge statements, requests, or other common pieces of conversation, {{and when she did}} respond it was often with a significant delay. Curtiss wrote that Genie grew progressively better at both, although even by mid-1975 she did not always respond or took an unusually long time to do so. If she did respond she often repeated something said earlier, and she used repetitive statements to serve several conversational functions.|$|E

However, Outalha later admitted that she embellished some of her accusations against Headley, leading the Americans to not take her claims seriously. The State Department relayed her warnings to the DEA, the FBI, and the CIA, but whether the agencies acted on them is disputed. After leaving Pakistan, Outalha divorced from Headley.|$|E

Some public opinions feared she had only {{stepped down from the}} Housing Authority for only seven months and it was inappropriate for her to be employed to a real property corporation. A few legislators also worried that Wong would no longer represent the interest of social workers by having a closer relationship with the business sector. Yet, <b>she</b> <b>responded</b> that she would only received 5,000 HKD annually as director's emoluments from the directorship and she promised to bring the voice of the social work sector into the corporation.|$|E
