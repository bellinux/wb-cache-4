25|$|Following the {{tradition}} of adding a trim level above the EX during the refresh like the first generation CR-V, Honda added the SE trim level for the 2005 CR-V. The CR-V SE featured painted bumpers, body side molding, and hard, body-colored <b>spare</b> <b>tire</b> cover. For a more luxurious experience, Honda added a leather interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated side mirrors and front seats.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the fuel tank. While the Fit locates the fuel tank under the front seats, the Insight positions the fuel tank under the rear seats. This allows the Insight’s hybrid battery pack to be located in the cargo floor below the <b>spare</b> <b>tire,</b> to accommodate folding rear seats, lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.|$|E
25|$|The 1908 New York to Paris Race was {{the first}} circumnavigation of the world by automobile.

The US built Thomas Flyer with George Schuster (driver) won the race covering 22,000 miles in 169 days.

25|$|In 2000, a Special Edition {{model was}} {{introduced}} in North America. The SE featured body-colored bumpers and side moldings, a body-colored hard <b>spare</b> <b>tire</b> cover, leather upholstery, CD/cassette audio deck, rear privacy glass, a Navtech navigation system, and chrome grille accent. Until 2001, the CR-V sold {{more than any other}} vehicle in its class. The North American models also received new exterior colors including Naples Gold Metallic and Taffeta White.

However, that year, sales of the Ford Escape and its clone, the Mazda Tribute, surpassed those of the CR-V.|$|E
25|$|For this generation, the Supra {{received}} a new six-speed Getrag/Toyota V160 gearbox on the turbo models while the naturally aspirated models made {{do with a}} five-speed manual W58, revised from the previous version. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode. All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminium alloy wheels, the naturally aspirated model had 16-inch wheels and the turbo models were 17-inch. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard onto the turbo model, but in Japan were optional extras. Both models had a space saver <b>spare</b> <b>tire</b> on a steel rim to save both space and weight.|$|E

25|$|Subaru {{had earned}} a {{reputation}} of building vehicles that were regarded as quirky and other Asian manufacturers were bringing more upscale and conventional appearing models to the market. The Legacy broke with many Subaru traditions, such as no longer locating the <b>spare</b> <b>tire</b> in the engine compartment, behind the engine and above the transmission, a tradition started with the 1966 Subaru 1000. The Legacy was an all-new model, and positioned above the Leone, XT, Justy, and kei cars Rex and Sambar in Subaru's model range at the time. The Legacy also introduced an entirely new flat-4 engine series, called the Subaru EJ engine, which was quieter and {{more powerful than the}} previous Subaru EA engine.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch <b>spare</b> <b>tire</b> as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

50|$|In the Verizon IndyCar Series, a {{pit stop}} {{is a more}} complex {{operation}} than in NASCAR, but far less so than in Formula One. Rules permit six mechanics over the pit wall during a stop. The pit rules and procedures have origins in USAC National Championship racing. The spare fuel for IndyCar competition is stored in large pitside fuel tanks. Each team's tank is filled to a specified volume of fuel, depending upon the race distance. Teams are also given a certain allotment of <b>spare</b> <b>tires</b> sets, likewise owing to the race distance. All of the <b>spare</b> <b>tires</b> are pre-mounted on wheels before the race.|$|R

50|$|In 1941, the U.S. {{government}} prohibited <b>spare</b> <b>tires</b> on new cars. Shortages {{of resources}} caused by World War II led to quotas and laws designed to force conservation, including rubber that was produced overseas {{and difficult to}} get. A similar ban was also implemented by the U.S. during the Korean War in 1951.|$|R
500|$|Haynes {{continued}} to drive his car as he added {{improvements to the}} vehicle, and [...] constructed the Pioneer II in 1895 to incorporate his improved steering designs and an exhaust pipe. [...] He built the new car {{with the intention of}} running it in the 1895 Chicago Times-Herald Race, the first automobile race in the United States. Although over seventy-five cars were entered in the race, most of their owners did not have them completed in time for race so only three cars and six early motorcycles showed up. While driving to the race, Haynes had a confrontation with a Chicago policeman who insisted that Haynes had no right to drive his vehicle on public roads, forcing him to requisition a horse to pull the car the rest of the way. Similar incidents happened with the other race's entries so the city passed an ordinance a few days later to clear up any ambiguity in the laws and allow automobiles equal access to the city streets, allowing the postponed race to take place. While giving his car a ride around the town on the following day Haynes was involved in what {{is believed to be the}} first automobile accident after swerving to miss a street car and striking a sharp curb, busting a tire and damaging the axle. Without a <b>spare</b> <b>tire,</b> Haynes was unable to run in the race. The race was held on November 28, and thousands of spectators turned out. Duryea's car won first place and a German Benz came in second. Another contest was held in which Haynes won a prize for most intuitive design.|$|E
