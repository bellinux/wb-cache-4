40|$|A {{modification}} of {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) was developed for the <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> and identification of strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum. The eight recognised human serotypes of U urealyticum and antisera produced against them were used as reference for the evaluation and standardisation of the method. The serological profile illustrating reactions of antigen with homologous and heterologous antisera was specific and reproducible for each serotype. The homologous reaction was always very prominent but some cross-reactivity was seen, most clearly between serotypes 2 and 5. The method {{was found to be}} suitable for serological typing of clinical isolates of U urealyticum because of rapid and simple technical procedure, good reproducibility of the results and economical consumption of antisera and other reagents...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> of Helicobacter pylori strains {{has been}} questioned, e. g., when the {{presence}} or absence of the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) is determined. This study compared CagA-reactive serum antibodies, assessed with immunoblot, with cag PAI status, as determined by PCR. CagA serology results were available for 101 individuals contributing 202 bacterial samples for cag PAI PCR. There was a high degree of correlation between the two methods (kappa coefficient, 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 68 – 0. 97). Combined with suggested biological explanations for the discrepancies, this finding supports the application of well-evaluated serological assays in the assessment of the cag PAI status of H. pylori infections in clinical and epidemiological studies...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage induces {{profound}} changes in Vibrio cholerae either by lysogenisation or by selection of resistant mutants (Mukerjee, 1983). These changes may involve pathogenic traits, e. g., lysogenisation with temperate phage obtained from an epidemic strain GS 9 (Mukerjee, 1983) may impart virulence to V. cholerae EW 6, a non-virulent strain that carries a non-functional toxin operon (Bhattacharyya et al., 1987). Not {{all of the}} virulence factors of V. cholerae have yet been characterised (Lancet, 1986), al-though lipopolysaccharide antigens and outer- membrane proteins, which are conspicuously im-munogenic in cholera patients (Pierce, 1984), are considered important in the pathogenesis of the disease (Manning et al., 1986). Some of these antigens are routinely used in serological character- isation of V. cholerae isolates. In recent years, phage-induced changes in V. cholerae have been characterised at the serological level (Ogg et al., 1978; Shigeno, 1982; Siddiqui and Bhattacharyya, 1984).

40|$|We {{monitored}} {{the incidence of}} human listeriosis in Navarre, a region in north of Spain between 1995 and 2005, and carried out the characterisation of Listeria monocytogenes isolates obtained from clinical samples and ready-to-eat products (sliced cooked meat, smoked salmon and liver pate). The active surveillance requesting hospitals to notify all listeriosis cases (n= 40) yielded higher incidence rates (average annual rate 0. 65 / 100, 000 inhabitants, range 0. 18 - 1. 18 / 100, 000 inhabitants) than expected. Pregnant women were the largest group affected (n= 13, 32. 5 % of the cases), with a peak in incidence {{during the last three}} years of the study period. From the 40 human cases we obtained 33 Listeria isolates. <b>Serological</b> and molecular <b>characterisation</b> by PFGE identified 20 different pulsotypes, which on three occasions enabled us to link sporadic cases into clusters. Although we could not identify the incriminated food product we found two clinical pulsotypes among smoked salmon and cooked meat isolates. Surveillance of listeriosis in Spain should be improved and coordinated with other European Union Member States in order to better estimate the burden of disease and to prevent foodborne outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{diarrhoea}} outbreak {{occurred in}} a kindergarten, which caused 21 relevant infected cases. Our object was to confirm the pathogens and their molecular characterisation. Materials and Methods: Faecal samples from 21 patients were collected on the 3 rd day after their symptom onset, and a regular epidemiological investigation was conducted. Bacterial isolation was performed in accordance with standard laboratory protocol, <b>serological</b> and molecular <b>characterisations</b> were determined by serum agglutination test and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, respectively. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and 16 S rRNAs were conducted to determine the homology. Results: Eleven enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) O 136 :K 78 strains were isolated. The serum agglutination test showed that all strains' serotypes were E. coli (EIEC) O 136 :K 78. Real-time PCR showed that 10 (91 %) strains carried the invasion plasmid antigen H gene (ipaH), carried by all four Shigella species and EIEC. The strain that didn't carry the ipaH gene had different biochemical reactions of L-lizyna and L-rhamnose with the other strains. The complete 16 S rRNA sequences showed 98. 4 % identity between ipaH-negative isolate and the others, and the PFGE indicated that the ipaH-negative isolate was not homological with other isolates in this diarrhoea outbreak.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study to}} assess {{zoonotic}} milk-borne health risks, seasonal survey data and unpasteurized milk samples were collected between January 1999 and February 2000 from randomly selected informal milk market agents (220 and 236 samples in the dry and wet seasons, respectively) and from households purchasing raw milk (213 and 219 samples in the dry and wet seasons, respectively) in rural and urban locations in central Kenya and screened for antibodies to Brucella abortus (B. abortus) and presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O 157 :H 7. The latter was assessed based on samples from consumer households only. Antibodies to B. abortus were screened using the indirect antibody Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and the Milk Ring Test (MRT). The presence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 was assessed by culture, biochemical <b>characterisation,</b> <b>serological</b> testing for production of verocytotoxin one (VT 1) and two (VT 2) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis {{for the presence of}} genes encoding for the toxins. The prevalence of antibodies to B. abortus varied considerably ranging from none in milk sold in small units and originating from intensive production systems to over 10 % in samples that were bulked or originating from extensive production systems. E. coli O 157 :H 7 was isolated from two samples (0. 8 %), one of which produced VT 1. All urban consumers (100 %) and nearly all rural consumers (96 %) of marketed milk boiled the milk before consumption, mainly in tea, thus greatly reducing chances of exposure to live pathogens and potential health risks...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{re-examination}} of nine Australian isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae that have been previously assigned to serovar 12. In the ring precipitation test, none of the nine isolates reacted with antisera to serovars 1 – 14 of A. pleuropneumoniae. Antiserum prepared {{against one of the}} Australian isolates gave no reaction with any of the 14 recognised serovar reference strains, except serovar 7. This reaction of the HS 143 antiserum with serovar 7 antigen could be removed by adsorption with serovar 7 antigen. The adsorbed antiserum remained reactive with HS 143 and the other eight Australian isolates. The nine Australian isolates were all shown to express ApxII and ApxIII, found in serovars 2, 4, 6 and 8, as well as the 42 kDa outer membrane protein found in all serovars of A. pleuropneumoniae. The nine Australian isolates were found to possess the following toxin associated genes apxIBD, apxIICA, apxIIICA, apxIIIBD and apxIVA. The toxin gene profile of the Australian isolates is typical of A. pleuropneumoniae serovars 2, 4, 6 and 8. On the basis of the <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> results and the toxin gene profiles, we propose that these isolates represent a new serovar of A. pleuropneumoniae –– serovar 15 –– with HS 143 being the reference strain for the new serovar...|$|E
40|$|THE {{epidemiology}} of Escherichia coli {{is poorly}} understood, and although <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> of strains affords an excellent method of typing E. coli, it is time-consuming {{and can be}} performed only in specialised labora-tories. Another method would be of value. Colicine typing {{as a method of}} differentiating strains has been used (Linton, 1960; McGeachie, 1965; Mustafa and Dunbar, 1970), but not so extensively as serotyping and its usefulness has not been defined. Colicine typing is simple to perform and has been found valuable in epidemiological studies on shigellae (Abbott and Shannon, 1958; Gillies, 1964; Hart, 1965), particularly on strains of Shigella sonnei because they are sero-logically and often biochemically homogeneous (Hart). This paper records our experience of colicine typing of E. coli and of the validity of the method as an epidemiological tool. Serological and colicine typing were used in this investigation to determine whether the combination of the two methods would provide a finer subdivision of strains, to show the frequency of colicine production and sensitivity among serologically defined strains, and to show any correlation between colicine types and antigenic structure of the organisms. This is particularly interesting because several workers attempting to purify colicines have observed a close association between colicines and the 0 antigen of the organism (Goebel and Barry, 1958; Hutto...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] Analysis of macrorestriction {{patterns}} by PFGE {{to resolve}} the relatedness of clonal subgroups amongst N gonorrhoeae IB- 2 and IB- 6 serovar strains. MATERIALS AND METHODS [...] Nineteen IB- 2 and eight IB- 6 serovar strains that differed in either auxotype or penicillin sensitivity were isolated over a two and a half-year period from patients attending several STD clinics in Sydney. During this period, a major clone, Wt/IB- 2 (FS), established on epidemiological grounds, was circulating amongst homosexual males. The genetic relation of this major clone to the other strains present in the community was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) analysis of DNA restriction fragments. Genomic DNA from the 27 isolates were prepared, digested with SpeI and BglII and the restriction patterns were analysed by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis (CHEF) in a CHEF DRIII equipment. RESULTS [...] Phenotypic characterisation of the 27 isolates by the combined use of auxotype, <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> and penicillin sensitivity indicated the presence of subgroups {{within each of the}} two serovars. In the present study, PFGE analysis of SPeI and BglII-generated genomic DNA restriction patterns from six of the ten Wt/IB- 2 (FS) correlated well with phenotypic characterisation of this major clone. Four of the ten Wt/IB- 2 (FS) were found to be clonally-derived variants of this major clone as minor genome variations (less than 3 DNA fragments) were observed. Distinct clones were represented by three Wt/IB- 2 (LS) isolates as the DNA fingerprints generated from these were unrelated to the major clone. Analysis of PFGE patterns of 6 Pro/IB- 2 isolates showed that one was genotypically identical to the major clone, two were clonal variants and three had significantly different patterns to indicate that they were genotypically unrelated. Wt/IB- 6 isolates had heterogenous PFGE patterns that were clearly unrelated to the Wt/IB- 2 serovar strains. Within the IB- 6 serovar, there were three isolates with the Wt/IB- 6 (FS) phenotype that could be considered as clonal variants whilst the rest were genotypically distinct. CONCLUSIONS [...] PFGE analysis of macrorestriction patterns generated from SpeI- and BglII-cleavage of genomic DNA has enabled the establishment of clonal origins of strains present in the Sydney community during the period of study. The delineation of strains belonging to major A/S groups by PFGE analysis presents a clearer epidemiological picture than phenotypic characterisation alone...|$|E
40|$|Cashew nut allergy can be {{a severe}} food allergy of which the {{prevalence}} appears to be increasing. The aim of this thesis was a comprehensive molecular and <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> of the cashew nut allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3 for improved diagnosis and characterisation of patient populations. Chapter 1 in this thesis provides background information on cashew nuts, allergy, the allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3, the effect of heat treatments on cashew nut proteins, the digestibility of cashew nut proteins, cross-reactivity between cashew nut proteins and other tree nuts, and the detection of cashew nut in food products. Subsequently, in Chapter 2, a review is presented {{on the topic of}} epithelial protein and allergen transport. This review describes multiple pathways of intestinal protein transport, sums up existing experimental data concerning protein and peptide transport, and presents different methods to study this. Interestingly, the pathway of (allergenic) protein transport can differ between sensitized and non-sensitized persons. In sensitized persons, protein transport occurs transcellularly via enterocytes, and paracellularly with the involvement of mast cells, while in non-sensitized persons microfold cells and enterocytes are considered most important. In the next three chapters, cashew nut allergens were studied. Cashew nut allergy and cashew nut allergens were chosen because of a high number of undiagnosed cashew nut allergic children reported at the children’s hospital “Kinderhaven”, in Rotterdam, an outpatient clinic that is involved in this study. Chapter 3 describes a protocol for the purification of Ana o 1, 2 and 3 from cashew nuts. Ana o 1 and 3 were purified by protein extraction, salt precipitation and filtering over a 30 kDa molecular weight membrane. Ana o 2 was purified by protein extraction followed by gel filtration chromatography. These purified proteins were characterised by SDS-PAGE, western blot, glycoprotein stain, and protein identification. In this chapter also more in-depth analysis was performed on the N- and C-termini of the large and small subunits of Ana o 3. These N- and C-termini of Ana o 3, as well as the SDS-PAGE protein profiles were compared between cashew nuts of different origins in Chapter 4. In this chapter also the effects of different heat treatments on the electrophoretic behaviour of cashew nut allergens from various origins were studied, using both 1 D and 2 D electrophoresis. In these data no significant differences were detected between the electrophoresis patterns of Ana o 1, 2 or 3 in the various origins of cashew nuts. Some small but significant differences in Ana o 1, 2 and 3 content, however, were detected between the differently heated cashew nuts. No major differences in N- and C-terminal micro-heterogeneity were detected between cashew nuts of different origins. Next, in Chapter 5, the cashew nut allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3 were produced as recombinant proteins using a yeast (P. pastoris) production system. This procedure was used as recombinant allergens often produce higher yields of higher purity compared to native purified allergens. The recombinant proteins were compared to the native cashew nut proteins for their glycosylation pattern, IgE binding capacity, and 2 D electrophoresis profile. In Chapter 6, the major findings of this thesis are discussed. An overview of the protein characteristics (e. g. 1 D and 2 D electrophoresis profile, glycosylation, IgE binding, pepsin-digestibility) was provided, as well as a discussion on the clinical benefits that can be derived from the results obtained in this thesis. Also some additional results are presented, studying the serologic cross-reactivity between cashew nuts and other tree nuts and Anacardiaceae nuts and fruits. This thesis provides an in-depth study regarding the protein characteristics of the cashew nut allergens Ana o 1, 2 and 3. Using the allergens that were purified in this thesis project, the serum IgE levels of Ana o 1, 2 and 3 could be measured in cashew nut-allergic children. The allergens were also recombinantly produced to obtain higher quantity of allergens for regular use in diagnostics of cashew nut allergy. The results from this thesis can potentially expand clinical patient characterisation with measurements of IgE levels to purified and recombinantly produced major cashew nut allergens. These results might have applications for other food allergens or patient populations...|$|E
40|$|Leptospirosis is an important, re-emerging, {{infectious}} disease {{of animals and}} humans. Leptospira, a spirochaete and the causative agent of leptospirosis, colonises the renal tissue of infected organisms where it can become endemic or result in clinical infection. Endemicity of a serovar is species specific and defines a reservoir or maintenance host, capable of renal shedding throughout life. Of the several mammalian maintenance hosts that have been described for the transmission of leptospires to humans, rodent reservoirs are the most significant. However, the sources of infection in rodents remain to be elucidated. The detection of antibodies and leptospiral DNA from fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) in Australia has alluded to a previously unrecognised role of fruit bats in the maintenance and transmission of leptospires to other species, in this case to associated ground-dwelling rodents. The primary aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effect of the presence of Australian fruit bat (Pteropus conspicillatus) colonies on leptospiral prevalence and population dynamics of associated rodents in a leptospirosis endemic region of Australia. A subsequent aim was to advance the detection and description of leptospires from clinical and field samples. A lower rodent abundance but significantly higher prevalence of leptospiral infection was reported for rodents associated with fruit bat colonies when compared with control rodents not associated with fruit bat colonies. Isolation by culture, which by definition is the most confirmatory test for the detection of leptospires, detected four isolates, which could not be exhaustively compared across sites. On comprehensive analysis of sampling techniques employed for the study, it was evident that a high percentage of samples were contaminated, specifically those collected for examination by culture, which impacted on success of the surveillance study. Detection of leptospiral DNA by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) provided the highest sensitivity when compared to detection by culture, microscopic agglutination test and histopathology. This alluded to the robustness of molecular-based methods to contaminated samples. An additional benefit of collecting multiple samples from each specimen for detection of leptospires by multiple serological and molecular tests was highlighted. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers have been previously used for the characterisation of leptospiral isolates, however, inconsistencies with reproducibility and subjective gel-scoring, have led to its disuse. PCR followed by high-resolution melt (HRM) curve analysis of amplicons from a number of bacterial and viral pathogens, including Campylobacter jejuni, have been successful at characterisation of pathogens. The two molecular methodologies were successfully combined for the <b>serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> of ten reference leptospiral isolates in a pilot trial. For the validation of this technique (RAPD-HRM), 23 strains of leptospires representing eight reference serovars, including the four strains isolated from rodents in this study, were tested. Intra-serovar divergence and inter-serovar convergence were reported {{during the course of this}} validation which may be indicative of discrepancies with serological classification. Further, evidence for genetic attenuation was noted in the strains representing the reference collection by the RAPD-HRM curve analysis. This trend was confirmed by analysis of hyper-immune antisera titre comparison between wild-type strains and corresponding reference strains. The attenuation may have occurred due to the high number of passages involved in the maintenance of the reference collections in agar-based, nutrient-rich medium. The data from the field surveillance of this study suggest that transmission of leptospires from fruit bats to rodents in Australia may not be influenced by the density of rodents at a site. Multiple samples collected for multiple tests from a single specimen increased chances of detecting leptospires. However, in the absence of isolation by culture of leptospires from renal samples from fruit bats, renal shedding, and therefore their role as reservoir hosts, cannot be confirmed. A high prevalence and low abundance in rodents associated with a fruit bat colony is suggestive of the potential for transmission which needs to be further evaluated. This surveillance constitutes the only study on the effect of the presence of a fruit bat colony on abundance and/ or leptospiral status in ground-dwelling, small mammals to date. To enhance detection and characterisation of leptospires from clinical and field isolates, the RAPD-HRM is presented here as a modern, closed-tube, reproducible, time and cost efficient method that is novel in bringing the knowledge of serovars to a molecular methodology. However, the diagnostic test could not be accurately validated due to evidence of attenuation in the reference strain collection. This thesis reports potential transmission dynamics from fruit bats to rodents in Australia, provides the foundation for future research into enhanced field-sampling techniques, presents a novel laboratory technique for characterisation of leptospiral isolates and provides a forum to highlight a gap in the quality control of reference strain collection, the effects of which can be mitigated by routine replacement with wild-type strains or in vitro challenge of collection...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepadnavirus}} family {{contains two}} genera, Orthohepadnaviruses that infect mammals and Avihepadnaviruses that infect birds. The most thoroughly studied {{members of the}} hepadnavirus family include hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects humans and chimpanzees, woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which infects woodchucks, and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), which infects ducks. All hepadnaviruses have similar genome structure and organisation of the open reading frames on their genome, and also show extensive nucleotide sequence homology within, but not between, genera. All hepadnaviruses primarily infect hepatocytes and have similar infection outcomes in their natural hosts. The outcome of hepadnavirus infection {{can be divided into}} either acute, with successful clearance of infection from the host and establishment of immune control, or chronic, where infection is not cleared, resulting in persistent lifelong infection that is linked to various forms of liver disease. The mechanisms involved in immune clearance of hepadnavirus infections are poorly understood. It has been hypothesised that virus DNA and proteins are, 1) cleared from the liver cytolytically by killing of the infected hepatocytes, or 2) can be destroyed noncytolytically by cytokines, leaving the infected hepatocyte intact. In this study, the mechanism of immune clearance was explored using molecular approaches to detect integrated virus-cell junctions, formed by the integration of DHBV DNA into the duck liver genome. The rate of DHBV DNA integration is thought to be low (reported to occur at a rate of ~ 1 in 10 ³ – 10 ⁴ cells by 6 day post infection (dpi)) (Yang and Summers, 1999), and the site of viral DNA integration into the host cell genome is random. Hence, each integration event will produce a unique integrated virus-cell junction that {{can be used as a}} genetic marker for that cell, which allows the fate of the DHBV-infected hepatocytes to be observed in the liver during various stages of both acute and chronic DHBV infection. Integrated virus-cell junctions can be detected using inverse nested PCR (invPCR), as described by Yang and Summers (Yang and Summers, 1999). Thus, this study aimed to determine whether cytolytic or non-cytolytic clearance of infected hepatocytes occurred, with the ultimate aim of contributing knowledge to assist in the development of new therapies for patients with chronic HBV infection. Initially, several molecular assays required for the characterisation of DHBV infection and the invPCR assay were established and optimised. These included DNA sequencing reactions and subsequent purification of DNA sequencing products (Chapter 3. 1), quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays used for the detection of DHBV total and cccDNA (Chapter 3. 2), as well as cloning and sequencing of the duck beta actin (β actin) and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes. The latter were both used as internal controls in the qPCR assays to quantify levels of DHBV total and cccDNA per cell (Chapter 4). Several parameters were tested and compared for each molecular assay to generate final optimised protocols, which were then applied both throughout subsequent Chapters and in other work performed in the laboratory. The duck β actin and GAPDH genes were characterised and the sequences were submitted to GenBank (GenBank Accession GU 564232 and GU 564233 respectively). The invPCR protocol was optimised by comparing 8 different liver cell DNA extraction methods, to determine the method that most efficiently extracted high molecular weight (MW) DNA from small quantities of frozen liver (Chapter 5. 1). One of the major problems with the invPCR assay was the high level of virus-virus (false positive) sequences generated from replicative forms of virus DNA. Therefore, the use of locked nucleic acids (LNA) oligonucleotides that were specific for the DHBV genome were tested as a potential selective tool to block the amplification of DHBV DNA (Chapter 5. 2). LNA oligonucleotides can bind with high affinity to their complementary DNA sequence, forming high melting temperature LNA-DNA complexes which then block amplification of that DNA sequence. Although the LNAs successfully blocked amplification of virus DNA, due to the high cost of LNA, their use in invPCR assays could not be pursued in this thesis. As a possible alternative to the invPCR assay, a linker ligation assay was assessed for its ability to detect integrated virus-cell junctions in samples of WHV-infected woodchuck and DHBV-infected duck liver tissue (Chapter 5. 3). However, as the efficiency of detection of integrated virus-cell junctions using linker ligation assay was similar to the efficiency of the invPCR assay, it was not further developed in this thesis, as the linker ligation assay is more complicated and time-consuming than invPCR. After optimising all the required molecular assays required for the invPCR assay in previous Chapters, the invPCR assay was first performed on plasmid DNA constructs as model systems, in order to determine the sensitivity and efficiency of the assay (Chapter 5. 4). It was found that the invPCR assay was able to amplify from a single copy of DNA template. The invPCR assay was also performed on samples of WHV-infected woodchuck and HBVinfected chimpanzee liver tissue in collaboration with Dr. William Mason (Chapter 5. 5). The results of the invPCR assay results confirmed that the assays established in this study had comparable efficiency with previously published invPCR assays, and could be confidently applied in this thesis. The integrated virus-cell junctions obtained in this study were included as a subset of the data published by Mason et al. 2009 a and 2009 b. In order to establish an invPCR assay specifically for the AusDHBV strain (GenBank Accession AJ 006350), several DHBV invPCR assays were designed, and preliminary studies were performed on liver tissues collected previously in the laboratory from ducks with acute and chronic DHBV infection (Chapter 6). Up to 38 integrated virus-cell junctions were successfully detected, among which 3 junctions were repeated, suggesting that clonal proliferation of hepatocytes had occurred in the duck liver. Characterisation of the integrated DHBV DNA showed that, consistent to previous studies, the most probable left and right hand end of the integrated DHBV dslDNA was at nucleotide position 2537 nt and ~ 2485 nt respectively, with no significant patterns or apparent preference of DHBV integration sites in the duck genome. The duck invPCR assay was subsequently extensively used in Chapters 7 and 8. To achieve the main aim of this thesis, and to explore if cytolytic or non-cytolytic clearance occurs during the resolution of acute hepadnavirus infection, the invPCR assay was used to detect integrated virus-cell junctions during and after resolution of acute DHBV infection. This DHBV model provided an advantage over the WHV-infected woodchuck and the HBVinfected chimpanzee models, where hepadnavirus infection spreads to > 95 % of the hepatocytes in the liver. Widespread infection requires the division of infected hepatocytes during clearance to replace hepatocytes killed by the host immune response. But in the duck model, DHBV infection can be established in ducks by inoculation with defined doses of DHBV to achieve a maximum DHBV infection of 95 % of hepatocytes in the liver, and was maintained until 165 dpi (duck 343) or 327 dpi (ducks 338 and 350), with continuous high levels of DHBV replication (181 – 298 copies of total DNA per liver cell) and viraemia (0. 6 – 20 μg/mL DHBsAg; 1 x 10 ⁶ – 1 x 10 ⁹ copies of DHBV DNA per mL of serum), and the establishment of a pool of 5 – 9 copies of DHBV cccDNA per liver cell. Histological characterisation of liver tissues at 4 dpi showed elevated levels of portal and lobular liver inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, but with low levels of Kupffer cell infiltration and activation. By 18 dpi, widespread DHBV infection and marked portal and lobular liver inflammation and elevated levels of hepatocyte apoptosis and Kupffer cell infiltration and activation were observed in the liver. From 60 – 327 dpi, the levels of hepatocyte apoptosis and Kupffer cell activation persisted, while levels of liver inflammation and Kupffer cell infiltration decreased. <b>Serological</b> <b>characterisation</b> revealed anti-DHBc antibodies from 4 dpi, and anti-DHBs antibodies from 4 – 11 dpi, at low and varying titres. However, the anti-DHBs antibodies were not sufficient to complex to and remove the DHBV virions from the serum, as “active” viraemia was also detected, indicating that the levels of circulating DHBV virions in the serum were in excess of the anti-DHBs antibodies. Using the invPCR assay, up to 22. 8 μg of DNA were analysed from liver tissues at 4, 18 and 60, 165, 196, 327 dpi. Out of the 685 invPCR products sequenced, 3 integrated virus-cell junctions were detected, but no hepatocyte clones were found. 81 % of the invPCR products sequenced were found to be virus-virus (false positive) sequences. As mentioned previously, integration of DHBV DNA has been reported to occur at a rate of ~ 1 in 10 ³ – 10 ⁴ cells by 6 dpi (Yang and Summers, 1999), thus out of the ~ 8 x 10 ⁶ cells analysed in this study, with > 95 % of the hepatocyte population in the liver infected, it is expected that up to 800 – 8000 integrated virus-cell junctions would be detected, with hepatocyte clone sizes of at least 8 cells. Similar to results obtained in Chapter 7, the failure to detect more integrated DHBVcell junctions in these studies could be due to high levels of virus-virus (false positive) sequences detected using the invPCR assay (81 % of total invPCR products). It is of course possible that physiological differences between mammalian and avian liver biology could explain the lack of viral DNA integration and subsequent formation of hepatocyte clones. On top of that, as the timeframe of this study (327 dpi) was much shorter compared to 2. 4 years post infection in woodchucks (Mason et al., 2005) and at least 20 years post infection in humans and chimpanzees (Mason et al., 2009 a; Mason et al., 2010), such large hepatocyte clones would not be expected to be found in ducks.
