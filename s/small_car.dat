5|$|The PSA Group, {{formed in}} 1976 when Peugeot bought out its competitor, Citroën, {{took over the}} former Chrysler Europe in 1979; one of its first {{decisions}} was to rebrand all of the models manufactured in the French and British factories to Talbot. Among the models inherited from Chrysler was the Scottish-built rear-wheel drive Talbot Sunbeam, the only <b>small</b> <b>car</b> in the lineup.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} a very <b>small</b> <b>car</b> park (eleven spaces) and is not {{permanently}} staffed, but it contains a ticket machine, one of an initial batch of ten installed by SPT in late 2003 and early 2004 {{as part of a}} drive to curb fare dodging, which was estimated to be costing the company £2 million a year. Both platforms are elevated and each has a wheelchair ramp. There is a connecting footbridge between the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|PSA {{decided that}} the Linwood plant would be {{unprofitable}} to maintain and should be closed, which meant an end to both the Avenger and Sunbeam model lines, further emphasizing {{the need for a}} new <b>small</b> <b>car</b> in the Talbot lineup. On the eve of the 1980s, PSA's city cars lineup consisted of models based on the veteran front-wheel drive 1972 Peugeot 104, which came in a shorter three-door and longer five-door version. Citroën rebadged the short-wheelbase 104 as the Citroën LN, and the long-wheelbase chassis formed the base of the five-door Citroën Visa.|$|E
50|$|The term is used {{along with}} other terms for <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> {{including}} subcompact in North America. The Euro NCAP calls all <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> superminis. The European Commission refers to A-segment (Utility/city class: entry level <b>small</b> passenger <b>car).</b>|$|R
50|$|A microcar is the {{smallest}} automobile classification, usually applied to very <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> (<b>smaller</b> than city <b>cars).</b> Such <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> were generally referred to as cyclecars until the 1940s. More recent models are also called bubble cars due to their bubble-shaped appearance.|$|R
50|$|Each stage gave either {{large or}} <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> a disadvantage. High {{altitude}} {{of up to}} 9,000 {{feet above sea level}} gave a disadvantage to <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> as it robbed them of power, requiring altitude correctors to the carburettor main jet to maintain the correct air/fuel mixture to the engine.|$|R
5|$|The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre. Her {{estate was}} sold and Olga {{purchased}} Knudsminde, {{a farm in}} Ballerup about 15miles (24km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds. They kept horses, in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, chickens, geese, dogs and cats. For transport they had a <b>small</b> <b>car</b> and a sledge. Tihon and Guri (age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they moved to Knudsminde) {{grew up on the}} farm. Olga ran the household {{with the help of her}} elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka"), who had come along with her from Russia. The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity working in the fields, doing household chores and painting.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam was {{originally}} conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed {{to keep the}} Linwood works running—it {{was based on the}} running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain a foothold in the growing <b>small</b> <b>car</b> market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming front-wheel drive rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code C2), dubbed C2-short, but it was cut short by the company's financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Talbot Samba {{is a city}} car {{manufactured}} by the PSA Group in the former Simca factory in Poissy, France, and marketed under the short-lived modern-day Talbot brand from 1981 to 1986. Based on the Peugeot 104, {{it was the only}} Talbot not inherited from Chrysler Europe, engineered by PSA alone. It was also the last new Talbot to be launched, and the last in production. Its demise in 1986 was effectively the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars. Launched initially as a three-door hatchback, it was also for some time the only <b>small</b> <b>car</b> available in a factory-ordered cabrio body style, and the most economical car in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Automakers {{have said}} that small, {{fuel-efficient}} vehicles cost the auto industry billions of dollars. They cost almost as much to design and market but cannot be sold {{for as much as}} larger vehicles such as SUVs, because consumers expect <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> to be inexpensive. [...] In 1999, USA Today reported <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> tend to depreciate faster than larger cars, so they are worth less in value to the consumer over time. However, 2007 Edmunds depreciation data show that some <b>small</b> <b>cars,</b> primarily premium models, are among the best in holding their value.|$|R

5|$|In {{an effort}} to make the vehicle stand out in the market against similar rivals, which {{included}} its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door hatchback. Although announced at the hatchback's launch, the first models were not available until 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who had been building open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59kilowatts (72 or 80PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin carburettors and a lined hood; the 80bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At the time of its launch it was the only cabrio <b>small</b> <b>car</b> available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA's own Citroën Visa Decapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062Samba cabriolets.|$|E

30|$|Folkhälsan [25] {{showed that}} the safety gap between large and <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> has {{decreased}} in terms of risk for fatality or permanent disability in crashes. Since 1980, the fatality rate has improved by 35  % for <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> and by 25  % for large cars. In addition, the difference in injury risk by vehicle weight in single-vehicle crashes is even smaller. Consequently, the difference between large and <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> has substantially diminished from the 1980 s. Also, Chen and Ren [10] showed that fuel-efficient vehicles can be as safe as, if not safer than, less fuel-efficient counterparts in accidents involving single-car crashes and side-impact collisions.|$|R
