5|$|In 1919, {{all three}} ships were {{decommissioned}} {{for the final}} time. Indiana was sunk in shallow water as an explosives test target a year later and sold for <b>scrap</b> in 1924. Massachusetts was scuttled {{off the coast of}} Pensacola in 1920 and used as an artillery target. The wreck was never scrapped and is now a Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. Oregon was initially preserved as a museum, but was sold for <b>scrap</b> during World War II. The scrapping was later halted and the stripped hulk was used as an ammunition barge during the battle of Guam. The hulk was finally sold for <b>scrap</b> in 1956.|$|E

40|$|Cellular solids were {{processed}} from machined <b>scraps</b> of {{a medium}} carbon steel by sintering. Mechanical properties of the cellular solids were investigated by compressive tests {{from the viewpoint of}} effects of high dislocation density in the machined <b>scraps</b> on the solid-state bonding. The flow stress in the plateau region for the cellular solid made of the as-machined <b>scraps</b> was higher than that of the one made of the annealed <b>scraps.</b> Clearly, the bonding strength between <b>scraps</b> was increased by the high dislocation density in the as-machined <b>scraps...</b>|$|R

5|$|That same day, {{the four}} men present when the {{cylinder}} was opened (two of the <b>scrap</b> collectors and two scrapyard employees) began to feel ill, experiencing headaches, nausea and vomiting. The <b>scrap</b> collectors succeeded in taking the lead cylinder apart, and took the parts to sell at the scrapyard the next day. The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the scrapyard owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the <b>scrap</b> collector to take it elsewhere, and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.|$|E
5|$|The Colossus {{class were}} deemed {{obsolete}} {{by the end}} of the war in 1918 and were reduced to reserve the following year. Hercules was sold for <b>scrap</b> in 1921, although Colossus was briefly used as a training ship. She was hulked in 1923 and sold for <b>scrap</b> five years later.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive number 1 was <b>scrapped</b> April 25, 1952. Locomotive number 2 {{was sold}} to the City of Prineville Railway and renumbered as their number 7 on July 31, 1946.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of vessel {{specific}} and market variables on the probability of <b>scrapping</b> dry bulk ships of different sizes. Using a 2012 - 2015 dataset, we find that, the probability of <b>scrapping</b> increases with age, but that the relation between vessels size and <b>scrapping</b> probability varies across the different segments. That is, the <b>scrapping</b> probability is lower for larger vessels in size segments {{where there is a}} trend towards building larger vessels. In addition, while the relation between earnings and probability of <b>scrapping</b> ships is negative, bunker prices seem to only affect the <b>scrapping</b> rate of smaller tonnage...|$|R

5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a minelayer and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza were simply sold for <b>scrap</b> in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, but otherwise did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when they too were broken up for <b>scrap.</b>|$|E

The ship served as a gunnery training ship until she was condemned in 1900. She was renamed Var in 1904 and was sold for <b>scrap</b> five years later.
