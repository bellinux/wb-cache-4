What challenges and priorities do music educators achieve from Hannah Arendt’s writings in this respect? Arendt underlines that human beings become clear to them selves and to others through interaction in the social life. In those interactive activities we need different forms of languages to try, modify, and create ideas and insights.

But let trouble come, and the farce is suspended. At the whistle of a squall these heaven-born mariners seize the tiller, and the £2,200 amateurs are knocked sprawling on the bilge.
