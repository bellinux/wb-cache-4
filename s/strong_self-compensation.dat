30|$|However, {{this kind}} of growth proposes a new method to control the N: ZnO structure. Furthermore, {{there is a big}} {{difference}} for the carrier concentration and mobility at different oxidation stages. These provide possibility to prepare p-type ZnO and to improve the concentration and mobility of the carrier. In our study, there are several reasons that lead to the n-type formation and the low carrier concentration and mobility. (1) The substrate temperature maintains at room temperature the deposition of the as-deposited Zn-N film in this study. There are a lot of donor impurities (oxygen vacancy, interstitial zinc, etc.) [42], which lead to a <b>strong</b> <b>self-compensation</b> effect after oxidation. (2) N content is too low. The lower N concentration results in the lower N substitution in the O lattice (No). This leads to the formation of n-type N: ZnO and the decrease of carrier concentration. In addition, this leads to the electrical properties of the films which are similar with those of the pure ZnO thin film (n-type) and also the lower carrier concentration [43]. Furthermore, the insulating quartz substrate is nonconductive to generate p-type semiconductors [44].|$|E
30|$|Semiconductor {{nanoparticles}} termed {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have drawn wide attention {{in recent years}} as light-emitting source for light-emitting diode (LED) applications, whose emission spectrum with narrow linewidth can be tuned by changing the energy bandgaps with the variation in QD sizes and shapes [1 – 7]. Numerous experiments present in literature on the high-performance electroluminescence (EL) properties of LEDs based on CdS [8, 9], CdSe [10, 11], and PbS [12, 13] colloidal QD thin film. However, the widespread employment of heavy metal ions, particularly Cd and Pb, are a serious hazard to human health {{as well as to the}} environment [14]. Therefore, it necessitates alternative approaches for developing QD-LEDs with the heavy-metal free composition. Nontoxic ZnO QDs with a tunable direct wide bandgap and a large exciton binding energy of 60  meV at room temperature are very promising for solid-state LED applications [15, 16]. However, the main issue, the lack of high-quality and stable p-type doing of ZnO due to the <b>strong</b> <b>self-compensation</b> effect of native point defects such as zinc interstitial or oxygen vacancy, still remained. Thus, n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs are offered as an alternative approach due to the low lattice mismatch (1.9 %), similar bandgap energy between ZnO and GaN, and the same wurtzite crystal structure. Nevertheless, the spontaneous polarization of GaN [17 – 19] and the interfacial energy barrier between ZnO QDs and GaN will necessarily reduce the performance of the device, thus resulting the low EL efficiency of the device. To improve the EL efficiency of the LEDs, localized surface plasmon (LSP) has been introduced into n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs to improve EL performance of the device. Recently, different metals like Au, Ag, and Pt have been observed to enhance the EL performance due to the enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency [20 – 26]. More recently, Lu et al. demonstrated a more than 30 -fold EL enhancement of Al nanoparticle-decorated n-ZnO nanorod/p-GaN LEDs compared with that of the bare one [27]. Liu et al. showed the devices of LSP-enhanced ZnO/SiO 2 core/shell nanorod array/p-GaN heterostructure LEDs containing decorated with Ag nanoparticles. In comparison with the bare UV LEDs, the maximum enhancement ration of the Ag nanoparticle-decorated LEDs in EL is sevenfold [28]. However, many reports are mainly focused on the LSP-enhanced LEDs based on ZnO nanorods; there has been no literature concerning the LSP-enhanced EL emission in ZnO QD-based LED structure.|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} p and {{the mobility}} mu of holes in metal-organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) GaN:Mg layers were studied by room temperature Hall-effect measurements {{as a function of}} the Mg concentration N(A) in the range 3 x 10 (exp 18) cm(exp- 3) <= N(A) <= 1 x 10 (exp 20) cm(exp - 3). The hole density first increases with increasing N(A), reaches a maximum value p(max) ~ 6 * 10 (exp 17) cm(exp - 3) at N(A) ~ 2 * 10 (exp 19) cm(exp - 3), decreases for larger N(A) values, and drops to very small values at N(A) 1 x 10 (exp 20) cm(exp - 3). The hole mobility decreases monotonically with increasing N(A). The p(N(A)) data provide <b>strong</b> evidence for <b>self-compensation,</b> i. e., for a doping driven compensation of the Mg acceptor by intrinsic donor defects. This effect becomes significant when N(A) exceeds a value of 2 x 10 (exp 19) cm(exp - 3). A semiquantitative self-compensation model involving nitrogen vacancies is developed. It accounts satisfactorily for the measured p(N(A)) dependence and suggests that self-compensation limits the hole conductivity in bulklike MOCVD GaN:Mg layers grown near 1300 K to about 1. 2 (omega cm) (exp - 1)) ...|$|R
