50|$|A {{synovial}} sarcoma (also known as: malignant <b>synovioma)</b> {{is a rare}} form of cancer which occurs primarily in the extremities of the arms or legs, often {{in close proximity to}} joint capsules and tendon sheaths. As one of the soft tissue sarcomas, {{it is one of the}} rarest forms of soft tissue cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Giant-cell tumor of the tendon sheath, {{also known}} as giant-cell <b>synovioma</b> and {{localized}} nodular tenosynovitis, is a firm lesion, measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter, and is most commonly attached to the tendons of the fingers, hands, and wrists, with a predilection for the flexor surfaces. Giant-cell tumor of tendon sheaths most often affect the wrist and fingers {{of males and females}} from the ages of 20-50 [...] These tumors are typically painless and can cause cortical erosion. Surgery to remove the tumor is a common treatment, though the tumors tend to recur.|$|E
40|$|METAPLASTIC bone {{formation}} in benign mesenchymal tumours is occasionally seen, as {{for example in}} fibromas and <b>synoviomas</b> (Evans, 1956; Willis, 1948), and in lipomas (Plaut, Salm and Truscott, 1959). Ossifying malignant neoplasms outside the skeleton have been recorded in many organs, but malignant osteogenic tumours arising primarily in the soft tissues are exceedingly rare. Fine and Stout (1956), who reviewed this subject, found only one such case amongst their own material of over 156, 000 specimens. They were able to trace 34 primary osteogenic sarcomas of soft tissue in the literature, to which they added their own and a further 11 referred cases, making a total of 46 cases. Yet in only 9 of these does the record include a post-mortem examination. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to present a complete record of such a case who was followed up closely since his first attendance. Case History The patient, a farmer aged 51 years, presented himself in February 1958 with a large, raised, fungating mass above his left iliac crest. He had been aware of i...|$|R
40|$|According to Lazarus and Marks {{there has}} been a total of 76 {{recorded}} cases of synovial sarcoma or <b>synovioma.</b> Of these cases 48. 7 per cent occurred in the knee-joint. In the series of 16 cases reported by DeSanto et al., about 50 per cent were in the knee-joint; and the three cases which they classify as of the diffuse type were all in the knee-joint. The remainder of their series of 16 cases of <b>synovioma</b> were classified as encapsulated or circumscribed. This series of cases is included in those reported by Lazarus. We are reporting a case of <b>synovioma</b> of the knee-joint which falls into the "diffuse " category. There are two reasons for reporting this case. The first is to present the history, which is of four years ' duration, and shows the difficulty that occurred in making the diagnosis in the early stage of the disease, when this patient might have had some chance of being cured by early amputation. Second, we wish to add one more case of a malignant synovial tumor to those already recorded in the literature. Case Report F. H., a 61 -year-old white female was first seen in the New Haven Hospital on June 2, 1943, complaining of pain and loss of motion in the right knee. Four years before admission she began having vague aches and pains in the right knee. She was treated symptomatically with "pills " at this time by her doctor. She had very little discomfort and apparently little swelling during the following two years. Two years before admission, following kneeling for some time while picking huckleberries, she developed a dull boring pain in the right knee which persisted in spite of pills and local heat. About one and one-half years before admission she noticed that the knee was increasing in size. During this one and one-half year period both the swelling and pain increased in severity. Two weeks before admission she had so much pain that she was forced to remain in bed...|$|E
40|$|Nine pedunculated benign synoviomata causing {{mechanical}} symptoms {{similar to}} those of a torn meniscus are described. The average age of the patients was 34. 4 years. During the period of study, 2254 meniscal lesions causing mechanical symptoms were identified, giving an incidence of one benign <b>synovioma</b> for every 250 meniscal lesions. All the lesions were removed arthroscopically with relief of symptoms. Many reports of pigmented villonodular synovitis have been published since Jaffe, Lichtenstein and Sutro first used the term in 1941. Granowitz and Mankin (1967) and Fraire and Fechner(1972) described localised lesions, and Granowitz, Dâ€™Antonio and Mankin (1976) suggested that the disorder existed as a spectrum between localised and diffuse forms. The localised form can cause mechan-ical symptoms similar to a loose body or meniscal lesion and Woods et al (1977), Flandry, Jacobson and Andrews (1986) and Lopez-Vazquez et al(1988) have each reporte...|$|E
40|$|When JAFFE e f al. (1941) {{presented}} their description of pigmented villo-nodular synovitis, bursitis, and tenosynovitis, they brought order {{to a wide}} range of tumor-like conditions of the joints, bursae, and tendons of man. These authors placed xanthoma, xanthogranuloma, xanthomatous giant-cell tumor of tendon, giant-cell tumor of tendon, <b>synovioma,</b> and benign giant-cell <b>synovioma</b> in 1 major group by emphasizing their common pathogenesis. Although proliferative in character, these conditions are now generally considered the result of an in-flammatory process. JAFFE (1958) reserved the term pigmented villonodular ienosynovifis for an un-common, diffuse form of the lesions of tendons, designating the more common type of lesion localixed nodular tenosynovitis. Although none of the lesions of this type has been reported in domesticated animals, the report by DANKS and OLAF-SON (1939) of a giant-cell sarcoma in a 7 -year-old mule was probably a case of lo-calized nodular tencsynovitis. The lesion was located on the anterior surface of the right stifle and did not cause lameness. The authors considered the lesion to Ee a sarcoma but malignancy was not unequivocably established. The present com-munication describes 2 cases of localized nodular tenosynovitis in the horse. Case Histories Case 1. In June 1964, a mass was surgically excised from the subcutis of the posterolateral region of the right stifle of an 18 -year-old, palomino, cross-bred Arabian-Thoroughbred stallion. The lesion had been present for 2 months and caused no apparent evidence of pain or impaired movement. Repeated attempts to obtain information on recurrence or non-recurrence have been unsuccessful. Case 2. In August 1962, a nodular mass was surgically excised from the sub-cutis at the point of the right shoulder of an 8 -year-old, hay, Thoroughbred stal-lion. The lesion had been present for l year, increasing slowly in size without pro-Fig. I. Small round to fusiform cells and multinucleated giant cells lying in a loose fibrillary matrix.

40|$|The term <b>synovioma</b> {{was coined}} by Smith in 1927, {{and later in}} 1936 Knox {{suggested}} the name synovial sarcoma. It occurs primarily in the paraarticular regions, usually in close association with tendon sheaths, bursae, and joint capsules. On rare occasions it {{may be seen in}} areas without any apparent relationship to synovial structures as in parapharyngeal region or the abdominal cavity. The first description of synovial sarcoma {{in the head and neck}} region was by Pack and Ariel in 1950. The majority of these tumors seem to take origin from paravertebral connective tissue spaces and manifest as solitary retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal masses near the carotid bifurcation. Synovial sarcoma has been reported in soft palate, tongue, maxillofacial region, angle of mandible, sternoclavicular region, scapular region, and the esophagus. We report a case of 28 -year-old male patient with synovial sarcoma in mandibular region with biphasic pattern...|$|E
40|$|THIS paper records a {{group of}} four tumours, all rapidly fatal, which {{occurred}} among schoolgirls in a Monmouthshire town during the period January, 1961 to June, 1962. Two of the cases were primary tumours of bone, the histology in the others having initially been given as <b>synovioma</b> and subsequently as undifferentiated sarcoma. The group is unusual because these types of cancer are comparatively rare among females of this age and furthermore, three of the cases were closely associated as friends and pupils attending the same school. The fourth case was a pupil at a different school in the neighbourhood but had earlier been a classmate and associated {{with one of the}} other three. In 1964, some months after the decease of the fourth subject and at the invitation of the Welsh Board of Health, investigations were commenced into the histories, environmental backgrounds, habits and activities of the cases in a search for factors common to them all. The following is a summary of the considerable data collected during the investigations...|$|E

Methods: This was a retrospective review of 62 patients who had resection of retrorectal tumors between 2002 and 2010. Results: All patients {{in this study were}} treated by excision of the retrorectal tumors. Surgical approach included transsacral approach (52 cases), transabdominal approach (eight cases), and combined approach (two cases). A total of 48 benign lesions (77. 4 %) and 14 malignant lesions (22. 6 %) were confirmed by histological examination. The 48 benign cases included dermoid cysts (17 cases), simple cysts (eight cases), teratomas (eight cases), neurofibromas (eight cases), fibrolipomas (four cases), neurilemmomas (two cases), and <b>synovioma</b> (one case). The 14 malignant cases included lymphomas (four cases), malignant teratomas (three cases), fibrosarcomas (two cases), interstitialomas (four cases) and malignant mesothelioma (one case). Complications occurred in 14. 5 % of patients and included intraoperative bleeding (three cases), rectal injury (three cases), and presacral infection (three cases). Conclusion: Primary retrorectal tumors are very rare. Successful treatment of these tumors requires extensive knowledge of pelvic anatomy and expertise in pelvic surgery.

40|$|THE nosological {{position}} of that lesion occurring in and about joint surfaces and designated variously as " xanthoma of the tendon sheath ", " localized villonodular synovitis ", " benign giant cell <b>synovioma</b> ", and " giant cell tumor of tendon sheath " remains disputed. The lesion {{consists of a}} proliferation of polyhedral and spindle cells in a fibrous stroma, exhibiting a capacity for phagocytosis of hemosiderin and lipid and a proclivity to form multinucleated giant cells. Opinions differ as to its pathogenesis and biological potential, the real schism occurring in regard {{to whether or not}} it is a neoplastic or a reactive process. Some writers (Jaffe, 1958; Jaffe, Lichtenstein and Sutro, 1941) point to the benign behaviour and phagocytic capacity of the component cells in human material, as indicative of a reactive process, while others, noting the rare tendency to recurrence following excision and the occasional occurrence of superficial erosion of adjacent bone (Fletcher and Horn, 1951), have considered it to be a neoplasm with an unpredictable degree of malignant potential. The lesion is not uncommon in human material, but very few well documented cases have been described in domestic animals (Cotchin, 1954; Nielsen, 1952). During a study of tumors in the Syrian hamster (Kirkman, 1957; 1962; Kirkman and Algard, in press) instances of giant cell tumor arising in dense connective tissue around metacarpal joints were encountered. In a preliminary report of hamster tumors (Kirkman, 1962) these were listed, but not discussed, as synoviomas, with an incidence of 0 03 % in 7200 hamsters. Both were transplantable, but only one had metastasized (lungs and kidneys). Since then a third extraskeletal giant cell neoplasm, of unknown origin, has been observed in what was assumed to be an enlarged, discolored, bronchial lymph node. These three lesions resembled anatomically the giant cell tumors of tendon sheath occurring in humans and it was thought that an account of them might be of value in elucidating the nature of that perplexing lesion...|$|E
40|$|Invasion {{and erosion}} of bone in nodular {{synovitis}} (histiocytic xanthomatous granuloma, xanthoma, giant-cell tumour, benign <b>synovioma)</b> are found fairly frequently in circumscribed lesions of the tendon sheaths of hands and feet. Fletcher and Horn (1951) in particular {{called attention to}} this. Bone involvement in diffuse forms, namely â€œ pigmented villonodular synovitis, bursitis and tenosynovitis â€œ (Jaffe, Lichtenstein and Sutro 1941) are much less common. The clinical and pathological features of this condition are well known. Mandl (1928) reported a similar condition {{under the name of}} â€œ haemorrhagic chronic villous synovitis â€œ: at a second operation abundant blood pigment and extensive xanthomatous areas were found. One of us (F. S.) reported another patient, also operated upon by Mandl, in 1937, under the same denomination (Schajowicz 1937). In 1963 Schajowicz and Slullitel presented before the Argentine Orthopaedic Society a case of pigmented villonodular synovitis affecting the shoulder with invasion of the humerus and scapula. Reviewing the literature and material filed with the Latin-American Register of Bone Pathology, they found fifty-two cases with invasion of one or more bones adjacent to the affected joint, including twelve cases studied in the laboratory of the Register. The hip, ankle and knee were the joints most commonly affected. On only two occasions did the condition affect the wrist (Lewis 1955) and carpus (Smith and Pugh 1962). Following our paper, Chung and Janes (1965) reported four cases of affection of the hip. Including the case mentioned in this report we have observed six new cases of bone invasion among twenty-seven cases of pigmented villonodular synovitis studied in our laboratory. For this reason {{we do not believe that}} this complication of pigmented villonodular synovitis is so rare as appears from the few cases published. The case reported here is of special interest because of the severity of the invasion of the lower end of the radius and because of the size of the lesion. These features raised the possibility that the lesion might be a giant-cell tumour of bone with extensive invasion of the neighbouring soft tissues and bones and perhaps with malignant change...|$|E
