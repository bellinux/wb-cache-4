40|$|AbstractA {{mechanical}} clinching using {{counter pressure}} of a <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> {{was developed to}} join the galvanised ultra-high strength steel sheets having low ductility. In the proposed process, the interlock was increased by the increment of metal flow with the counter pressure of <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> in the die cavity. The ultra-high strength steel sheets having 45 % of reduction area {{was used in the}} mechanical clinching. The effect of the shape of <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> on the deforming behaviour of the sheets was investigated. The joinability was improved under the appropriate shape of <b>rubber</b> <b>ring,</b> and then the sheets were successfully joined with the counter pressure. The maximum static load and the fatigue limit of the joined sheets were measured in the tension-shearing and cross-tension tests. It was effective for the improvement of joinability in the mechanical clinching of ultra-high strength steel sheets to use the counter pressure of the <b>rubber</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

Seventy calves, aged 21 - 28 days, were control handled (20) or castrated using the Burdizzo (25) or <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> technique (25). Either 10 mL lidocaine or NaCl were distributed in both spermatic cords and the scrotal neck. The plasma cortisol response was recorded for 72 h, and behavioural and clinical traits monitored over a three month period. Local anaesthesia reduced the level of indicators of acute pain after both the Burdizzo and <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> techniques. It did not, however, result in a totally painless castration. As there was evidence of chronic pain lasting for several weeks after <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> castration, the Burdizzo method is judged to be preferable to the <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> technique...|$|R

40|$|To assess short- and {{long-term}} effects of bloodless castration methods with and without local anaesthesia, behavioural and cortisol responses of lambs were used as indicators of pain and distress. Seventy lambs, aged 2 - 7 days, were control-handled or castrated by Burdizzo or <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> methods with and without local anaesthesia. Either 5 mL of diluted lidocaine (4 mg/kg) or physiological sodium chloride solution was distributed in both spermatic cords and the scrotal neck. The serum cortisol response was monitored for 48 h, and behavioural and clinical traits were followed for three months. Local anaesthesia tended to reduce behavioural and cortisol responses after Burdizzo castration and provided a significant reduction after <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> castration.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different methods of rubber-ring castration on acute and chronic pain in calves. Sixty-three 4 - 6 week-old calves were randomly and sequentially allocated to one of five groups: Group RR (traditional <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> castration); group BRR (combination of one <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> with Burdizzo); group Rcut (one <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> applied with the scrotal tissue and <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> removed on day 9); group 3 RR (three <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> placed one above the other around the scrotal neck); and group CO (controls; sham-castrated). All calves received 0. 2 mL/kg bodyweight lidocaine 2 %, injected into the spermatic cords and around the scrotal neck 15 min before castration. The presence of acute and chronic pain was assessed using plasma cortisol concentrations, response to palpation of scrotal area, time from castration until complete wound healing, and behavioural signs. Calves of group 3 RR showed severe swelling and inflammation, and licking of the scrotal area occurred significantly more often than in groups Rcut and CO. Technique 3 RR was discontinued for welfare reasons before the end of the study. All castration groups had significantly more pain upon palpation than calves of group CO, but palpation elicited markedly less pain in group Rcut than in the other castration groups. The most rapid healing time and shortest duration of chronic pain after castration was achieved in group Rcut. For welfare reasons, the Rcut technique should be considered as a valuable alternative to traditional <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> castration of calves at 4 - 6 weeks of age...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} part of a {{cross-sectional}} project on freestall housing, and the aim was to compare locomotion and claw disorders in freestall dairy cattle herds with slatted concrete, solid concrete, or <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> flooring in the alleys. The final population for studying claw disorders consisted of 66 dairy herds with 2, 709 dry or lactating cows, whereas the population for studying locomotion consisted of 54 herds with 2, 216 cows. All herds used Norwegian Red as the main breed. The herds were visited by 15 trained claw trimmers one time during the period from the beginning of February to summer let-out onto pasture in 2008. The trimmers assessed locomotion scores (LocS) of all cows before trimming. At trimming, claw disorders were diagnosed and recorded in the Norwegian Claw Health Card. Estimates describing locomotion and claw disorders in the hind feet were identified by use of multivariable models fit with LocS and each claw disorder as dependent variables, respectively. Herd nested within claw trimmer was included in the model as random effects. The odds ratio (OR) of having LocS > 2 and LocS > 3 was 1. 9 and 2. 1, respectively, on slatted concrete compared with solid concrete. Fewer cases of dermatitis were found on slatted than solid concrete (OR= 0. 70) and a tendency was observed for fewer heel horn erosions on slatted concrete than <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> (OR= 0. 47). Hemorrhages of the white line and sole were more prevalent in herds housed on slatted and solid concrete than in those housed on <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> (OR= 2. 6 and OR= 2. 1, respectively). White line fissures were also more prevalent in herds housed on slatted and solid concrete than in those housed on <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> (OR= 2. 1 and OR= 2. 0, respectively). Double soles were more prevalent on solid concrete than <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> (OR= 4. 4). However, sole ulcers were less prevalent in herds with slatted and solid concrete than <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> (OR= 0. 39 and OR= 0. 53, respectively). Fewer corkscrewed claws were found on slatted concrete than both <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> and <b>solid</b> concrete (OR= 0. 60 and OR= 0. 44, respectively). More white line crossing fissures were recorded on slatted and solid concrete than <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> (OR= 3. 6 and OR= 3. 1, respectively). This shows that <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> flooring was favorable when most laminitis-related lesions were considered, whereas slatted concrete was favorable for infectious claw lesions and corkscrewed claws but not for locomotion...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft pulley. This driving pulley is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> and an inertia steel ring with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other <b>rubber</b> <b>ring.</b> The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the <b>rubber</b> <b>ring.</b> These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models. An experimental characterization method is presented and discussed for {{the determination of the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of the <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> used in such pulley.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{measures of}} 31 red and 39 fallow deer yearlings prior to, during and following application of <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> to prevent antler growth were determined. Animals were mechanically or manually restrained and treated {{according to their}} random allocation {{to one of the}} following groups: control (C), local anaesthesia only(LC), local anaesthesia and <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> application (LR), <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> application only(R). In a further field trial 45 yearling red deer stags and 84 yearling fallow bucks were randomly allocated to control or <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> application. In both studies the development of the pedicle/antler post treatment was examined at intervals to investigate the percentage of loss of pedicle/antler due to the treatment and to detect possible side effects of the treatment. In red deer during the first three hours post treatment a significant increase in walking, standing and feeding and a decrease in lying were seen in the R group. Twenty minutes after treatment the R group showed a significantly higher frequency of scratching. In fallow deer a significant increase in frequency of ear flicks was observed in the R group until six hours post treatment. Other activities (walking,standing, lying) varied significantly at some time periods but no consistent patterns were observed. In both species a substantial reduction of the pedicle/antler could be observed two to four weeks after application of <b>rubber</b> <b>rings.</b> However, the loss of distal parts of the pedicle/antler varied in percentage and time until the loss. A rate of 38 - 100 % regrowth occurred in the first study in fallow and red deer, respectively. In red deer the application of <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> stopped further antler growth in 36 of 37 stags thirty days after treatment. The loss of pedicle/antler occurred in 60 - 66. 7 %. In fallow deer 93 % pedicle/antler loss occurred in bucks. A rate of 10 % regrowth occurred. No infections or other untoward side effects of the treatment were seen...|$|R

40|$|Seventy male lambs over 10 {{weeks of}} age were {{castrated}} using Burdizzo, <b>rubber</b> <b>rings,</b> or surgery {{to assess the}} acute and long-term effects of castration. All castrations were performed under local anaesthesia. The surgically castrated lambs were additionally sedated with xylazine and the sedation reversed with tolazoline. The frequency of abnormal postures and immediate behavioural responses indicated that surgically castrated lambs were most distressed; the lambs castrated using Burdizzo and <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> were not dissimilar {{to those of the}} control group. Between 1. 5 and 9 h after castration, signs of pain and distress were at a lower level in lambs anaesthetised with bupivacaine compared with those treated with lidocaine.
