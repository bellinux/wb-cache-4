5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E

5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White {{is no longer}} able to bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack.

5|$|The {{computational}} {{efficiency of}} Euclid's algorithm {{has been studied}} thoroughly. This efficiency can be described {{by the number of}} division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of division steps on input (u, v) is bounded by v; later he improved this to v/2 +2. Later, in 1841, P. J. E. Finck <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of division steps is at most 2log2v+1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial {{in the size of the}} input. Émile Léger, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Finck's analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, who <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number h of base-10 digits of the smaller numberb.|$|E
