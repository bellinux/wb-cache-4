40|$|Along {{with its}} wider reach in society, {{in the form}} of both {{mobility}} and relatively affordable access, the internet has transformed the world we live in, serving as bedrock for electronic commerce and other digital and communication services. It has {{become an integral part of}} the personal, professional, and economic spheres of our daily life. Global organisations, whether official, commercial, or social, are relying on it ever more to function, bringing an increasing need for a <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The pervasive nature of the internet, one major factor behind its success, is also proving to be its main threat.

Thus, if Islamic principles are {{to be applied to}} e-commerce, where credit card transactions are the norm, a new and <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> payment process is required. In this paper we present a method for <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> Murabaha transactions. After introducing the notion of Murabaha sale within the Islamic banking framework, we describe a general model for a <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> Murabaha transaction, and then consider the associated security risks. Security requirements are then identified for a <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> Murabaha transaction. We then present the <b>Secure</b> <b>Electronic</b> Murabaha Transaction (SEMT), designed to address the identified security requirements. Finally, we analyse how the proposed protocol matches the identified security requirements. 1...|$|R
