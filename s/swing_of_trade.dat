These terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> represent one <b>of</b> the key determinants of the real exchange rates of these economies. By estimating long-term equilibrium exchange rates we can gauge their impact for oil exporters and for exporters of other commodities. We then evaluate currency ‘misalignments’ as the discrepancies between the observed real exchange rates and their equilibrium values. Can these misalignments themselves be explained? In countries whose currencies are anchored to the dollar or to the euro, the misalignments are shown {{to depend on the}} behaviour of the anchor currency. When the anchor currency appreciates, the anchored currencies tend to be overvalued; when it depreciates, their undervaluation is likely. EXCHANGE RATE;INTERNATIONAL TRADE;EXCHANGE RATE POLICY...|$|R

40|$|As {{the process}} of global {{integration}} evolves, developing economies {{become more and more}} dependent upon the <b>swings</b> <b>of</b> international markets. Changes in the external environment and economic policy have {{played a major role in}} determining the performance of these economies. Terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> shocks represent one of the most important issues related to recent developments in low and middle income countries, whose effects have been widely studied in the economic literature. However, attention has always been focused on the national economies, without any consideration of the ability of these economies to absorb these shocks through interregional interactions. In this paper we address this issue using an bottom-up interregional CGE model. It is shown that the degree of integration of the national economies helps to absorb external shocks, decreasing the adverse impacts of negative terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> shocks as the economy becomes more integrated. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} an ideological stance {{that should have}} favored free trade, the <b>trade</b> {{policies}} <b>of</b> the Reagan years were a mixture <b>of</b> both free <b>trade</b> and protection that were not {{all that different from}} those of preceding administrations.

After 1991, the volume, {{direction}} and destination <b>of</b> India's <b>trade</b> were influenced by ASEAN neighbours. Considering the analysis period from 1971 to 2010 to study Indo-ASEAN trade, the Hausman test favoured the fixed effects and random effects. The core gravity model that we had derived helped us to deduce that distance rather than economic size <b>of</b> the <b>trading</b> partner has dominated India's direction <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> The augmented gravity model, of Frankel, was used to analyse India's bilateral external relations with contiguous countries and with landlocked countries. The extended analysis included population and per capita income to observe the significance of size and distance. An important research gap regarding analysis of the uniformity pattern <b>of</b> Indo-ASEAN <b>trade</b> exists and we have used both the fluctuation and swing indices to infer that a systematic pattern emerges whereby the expected GDP <b>swings</b> <b>of</b> India matches with her observed GDP swings-the recurrent uniformity is present with a lag period of two years in post liberalisation period...|$|R
