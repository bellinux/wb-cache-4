5000|$|Oneirophrenia (from the Greek words [...] "" [...] (oneiros, [...] "dream") and [...] "" [...] (phrenos, [...] "mind")) is a hallucinatory, dream-like state {{caused by}} <b>several</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> {{prolonged}} sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, or drugs (such as ibogaine). Oneirophrenia is often confused with an acute case of schizophrenia {{due to the}} onset of hallucinations. [...] The severity of this condition can range from derealization to complete hallucinations and delusions. Oneirophrenia was described {{for the first time}} in the 1950s but was studied more in the 1960s. Although it is still cited in diagnostic manuals of psychiatry, such as DSM-IV and in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), oneirophrenia as a separate entity is out of fashion nowadays.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of {{compounds}} {{often cited as}} [...] "dirty drugs" [...] include chlorpromazine, dextromethorphan and ibogaine, all of which bind to multiple receptors or influence multiple receptor systems. There may be instances of advantages to drugs that exhibit multi-receptor activity such as the anti-addictive drug ibogaine that acts within {{a broad range of}} neurohormonal systems where activity is also exhibited by drugs commonly associated with addiction including opioids, nicotine, and alcohol. Similarly chlorpromazine is primarily used as an antipsychotic, but its strong serotonin receptor blocking effects make it useful for treating serotonergic crisis such as serotonin syndrome. Dextromethorphan for its part is widely used as a cough medication, but its other actions have led to trials for <b>several</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> its use as an adjunct to analgesia, and a potential anti-addictive drug, as well as its occasional recreational use as a dissociative.|$|E

50|$|Regardless of the {{underlying}} condition, the loss of intestinal function does not necessarily necessitate a transplant. <b>Several</b> <b>conditions,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> necrotizing enterocolitis or volvulus, may be adequately resolved by other surgical and nonsurgical treatments, especially if SBS never develops. An individual can obtain nutrients intravenously through PN, bypassing food consumption entirely and its subsequent digestion. Long-term survival with SBS and without PN is possible with enteral nutrition, but this is inadequate for many patients as {{it depends on the}} remaining intestine's ability to adapt and increase its absorptive capacity. Although more complicated and expensive to perform, any person may receive PN. Although PN can meet all energy, fluid, and nutrient needs and can be performed at home, quality of life can be significantly decreased. On average, PN takes 10 to 16 hours to administer but can take up to 24. Over this time frame, daily life can be significantly hindered as a consequence of attachment to the IV pump. Over long periods of time, PN can lead to numerous health conditions, including severe dehydration, catheter-related infections, and liver disease. PN-associated liver disease strikes up to 50% of patients within 5-7 years, correlated with a mortality rate of 2-50%.|$|E
50|$|Many {{human and}} animal studies have {{determined}} that RNA editing of the Q/R site in GluR2 pre-mRNA is necessary for normal brain function. Defective editing {{has been linked to}} <b>several</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS effects 1 in 2000 people, usually fatal in 1-5 years, with onset in the majority of cases being sporadic and minority being familial. With these conditions motor neurons degenerate leading to eventual paralysis and respiratory failure. Glutamate excitotoxicity is known to contribute to the spread of the sporadic condition. Glutamate levels are increased up 40%, suggesting that activation of glutamate receptors could be the reason for this causing increase Ca influx and then neuronal death. Since decrease nor loss of editing at Q/R site would lead to increase in calcium permeability. In diseased motor neurons editing levels of Glur 2 (62-100%) at this site was discovered to be reduced.Abnormal editing is thought to be specific for this condition, as editing levels have not been found to be decreased in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Q/R editing is not the only mechanism involved, as editing occurs only in spinal motor neurons not in upper spinal neurons. Also, it is unknown whether editing dysregulation is involved in the initiation of the condition, or whether it occurs during pathogenesis.|$|E
