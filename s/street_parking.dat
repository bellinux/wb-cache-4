5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use of the car parks, more local <b>street</b> <b>parking</b> and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the <b>street</b> <b>parking</b> spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the well-connected {{owners of}} Cross Sound Ferry {{proposed}} a footbridge from the Water <b>Street</b> <b>parking</b> garage to the ferry slips so that ferry passengers {{would not have}} to cross Water Street and the tracks at grade. Amtrak saw the project as an opportunity to build a new elevated station nearby and contributed $1 million to the design of the bridge. However, Amtrak reversed course in 1999 and decided to keep using Union Station; in 2001, the railroad declined to fund the footbridge. Also in 2001, Amtrak built a pair of high-level platforms to serve the new Acela Express high-speed service, thus adapting the 19th-century station for 21st-century usage. Catenary wires were installed over the tracks as part of the introduction of the Acela. Later that year or early in 2002, the 1899-built freight house {{on the east side of}} the tracks was torn down as part of redevelopment sponsored by the New London Development Corporation. The freight house had previously been used by Amtrak maintenance-of-way crews, and before that by the Fishers Island Ferry District.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. The lots adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail parking lot is available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use <b>street</b> <b>parking</b> and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and streetscape improvements for pedestrian access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a publicly owned pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use the federal funds).|$|E

25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where sight {{distance}} is insufficient. The US MUTCD requires Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping sight distance at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict sight distance. However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use ordinary care regarding conditions readily apparent to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower functional classification. The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be readily apparent to a driver even when a specific access point is not. For this reason, full corner sight distance is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and <b>street</b> <b>parking</b> is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
