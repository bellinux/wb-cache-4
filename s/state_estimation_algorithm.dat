40|$|This paper {{describes}} a minimax state estimation approach for linear Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE) with uncertain parameters. The approach addresses continuous-time DAE with non-stationary rectangular matrices and uncertain bounded deterministic input. An observation’s noise {{is supposed to}} be random with zero mean and unknown bounded correlation function. Main results are a Generalized Kalman Duality (GKD) principle and sub-optimal minimax <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>algorithm.</b> GKD is derived by means of Young-Fenhel duality theorem. GKD proves that the minimax estimate coincides with a solution to a Dual Control Problem (DCP) with DAE constraints. The latter is ill-posed and, therefore, the DCP is solved by means of Tikhonov regularization approach resulting a sub-optimal <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>algorithm</b> in the form of filter.

Utilizing a residual signal vector generated from the difference between the estimated and measured current states of a process, disturbances are detected and identified with statistical hypothesis testing. Since the hypothesis testing utilizes the inherent noise on the signals to obtain a conclusion and the <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>algorithm</b> requires only a majority of the sensors to be functioning to ascertain the current state, this technique has proven to be quite robust and fault-tolerant.

Discusses the {{practical}} management of electrical networks, no perfect monitoring of an {{electrical power system}} state is available, either because it is expensive or technically unfeasible due to the poor quality of the available measurements in the control centre.

40|$|When {{tracking}} {{a target}} particle that is interacting with nearest neighbors in a known way, positional {{data of the}} neighbors {{can be used to}} improve the state estimate. Effects of the accuracy of such positional data on the target track accuracy are investigated in this paper, in the context of dusty plasmas. In kinematic simulations, notable improvement in the target track accuracy was found when including all nearest neighbors in the state estimation filter and tracking algorithm, whereas the track accuracy was not significantly improved by higher-accuracy measurement techniques. The <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>algorithm,</b> involving an extended Kalman filter, was shown to either remove or significantly reduce errors due to "pixel locking". It is concluded that the significant extra complexity and computational expense to achieve these relatively small improvements are likely to be unwarranted for many situations.

40|$|As {{centralized}} <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>algorithms</b> for {{formation flying}} spacecraft would suffer from high computational burdens when {{the scale of}} the formation increases, it is necessary to develop decentralized algorithms. To the state of the art, most decentralized algorithms for formation flying are derived from centralized EKF by simplification and decoupling, rendering suboptimal estimations. In this paper, typical decentralized <b>state</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>algorithms</b> are reviewed, and a new scheme for decentralized algorithms is proposed. In the new solution, the system is modeled as a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). A probabilistic graphical method named junction tree (JT) is used to analyze the hidden distributed structure of the DBNs. Inference on JT is a decentralized form of centralized Bayesian estimation (BE), which is a modularized three-step procedure of receiving messages, collecting evidences, and generating messages. As KF is a special case of BE, the new solution based on JT is equivalent in precision to centralized KF in theory. A cooperative navigation example of a three-satellite formation is used to test the decentralized algorithms. Simulation results indicate that JT has the best precision among all current decentralized algorithms...|$|R
