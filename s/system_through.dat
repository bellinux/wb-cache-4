The storm turned {{to the west and}} crossed the northern Gulf of Tonkin, hitting northern Vietnam and dissipating on August20. Another storm was first detected northeast of Luzon on August21. A northwest trajectory brought the <b>system</b> <b>through</b> the Ryukyu Islands, and the storm ultimately dissipated over eastern China on August24, having moved ashore near Wenzhou.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice <b>system</b> <b>through</b> the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune <b>system</b> <b>through</b> increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E

5|$|The King's {{contributed to}} the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and {{assisted}} in defensive actions as the new year neared. Acute manpower shortages in the BEF on the Western Front left many divisions understrength {{and so it was}} decided to adopt a nine-battalion <b>system</b> <b>through</b> amalgamations and disbandments. The 5th, 8th, 9th, and 10th King's integrated with their second-line, while hundreds of their men were distributed to other King's battalions.

5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous <b>system</b> <b>through</b> holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court <b>system</b> <b>through</b> the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison <b>system</b> <b>through</b> strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking <b>system.</b> <b>Through</b> his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit <b>system</b> <b>through</b> the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith <b>System</b> <b>through</b> his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E

5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the <b>system</b> <b>through</b> a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1973, it {{used oil}} {{money to fund}} social welfare programs, which led to house-building {{projects}} and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace the shanty towns created by Libya's growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50% more hospitals than it had in 1968, {{while the number of}} doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and trachoma and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education <b>system.</b> <b>Through</b> these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya {{believed}} in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities. These deities needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices. At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would act as go-betweens for their living descendants in dealings with the denizens of the supernatural realm. The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural realm were shamans. Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan (oracular) priests. Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses. As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the general concepts held by Maya society, and developed them into religious cults that justified their right to rule. In the Late Preclassic, the pinnacle of this process was the combination of ultimate political and religious power in the divine king, the k'uhul ajaw. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the belief <b>system</b> <b>through</b> archaeology, some indicators of ritual practice do leave physical traces. These include dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials and their associated funerary offerings. In addition, Maya art, architecture, and writing all assist in the reconstruction of ancient Maya beliefs; these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.|$|E

5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground <b>system</b> <b>through</b> a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E

5|$|Sales of the Master System {{have been}} {{estimated}} at 13 million units, not including recent Brazil sales, {{in contrast to}} the 62 million units sold by its chief competitor, the Famicom. Sega would close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis, which sold 30.75 million consoles compared with the 49 million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles sold by Nintendo. The Master System saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America. In 1989, the Sega Master System was listed in the top 20 products of NPD Group's Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service. However, the Electronic Gaming Monthly 1992 Buyer's Guide indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality titles for the Master System. In 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases. According to Bill Pearse of Playthings, the NES gained an advantage over the Master <b>System</b> <b>through</b> the use of better software and stronger character identification.|$|E
