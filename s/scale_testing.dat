500|$|Following the {{successful}} tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large <b>scale</b> <b>testing</b> in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The minelayer Ord laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable. [...] The USS O'Brien was fitted with receiving equipment {{and attempted to}} follow the cable out of the Channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where {{a break in the}} cable prevented the signal from continuing. [...] The break in the cable was repaired, but {{over the course of the}} winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable. [...] Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable. [...] The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the CUR {{committee}} 159 B {{has been working on}} the new Dutch Design Guideline for the design of piled embankments. To validate the guideline several field tests have been performed. From the field measurements is concluded that the design method is very conservative. Improving the design guideline will reduce the construction costs. To understand the physical behaviour of the piled embankment and to validate the theory, experimental <b>scale</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed. During these tests the load distribution, deformation and strains were measured. The results of the <b>scale</b> <b>tests</b> are analysed and published. To improve the understanding of the phenomenon arching and where possible, to confirm the observed load distributions and displacements, numerical analysis of the <b>scale</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed and reported in this thesis. The numerical analysis of the <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> is performed with Plaxis 3 D Tunnel version 2. 4 (Plaxis). The geometry of the Plaxis model is one quarter of the geometry of the <b>scale</b> <b>test.</b> This reduces the amount of elements and therefore the calculation time. In the <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> circular piles are applied. Circular geometry cannot be modelled in Plaxis, therefore the circular pile is mathematically converted to a square pile. The sand and granular material are modelled with Mohr Coulomb (MC) model and Hardening Soil (HS) model. The <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> is driven by applying top load and by drainage of the foam cushion. The top load is modelled as the measured equally distributed load on the embankment. To model the drainage of the foam cushion, the measured water pressure is assigned to the subsoil clusters in Plaxis by a water pressure head. From the Plaxis results can be concluded that arching is immediately found after the first drainage of the foam cushion. Increasing the top load and drainage of the foam cushion in Plaxis results in an increase of loads transferred to the pile by arching and GR, thus results in improvement of arching. The by Plaxis calculated tensile forces in the GR are concentrated in ‘tensile strips’ that lie on top and between adjacent piles. The largest displacement of the GR is found at the middle of four piles. The results of the Plaxis calculations are compared to the <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> results. The total load on the pile and water pressure in the foam cushion found with Plaxis are corresponding with the <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> results. During {{the first part of the}} test, the load distribution shows similar results as the measured load distribution. During the second part of the test the load transferred to the pile by arching is overestimated and the load transferred to the pile by the GR is underestimated. The displacement of the geosynthetic reinforcement calculated with Plaxis is underestimated compared to the <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> results. In general the results of the HS model are better than the MC model. By varying a number of parameters in the model, possible causes for the underestimated displacement are investigated. This research concludes that the stiffness of the foam cushion and the water pressure in the foam cushion does not have influence on the GR displacement. The vertical effective stresses are concentrated on and directly next to the pile and are relatively small between the piles. The internal friction angle does have a large influence on the geosynthetic reinforcement displacement, because when the internal friction angle is decreased, the arch decreases and the settlements increase. However, the measured geosynthetic reinforcement displacement from the <b>scale</b> <b>test</b> is still not found in the numerical results calculated in Plaxis.
