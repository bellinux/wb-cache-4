40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate potential diet segregation in <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> by measuring coefficient of variation (CV) and mean salt concentration. The facility was a 1500 -head gestation barn with nine <b>feed</b> <b>lines,</b> transected by a central <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> that conveyed <b>feed</b> from one of two bulk bins. Quantab® chloride titrators were {{used to analyze the}} chloride concentration (salt) from samples collected at pre-determined <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> locations at various distances from the bulk bins. Thirty samples were collected from three <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> (row 1, 5, and 9), ten samples were collected from drop boxes close to the central <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> (location 1), ten samples were collected from a central location within the row (location 2), and ten samples were collected from the furthest end of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> (location 3). Samples of approximately 50 g were collected directly from the feed drop. The sample collection procedure was repeated four times. After the first two sample collections, a bin agitator was added to the bulk bin. There was a <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> × distance (within the <b>feed</b> <b>line)</b> × agitator interaction (P > 0. 02) observed for CV. The addition of the bin agitator improved the CV in <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 1 and 5, with no improvement observed in <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 9. The CV observed before the addition of the agitator averaged 17. 6, 18. 6, and 14. 3 % for <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> 1, 5, and 9, respectively, and the CV observed after the addition of the agitator averaged 13. 6, 16, and 14 % for <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 1, 5, and 9 respectively. Within all <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> (rows), distance CV was higher at locations 1 (17. 3 %) and 3 (17. 6 %), compared with CV at location 2 (15. 6 %) before the addition of the agitator, but was lower at locations 1 (14. 3 %) and 3 (13. 0 %), compared with CV at location 2 (15. 6 %) after the addition of the agitator. There was a mean-salt concentration effect (P< 0. 0001) observed for <b>feed</b> <b>line.</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>lines</b> 1 and 5 were similar in mean salt concentration, whereas <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> 9 consistently had the highest salt concentration.

50|$|Matching the {{impedance}} of {{the antenna}} to {{the impedance of}} the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an antenna tuner, an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> and the antenna allows for the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> to one preferred by the transmitter.

As a planar discontinuity is analyzed {{with respect to}} the planes of impressed sources, each individual nonuniform <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> is modeled as a general error box relying on the perfect short- and open-circuit standards. By calibrating out all the error boxes associated with all the nonuniform <b>feed</b> <b>lines,</b> the core discontinuity section can be deembedded based on the cascaded network theorem. Since each individual <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> is modeled as a unified two-port circuit instead of a transmission line section, the presented technique provides an advantageous feature in deembedding various planar circuits that may be fed by nonuniform lines, as met in the high-density and high-integrated circuits. After theoretical description is made on the deembedding procedure, a microstrip-line slit discontinuity with varied <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> is numerically characterized.

The characteristics parameters like dielectric constant (), thickness of the substrate (h) and antenna’s dominant-mode resonant frequency () is transformed into the patch dimensions that is length (l) and width (w) of the microstrip patch. The rectangular microstrip patch antenna with modified <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> are designed & simulated for wireless communication application that works at 2. 4 GHz. The microstrip <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> for microstrip patch antenna plays an important role to determine the return loss, gain & its radiation pattern.

40|$|For {{the next}} {{generation}} Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), the use of advanced composite materials is highly desirable and {{critical to the success}} of the mission. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been working with the aerospace industry for many years to develop and demonstrate the cryogenic composite propellant tanks and <b>feed</b> <b>lines</b> technologies. A 50. 8 -mm diameter composite <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> for the Clipper Graham (DCY. A) was developed and tested. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the LH 2 permeability, composite to composite and metal joints, as well as composite flange interface of the composite <b>feed</b> <b>line.</b> Stress analysis and permeability testing have been performed on this article. Recently, a larger composite <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> design is being investigated and developed at MSFC for potential use in future RLV. The diameter of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> is 203 mm and the overall length is approximately 2. 2 meters. This one piece unlined <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> consists of three straight tubular sections joined by two 90 degree elbows. The material chosen is IM 7 / 977 - 3 prepreg fabric. The lay-up pattern is [0 / 90, plus or minus 45]s and is built up to 18 plies to the flanges at both ends. A preliminary stress analysis has been conducted to identify potential critical stresses and to develop the finite element analysis (FEA) capability of composite <b>feed</b> <b>lines.</b> As expected, the critical stresses occurred at the rims of some flange holes and the onset of the tapered tubular sections. Further analysis is required to determine the loads, flange deflection, vibration, and combined maximum loads. Two permeability-testing apparatuses were also designed for both flat panel specimens and curved <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> sections after impact damage. A larger permeant gas exposed area is required to accurately determine the effect of impact damage on the permeability of the <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> materials. The flat panel tester was fabricated and assembled. Three test coupons were made of graphite/epoxy plain weave prepreg and unidirectional prepreg. The flow rate was calculated by measuring the change of manometer fluid height per unit time. The permeability of the coupons is then calculated according to Darcy's Law. The pressure increase due to the head rise in the manometer was not considered for the initial estimation. The result of the unidirectional composite coupon agreed with that obtained from the DC-XA <b>feed</b> <b>line</b> testing of a similar material.
