5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E

It was introduced by the school's headmistress Louisa Lumsden after a visit to Quebec, where <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> played. The first women's lacrosse team in the United States was established at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland in 1926. Men's and women's lacrosse were played under virtually the same rules, with no protective equipment, until the mid-1930s.|$|E
25|$|The longer horn was {{discovered}} on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter {{in the village}} of Gallehus, near Møgeltønder, Denmark when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King Christian IV of Denmark who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish prince Christian, who refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.|$|E

25|$|When Cardenas {{learned of}} his wife's predicament, he {{recommended}} that she retain Charles Garry, a criminal attorney who had {{gained a reputation}} in Soledad State Penitentiary as the ardent defender of George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. At the same time, news of the case reached the San Francisco Bay Area, where the women's rights and Chicano movements were at their apex. García began speaking to women's groups in the area, and the Inez Garcia Defense Committee raised money for the defense and publicized the case, hoping to put gender inequalities {{in the criminal justice}} system, rather than Garcia herself, on trial. Through her contact with feminist groups, Garcia transformed from the timid, submissive victim who was too ashamed to even admit {{what had happened to her}} into an outspoken critic of patriarchy, even when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her own judge, who she accused of prejudice and sexism. During the trial, Garry had argued that García had acted with diminished capacity. He based this argument on expert psychological testimony that rape causes mental trauma and García's own history of mental instability. The defense disappointed feminists who preferred to see García as a symbol of strength and resistance to male domination. It also failed to win the sympathy of the jury. García was convicted of second-degree murder, sentenced, and spent two years in the California Institution for Women before her appeal was heard.|$|E
500|$|Celebrities {{with larger}} Twitter followings began {{to weigh in}} overnight. Taylor Swift's tweet – which {{described}} how while <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as blue and black, the whole thing left her [...] "confused and scared"– was retweeted 111,134 times and liked 154,188 times. Jaden Smith, Frankie Muniz, Demi Lovato, Mindy Kaling, and Justin Bieber agreed that the dress was blue and black, while Anna Kendrick, B. J. Novak, Katy Perry, Julianne Moore, and Sarah Hyland saw it as white and gold. Kim Kardashian tweeted that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as white and gold, while her husband Kanye West saw it as blue and black. Lucy Hale, Phoebe Tonkin, and Katie Nolan saw different colour schemes at different times. Lady Gaga described the dress as [...] "periwinkle and sand," [...] while David Duchovny called it teal. Other celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande, mentioned the dress on social media without mentioning specific colours. Politicians, government agencies and social media platforms of well-known brands also weighed in tongue-in-cheek on the issue. Ultimately, the dress {{was the subject of}} 4.4 million tweets within 24 hours.|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{traveled}} to Canada in 1927, {{just in time}} to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as another travesty of justice in the US. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in Boston; memories of the Haymarket affair overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. [...] "Then," [...] she wrote, [...] "I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the [...] "shower scene" [...] never once shows a knife {{puncturing}} flesh. However, a {{frame by frame}} analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all {{the doors and windows}} and would leave the bathroom and shower door open. She never realized until she first watched the film [...] "how vulnerable and defenseless one is".|$|E
500|$|For Neon Tommy, Jeremy Fuster {{called it}} [...] "a dark, unspeakable corner of {{television}} where no light can reach {{and only the}} sleepless and drug-addled dare to venture." [...] Amanda McCorquodale of the Miami New Times joked that, for artists featured on the show, [...] "nothing compares to the prestige of sharing a network with Tim & Eric and Brak, right?" [...] Ultimately, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as the [...] "already bizarre network's foray into out-there visual experimentation." [...] Writing for The Fader, Matthew Trammell regarded it as [...] "when things get really interesting." [...] PQ Ribber of The Overnightscape Underground dubbed the series a [...] "modern version" [...] of Liquid Television and called it [...] "really kinda spiffy, and trippy, and cool." [...] Casper Kelly sought inspiration from the show during the production of his short film for the network, Too Many Cooks.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly author Dan Snierson noted that this dress [...] "probably wouldn’t have been Street-approved either", and a writer for Metro commented that [...] "the Simpsons' producers were certainly not worried about Katy looking too raunchy". Perry was a fan of The Simpsons before guest starring. In a video interview, she commented that she [...] "thought it was {{an honor to be}} asked to be on The Simpsons. The Simpsons, they are kind of like a national treasure when it comes to, you know, America and the whole world." [...] She also stated that she considers it {{to be one of the}} highlights of her career, and that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as a sign that she had [...] "made it".|$|E

500|$|The filmmaker Robert Altman saw Moore in the Uncle Vanya production, and was {{sufficiently}} impressed to cast {{her in his}} next project: the ensemble drama Short Cuts (1993), based on short stories by Raymond Carver. Moore was pleased to work with him, as his film 3 Women (1977) gave her a strong appreciation for cinema when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in college. Playing artist Marian Wyman was an experience she found difficult, as she was a [...] "total unknown" [...] surrounded by established actors, but this proved to be Moore's breakout role. Variety magazine described her as [...] "arresting" [...] and noted that her monologue, delivered naked from the waist down, would [...] "no doubt be the most discussed scene" [...] of the film. Short Cuts was critically acclaimed, and received awards for Best Ensemble Cast at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Globe Awards. Moore received an individual nomination for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards, and the monologue scene earned her a degree of notoriety.|$|E
500|$|Three singles were {{released}} from the album. [...] "Play with Fire" [...] was released as the first single on August 21, 2006 which Duff {{considered to be a}} [...] "tease" [...] of Dignitys musical sound. Although she felt it was different from the album's other songs, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as embodying the dance/electro/rock combination of the album, which influenced her decision to release it. Duff opted to release the song well in advance of the album [...] "to give listeners a chance to get into my new sound". Though it failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, it charted on the magazine's Hot Dance Club Play chart, peaking at number 34. It was later released as a digital-only single on May 15, 2007 in a remixed form of the original version, with production by Richard Vission. The second single, [...] "With Love" [...] became her highest-peaking single on the Hot 100 when it reached number 24. The single reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The third and final single, [...] "Stranger", peaked at 97 on the Hot 100 and also {{reached the top of the}} dance charts.|$|E
500|$|Barb Richards, {{director}} of music for WAJI {{said that the}} cast's introduction of new music prompted the station to finally add music from the cast. Richards referenced the 21.9million downloads and 5.2million albums sold since the series since its May2009 premiere, but commented, [...] "Still, I believe {{that people want to}} hear originals over remakes, so up until the 'Glee' cast's original music it didn't make sense for us to play each latest cover, other than to spotlight it the day of the show." [...] However, Richards complimented the original [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] saying its lyrics would [...] "resonate with kids and parents" [...] and said that she liked it when she first heard it and when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on the show. She also commented that it [...] "is good on its own, and having the Glee name on it gives it a leg up". Dave McKay, program director at WPST also echoed Richards' sentiments that the Glee sales were reason to add them to airplay, adding [...] "Not many artists or songs enjoy the type of exposure that 'Glee' provides. Plus, the audience that watches the show is the audience we target, so the fit seems perfect [...] since 'Glee' music sells, there is definitely an appetite for it." ...|$|E

[...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] for The Daily Telegraph James Walton was sceptical {{about the fact}} that [...] "some of the fawning [...] even came from the main baddie" [...] and what he felt to be the {{indication}} that the character was [...] "thrown into the mix on the principle that one glamorous space-travelling bisexual isn’t enough." [...] Whilst The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon expected that the physical contact between Marsters and Barrowman would result in [...] "somebody's sci-fi fantasy" [...] being realised <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> dashing her [...] "hopes series two might serve less sex, less rubbish aliens and more credible drama". However, Dan Martin of The Guardian described the character as the [...] "best thing about the opener" [...] and stated that [...] "he stole every scene he was in". He felt the production team [...] "shamelessly and brilliantly.... transplanted" [...] the character of Spike into the series. Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave particular praise to Marsters portrayal and like Martin, stated that he [...] "steals the show". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy felt Hart's arrival to be [...] "self-consciously iconic" [...] in providing [...] "swagger, innuendo and a wonderful Star Wars reference". He felt that overall the characterisation verged [...] "dangerously close to parody at times" [...] but this didn't detract from Marsters being [...] "a joy to watch, in a similar vein to his role in Buffy." [...] Charlie Jane Anders commented in regards to the episode that [...] ""Spike" [...] is pretty great in his Adam Ant jacket, with his paralyzing lip gloss and his zany sexual innuendo". IGN felt John to be a [...] "lot of fun" [...] and a [...] "good character to add to the mix" [...] who showed the team [...] "just how much of a mess they are".|$|E

500|$|Conscience was {{a factor}} in Peter Galbraith's {{criticism}} of fraud in the 2009 Afghanistan election despite it costing him his United Nations job. Conscience motivated Bunnatine Greenhouse to expose irregularities in the contracting of the Halliburton company for work in Iraq. Naji al-Ali a popular cartoon artist in the Arab world, loved for his defense of the ordinary people, and for his criticism of repression and despotism by both the Israeli military and Yasser Arafat's PLO, was murdered for refusing to compromise with his conscience. The journalist Anna Politkovskaya provided (prior to her murder) an example of conscience in her opposition to the Second Chechen War and then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. Conscience motivated the Russian human-rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted and murdered in Grozny, Chechnya in 2009. The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan arose from conscience-driven protests against the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Female Muslim lawyer Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) has been described as the 'conscience of the Islamic Republic' for her work in protecting the human rights of women and children in Iran. The human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, {{often referred to as the}} 'conscience of China' and who had previously been arrested and allegedly tortured by the Chinese regime for defending members of the Falun Gong, was abducted by Chinese security agents on 4 February 2009 and has not been seen since. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in his final statement before being sentenced by a closed Chinese court to over a decade in jail as a political prisoner of conscience stated: [...] "For hatred is corrosive of a person’s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation’s spirit." [...] Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer in Russia, was arrested, held without trial for almost a year and died in custody, as a result of exposing corruption. On 6 October 2001 Laura Whittle was a naval gunner on HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) under orders to implement a new border protection policy when they encountered the SIEV-4 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel-4) refugee boat in choppy seas.

Whittle jumped without a life vest 12 metres into the sea to help save the refugees from drowning thinking [...] "this isn't right; this isn't how things should be." [...] In February 2012 journalist Marie Colvin was deliberately targeted and killed by the Syrian Army [...] in Homs during the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising and Siege of Homs, after she decided to stay at the [...] "epicentre of the storm" [...] in order to [...] "expose what is happening." [...] In October 2012 the Taliban organised the attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai a teenage girl who had been campaigning, despite their threats, for female education in Pakistan. In December 2012 the 2012 Delhi gang rape case was said to have stirred the collective conscience of India to civil disobedience and public protest at the lack of legal action against rapists in that country (see Rape in India) In June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed details of a US National Security Agency internet and electronic communication PRISM (surveillance program) because of a conscience-felt obligation to the freedom of humanity greater than obedience to the laws that bound his employment.|$|E
