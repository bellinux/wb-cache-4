40|$|ABSTRACT Among {{the methods}} of weed control, stands out {{chemical}} control. However, even <b>selective,</b> <b>herbicides</b> can trigger the production of reactive species of oxygen and cause oxidative stress. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate changes in photosynthetic parameters, oxidative damage, antioxidant enzyme activity and altered metabolism of rice plants after applying pre-emergent herbicides. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and herbicides used were oxadiazon, pendimethalin and oxyfluorfen, beyond the control without herbicide. There was a reduction of photosynthetic rate and efficiency of carboxylation, compared to the control, when applied herbicides oxyfluorfen and pendimethalin. The major lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation was observed for the herbicide oxyfluorfen. The oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon herbicides also resulted in increased activity of superoxide dismutase, compared to control. When evaluated ascorbate peroxidase activity, there was a higher enzyme activity in plants treated with oxadiazon and pendimethalin. Even <b>selective</b> <b>herbicides</b> registered for weed control in rice crops cause phytotoxicity, reduce height and alter the metabolism of plants, generating reactive oxygen species, which activate enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems and result in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments and in reduced protein content...|$|R

40|$|Apart {{from the}} last 40 to 50 years, weed control In crops {{has always been a}} {{labour-intensive}} and time-consuming mechanical practice. Relief {{came in the form of}} chemical compounds that could control weeds, In particular <b>selective</b> <b>herbicides.</b> The development of highly effective <b>selective</b> <b>herbicides</b> has resulted in farmers becoming increasingly reliant on chemical weed control. Continuous application of herbicides with the same mode of action, however, selected for resistant mutations within weed populations to become dominant, rendering the herbicides less effective. Herbicide resistant weeds currently occur in 187 weed species distributed over 60 countries worldwide. South Africa is no exception and resistance in 15 weed species to herbicides in seven modes of action groups has been verified. This situation Is compelling farmers to consider alternative weed control strategies and cropping systems. The most effective strategy to manage resistant weeds would most probably be an integrated weed management program that does not rely on any one type of weed control method alone. Farmers will therefore have to adapt weed management systems and cropping systems to delay the onset of herbicide resistance or, if it is already present, to manage it effectively in order to keep future crop production profitable and sustainable.
