5|$|Up {{until the}} middle part of the 20th century, it was {{customary}} to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a lounge <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.|$|E
5|$|Now, {{the next}} player {{to the right}} plays a card {{following}} the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or {{if this is not}} possible, then lower; if no card of the same <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
5000|$|Five Beetleborgs <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> re-used in the Power Rangers Wild Force episode Forever Red as {{remnants}} of the Machine Empire who would plan to reactivate Serpentera. Shadowborg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for General Venjix, Ladyborg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for Tezzla, Green Hunter Borg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for Gerrok, Dragonborg's <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> used for Steelon with the dragonfly wings on the head not being seen, and Automon has the head of Fireborg and the body of Lightningborg.|$|R
50|$|The <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to be worn over a liquid cooling garment. The inner fabric of the <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> gray nylon canvas. The <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> insulated with waffle-textured foil. The outer layer was an off-white satin-weave fabric with orange trim.|$|R
50|$|Naked Suits by AlbertMing {{or simply}} Naked <b>Suits</b> <b>are</b> the company's main products. The <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> waterproof, made from an {{undisclosed}} material.|$|R
5|$|The {{winner of}} the trick takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start of}} every trick. When the trump card {{at the bottom of the}} deck is {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the Halo {{video game}} series, Troy Hurtubise, {{known for his}} anti-bear suits, {{developed}} a real counterpart to the MJOLNIR powered assault armor, named the Trojan. The <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> functional and its capabilities were inspired by those present in the video games versions of the armor. The armor's features include a system that purifies air, powered by solar panels located in the helmet, equipment for weapon transportation, a recording system, emergency illumination, and a transponder that can be activated if the wearer is in serious jeopardy. The armor offers protection against attacks with knives, blunt objects, and small explosions and is bulletproof. Hurtubise expressed that {{he is able to}} improve this design for use in the military for a price of 2,000 dollars per piece. Non-functional replicas of the MJOLNIR powered assault armor have also been created by hobbyists; a Spike TV pre-Halo 3 special profiled some of these dedicated fans.|$|E
5|$|Samus Aran is {{typically}} seen wearing the Power Suit, a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters {{and can be}} enhanced by power-ups collected during gameplay. In regard to offense, the Power Suit boasts the Arm Cannon, which can fire various energy beams, charge beams to shoot an extra-powerful blast, or launch {{a limited number of}} missiles. The Power Suit can also be reconfigured into a small, spherical form called the Morph Ball, which allows her to roll through tight areas, such as tunnels, and use Bombs. The Power <b>Suit</b> <b>is</b> also equipped with a Grapple Beam, which can be used to tether onto objects to cross large distances, such as chasms. Additionally, its visor can be used to scan objects to learn more about them, a feature that has been used since Metroid Prime. Aside from her Power Suit, Samus is also in possession of a Gunship, which is used in the games to save progress and restore her health and ammunition.|$|E
50|$|Various {{languages}} {{have different}} terminology for suits such as colors, signs, or seeds. Modern Western playing cards are generally {{divided into two}} or three general suit-systems. The older Latin <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> subdivided into the Italian and Spanish suit-systems. The younger Germanic <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> subdivided into the German and Swiss suit-systems. The French <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> a derivative of the German <b>suits</b> but <b>are</b> generally considered a separate system on its own.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the Toho <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{in really}} bad shape. The Gargantuas <b>suits</b> appear to <b>be</b> rotting (especially Gaira), {{despite the fact}} that both <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> repainted. They are also wearing new masks (with wigs).|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to being}} made with using wet-suits and latices, the <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{incapable}} of sustaining {{long periods of}} time. What happened {{to each of the}} <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> as follows: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{palladium}} core in the arc reactor {{that keeps}} Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and {{choosing not to}} tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
5000|$|It is a four-card major system: only four-card <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} to open 1 or 1, unlike Standard American {{and many other}} systems where five-card <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> typically required.|$|R
5000|$|... {{saturated}} squeeze: {{similar to}} the hexagonal squeeze, but all four <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> involved, with each opponent singly holding length guards in 2 suits, and then the 2 other <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> shared.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pairing of}} <b>suits</b> <b>is</b> a vestigial remnant of Ganjifa, a game where half the <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> in reverse order, the lower cards beating the higher. In Ganjifa, {{progressive}} <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> called [...] "strong" [...] while inverted <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> called [...] "weak". In Latin decks, the traditional division {{is between the}} long suits of swords and clubs and the round suits of cups and coins. This pairing {{can be seen in}} Ombre and Tarot card games. German and Swiss suits lack pairing but French suits maintained them and this {{can be seen in the}} game of Spoil Five.|$|R
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
25|$|Hokuto's Ultraman <b>Suit</b> <b>is</b> called Ver.A, which materializes by {{pounding}} his prosthetic fists together. This <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> {{an analogous}} of Ultraman Ace from his titular series.|$|E
25|$|The BCD is {{designed}} {{to act as a}} flotation device on the surface, the dry <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|E
50|$|Chinese jade burial <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> {{believed}} to be myths for many years until two were discovered in 1968; it is now believed that most jade burial <b>suits</b> <b>were</b> removed long ago by grave robbers.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, as {{with most}} clothes, a tailor made the suit from his client's {{selected}} cloth; these are now often known as bespoke <b>suits.</b> The <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> custom made to the measurements, taste, and style of the man. Since the Industrial Revolution, most <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> mass-produced, and, as such, are sold as ready-to-wear garments (though alteration by a tailor prior to wearing <b>is</b> common). Currently, <b>suits</b> <b>are</b> sold in roughly four ways: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, a <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{filed against}} the Diocese by two people {{claiming}} they were sexually abused by Reverend Raymond Pcolka. This <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> later joined by eleven more people and led to Pcolka's being defrocked.|$|R
25|$|The {{main part}} of the dry <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> a {{waterproof}} shell made from a membrane type material, foamed neoprene or a hybrid of both.|$|E
25|$|The shalwar kameez {{known as}} the Anarkali <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> named after the court dancer from Lahore. This suit has a {{timeless}} style which has become very popular. It {{is made up of}} a long, frock-style top and features a slim fitted bottom. This style of suit links South Asia with the women's firaq partug (frock and shalwar) of northwestern Pakistan and Afghanistan and to the traditional women's clothing of parts of Central Asia. It also links to the Punjab region, where the Anarkali <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> similar to the anga and the Peshwaz worn in Jammu.|$|E
25|$|Non-distinct Jokers are valueless {{cards that}} cannot win tricks. They may be played {{at all times}} (except to lead tricks), or perhaps only when {{following}} <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> not possible.|$|E
50|$|The Yastreb <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{only used}} once, this {{was during the}} Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 docking and crew exchange. The <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> not worn during launch or reentry. During the mission both cosmonauts {{experienced}} problems with the suit.|$|R

25|$|Bayonetta: The titular protagonist Bayonetta wears a catsuit that is {{composed}} of her own hair as a medium. The <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> occasionally removed when she is summoning demons to kill powerful angels.|$|E
25|$|Escalade: A businessman, {{stripped}} of his <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> trapped deep in the jungle. Jumping and climbing around a Chinese-pole-like framework, as if swinging through the trees, he finds his inner, primitive, ape.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{traditional}} bespoke process, measurements are taken, a basted canvas {{is built around}} the customer, then disassembled and traced onto paper, after which there are two more fittings. The <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> hand-sewn.|$|E
