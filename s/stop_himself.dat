When Skinner arrives minutes later, Barry breaks into convulsions and dies. Later, at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Mulder attempts to question the doctor who performed Barry's autopsy; she refuses to provide details since it was performed by the military instead of the FBI, claiming no other doctors were available.|$|E
5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – {{just to be able to}} say they had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract until the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} threat of the Darkness – {{revealed}} {{over the course of the}} series to be God's 'sister', sacrificed to create the world – Castiel agrees to act as Lucifer's vessel when Lucifer claims to be the only one with the power to defeat the Darkness, since God is absent and all other archangels are dead or insane. After killing Rowena, apparently the only person capable of re-opening the Cage, Lucifer spends some time re-establishing his power base in Hell while acting as Castiel to interact with the Winchesters and follow their research into Amara, but his true identity is revealed after the Winchesters attempt to travel back in time to recover a Hand of God from a submarine before it sank in 1943. Castiel is able to regain control long enough to explain the situation to Sam and <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> killing his friend, Dean subsequently banishing Lucifer and vowing to find a way to free Castiel from his control. Crowley, forced to act as Lucifer's slave, is forced on the run after he fails to kill Lucifer with another salvaged Hand of God. The Winchesters manage to get through to Castiel when preparing for a new confrontation with Amara, but Castiel resolves to remain as Lucifer's Vessel until her defeat, only for the Hand of God to fail against Amara's power. With Castiel/Lucifer now Amara's prisoner, she decides to torture an archangel to try and lure God out, leaving the Winchesters to speculate that Lucifer couldn't use the Hand of God due to the fact that he is a fallen archangel. Lucifer is eventually rescued when God returns – revealed to be Chuck, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels – with God/Chuck healing Lucifer and apologising for his past actions. Although Lucifer is apparently killed in the later confrontation with Amara, Castiel is healed and returned to control of his body, although he is then banished when a member of the London branch of the Men of Letters attacks the bunker to punish Sam's past actions.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} this revelation, rather than being granted a break to recover and {{possibly}} undergo surgery Sakuraba scheduled to return to action on December 31, 2006 against Yoshihiro Akiyama at K-1 Dynamite!!. During the bout, Sakuraba was hit with several punches and he rushed to get the takedown, but in doing so he slipped from Akiyama's body. As the sequence repeated itself over and over while Sakuraba took punishment, he opted to drop to his back and attempt a kneebar from there, but {{his grip on the}} judoka inexplicably failed again. Having Sakuraba trapped against the ropes and struggling for his submission, Akiyama was free to attack with ground and pound for the referee stoppage. Words were exchanged between Sakuraba and referee Yoshinori Umeki prior to the stop, which was brought on by the sounding of a bell at the behest of Akira Maeda, the event coordinator, the referee separating the fighters following the bell rather than initiating the <b>stop</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fujishima was {{responsible}} for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories. The supporting cast was designed by Hidenori Matsubara. Matsubara also helped with general animation. As the character concepts had been firmly established before the design stage, Fujishima was able to create the characters with ease, creating them so players could easily understand {{what was going through}} their minds. Due to the game's Taishō period setting, Fujishima needed to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from adding anachronistic elements such as fasteners. Hiroi made character sheets for each character, which Fujisaka used to create each character and their various designs, noting Sumire as a character whose personality was communicated through her clothes. Each character had distinct traits, such as a ponytail and hakama kimono for Sakura, so Kujishima simply combined these elements with his own design ideas. The Taishō period meant that Fujishima could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement. His design for each main protagonist—from Ogami to the Flower Division members—directly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them. The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after tuxedos, and compared by Kujishima with the costumes of the Takarazuka Revue.|$|E

500|$|Work on Grand Theft Auto IV {{began in}} November 2004, almost {{immediately}} {{after the release of}} [...] (2004). Around 150 game developers worked on Grand Theft Auto IV, led by core members of the team that previously worked on Grand Theft Auto III (2001). For the game, Rockstar used their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), which was previously used in Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis (2006), in combination with the Euphoria game animation engine. Instead of pre-written animations, Euphoria uses procedural animation to control the way the player moves, enabling character movements to be more realistic. The Euphoria engine also enables NPCs to react in a realistic way to the player's actions. In one preview, a player knocked an NPC out of a window and the character grabbed onto a ledge to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from falling. The game also uses middleware from Image Metrics to facilitate intricate facial expressions and ease the process of incorporating lip-synching. Foliage in the game is produced through SpeedTree.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Naples, the Shelleys {{settled in}} Rome, {{the city where}} her husband wrote where [...] "the meanest streets were strewed with {{truncated}} columns, broken capitals...and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry...The voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified [...] as they were by man". Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius, the Reanimated Roman, where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of [...] "superstitious" [...] Catholicism. The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria. Shelley bitterly commented that she come to Italy to improve her husband's health, and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children, leading her to write: [...] "May you my dear Marianne never {{know what it is}} to lose two only and lovely children in one year-to watch their dying moments-and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable". To deal with her grief, Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy, which became Matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father, who ultimately commits suicide to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from acting on his passion for his daughter, while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about [...] "the unnatural love I had inspired". The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father's feelings.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{a lawyer}} named Robert Tarbox (who, in August 1975, was disbarred by the California Supreme Court {{for failure to}} pay some clients) {{said that in the}} early 1970s a {{merchant}} mariner walked into his office and confessed to him that he was the Zodiac Killer. The seemingly lucid seaman (whose name Tarbox would not reveal due to confidentiality) described his crimes briefly but persuasively enough to convince Tarbox. The man said he was trying to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from his [...] "opportunistic" [...] murder spree but never returned to see Tarbox again. Tarbox took out a full-page ad in the Vallejo Times-Herald that he claimed would clear the name of Arthur Leigh Allen as a killer, his only reason for revealing the story thirty years after the fact. Robert Graysmith, {{the author of several books}} on Zodiac, said Tarbox's story was [...] "entirely plausible".|$|E

2500|$|John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) {{went on to}} face John Cena at WrestleMania. On the SmackDown! after No Way Out, Cena and The Big Show {{defeated}} JBL and Orlando Jordan. The following week, JBL cut a promo and Cena, and insulted him, while Cena {{defended his}} United States title against Jordan. Jordan won the title after the Basham Brothers distracted the referee, and JBL hit Cena with the WWE Championship belt. They then blew up Cena's customized design of the United States Championship, {{and replaced it with}} the original one. Later that night, Cena attacked the General Manager, Long, and was thrown out of the arena. During JBL's match that night, Cena returned and attacked JBL's cabinet. The next week, Long announced that if Cena laid a hand on JBL, apart from in matches, he would lose his WrestleMania match. In a six-person tag team match that night, Cena's team won, but Cena had to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from attacking JBL after the bell had rung. On a later episode of SmackDown!, Long clarifies that if JBL physically provoked Cena, then Cena could retaliate. Cena then attempted to provoke JBL, by vandalising his limousine, and spray painting [...] "FU" [...] on JBL's shirt. On the last SmackDown! before WrestleMania, however, JBL had Cena arrested for vandalism and, once Cena was handcuffed, attacked him. At WrestleMania, Cena pinned JBL after an FU, to win the WWE Championship for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|GLaDOS has {{received}} praise for her humor and wit. In {{his review of}} Portal, PC Gamer editor Tom Francis stated that he could hardly <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from laughing at GLaDOS' deranged writing. Similarly, GamesRadar editor Tom Francis described her as hysterical and being an aspect of Portal that gamers will love. [...] Tom Francis called GLaDOS {{as one of the}} most badass boss fights in video games, citing both the hilarity of the character, with whom they state as the funniest video game villain since the Purple Tentacle from Day of the Tentacle, as well as the memorable quotes. PC Zone UK listed her as the second-best conceived character in gaming, commenting that the memes related to the Weighted Companion Cube and [...] "the cake is a lie" [...] could distract people from GLaDOS' [...] "perfectly-metered and lyrical voice". He described her as the [...] "humorous, clinical, savage and poignant heart of Portal". In a piece in The Observer, game theorist and author of Fun Inc [...] Tom Chatfield listed GLaDOS as one of the ten best video game characters of all time, describing her as both as [...] "gaming's funniest, freakiest female" [...] and a [...] "psychopathic artificial intelligence". The Observers Will Freeman wrote that GLaDOS [...] "really is (in a rare case of living up to the hyperbole) one of the most fascinating characters in the history of the video game".|$|E
2500|$|The king {{hears about}} a maiden {{being the most}} {{beautiful}} and charming in the land, {{who happens to be}} Imoinda and also falls in love. Despite his Intelligence saying she had been claimed by Oroonoko, the gives Imoinda a sacred veil, thus forcing her to become one of his wives, even though she is already promised to Oroonoko. After Imoinda unwillingly, but dutifully spends time in the king's harem (the Otan), Oroonoko is comforted by the idea of the king being too old to ravish Imoinda. Over time the Prince plans a tryst {{with the help of the}} sympathetic Onahal (one of the kings wives) and Aboan (a friend to the prince). The Prince and Imoinda are reunited for a short time and consummate the marriage, but are eventually discovered. Imoinda and Onahal are given the worse possible punishment by being sold as slaves for their actions. The king's guilt, however, leads him to falsely inform Oroonoko that Imoinda has been executed, since death was thought to be better than slavery. The Prince grieves for an extended time by lying on a carpet and refusing to get up. Later, after winning another tribal war, Oroonoko and his men goes to visit an English captain on his ship and is tricked and shackled after drinking. The English Captain plans to sell him and his men as slaves. Oroonoko and his men are carried to Surinam, at that time an English colony based in the West Indies. Oroonoko is purchased by a Cornish man named Trefry, but given special treatment for his being educated and ability to speak French and English (which he learned from his own French slave). The two men grow to be acquaintances. Trefry mentions that he came into owning the most beautiful slave maiden and had to <b>stop</b> <b>himself</b> from forcing her into sex. Unbeknownst to Oroonoko, Trefry is speaking of Imoinda who is at the same plantation. [...] The two lovers are reunited under the new Christian names of Caesar and Clemene.|$|E

2500|$|Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son, {{comes to}} Camelot to dishonor the King {{and tries to}} gain the throne for himself. Arthur puts him {{in charge of the}} knights’ {{training}} program, not knowing that Mordred is there to destroy the Round Table in revenge against Arthur for abandoning him, and detests the idea of being a Knight ("The Seven Deadly Virtues"). Arthur begins to feel the strain of ruling England, and both he and Guinevere wonder what commoners do without any such responsibilities ("What Do The Simple Folk Do?"). Mordred, meanwhile, has devised a plan to ruin Arthur and his kingdom permanently. He enters an enchanted glade where his aunt, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, dwells in an invisible castle. Morgan has a sweet tooth, and though she likes Arthur, Mordred manages to bribe her with a large supply of sweetmeats, to build one of her invisible walls around Arthur for one night, so that when he goes on his hunting trip the next day, he {{will not be able to}} get back to the castle ("The Persuasion"). [...] Meanwhile, Mordred incites the Knights to remember their former days of fighting and pillaging, and turns them against Arthur, ("Fie On Goodness!"). [...] With Arthur gone, Lancelot, unable to <b>stop</b> <b>himself,</b> visits Guinevere in her chambers, as Mordred fully suspected he would. [...] They kiss passionately ("I Loved You Once in Silence"). However, Lancelot and Guinevere's affair and Mordred's machinations come to a head when Mordred and some of the Knights of the Round Table interrupt, accuse Lancelot of treason, and try to take him prisoner. Lancelot fights them off and escapes, but Guinevere is arrested, tried, found guilty of treason by reason of her infidelity, and sentenced to be burned at the stake ("Guinevere"). At the execution, Arthur watches from a distance as Mordred taunts him for his failures; he is torn between upholding his law and doing his duty as a king, or sparing Guinevere, whom he still loves in spite of everything. At the last moment, Lancelot arrives with an army, rescues Guinevere and takes her off with him to France. But in the process, Lancelot has been forced to kill some of the other knights, leaving the survivors vowing revenge.|$|E
