5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Best thing about it is we’re going to do it {{whenever}} we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

25|$|On 5 March 2011, Mayall {{appeared}} on Let's Dance for Comic Relief {{in which he}} came on stage and attacked Ade Edmondson with a frying pan during his performance of The Dying Swan ballet. Edmondson mentioned backstage {{that it was the}} first time in eight years they had done <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> together and claimed Mayall had left his head with a small bump. It would be the last time the duo performed together in public.|$|E
25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, {{there is no such thing}} as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E

25|$|The decorations:On {{one side}} of the {{courtyard}} is the temple proper, on a raised dais four feet high. The building and decorations are exquisite; the shafts of all the arches are of polished white marble inlaid with flowing flowery patterns in coloured marbles. The walls and ceiling and every available inch are painted richly, the prevailing colours being blue and gold, but all so artistically blended that the eye only takes in the general effect, which is <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a Cashmere shawl.|$|E
25|$|Ron Meyer’s {{recruiting}} {{strategy was}} very aggressive. He pursued and attracted the finest football players {{from all of}} Texas. Not all of his players were acquired the ethical way, however; his recruiting staff was paying recruits, and Meyer was letting it slide. According to Steve Endicott the first payments came at Kashmere High School in Houston, Texas. “... It was Ron, Myself, Rob (Robin Buddecke, Endicott’s assistant), and maybe another coach...I can’t pin it down it was maybe twenty or fifty bucks or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> we gave”. the Kashmere football players would call the SMU recruiters “Santa Claus”. The little payments of 20 dollars turned into 500 dollars, Buddecke {{was said to have}} handed out 100-dollar bills to recruits when meeting them at airports.|$|E
25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury {{that by the time}} Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the grand jury that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|E
50|$|It is {{universal}} that published books prefaces are <b>something</b> <b>like</b> expectances <b>that</b> this book could sell well or praises for the authors great talents by another several masters.

There are percussion elements and a few random sounds in there too, plus the nice guitar track, but certainly the main challenge was for all of these tracks to be well balanced and individually audible.

500|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} of rookie and selected veterans training camp on July 29, Kafka {{took all the}} snaps at quarterback after Kolb and Vick got practice off. After practice, offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said Kafka was [...] "the best rookie that I've ever had in 15, 16, 17 years or <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> So, he's really sharp. Now, he's sharp book-wise, but he's also very intelligent in a football sense. He's really picked [...] up very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of {{his success}} in guiding Stanford's offense, head coach Harbaugh was {{mentioned}} {{as a candidate for}} the vacant head coaching positions of other universities and National Football League teams. In the leadup to the Orange Bowl, however, Harbaugh refused to comment on any of the possibilities and said he wanted to focus on guiding his team to victory. Stanford players echoed that line. [...] "We've invested too much to let <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> distract us," [...] linebacker Shayne Skov said December 30.|$|E

Why, she never even alluded to it in any of her letters--all these months.|$|R

[...] It's something you pick up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you've {{got to be able to}} take it.|$|E
500|$|Chabon was {{ambivalent}} about his new-found fame. He turned down offers {{to appear in}} a Gap ad and to be featured as one of Peoples [...] "50 Most Beautiful People." [...] He later said, of the People offer, [...] "I don't give a shit ... I only take pride in things I've actually done myself.

In warning {{readers to}} avoid spoiling {{potential}} surprises for their experience in playing , Eric Holmes specifically referenced the Wikipedia {{article on the}} character as a resource to avoid: [...] "You know what?

500|$|On September 9, the Brewers {{became the}} third team {{in major league}} history to start a game with three {{straight}} home runs, as Rickie Weeks, J. J.

[...] Braun's home run in that game also broke the Brewers rookie record for home runs (28). Braun hit his 30th homer in his 94th game, a pace no player had set to start a career since McGwire hit 30 in 84 games during 1986 and 1987.|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{interest}} in acting from an early age, Pinto was undecided on which career path to take until watching Monster (2003) while at college.

[...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years.

When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked [...] "What are those things?," [...] he answered [...] "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds." [...] Since the show was influenced by tiki, the background painters have to use a lot of pattern.
