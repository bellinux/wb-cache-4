40|$|We discuss heat {{transport}} in a thermally-biased SQUID {{in the presence}} of an external magnetic flux, when a non-negligible inductance of the SQUID ring is taken into account. A properly sweeping driving flux causes the thermal current to modulate and behave hysteretically. The response of this device is analysed as a function of both the hysteresis parameter and degree of asymmetry of the SQUID, highlighting the parameter range over which hysteretic behavior is observable. Markedly, also the temperature of the SQUID shows hysteretic evolution, with sharp transitions characterized by temperature jumps up to, e. g., ~ 38 mK for a realistic Al-based setup. In view of these results, the proposed device can effectively find application as a temperature-based <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> element, working even at GHz frequencies by suitably choosing the superconductor on which the device is based.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high-density}} data storage with ultrafast accessibility motivates {{the search for}} new memory implementations. Ideally such storage devices should be robust to input error and to unreliability of individual elements; furthermore information {{should be addressed by}} its content rather than by its location. Here we present a concept for an associative memory whose key component is a superconducting array with natural multiconnectivity. Its intrinsic redundancy is crucial for the content-addressability of the resulting storage device and also leads to parallel image retrieval. Because patterns are stored nonlocally both physically and logically in the proposed device, information access and retrieval are fault-tolerant. This <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> should exhibit picosecond single-bit acquisition times with negligible energy dissipation during switching and multiple non-destructive read-outs of the stored data. The key component of our proposed associative memory is a superconducting array with multiple interconnections (Figure 1), where each bit is represented by a wire and thus is physically delocalized. More specifically this network consists of a stack of two perpendicular set...|$|E
40|$|A superconducting loop stores {{persistent}} current without any ohmic loss, {{making it an}} ideal platform for energy efficient memories. Conventional superconducting memories use an architecture based on Josephson junctions (JJs) and have demonstrated access times less than 10 ps and power dissipation as low as 10 ^- 19 J. However, their scalability {{has been slow to}} develop due to the challenges in reducing the dimensions of JJs and minimizing the area of the superconducting loops. In addition to the memory itself, complex readout circuits require additional JJs and inductors for coupling signals, increasing the overall area. Here, we have demonstrated a <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> based solely on lithographic nanowires. The small dimensions of the nanowire ensure that the device can be fabricated in a dense area in multiple layers, while the high kinetic inductance makes the loop essentially independent of geometric inductance, allowing it to be scaled down without sacrificing performance. The memory is operated by a group of nanowire cryotrons patterned alongside the storage loop, enabling us to reduce the entire memory cell to 3 μm × 7 μm in our proof-of-concept device. In this work we present the operation principles of a superconducting nanowire memory (nMem) and characterize its bit error rate, speed, and power dissipation...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{nonvolatile}} <b>superconducting</b> <b>memories</b> is proposed. The devices combine ferromagnetic dots for {{the storage of}} the data and Josephson junctions for their readout. Good scalability is expected for large scale integration. First memory cells have been implemented using 3 μm-Nb-technology and permalloy dots. Nonvolatile data storage at 300 K was demonstrated. Comment: 8 Pages, 5 Figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in {{telecommunication}} traffic demands a higher-speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching system. At present, the upper limit of the system clock rate {{is determined by the}} maximum clock rate of conventional semiconductor memory devices, such as the register files used in ATM cell buffer storage. This is because the maximum clock rate of these register files is restricted by the propagation delay time between each register stage. Since a reentrant <b>superconducting</b> delay-line <b>memory</b> avoids this restriction using an analogue delay given by the superconducting delay line, we have proposed that this memory should be used in high-speed ATM cell buffer storage. Recently, we fabricated a 10 -m mm mm-wide 37 -cm-long YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d dd d coplanar delay-line. This line had a delay of approximately 2. 8 ns. Using this coplanar delay-line and an assembly of commercially available integrated circuits, we successfully developed a <b>superconducting</b> delay-line <b>memory.</b> This memory operates as a 32 -bit buffer storage at a clock rate of 10 GHz, which is several times faster than the register files. This result shows that the <b>superconducting</b> delay-line <b>memory</b> is a powerful candidate for high-speed ATM cell buffer storage...|$|R

The memory effect, which is the <b>superconducting</b> niobium <b>memory</b> about an initial magnetic domain structure of permalloy at cooling below T_c, is found.

40|$|We {{investigate}} Magnetic Josephson Junction (MJJ) - a superconducting {{device with}} ferromagnetic barrier for a scalable high-density cryogenic memory compatible with energy-efficient single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits. The superconductor-insulator-superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIS'FS) MJJs are analyzed both experimentally and theoretically. We {{found that the}} properties of SIS'FS junctions fall into two distinct classes based on the thickness of S' layer. We fabricate Nb-Al/AlOx-Nb-PdFe-Nb SIS'FS MJJs using a co-processing approach {{with a combination of}} HYPRES and ISSP fabrication processes. The resultant SIS'FS structure with thin superconducting S'-layer is substantially affected by the ferromagnetic layer as a whole. We fabricate these type of junctions to reach the device compatibility with conventional SIS junctions used for superconducting SFQ electronics to ensure a seamless integration of MJJ-based circuits and SIS JJ-based ultra-fast digital SFQ circuits. We report experimental results for MJJs, demonstrating their applicability for <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> and digital circuits. These MJJs exhibit IcRn product only ~ 30 % lower than that of conventional SIS junctions co-produced in the same fabrication. Analytical calculations for these SIS'FS structures are in a good agreement with the experiment. We discuss application of MJJ devices for memory and programmable logic circuits.

40|$|We study planar {{clusters}} {{consisting of}} loops including a Josephson π-junction (π-rings). Each π-ring carries a persistent current and behaves as a classical orbital moment. The type of particular state {{associated with the}} orientation of orbital moments at the cluster depends on the interaction between these orbital moments and can be easily controlled, i. e. by a bias current or by other means. We show that these systems can be described by the two-dimensional Ising model with competing nearest-neighbor and diagonal interactions and investigate the phase diagram of this model. The characteristic features of the model are analyzed based on the exact solutions for small clusters such as a 5 -site square plaquette {{as well as on}} a mean-field type approach for the infinite square lattice of Ising spins. The results are compared with spin patterns obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for the 100 × 100 square lattice and with experiment. We show that the π-ring clusters may be used as a new type of <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> elements. The obtained results may be verified in experiments and are applicable to adiabatic quantum computing where the states are switched adiabatically with the slow change of coupling constants.

40|$|Superconducting devices, which rely on {{modulating}} {{a complex}} superconducting order parameter in a Josephson junction, {{have been developed}} for low power logic operations, high-frequency oscillators, and exquisite magnetic field sensors. Magnetic devices, which rely on the modulation of a local vector order parameter- the local magnetic moment, have been used as memory elements, high-frequency spin-transfer oscillators, and magnetic field sensors. In a hybrid superconducting-magnetic device, these two order parameters compete, with one type of order suppressing the other. Recent interest in ultra-low-power, high-density cryogenic memories has spurred new interest in merging superconducting and magnetic behavior so as to exploit these two competing order parameters to produce novel switching elements. Here, we describe a reconfigurable two-layer magnetic spin valve integrated within a Josephson junction. Our measurements separate the suppression in the superconducting coupling due to the exchange field in the magnetic layers, which causes depairing of the supercurrent, from the suppression due to the magnetic field generated by the magnetic layers. The exchange field suppression of the superconducting order parameter is a tunable and switchable behavior that is also scalable to nanometer device dimensions. These devices are the first to demonstrate nonvolatile, size-independent switching of the Josephson coupling, in both magnitude and phase, and they may allow for the first nanoscale <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> devices...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe lack of dense, fast, energy {{efficient}} memory {{has been the}} main detractor for multiple superconducting digital projects in the past. Recently, fundamental physics research in superconductor-ferromagnet thin-film tunnel structures created a new opportunity to solve this long-standing problem. Superconductivity and ferromagnetism, two deeply antagonistic electronic properties, can co-exist in form of Magnetic Josephson Junctions (MJJs). The superconducting-ferromagnetic MJJs are electrically compatible with traditional superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions (JJs) used for digital energy-efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ/ERSFQ) circuits. Both MJJ and JJ circuits have similar fabrication process and can be integrated on a single chip. As a result, a combination of MJJs and JJs {{can be used to}} form addressable memory cells, energy-efficient memory periphery circuits and programmable logic elements. In this paper, we present the test results of superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIFS) MJJs showing their applicability for <b>superconducting</b> spintronic <b>memory</b> and digital circuits...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>superconducting</b> thermal <b>memory</b> device that {{exploits}} the thermal hysteresis in a flux-controlled, temperature-biased superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID). This system reveals a flux-controllable temperature bistability, {{which can be}} used to define two well-distinguishable thermal logic states. We discuss a suitable writing-reading procedure for these memory states. The time of the memory writing operation is expected to be on the order of ~ 0. 2 ns, for a Nb-based SQUID in thermal contact with a phonon bath at 4 : 2 K. We suggest a non-invasive readout scheme for the memory states based on the measurement of the effective resonance frequency of a tank circuit inductively coupled to the SQUID. The proposed device paves the way for a practical implementation of thermal logic and computation. The advantage of this proposal is that it represents also an example of harvesting thermal energy in superconducting circuits. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Modular quantum {{computing}} architectures require fast and efficient distribution of quantum information through propagating signals. Here we report rapid, on-demand quantum state transfer between two remote <b>superconducting</b> cavity quantum <b>memories</b> through traveling microwave photons. We demonstrate a quantum communication channel by deterministic transfer of quantum bits with 76 % fidelity. Heralding on errors induced by experimental imperfection can improve this to 87 % with a success probability of 0. 87. By partial transfer of a microwave photon, we generate remote entanglement {{at a rate}} that exceeds photon loss in either memory by more than a factor of three. We further show the transfer of quantum error correction code words that will allow deterministic mitigation of photon loss. These results pave the way for scaling superconducting quantum devices through modular quantum networks. Comment: main text 7 pages, 4 figures; supplement 16 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} low-dissipation {{nanoscale}} memory devices is {{as strong as}} ever. As Moore's Law is staggering, {{and the demand for}} a low-power-consuming supercomputer is high, the goal of making information processing circuits out of superconductors is one of the central goals of modern technology and physics. So far, digital superconducting circuits could not demonstrate their immense potential. One important {{reason for this is that}} a dense <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> technology is not yet available. Miniaturization of traditional superconducting quantum interference devices is difficult below a few micrometers because their operation relies on the geometric inductance of the superconducting loop. Magnetic memories do allow nanometer-scale miniaturization, but they are not purely superconducting (Baek et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 3888). Our approach is to make nanometer scale memory cells based on the kinetic inductance (and not geometric inductance) of superconducting nanowire loops, which have already shown many fascinating properties (Aprili 2006 Nat. Nanotechnol. 1 15; Hopkins et al 2005 Science 308 1762). This allows much smaller devices and naturally eliminates magnetic-field cross-talk. We demonstrate that the vorticity, i. e., the winding number of the order parameter, of a closed superconducting loop can be used for realizing a nanoscale nonvolatile memory device. We demonstrate how to alter the vorticity in a controlled fashion by applying calibrated current pulses. A reliable read-out of the memory is also demonstrated. We present arguments that such memory can be developed to operate without energy dissipation...|$|E
40|$|Memristors, memcapacitors, and meminductors, collectively called memelements, {{represent}} an innovative generation of circuit elements whose properties {{depend on the}} state {{and history of the}} system. The hysteretic behavior of one of their constituent variables, under the effect of an external time-dependent perturbation, is their distinctive fingerprint. In turn, this feature endows them with the ability to both store and process information on the same physical location, a property that is expected to benefit many applications ranging from unconventional computing to adaptive electronics to robotics, to name just a few. For all these types of applications, it is important to find appropriate memelements that combine a wide range of memory states (multi-state memory), long memory retention times, and protection against unavoidable noise. Although several physical systems belong to the general class of memelements, few of them combine all of these important physical features in a single component. Her we demonstrate theoretically a <b>superconducting</b> <b>memory</b> structure based on solitonic long Josephson junctions (LJJs). We show that the Josephson critical current of the junction behaves hysteretically as an external magnetic field is properly swept. According to the hysteretic path displayed by the critical current, a LJJ {{can be used as a}} multi-state memory, with a controllable number of available states. In addition, since solitons are at the core of its operation, this system provides an intrinsic topological protection against external perturbations. Solitonic Josephson-based memelements may find applications as memories, and in other emerging areas such as memcomputing, i. e., computing directly in/by the memory.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a key}} issue for modern high performance computing. Superconductive digital electronics has already demonstrated superior performances in terms of speed and energy dissipations. However, {{there is still the}} open issue of the realization of effective submicron scale superconductive <b>memories.</b> <b>Superconducting</b> nanowires represent the state-of-the-art of single-photon detectors. Their technology has also been used to realize three-terminal active devices, where the output response is triggered by a current pulse. The combination of the electrothermal mechanism of the nanowire and the magnetic coupling with a suitable material can be used for the realization of a nanowire-based memory device scalable to nanoscale. The principle of operation and material requirements are presented here. In particular, the feasibility of the proposed device using EuS as magnetic material and NbN as nanowire is discussed. By using a physical model of the nanowire dynamics, in terms of the spatial distribution of electron and phonon temperatures, the feasibility of the proposed device has been verified, through numerical simulations. The device configurations considered have the specific goal of realizing reliable and high-speed read and write operations, with the possibility of scalability to nanoscale...|$|R
40|$|Qubit {{connectivity}} is {{an important}} property of a quantum processor, with an ideal processor having random access [...] the ability of arbitrary qubit pairs to interact directly. Here, we implement a random access superconducting quantum information processor, demonstrating universal operations on a nine-bit quantum memory, with a single transmon serving as the central processor. The quantum memory uses the eigenmodes of a linear array of coupled <b>superconducting</b> resonators. The <b>memory</b> bits are superpositions of vacuum and single-photon states, controlled by a single superconducting transmon coupled {{to the edge of}} the array. We selectively stimulate single-photon vacuum Rabi oscillations between the transmon and individual eigenmodes through parametric flux modulation of the transmon frequency, producing sidebands resonant with the modes. Utilizing these oscillations for state transfer, we perform a universal set of single- and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs of modes, using only the charge and flux bias of the transmon. Further, we prepare multimode entangled Bell and GHZ states of arbitrary modes. The fast and flexible control, achieved with efficient use of cryogenic resources and control electronics, in a scalable architecture compatible with state-of-the-art quantum memories is promising for quantum computation and simulation.
