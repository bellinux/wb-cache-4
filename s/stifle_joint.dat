5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, <b>stifle</b> <b>joint,</b> tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{clinical study}} compared inflammation, including {{expression of the}} chemokine interleukin (IL) - 8 and intercellular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), in the <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of 4 control dogs and 23 dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR). The CCL, synovial membrane, meniscus, cartilage, and synovial fluid from the affected <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of all the dogs were examined. Inflammatory cell counts were performed on the synovial fluid, and the tissues were processed for histologic study and immunohistochemical detection of IL- 8 and ICAM- 1. The synovial fluid from the <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of the dogs with CCLR had an increased percentage of neutrophils (P = 0. 054) and a decreased percentage of lymphocytes (P = 0. 004) but not macrophages compared with the fluid from the control dogs. There was accumulation of inflammatory cells and increased expression of IL- 8 and ICAM- 1 in the vascular endothelium of the synovial membrane and the CCL of the dogs with CCLR. The increase in inflammatory cells in the <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of dogs with CCLR may therefore be due to increased expression of IL- 8 and ICAM- 1 in the synovial membrane and the CCL after the injury. These data may help in understanding the mechanisms of inflammation associated with CCLR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In a {{prospective}} study, {{the outcome of}} surgical correction of medial patellar luxation of 70 <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> in 55 Pomeranian dogs was evaluated. Trochlear block recession alone was performed in 46 <b>stifle</b> <b>joints,</b> or in combination with tibial tuberosity transposition in 24 <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> in cases with grade II, III or IV medial patellar luxation. Additional pro-cedures were performed to restore lateral and medial retinacular function.

In humans, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the preferred diagnostic method for as-sessment of periarticular soft tissue and articular cartil-age, including evaluation of lesions such as meniscus and ligament tears in the knee [2 - 6]. However, the use-fulness of MR for the assessment of osteoarthritis, and joint disease in general, is still not well characterized in veterinary medicine [6].

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of little spotted cats in captivity using radiographic and CT studies. The hypothesis was that these animals would have meniscal mineralisation that could be detectable by imaging studies. Twelve intact little spotted cats (Leopardus tigrinus), 2 females and 10 males, aged from 1. 5 to 11. 11 years old and weighing 1. 9 - 3. 05 kg were studied. These animals, which were living in the Quinzinho de Barros Municipal Zoo, had no symptoms or known disease processes at the time of the study. The plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of both <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> were performed under general anaesthesia. Sequential transverse images were acquired on a spiral scanner. Results: No signs of articular disease were observed in any of the animals. Radiographically, the meniscal mineralisation was detected as an oval radiopacity in the cranial compartment on the mediolateral projection, located within the area of the medial meniscus. On craniocaudal projection, the mineralisation was more difficult to visualise. In one of the animals, it was not possible to identify the meniscal mineralisation in either of the <b>stifle</b> <b>joints.</b> Using CT, meniscal mineralisation was best identified in the transverse plane images. Conclusions: Meniscal mineralisation appears to be a normal anatomic feature in little spotted cats. © 2013 Rahal et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} interglobular domain (IGD) cleavage of aggrecan in {{dogs with}} naturally developing osteoarthritis (OA). Sample Population—Samples of synovial fluid (SF) obtained from 3 cubital (elbow) <b>joints</b> and 3 <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of 4 clinically normal dogs, 24 elbow joints of 12 dogs with early-stage OA, 8 <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of 5 dogs with early-stage OA, and 10 <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of 9 dogs with latestage OA. Procedure—Fractions of SF were assayed for total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and also subjected to western blot analysis {{by use of}} monoclonal antibodies against neoepitopes generated by cleavage of the IGD of the aggrecan protein core by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP; BC- 14) and aggrecanase (BC- 3). Results—Total GAG content of SF from joints of clinically normal dogs {{did not differ from}} that of dogs with early-stage OA. The GAG content of SF from joints of dogs with late-stage OA was significantly lower, compared with GAG content for other SF samples. Aggrecanase-generated fragments were detected in SF from all groups but not in all samples. Matrix metalloproteinase– generated fragments were not detected in any SF samples. In early-stage OA, high-molecularweight aggrecanase-generated aggrecan catabolites were evident. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—GAG content of SF obtained from dogs with late-stage OA is significantly decreased, suggesting proteoglycan depletion of cartilage. Aggrecanases, but not MMPs, are the major proteolytic enzymes responsible for IGD cleavage of aggrecan in canine joints. Analyses of SF samples to detect aggrecanase-generated catabolites may provide an early biomarker for discriminating early- and latestage OA in dogs...|$|R

40|$|In dogs, {{degenerative}} joint diseases (DJD) {{have been}} shown to be associated with increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the synovial fluid. The goal of this study was to examine healthy and degenerative <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> in order to clarify the origin of LDH in synovial fluid. In order to assess the distribution of LDH, cartilage samples from healthy and degenerative knee joints were investigated by means of light and transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with immunolabeling and enzyme cytochemistry. Morphological analysis confirmed DJD. All techniques used corroborated the presence of LDH in chondrocytes and in the interterritorial matrix of healthy and degenerative <b>stifle</b> <b>joints.</b> Although enzymatic activity of LDH was clearly demonstrated in the territorial matrix by means of the tetrazolium-formazan reaction, immunolabeling for LDH was missing in this region. With respect to the distribution of LDH in the interterritorial matrix, a striking decrease from superficial to deeper layers was present in healthy dogs but was missing in affected joints. These results support the contention that LDH in synovial fluid of degenerative joints originates from cartilage. Therefore, we suggest that (1) LDH is transferred from chondrocytes to ECM in both healthy dogs and dogs with degenerative joint disease and that (2) in degenerative joints, LDH is released from chondrocytes and the ECM into synovial fluid through abrasion of cartilage as well as through enhanced diffusion as a result of increased water content and degradation of collagen...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of caudal pole hemi-meniscectomy (CPHM) and {{complete}} medial meniscectomy (MM), specifically with respect to development of secondary osteoarthritis, in the <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> of clinically normal dogs. ANIMALS: 14 large-breed dogs. PROCEDURE: Unilateral CPHM (7 dogs) or MM (7) was performed, and the left <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> served as untreated control joints. Gait was assessed in all dogs before surgery and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks postoperatively. After euthanasia, joints were evaluated grossly; Mankin cartilage scores, subchondral bone density assessment, and articular cartilage proteoglycan extraction and western blot analyses of 3 B 3 (-) and 7 D 4 epitopes were performed. RESULTS: Weight distribution on control limbs exceeded that of treated limbs at 4 and 16 weeks after surgery in the CPHM group and at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery in the MM group; weight distribution was not significantly different between the 2 groups. After 16 weeks, incomplete meniscal regeneration and cartilage fibrillation on the medial aspect of the tibial plateau and medial femoral condyle were detected in treated joints in both groups. Mankin cartilage scores, subchondral bone density, and immunoexpression of 3 B 3 (-) or 7 D 4 in articular cartilage in CPHM- or MM-treated joints were similar; 7 D 4 epitope concentration in synovial fluid was significantly greater in the MM-treated joints than in CPHM-treated joints. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Overall severity of secondary osteoarthritis induced by CPHM and MM was similar. Investigation of 7 D 4 epitope concentration in synovial fluid suggested that CPHM was associated with less disruption of chondrocyte metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the clinical, cytological, and histopathological {{adverse effects of}} intra-articularly injected botulinum toxin A in dogs and to study whether the toxin spreads from the joint after the injection. Methods A longitudinal, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted with six healthy laboratory Beagle dogs. <b>Stifle</b> <b>joints</b> were randomized to receive either 30 IU of onabotulinum toxin A or placebo in a 1 : 1 ratio. Adverse effects and spread of the toxin were examined by evaluating dynamic and static weight-bearing of the injected limbs, by assessing painless range of motion and pain on palpation of joints, and by performing synovial fluid analysis, neurological examination, and electrophysiological recordings at different examination timepoints in a 12 -week period after the injections. The dogs were then euthanized and autopsy and histopathological examination of joint structures and adjacent muscles and nerves were performed. Results Intra-articular botulinum toxin A did not cause local weakness or injection site pain. Instead, static weight-bearing and painless range of motion of <b>stifle</b> <b>joints</b> decreased in the placebo limbs. No clinically significant abnormalities associated with intra-articular botulinum toxin A were detected in the neurological examinations. Electrophysiological recordings showed low compound muscle action potentials in two dogs in the botulinum toxin A-injected limb. No significant changes were detected in the synovial fluid. Autopsy and histopathological examination of the joint and adjacent muscles and nerves did not reveal histopathological adverse effects of the toxin. Conclusion Intra-articular botulinum toxin A does not produce significant clinical, cytological, or histopathological adverse effects in healthy dogs. Based on the electrophysiological recordings, the toxin may spread from the joint, but its clinical impact seems to be low...|$|R
