40|$|The dissociative thesis {{states that}} social {{mobility}} is a disruptive and detrimental {{experience for the}} individual. Despite the absence of convincing evidence either for or against it, this thesis is generally accepted in sociology. I investigate this thesis by considering three dimensions of dissociation—i. e., social isolation, utilitarian individualism, and <b>social</b> <b>disorientation.</b> I use data from a large-scale survey in Flanders (Belgium) and apply Diagonal Reference Models to study consequences of intergenerational social mobility. I ﬁnd support for asymmetric acculturation for each dimension, i. e., upwardly mobile individuals adapt more to the new social status position, compared to downwardly mobile individuals. Moreover, both for <b>social</b> <b>disorientation</b> and utilitarian individualism, I ﬁnd detrimental effects {{of the experience of}} downward social mobility. As I ﬁnd no detrimental consequences of both upward and downward mobility, the results do not provide evidence for the dissociative thesis...|$|E
40|$|The term {{diaspora}} {{is somewhat}} complex and has disputed meanings. This paper defines virtual citizens as residents of online communities with diasporic backgrounds as either intellectuals or with cultural affinity to the homeland in question. Our diasporic discourses are engagements {{through the use}} of new media technology, in cultural dislocation, <b>social</b> <b>disorientation,</b> political discontent, self-disclosure, geographical displacement and, most importantly of difference. Through these engagements this paper highlights some of the roles of diasporic citizens in dealing with the effects of colonial, postcolonial and, capitalist global market economy on the lives of people in their homeland. It analyses how new media technology has redefined diaspora and, through an investigation of some online groups how these diasporic citizens have appropriated media technologies to reconnect with their homeland as well as help bring to world attention issues confronting developing nations. While the paper takes a broad view of diasporic discourse it focuses attention on Africans in the diaspora. Anyanwu, Chik...|$|E
30|$|Urban areas face {{multiple}} risks: {{they range}} from natural hazard-induced disasters, fires, and building code violations to social risks such as vandalism, crime, and <b>social</b> <b>disorientation,</b> among others. These risks often {{interact with each other}} and cannot be dealt with in isolation. As a means to identify, assess, and manage multiple risks, the concept of “risk governance” has been developed, which promises to provide integrative and comprehensive tools to deal with the many manifestations of risks. In this article, risk governance concept has been specifically applied to complex risk situations in urban areas. The concept of risk governance pertains to the many ways in which multiple actors, individuals and institutions, public and private, deal with risks. It includes formal institutions and regimes and informal arrangements. The article first develops an adaptive and integrative model of risk governance and applies this model to the urban environments. After a short summary of the roots of risk governance, key concepts, such as simple, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous risks, are discussed. The main emphasis is on each of the five phases of risk governance: pre-estimation, interdisciplinary assessment, risk evaluation, risk management, and risk communication.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, the subject of trust {{has become one of}} the central {{research}} topics in sociology and political science. Various theoretical approaches have crystallized, and an immense amount of empirical data has been collected. The focus on trust is for two kinds of reasons. One has to do with immanent developments in the social sciences. We have witnessed a turn from almost exclusive preoccupation with the macro-social level, that is the organizational, systemic or structuralist images of society, toward the micro-foundations of social life; that is, everyday actions and interactions, including their soft dimensions, mental and cultural intangibles and imponderables. Another set of reasons has to do with the changing quality of social structures and social processes in the late-modern period. The ascendance of democracy means that the role of human agency is growing, and more depends on what common people think and do, how they feel toward others and toward their rulers and how they choose to participate and cooperate. The process of globalization means that more and more of the factors impinging on everyday life of people are non-transparent, unfamiliar and distant, demanding new type of attitudes. The expansion of risk means that people have to act more often than before in conditions of uncertainty. The traumas of rapid, comprehensive and often unexpected <b>social</b> change produce <b>disorientation</b> and a loss of existential security. If the ambition of sociology to become the reflexive awareness of society is to be realized, then the current interest in trust seems to be wholly warranted. ...|$|R
40|$|The 'increase of scale' as {{a process}} of social change has a {{detrimental}} effect on many small communities in the country. The number of inhabitants in some hamlets, villages, country-towns and other small rural communities is decreasing; small communities have lost to some extent their function as trade centres. A lot of people living in many of these small country communities dislike this process of decline. This study has been focused on a twofold problem: 1. What changes have taken place in the distribution of both population and provisions in the countryside during the last decades? Which factors have influenced this process? 2. What effect does the change in distribution of both population and provisions have on rural people? How do these people, particularly in small communities, react to this change and how can the way they react be explained? Hence this study has two parts: Part I looks from the outside at the social forces that affect the development of cummunities. Part II discusses the social life within these rural communities that are under stress from the 'increase of scale'. In Part I, processes of social change are considered that may be connected with the difficulties many small rural communities are facing. In the general concept of 'increase of scale' three aspects can be distinguished: physical, structural and mental. The increase of scale in the physical sense is defined as the increase in number of members of social units and the enlargement of spatial units (e. g. plots, number of buildings). With the increase of the structural scale both individuals and social units are involved in more embracing networks of interaction and communication. The increase of the mental scale includes changes in the culture of a historical-geographical group (e. g. village-community, city-community, national community) by which the affective ties of its members with the group as a whole diminish. Then the norms, expectations and values of the members change to those of the 'higher ranking' historical-geographical groups. In this study the concept of the small rural community is defined as an aggregation of individuals who a. live together in a centre of limited size or else both in a centre and on scattered holdings; b. do not need to go to other places for at least a part of their daily necessities; c. are characterized by a certain awareness of a collective identity that has resulted from their living together. First some theoretical starting-points and concepts are discussed. Then the number and the geographical distribution of small rural communities, in the Netherlands as well as in other countries in Europe and in Northern America, are considered. The history of the patterns of villages and other rural communities is discussed in detail, particularly for the Netherlands. It was concluded that the degree of autonomy that a rural community had in the past was of great importance to its present social status. This applies not only to towns, but also to boroughs, villages, hamlets and so on. Chapter 4 is devoted to population change of rural communities and how it can be influenced by community size, distance to an urban centre, the economic region in which the community is situated, relative size of population occupied in agriculture, type of farming area and level of retail and service facilities. For each of these factors data from the literature are discussed. Additional data are provided from an investigation into the development of size of Dutch rural communities. For this study, statistics were taken from the censuses held in 1947, 1956 and 1960. The results supported HART and SALISBURY (1965, p. 157) who came to the somewhat pessimistic conclusion that'population growth and decline, even in the village, is far too complex a phenomenon to permit of any simple explanation'. Moreover it appeared that a quantitative approach to the small rural community problem has to be characterized as partial, because it is mainly directed to the physical aspect of the increase of scale process. The last chapter of Part I describes how small rural communities have developed to provide rural people with retail and service facilities. In particular, attention is paid to shopkeepers and artisans, primary schools, religious care, voluntary associations, government and other provisions. From the data it was concluded that in the Netherlands the geographical distribution of provisions has become concentrated {{at the expense of the}} small rural communities. However, there was a marked difference generally betweeen material provisions and social and cultural facilities. In small rural communities the latter, especially primary schools, were scarcely decreasing in number but there appeared to be an obvious concentration of most of the material provisions. Part II also starts with theoretical reflections. Firstly, as small rural communities in the western World generally may be considered as social groups, it is suggested that when small rural communities lose some or all of their functions, their inhabitants usually value their living conditions negatively. Secondly, attention is paid to the various ways small rural communities could react to a physical or structural increase of scale. With the help of literature, five states of reaction are described: a. social isolation, b. <b>social</b> tension, c. <b>disorientation,</b> d. integration, c. assimilation. Thirdly, the concept of locality group identification (Dutch: dorpsbinding) is defined as the phenomenon by which people feel themselves emotionally tied to their local society. Locality group identification can only occur if the local society is symbolized by ail object of a material or non-material nature. This object must refer to the social life of the local community concerned. This concept of locality group identification explains to a great extent the way small rural communities are reacting to increase of scale. Chapter 7 deals with the design of the investigation into the second part of the problem. Random samples of adolescents, and adults, both male and female, were interviewed by means of structured schedules. Then a short description is given of the four Dutch rural areas in which data were collected between 1963 and 1965 both by formal and informal interviews. Chapter 9 contains a synopsis and comments of the informal interviews (about 150 in number) with key-persons in the four areas. After these interviews, the preliminary hypotheses made in Chapter 6 were reformulated. The definite hypotheses on the reaction of people living in small rural communities to increase of scale are as follows: 1. In spite of the decline in retail and service facilities, people living in small rural communities value their living conditions positively. 2. Because many inhabitants of small rural communities identify themselves strongly with their local society: a. they direct themselves to their own locality to a high degree, at least for their daily necessities, b. they must act according to precise norms which means making as much use as possible of the provisions their community offers, c. they have a limited social horizon. 3. The locality group identification is connected with a number of variables such as duration of living in the present place of residence, age, occupation, religious denomination and position held in the local leadership structure. In Chapter 10 the hypothesis first mentioned is tested. In each rural area, 30 to 50 percent of the respondents living in small communities valued their living conditions negatively. There was an obvious connection between the evaluation of the living conditions and the degree of locality group identification. Therefore for rural people living in small communities the social relationships, especially those in their own local community, must be considered as more important for their welfare than providing them with goods and services. Data taken from the formal interviews showed that in all of the small communities three quarters or more of the respondents identified themselves strongly with their local community. In contrast to hypothesis 2 a, it appeared that in general only a week connection existed between a strong locality group identification and the direction of the respondents to their own locality to satisfy both material and non-material needs. At least in two of the areas concerned, there were rather precise norms in making use of the local provisions. The last part of hypothesis 2 was confirmed. In Chapter 12 on the basis of the formal interview data the locality group identification is analysed further. The hypothesized connection between this phenomenon and many variables became evident. The results of investigating the connection between the degree of locality group identification and the position held in the local leadership structure were surprising. In one of the areas, local leaders had an obviously stronger locality group identification than their followers, whereas in another area in which also many of the respondents identified themselves strongly with the local community, the result was the reverse. Therefore locality group identification has to be considered a more central value in the former area than in the latter. In my final remarks, I give my opinions on the significance of some findings to policy on rural physical planning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} different aspects of identity among the students of Tehran universities with a focus on the role of sex differences. The statistical universe included all the students who were studying at Tehran universities. The samples included 1004 cases that were selected by stratified random sampling. Religious and national identity scale and the revised identity style questionnaire were the devices used in this study. Multiple-variance analysis of variance was applied for the purpose of data analysis. The results of the study indicated that: regarding the three sub-scales of information, normative and commitment identity style, the female group had (got) higher means compared to the male group. This is while the male group showed a higher mean in the sub-scale of diffuse/avoidance; the female group showed a higher mean in all the sub-scales of national and religious identity. On the whole, the present study revealed that all the sub-scales of religiosity, psychological well-being, information, normative and commitment identity, religious and national identity are higher in the female students compared to the male students, whereas the diffuse and avoidance identity was higher in the male students. In general, these findings prove psychological and <b>social</b> <b>disorientation</b> among the male students in comparison to the female group. Since the male population (community) of the society is considered as more active and dynamic, this issue needs the serious consideration of those in charge...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{brings into}} sharper focus {{the crisis of}} care in our society which underlies {{the politics of the}} welfare state. It explores points of vulnerability in the liberal, professional-bureaucratic approach to care which the New Right has been able to exploit in undermining support for much needed public sector human services. It argues that we need to move beyond conservative, liberal, and orthodox Marxist approaches to care, in favor of a socialist-feminist, communitarian approach which recognizes the need for mutual support in dealing with our common human vulnerability. This approach makes the super-exploitation and devaluation of women 2 ̆ 7 s caring capacities, within home and state, and the underdevelopment of men 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to care, a central issue. The void of mutual supportiveness, combined with prolonged economic insecurity and <b>social</b> <b>disorientation,</b> has given rise to a level of personal anxiety and pain that has reached crisis proportions, outstripping the professional-managerial capacity of the liberal welfare state to contain, and increasing the power of the right. Human service practitioners are caught in a severe bind as they attempt to fill this support void, while being bound by a set of professional-hierarchical and fiscal constraints not of their own making. The thesis concludes with a vision of service in which the professional-hierarchical and gender defined social relations of care are transformed to enhance our capacity to care for one another as an ongoing, mutually shared part of our life activity. It points to the black and white working class women, who are the main providers and recipients of state human services, as an important and underacknowledged source of insight and leadership in undertaking these changes upon which our social survival and growth depends. ...|$|E
40|$|Out of Hand: Experimental Media Practices by Women surveys a 30 -year {{history of}} feminist media production, {{including}} film, video, installation, and new media, charting the projects {{of artists who}} work tactically, using the term as it is defined by French theorist Michel de Certeau. ❧ The study charts shifts in technology, working methods, feminist issues, {{and the notion of}} an alternative media practice within the United States, focusing mainly on feminist media projects from 1990 forward. The study also situates these projects in the larger contexts of the history of avantgarde cinema, video art, and the art world, illustrating links to the poststructuralist tactics of appropriation, narrative experimentation, and identity subversion that characterize feminist artwork in general. The study also tackles the ways in which contemporary feminist media artists are continuing to grapple with how to understand and resist the sense of political and <b>social</b> <b>disorientation</b> that in the early 1990 s helped reduce what remained of a feminist movement to near non-existence. Another issue asks where, as the entertainment, telecommunication, and international business industries continue to merge, should political resistance occur? ❧ Underlying these larger political questions is the ongoing project of rethinking the subject, dramatically questioned in terms of the matrix of race, class, and gender in 1960 s experimental film and video and now reconfigured with attention to phenomenological inflections of the wcrld around us, and to technology. A third issue is that of the body, now understood to be thoroughly imbricated in technology such that the boundary separating body and machine has become malleable, with one the supplement to the other. While much attention has been paid in feminist analysis to the political insurgency of the notion of the cyborg, the complex interconnectedness of the body, both physical and psychic, within an increasingly altered conception of space and time, demands more consideration. Finally, the destabilization of the spatial realm and the rethinking of our abilities for cognitive mapping are radically altering how we conceptualize all acts, and therefore the very possibility for resistance...|$|E
40|$|As a site, it {{resonates with}} a {{layering}} of dislocations and exchanges, a reshaping of languages, ideologies and histories. Occasionally these coalesce into a potent symbol of historical forces and human drama. The Berlin Wall is one example. Another is the fourteen miles {{of steel and}} barbwire fence that separates San Diego and Southern California from Tijuana and Northern Mexico. Built on sediments of colonial history (when California was a Spanish possession and Franciscan missionaries sought the conquest of indigenous souls) and nineteenth-century American expansion (gold rushes, Mexican-American wars and Manifest Destiny), San Diego and Tijuana are cities whose stark contrast belies their irrevocably intertwined existence. While Tijuana evokes a cliche Hollywood image as a dusty border town, with shanties, saloons, and vendors hawking wide-brimmed sombreros and colourful ponchos in a steamy noonday sun, it is the fastest growing city in Mexico, with immigrants from {{every state in the}} country coming to work in the maquiladores (branch-plant factories) for a dollar an hour or to wait to cross the border. Its stately avenues, lined with art-deco facades, are thronged with people. The Centro Cultural Tijuana, with its vast exterior plaza and cavernous interior antechamber, is a marble showcase for the city's economic and cultural ascendancy. While Thomas Glassford probed the banality of San Diego's leisure industry, Betsabee Romero constructed a hybrid shrine to the cultural distinctiveness of Tijuana. To encounter Glassford's City of Greens, one only needed inquire about the attractions of San Diego at the tourist office. To reach Romero's Jute Car installation required a trek through Tijuana, in which paved roads led to dirt ones and to the ramshackle houses of Colonia Libertad, perched {{at the edge of the}} border fence. On a hillside cliff above the shacks, Romero placed an old car decorated with the intricate designs of Mexican folk art and stuffed with dried roses. Made in Mexico City and transported to Colonia Libertad, it reverberated with historical echoes that reached back in time to the appearance, on a hillside outside Mexico City, of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531. The first Virgin of the Americas of indigenous origin, Guadalupe became the patron saint of the poor and downtrodden, an icon carried into, the Independence Wars of the eighteen-hundreds by a rabble army led by the priest Hidalgo. In decorating a car in motifs that traditionally bordered Guadalupe's image, Romero imbued a fetish object of power and speed with a centuries-old patina of miracles and spirituality. While many of the Mexican artists drew upon strategies of pastiche and the appropriation of kitsch to politicize and vindicate the cultural differences between San Diego and Tijuana, other artists were less concerned with exposing the cultural mores of the border region than with reflecting the spatial and <b>social</b> <b>disorientation</b> engendered by the border experience. In contrast to the cultural specificity of Romero and Ruben Ortiz Torres's hybrid cars, Kim Adams constructed a nomad vehicle that crossed borders and cultures. Fusing two children's bicycles, so that the front wheels and handlebars were attached to a single middle wheel, Adams left these playful concoctions in various locations in San Diego and Tijuana for children to find and adopt. A tongue-in-cheek metaphor for the border, Adams's intervention pivoted on the process by which the children who stumbled across his bicycles resolved the dilemma of their mutated function. Like the border itself, his vehicles required an inordinate degree of cooperation or, alternatively, an act of severing the bicycles in two...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis on}} the {{dynamics}} of ancient tula wells cultural landscape {{is an attempt to}} integrate Environmental and Social History. The thesis advances knowledge on ancient water systems, of which past recorded knowledge is meagre. The thesis has two fundamental sections: A (introductory) and B (individual study papers). The first part introduces important concepts and provides background and theoretical information for reconstructing the environmental and social history of ancient water systems. The thesis approached environmental reconstruction using oral time recall systems based on the indigenous time recall system of the Borana for understanding the impacts of natural disasters, socio-political perturbations and human responses on this ancient water system. This thesis has followed the tradition of previous historians working on environmental history of the lacustrine lakes of East Africa which used oral sources to reconstruct several centuries of environmental and social change. With brief discussions of the roles of the ancient water systems in transforming the water deficient regions of the world, the thesis situates {{the dynamics of}} ancient tula wells in the contemporary debates of African environmental and social history. The second part (Part B) comprises four articles. The individual papers present an analysis of the impacts of natural disasters, socio-political perturbations, human responses (Papers I & II), human perceptions of land use changes (Paper III), and labour and technological transformations in the utilizations of tula wells (Paper IV). Paper I reconstructs environmental and social history of the ancient tula wells. The tula well in southern Ethiopia represents a unique water-cultural landscape wherein the well is linked to sustainable pastoral production, clan social identity, religious and ritual practices, and political debates of the community. The Borana pastoralists explain the pivotal role of tula wells by linking the wells to family, cattle economy, and peace of Borana (nagaa Borana). This water system has been modified by centuries of natural disasters, sociopolitical perturbations and human actions. The dynamics reflect the historical imprints of natural disasters (epidemics, droughts, excessive rainfalls or floods, famine, etc.) and sociopolitical perturbations (social disharmony, disunity, and political perturbations) that induced human adaptive responses. The Borana oral sources explain the dynamics of tula wells using three interrelated Borana concepts: gogessa (patri-class), maqabas (cyclical name) and dhaaccii (predestined event repetitions). The concepts provide time experts with tools to memorize and narrate environmental and socio political perturbations and human responses in understanding the dynamics of tula wells. These interconnected and complex concepts define the cycles and replications of events in historical perspectives. In the cycles of maqabas and gogessa, natural disasters and socio-political perturbations that affected {{at least one of the}} three interdependent and important aspects of Borana pastoral system (wells, cattle economy, and family or human demography) served as historical markers and references for time recollection. Corroborating the oral sources with proxy environmental data, the thesis reconstructs the impact of natural disasters, socio-political perturbations, and human responses on the cultural landscape of tula wells. The study shows that Epidemics, droughts, famines, and excessive rainfall or floods are key environmental perturbations in the ancient tula wells cultural landscape. Epidemics and droughts collapse cattle economy and human demography, denying the tula wells the most important inputs forcing the Borana to abandon many tula wells. Floods on the other hand have repeatedly hit tula wells, filling the well shafts and collapsing the walls. The Borana pastoralists responded to such environmental vagaries through rehabilitation and reexcavation of the collapsed wells. This has been dependent on the status of the pastoral economy and availability of human labour. The imbalance between the number of collapsed and re-excavated wells caused higher proportion of the wells to remain dysfunctional. The natural disasters are closely linked to socio-political perturbations that influenced the operation and management of tula wells. Socio-political perturbations weakened the social institutions and society’s capacity to mitigate disasters or cope with and manage recovery processes, revoking human stewardship. Paper II presents detailed descriptions of the impact of the rinderpest epizootic on cattle economy, the consequent famine, and human responses. The impact is remembered by the Borana oral sources as ciinna − termination or discontinuity. Ciinna refers to the total collapse of social, economic, political and cultural lives of the pastoral society. The collapse of cattle economy and consequent famine created <b>social</b> <b>disorientation</b> and disharmony that dispersed the society into bush, exposing them to wild beasts. The term ciinna explains not only the extent of damage caused to the pastoral economy but also the incapacitation of the social system that limited the human responses to the multiple disasters that occurred simultaneously. The damages are remembered in terms of economic collapse, human emographic decline, dispersion of families and clans, the practice of pawning children, and the crises in social identity. The <b>social</b> <b>disorientation</b> and disorganization was reversed soon after the disaster by Borana indigenous institutions that reorganized the society, enabling concerted actions. Despite the historical facts that show the resilience of Borana social institutions, the combined effect of repeated natural disasters, socio-political perturbations, external intervention, and internal dynamics have played significant roles in transforming tula wells cultural landscape and the institutions that mobilized human labour and cattle economy to re-excavate collapsed wells or rehabilitate the functional ones. Paper III presents societal perceptions of tula wells cultural landscape changes. In recent years, the dynamics of tula wells and the cultural landscapes are associated with land use changes (e. g. change in settlement patterns and expansion of crop cultivation). Peri-urban centres have been established in every well cluster in the last four decades, while traditional settlements have shown steady movement into well zones during the same period. Similarly, crop cultivation has shown dramatic increase in the well zones, particularly after 1991. These changes disrupted the traditional resource use pattern that reserves the well zones exclusively for livestock grazing during the dry seasons. These changes are considered as severe threats to the operation of tula wells, as they are not governed by aadaa seeraa (customary law) and compete for land resources with livestock. The transformation occurred concomitantly with technology used to dig wells and lift water from the deep tula wells, as well as institutional transformation. Paper IV describes how labour and technological transformations in the utilization of ancient tula wells influenced changes in the operations of these ancient water systems. The technological transformations include changes in water bucket (okole) technology from giraffe hide to plastic jerry cans, tools for well digging changing from rudimentary hand tools to improved metallic tools or heavy earth moving machines. The institutional transformation is revealed in changes in labour organization (from clan-based to hired labour) while the role of the clan in organizing labour shifted to pastoral associations, particularly when external organizations fund the well digging. The Borana also adjusted the economic contribution to fit the timely demand. They now contribute in cash rather than in kind (cattle) for well digging. The transformations brought structural transformation in the wells that increased water yield and eased access to water. However, the long term impacts of the transformations are not clear. Currently, pastoralists use the most yielding wells, which is more likely to leave many of the less yielding wells in a disused state. In conclusion, the dynamics of tula wells cultural landscape are the cumulative effects of natural disasters, socio-political perturbations, and human actions. The human-environment relations are reciprocal and the influences are not linear...|$|E
