40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the potential benefits}} of Fast Fill Fast Empty (hereafter known as FFFE) valves to patient compliance. It uses the 3 M ™ Face <b>Seal</b> <b>Valve,</b> a 3 M developed FFFE valve, with two differing suspension formulations. 3 M Face Seal Valves were fitted to pMDIs (pressurised metered dose inhalers), filled with these formulations, and placed in a 40 °C / 75 % RH environment for 1 month. Through Life Uniformity of Delivered Dose (TLUoDD), Patient Simulation and Loss of Dose (LoD) testing were performed on both of the formulations. This paper aims to illustrate, using the results based on the aforementioned testing, the benefits of FFFE valves to patient compliance...|$|E

50|$|Bottom {{blowdown}} piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the <b>sealing</b> <b>valve,</b> and the other as the blowdown <b>valve.</b> The <b>sealing</b> <b>valve</b> is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|R

40|$|For commercial, military, and {{aerospace}} applications, low-cost, small, reliable, and lightweight gas and liquid hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>valves</b> with post initiation on/off capability are highly desirable for pressurized systems. Applications include remote fire suppression, single-use system-pressurization systems, spacecraft propellant systems, and in situ instruments. Current pyrotechnic- activated rupture disk hermetic valves {{were designed for}} physically larger systems and are heavy and integrate poorly with portable equipment, aircraft, and small spacecraft and instrument systems. Additionally, current pyrotechnically activated systems impart high g-force shock loads to surrounding components and structures, which {{increase the risk of}} damage and can require additional mitigation. The disclosed mechanism addresses the need for producing a hermetically <b>sealed</b> micro-isolation <b>valve</b> for low and high pressure for commercial, aerospace, and spacecraft applications. High-precision electrical discharge machining (EDM) parts allow for the machining of mated parts with gaps less than a thousandth of an inch. These high-precision parts are used to support against pressure and extrusion, a thin hermetically welded diaphragm. This diaphragm ruptures from a pressure differential when the support is removed and/or when the plunger is forced against the diaphragm. With the addition of conventional seals to the plunger and a two-way actuator, a derivative of this design would allow nonhermetic use as an on/off or metering valve after the initial rupturing of the hermetic sealing disk. In addition, in a single-use hermetically <b>sealed</b> isolation <b>valve,</b> the valve can be activated without the use of potential leak-inducing valve body penetrations. One implementation of this technology is a high-pressure, high-flow-rate rupture valve that is self-rupturing, which is advantageous for high-pressure applications such as gas isolation valves. Once initiated, this technology is self-energizing and requires low force compared to current pyrotechnic-based burst disk hermetic valves. This is a novel design for producing a single-use, self-rupturing, hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>valve</b> for isolation of pressurized gas and/or liquids. This design can also be applied for single-use disposable valves for chemical instruments. A welded foil diaphragm is fully supported by two mated surfaces that are machined to micron accuracies using EDM. To open the valve, one of the surfaces is moved relative to the other to (a) remove the support creating an unsupported diaphragm that ruptures due to over pressure, and/or (b) produce tension in the diaphragm and rupture it...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new non-intrusive methodology for testing the seal quality of inline stop valves. An inline stop valve {{is a common}} element of the water supply system, both in large diameter transmission pipelines and in distribution networks. A good quality <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> is essential for executing an isolation procedure. The proposed technique uses an artificially generated hydraulic transient to test the <b>valve</b> <b>seal.</b> The <b>valve</b> resistance coefficient, {{the diameter of the}} orifice that is equivalent to the open area of the valve and the discharge rate through the valve are derived based on the reflection of the transient wave from the closed valve. The method provides a quick and inexpensive way of identifying inline stop valves that fail to seal and allows operators to rate their condition without internal access to the pipe.

25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or dry suits. These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically <b>sealing</b> <b>valve</b> which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|R
