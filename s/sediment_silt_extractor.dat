Establishing the primary drivers of present day diatom community composition is a vital step in their use as a proxy for past conditions. Moreton Bay, Australia, has experienced extensive modification of its catchments and western and southern shorelines. Regional weather patterns and terrestrial runoff have created a gradient in water quality from relatively degraded western and southern areas to relatively pristine northern and eastern areas. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relative impact of short term changes to light and/or nutrient availability and long term changes in sediment type, light and nutrient availability to subtidal benthic community composition. Short term changes were imposed using a manipulative field experiment whilst long term changes were obtained from a field survey of sites across the gradient of water quality. Diatoms were found to be the dominant microalgal group at all studied sites. The diatom communities were comprised primarily of small benthic epipsammic species and community composition was primarily driven by changes in <b>sediment</b> <b>silt</b> content. Short term changes in light and/or nutrient availability had little impact on community composition. In this open estuarine system the use of diatom indices to infer past water quality must take into account the <b>sediment</b> <b>silt</b> content in their interpretations...|$|R

5000|$|Columbia {{is located}} in a region of massive granite {{intrusion}} that was glaciated in the Wisconsin age. The glacier caused till (unsorted, poorly drained soil) to be deposited over the entire region. This poorly drained till formed bogs and ponds and altered the drainage pattern. The underlying granite caused the till to be more thickly deposited on the northwest sides of ridges: on the southeast sides boulders were [...] "plucked" [...] and transported further south. Thick till deposits are also found in bedrock [...] "valleys" [...] and depressions. The weight of the ice (in some places a mile thick) caused the land to be depressed in relation {{to the level of the}} sea. Marine <b>sediments</b> (<b>silts</b> and clays) were deposited in valleys and more sheltered locations. The release of pressure due to the melting allowed the land to rise slowly. This explains why silt and clay deposits can be found at elevations of 100 ft or more.

5000|$|Like all dams, Glen Canyon traps <b>sediment</b> (<b>silt),</b> {{but because}} the Colorado is an {{especially}} muddy river, the dam has posed even more visible consequences for the river within the Grand Canyon. About 100 million US tons (90,700,000 metric tons) of sediment are trapped behind the dam annually, equal to about 30,000 dump truck loads per day. Because of the dam, sediment deposited by the Colorado and its tributaries is slowly filling up the canyon, and projections put the useful life of the reservoir at 300 to 700 years. If no action is taken such as dredging or sediment sluicing, in a few hundred years, sediment deposits will begin to build up {{at the foot of}} the dam and will gradually block the different outlets, reducing the dam's capacity to store and release water. Thus, it would become more difficult to maintain the required release of [...] below the dam. The Colorado River would reduce to a trickle in dry seasons as it naturally did before the dam was built, potentially compromising the water supply of the Lower Basin states.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the major}} impacts {{downstream}} is deposition of sediment. But erosion and deposition are extremely complex processes, and the topic serves mainly to illustrate the complexity of upstream-downstream linkages. The finest <b>sediment,</b> <b>silt,</b> is generally beneficial and {{is the source of}} the high fertility of the alluvial plains. Preventing conveyance and deposition of silt will have a negative impact on soil fertility in the plains. Equally, large deposits of coarse sediment brought down in flood conditions can completely cover previously fertile land (ICIMOD [2009]), and preventing this would be positive. Because of the high sediment load, the main channel of the Koshi river in eastern Nepal shifted westward by about 115 km over more than 220 years (Gole and Chitale [1966]; Thakur and Tamrakar [2001]). Further movement was halted by construction of a barrage and embankment system at the start of the plains area to control flooding and provide irrigation water. In 2008, a major breach of the embankment resulted in an avulsion of the river, which picked up an old channel 120 km to the east, resulting in large-scale inundation of several districts in Nepal and India and devastation of the affected area, affecting a population of 4.8 million (Dixit [2009]). Such events serve to illustrate the close linkages between upstream interventions and downstream impacts, and highlight the need for cooperation between upstream and downstream areas within and between countries.|$|R
