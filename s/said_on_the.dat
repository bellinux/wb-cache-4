25|$|Similarly, most forums allow {{users to}} define a {{signature}} (sometimes called a sig), which is a block of text, possibly with BBCode, which appears {{at the bottom of}} all of the user's posts. There is a character limit on signatures, though it may be so high that it is rarely hit. Often the forum's moderators impose manual rules on signatures to prevent them from being obnoxious (for example, being extremely long or having flashing images), and issue warnings or bans to users who break these rules. Like avatars, signatures may improve the recognizability of a poster. They may also allow the user to attach information to all of their posts, such as proclaiming support for a cause, noting facts about themselves, or quoting humorous things that have previously been <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forum.|$|E

He told the court that he had gone to Via della Pergola7 on a date arranged with Kercher, after meeting her the previous evening. Two neighbours of Guede's, foreign female students who were with him at a nightclub on that evening, told police the only girl they saw him talking to had long blonde hair. Guede said Kercher had let him in the cottage around 9pm. Sollecito's lawyers said a glass fragment from the window found beside a shoe-print of Guede's {{at the scene of the}} crime was proof that Guede had broken in.|$|E

25|$|Empire Drayton was {{transferred}} to the Belgian Government shortly after completion. She was placed under the management of Compagnie Maritime Belge SA, but would later be managed by Agence Maritime Internationale. She departed from the Tyne on 10 March 1942 to join Convoy FN 651, which had departed from Southend, Essex the previous day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 11 March. She then joined Convoy EN 58, which departed on 13 March and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 16 March. Belgian Sailor left the convoy at Loch Ewe and sailed to New York, United States, where she arrived on 2 April. She departed from New York on 28 April for Cape Town, South Africa, arriving on 4 June. Over the next four months, Belgian Sailor made a round trip to Alexandria, Egypt, calling at Durban, Aden, Port Sudan, Suez and Port <b>Said</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outward voyage, and Port Said, Suez, Aden and Lourenço Marques, Mozambique on the return voyage.

25|$|In 1946 {{he went to}} University of the Witwatersrand (more {{commonly}} known as Wits University) in Johannesburg {{with the help of}} a Government loan and grant, where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo. He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> National Party victory that “To me, they were the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported.” He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.|$|E
