One frequently encountered technical difficulty when removing an infected prosthetic aortic graft {{is how to}} close a short, friable remnant aortic stump. We present three case reports in which we used a layer of posterior rectus fascia-peritoneum to bolster oversewing a short infected aortic <b>stump</b> after <b>removal</b> of an infected aortic graft. All three patients underwent staged extra-anatomic axillary-to-femoral artery bypass procedures, with subsequent removal of the infected aortic graft as a second operation. Two of the three procedures were semi-elective, and one was done urgently because of a recurrent aortoenteric fistula. All three patients had less than 1 cm of remaining aortic neck below the renal arteries for closure. In each instance a segment of autogenous posterior rectus fascia-peritoneum was harvested and used as a circumferential pledget to bolster the anastomosis. No patient had stump blowout, and in no case was there computed tomography evidence of aneurysmal enlargement of the stump with follow-up of 12 and 24 months {{in two of the}} three survivors.

The plan called {{for the construction of a}} parking lot in close proximity to site 41 CM 25, an Archaic-period cemetery. The investigation was to determine whether the proposed construction would impact site 41 CM 25 or other prehistoric and/or historic features. CAR staff conducted a pedestrian survey of the project area, shovel tested in the footprint of the proposed parking lot, and monitored tree <b>stump</b> <b>removals</b> and subsurface grading necessary for the parking lot construction. In addition, two backhoe trenches were excavated and one geological profile was described. The testing and monitoring uncovered various prehistoric and historic artifacts in good archaeological and geological contexts. Most of the artifacts were prehistoric and included chert flakes, cores, mussel shell, and fire-cracked rock. One diagnostic artifact-a Pedemales point-was uncovered, tentatively assigning the site to the Middle Archaic period. The results of the geological profile, in conjunction with background research, suggest that the project area is located on the edge of a distinctive geological zone in which the burial site of 41 CM 25 is located. The testing and monitoring concluded that numerous buried cultural deposits are located in the project area and that the presence of buried cultural features is also highly probable. However, due to the relatively shallow depth required for the footings of the parking lot, these deposits and features will not be significantly impacted by the construction process. In addition, the close proximity of the project area to the existing site 41 CM 25, combined with the geological evidence, suggests that this area is one contiguous site. Therefore, we recommend that the boundaries of site 41 CM 25 be extended to include the project area and that any future development of 41 CM 25 and/or the project area be closely monitored and evaluated by archaeologists...|$|R

Special focus is placed on utilization of biomass residues, which are considered to cause low environmental impacts. We used the dataset from the latest European Commission document on the sustainability of solid and gaseous biomass (SWD 2014 259), complementing those results by: i) designing three pathways for domestic-heat production using forest logging residues, with different combustion technologies; ii) expanding the analysis to include forest carbon stock development with and without bioenergy; iii) using absolute climate metrics to assess the surface temperature response {{by the end of}} the century to a bioenergy and a reference fossil system; iv) including multiple climate forcers (well-mixed GHG, near term climate forcers and surface albedo change); iv) quantifying life cycle impacts on acidification, particulate matter emissions and photochemical ozone formation; v) reviewing potential risks for forest ecosystem degradation due to increased removal of residues. Supply-chain GHG savings of the three pathways analysed ranged between 80 % and 96 % compared to a natural gas system, above the 70 % threshold suggested by the EU. However, the climate impact of bioenergy should be assessed by considering also the non-bioenergy uses of the biomass and by including all climate forcers. We calculate the Surface Temperature Response to bioenergy and fossil systems by means of Absolute Global surface Temperature Potential (AGTP) metric. Domestic heating from logging residues is generally beneficial to mitigate the surface temperature increase by 2100 compared to the use of natural gas and other fossil sources. As long as residues with a decay rate in the forest higher than 2. 7 %*yr− 1 are considered as feedstock, investing now in the mobilization of residues for heat production can reduce the temperature increase by 2100 compared to all the fossil sources analysed, both in case of bioenergy as a systemic change or in case of bioenergy as a transitory option. Furthermore, several environmental risks are associated with the removal and use of forest logging residues for bioenergy. These issues concern mostly local air pollution, biodiversity loss and, mainly for <b>stumps</b> <b>removal,</b> physical damage to forest soils. Forest logging residues are not free of environmental risks.

5000|$|The best {{strategy}} to manage this disease {{is to avoid}} infection of stumps. To do this, do not cut trees at major sporulation times, which are summer to late fall, and treat fresh stumps with protectants such as borax, which is registered as cellu-treat or sporax, either as a powder or in aqueous form. These treatments are most effective if done immediately after stump is created (the tree is cut). Other control measures include: use wide spacing when planting to {{reduce the need for}} thinning and reduce the potential root grafts, thin only when spores are less abundant, (January through March), and plant tree species that are less susceptible. Another strategy is to avoid logging injuries as the spores enter through such injuries and infect and kill the tree and begin a disease center.

40|$|Background: Traditionally, {{extensive}} prosthetic arteriovenous (AV) graft {{infection is}} treatedwith graft removal and the arteriotomy or the graft stumps were simplysutured following {{the removal of}} the graft. However, postoperative bleedingmay occur which requires emergent intervention. We report the resultsachieved at our clinic after arteriotomy repair with venous graft interpositionin re-bleeding conditions. Methods: From January 2000 through February 2001, 31 patients with extensive graftinfections underwent graft removal with direct closure of the arteriotomy orgraft stumps at our clinic. Seven of these patients experienced re-bleedingfrom the repaired brachial artery. Six of them received repair of the brachialartery with venous graft interposition and one received brachial artery ligation. Results: Surgery of the infected dialysis graft removal was associated with a high rebleedingrate (22. 6 %) in our group. In this study, we analyzed the preoperativedata, including age, gender, incidence of diabetes mellitus, incidence ofperipheral artery occlusive disease, and preoperative blood culture. Both univariateand multivariate analyses showed that the positive preoperative bloodcultures were the only factors related to postoperative bleeding (Odds Ratio 22. 8, p = 0. 009 < 0. 05).

Conclusion: In the patients with positive blood cultures, we recommended brachial arteryrepair with venous graft interposition rather than simple closure of the arteriotomyor graft <b>stump</b> after <b>removal</b> of the infected graft.

40|$|Incidentally {{to other}} studies, Smith (1) noted that {{removal of the}} {{hypophysis}} in rats {{is followed by a}} decrease in size of the spleen as well as of other viscera and endocrine organs. Daily homeotransplants of anterior hypophysis caused return of the viscera to normal or nearly normal proportions. In a series of immature hypophysectomized dogs, Houssay and Lascano-Gonzalez (2) observed that the arrest of growth of the animals was accompanied by a parallel cessation of growth of the spleen. The number of Malpighian corpuscles was more numerous in the hypophysectomized than in the control animals, and these were larger in size. In dogs hypophysectomized after the age of 10 weeks, the follicles of the spleen were more numerous but not larger than in the controls. The rhythm of splenic contraction diminished in the hypophysectomized dog. They concluded, however, that there is no atrophy of the spleen in this animal following removal of the hypophysis.

Discrepancies in the conclusions from Northern blotting and in situ hybridization experiments were also noted in the case of tubulin mRNA changes at long intervals after axotomy. in situ hybridization data derived from the large-sized DRG neurons using a coding region β-tubulin cDNA (which recognizes both βII and βIII mRNAs) showed complete recovery of β-tubulin mRNA levels in surviving, large-sized DRG neurons after crush axotomy, but significantly elevated tubulin mRNA levels in surviving large DRG cells at 12 weeks after cut/ligation axotomy. In contrast, Northern blotting results indicated that βII-tubulin mRNA levels in the crush axotomy condition remained elevated relative to control while they were substantially lower than control in cut/ligation axotomy samples. Results from analysis of βIII-tubulin mRNA changes were not conclusive. The lack of complete correspondence in the results from the two different methods of analysis of mRNA changes (blotting vs. in situ) is likely to be due to selective loss of large-sized DRG neurons in the long-standing cut/ligation injury condition. This would influence results from blotting data, where RNA is derived from the DRG as a whole, more so than in situ hybridization experiments which specifically focus on the surviving largesized neurons.
