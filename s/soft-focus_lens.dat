50|$|He {{was born}} in New York, New York, in 1886. After an illness in high school, Karl's father, Henry, removed his son from school and placed him as a labor {{operator}} at Seybel & Struss bonnet wire factory. He began to develop an interest in photography, experimenting with an 8 x 10 camera, and, beginning in 1908, attended Clarence H. White's evening photography course at Teachers College, Columbia University. Early in his studies, he explored the properties of camera lenses and eventually invented, in 1909, what he attempted to patent as the Struss Pictorial Lens, a <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lens.</b> This lens was considered popular with pictorial photographers of the time. The Struss Pictorial lens was the first <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lens</b> introduced into the motion picture industry in 1916.|$|E
50|$|The Perscheid lens was {{developed}} around 1920. It is a <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lens</b> {{with a wide}} depth of field, produced by Emil Busch AG after the specifications of Perscheid. The lens is designed especially for large format portrait photography. Ariga introduced the Perscheid lens in Japan, where it became very popular amongst Japanese portrait photographers of the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|The Smooth Trans Focus (STF) {{technology}} in photographic lenses uses an apodization filter to realize notably smooth bokeh with rounded out-of-focus highlights {{in both the}} foreground and background. This is accomplished by utilizing a concave neutral-gray tinted lens element next to the aperture blades as apodization filter, a technology originally invented (and patented) by Minolta in the 1980s, and first implemented in a commercially available lens in 1999. In contrast to <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> STF lenses render a perfectly sharp image in the focus plane.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{produced}} by Minolta, and currently {{produced by}} Sony, the STF 135mm f/2.8 T4.5 is a photographic lens compatible with cameras using the Minolta AF and Sony α A-mount. STF stands for Smooth Trans Focus, {{in reference to}} its special optical system, which is intended to smooth the transition between the plane of focus and out-of-focus areas in the image. This is accomplished {{by the use of}} an apodization filter that provides the high-quality bokeh effect. The lens is not a <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Around 1976/77 Tice {{acquired}} a Fujica <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lens,</b> {{and in this}} he found another avenue to explore the history of photography and to invent it once again for his own artistic purposes. He {{was fascinated by the}} firm contours this lens resolved amidst a cloudy glow which emanated from the figure—an effect fundamentally {{different from those of the}} methods employed by modern photographers. Over the next two years he made a series of soft-focus photographs of a girlfriend, Deborah, and three white cats, which belonged to one of his daughters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930 the Leica I Schraubgewinde {{was first}} produced, with an {{exchangeable}} lens {{system based on}} a 39mm diameter screw thread, {{often referred to as}} [...] " [...] Leica Thread Mount" [...] or LTM. In addition to the 50 mm normal lens, a 35 mm wide angle and a 135 mm telephoto lens were initially available. During the mid-1930s, a legendary <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lens,</b> the Thambar 90 mm f/2.2 was designed, and made in small numbers between 1935 and 1949, no more than 3000 units. It is now a rare collectors item.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{retirement}} {{from the military}} in 1902, Puyo was able to devote himself more fully to photography. [...] In an effort to achieve greater artistic effects, Puyo and the Photo Club experimented with gum bichromate and oil pigment processes, and developed special <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> that achieved impressionistic effects. [...] Puyo wrote or co-wrote several books for the club during this period describing these processes in detail.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of special purpose lenses, the most popular being fisheye lenses, which are extreme wide-angle lenses with an angle of view of up to 180 degrees or more, with very noticeable (sometimes intended) distortion. Perspective control <b>lenses</b> and <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> were more popular with film SLRs but are less popular for DSLRs because the same or similar results can be obtained with post-processing software.|$|R
2500|$|During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called [...] "old-school" [...] and [...] "crotchety"—had {{disputes}} over filming. With {{a background in}} independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most {{of the elements of}} the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look. Kurtz stated that [...] "In a couple of scenes [...] rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [...] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment {{about what to do with}} my lights.|$|R
5000|$|Speed-wise, fast lenses (wide aperture) are preferred, {{as these}} allow shallow {{depth of field}} (blurring the {{background}}), which helps isolate the subject from the background and focus attention on them. This is particularly useful in the field, where {{one does not have}} a back drop behind the subject, and the background may be distracting. The details of bokeh in the resulting blur are accordingly also a consideration; some lenses, in particular the [...] "DC" [...] (Defocus Control) types by Nikon, are designed to give the photographer control over this aspect, by providing an additional ring acting only {{on the quality of the}} bokeh, without influencing the foreground (hence, these are not <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses).</b> However, extremely wide apertures are less frequently used, because they have a very shallow depth of field and thus the subject's face will not be completely in focus. Thus, f/1.8 or f/2 is usually the maximum aperture used; f/1.2 or f/1.4 may be used, but the resulting defocus may be considered a special effect - the eyes will be sharp, but the ears and nose will be soft.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the Graflex-branded cameras, {{released}} in 1898, was the Graflex camera, {{also known as the}} Graflex Reflex, or Graflex single lens reflex (SLR). This camera used the same swinging-mirror, through-the-lens viewing mechanism as modern single lens reflex cameras, introduced many decades later, and quickly became popular for sports and press photography in the early 20th century due largely to its use of a focal plane shutter. To produce shutter speeds fast enough to appear to freeze rapid motion, early Graflex cameras employed a cloth shutter with a narrow slit that quickly moved across the film plane, exposing only one small strip at any given moment in its travel. To set the shutter speed, the photographer wound the shutter spring to {{one of a series of}} calculated tensions using a key, and selected the slit width with another control. A table on the side of the box gave the shutter speed for each combination. The Graflex Reflex was also popular among early 20th Century fine art photographers, leading several lens manufacturers to design special <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses,</b> including the famous Wollensak's Verito, to support the camera's creative potential.|$|R
40|$|Francis Watts Lee and {{his family}} hold a unique {{position}} {{in the history of}} photography. Most familiar are photographs of Lee 2 ̆ 7 s daughter Peggy, taken by F. Holland Day, and the striking portrait of Peggy and her mother, Agnes Rand Lee, in Gertrude Käsebier 2 ̆ 7 s composition, Blessed Art Thou among Women. Few may be aware that Francis Watts Lee was a photographer himself, as well as a talented printer, and was largely responsible for introducing the distinctive <b>soft-focus</b> Pinkham/Smith <b>lens</b> to the United States. This article reintroduces Lee to the photographic community, detailing his contributions to the field and reproducing his own work {{for the first time in}} more than a century...|$|R
40|$|Walter Benington (1872 - 1936) {{was a major}} British photographer, {{a member}} of the Linked Ring and a {{colleague}} of international figures such as F H Evans, Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen and Alvin Langdon Coburn. He was also a noted portrait photographer whose sitters included Albert Einstein, Dame Ellen Terry, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and many others. He is, however, rarely noted in current histories of photography. Beaumont Newhall’s 1937 exhibition Photography 1839 - 1937 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York is regarded by many respected critics as one of the foundation-stones of the writing of the history of photography. To establish photography as modern art, Newhall believed it was necessary to create a direct link between the master-works of the earliest photographers and the photographic work of his modernist contemporaries in the USA. He argued that any work which demonstrated intervention by the photographer {{such as the use of}} <b>soft-focus</b> <b>lenses</b> was a deviation from the direct path of photographic progress and must therefore be eliminated from the history of photography. A consequence of this was that he rejected much British photography as being “unphotographic” and dangerously irrelevant. Newhall’s writings inspired many other historians and have helped to perpetuate the neglect of an important period of British photography. As a result, the work of key photographers such as Walter Benington is now virtually unknown. Benington’s central involvement with the Linked Ring and his national and international exhibition successes demonstrate his significance within post- 1890 British photography. Recent moves in the writing of histories of photography have called for the exploration of previously unknown archives and collections. A detailed examination of a cross-section of Benington’s work will illustrate that he was a photographer of great distinction and marked individuality fully worthy of a major reappraisal...|$|R
