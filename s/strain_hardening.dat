Stainless steel and other materials with a high <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> ability also want to form a built up edge.

The structure will be permanently deformed when the load is removed, and may have residual stresses. Engineering metals display <b>strain</b> <b>hardening,</b> which implies that the yield stress is increased after unloading from a yield state. Highly optimized structures, such as airplane beams and components, rely on yielding as a fail-safe failure mode. No safety factor is therefore needed when comparing limit loads (the highest loads expected during normal operation) to yield criteria.|$|E

50|$|High-performance fiber-reinforced {{cementitious}} composites (HPFRCCs) are {{a group of}} fiber-reinforced cement-based composites which possess the unique ability to flex and self-strengthen before fracturing. This particular class of concrete was developed {{with the goal of}} solving the structural problems inherent with today’s typical concrete, such as its tendency to fail in a brittle manner under excessive loading and its lack of long-term durability. Because of their design and composition, HPFRCCs possess the remarkable ability to <b>strain</b> <b>harden</b> under excessive loading. In layman’s terms, this means they have the ability to flex or deform before fracturing, a behavior similar to that exhibited by most metals under tensile or bending stresses. Because of this capability, HPFRCCs are more resistant to cracking and last considerably longer than normal concrete. Another extremely desirable property of HPFRCCs is their low density. A less dense, and hence lighter material means that HPFRCCs could eventually require much less energy to produce and handle, deeming them a more economic building material. Because of HPFRCCs’ lightweight composition and ability to <b>strain</b> <b>harden,</b> it has been proposed that they could eventually become a more durable and efficient alternative to typical concrete.|$|R

It can be defined as rolling that is carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nanostructured materials are produced chiefly by severe plastic deformation processes. The majority of these methods require large plastic deformations (strains much larger than unity). In case of cryorolling, the deformation in the <b>strain</b> <b>hardened</b> metals is preserved {{as a result of the}} suppression of the dynamic recovery.
