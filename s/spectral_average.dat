The purposes of this research were to determine values and variability of sea surface absorption coefficient in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) based on various seasons. The data were collected in spring, summer, and fall seasons in 1999 - 2000 with AC- 9 instrument. The spatial distribution of absorption coefficient showed that relatively high values were generally found along the run off Missisippi, Mobile, Chochawati, Escambia, Apalachicola, and Suwannee rivers, as well as Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, relatively low values were found in offshore region. This pattern followed the distribution pattern of chlorophyll and CDOM.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> which generalises {{the local}} spacing {{distribution}} of the eigenvalues of random N × N hermitian matrices in {{the bulk of their}} spectrum as N → ∞ is known to be a τ-function of the fifth Painlevé system. This τ-function, τ(s), has generic parameters and is transcendental but is characterised by particular boundary conditions about the singular point s = 0, which we determine here. When the average reduces to the local spacing distribution we find that τ-function is of the separatrix, or partially truncated type. 1. Motivations Recent studies [13, 14, 15] have revealed that a generalised <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> for the universality classes of scaled random hermitian matrix ensembles- the bulk, hard edge and soft edge classes for β = 2 - are determined by general transcendental solutions of the Painlevé equations PV, PIII and PII respectively. These works unified earlier studies [19],[23],[24],[25] in the sense that this average includes local eigenvalue spacing distributions and moments of the characteristic polynomials as special cases, and extended them in that the parameter sets of the Painlevé equations were exhausted. As a consequence of this identification the logarithmic derivatives of the spectral averages are Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto σ-functions satisfying second-order second-degree ordinary differential equations. It was noted in the first mentioned works, that while identifying the precise parameters of the Painlevé transcendents involved, the algebraic approach employed could not uniquely specify adequately the boundary conditions that the particular solutions to the differential equations should satisfy. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to rectify this for the bulk scaling case and completely determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations of the σ-form. The plan of our work is as follows- in Section 2 we review the isomonodromic formulation of PVI for generic values of the parameters, give a specific parameterisation of its monodromy matrices and the local expansion of the τ-function about the fixed singularity t = 0. In Section 3 we give the corresponding expansion for...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Frequency and phase drifts are {{a common}} problem in the {{acquisition}} of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. If not accounted for, frequency and phase drifts will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, {{and a reduction in}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present herein a new method for estimating and correcting frequency and phase drifts in in vivo MRS data. METHODS: We used a simple method of fitting each <b>spectral</b> <b>average</b> to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of frequency and phase terms. Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as "spectral registration. " Using simulated data with known frequency and phase drifts, the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels. RESULTS: Spectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both frequency and phase drift estimation. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral registration provides an effective method for frequency and phase drift correction. It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile.
