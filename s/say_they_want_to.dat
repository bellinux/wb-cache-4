500|$|Writing in Salon, David Sirota, a {{progressive}} political commentator compared The Dark Knight Rises {{and the game}} Call of Duty to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: [...] "Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected {{the spirit of the}} Reagan Revolution's conservative backlash, we are now seeing two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the Tea Party's rhetorical backlash to the powerful Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist." [...] An article in Variety reported Chuck Dixon, the co-creator of the Bane character, as saying that Bane is [...] "far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street type if you're looking to cast him politically."

[...] In contrast, liberal commentator Jonathan Chait opined in New York that [...] "What passes for a right-wing movie these days is The Dark Knight Rises, which submits the rather modest premise that, irritating though the rich may be, actually killing them and taking all their stuff might be excessive." [...] Writing in USA Today, Bryan Alexander called Bane [...] "the ultimate occupier" [...] and reported that Christian Bale was amazed that the script had [...] "foreseen" [...] the Occupy movement.|$|E
