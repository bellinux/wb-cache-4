It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter – the world's largest single defence project – for which it designs and manufactures a range of components including the aft fuselage, vertical and horizontal tail and wing tips and fuel system. It also manufactures the Hawk, the world's most successful jet training aircraft.|$|E

A second factory was opened in 2006 by Prince Andrew, Duke of York where a wet painting facility and assembly line have been established. A third factory was opened in 2007 to include high pressure die-casting and machining, and Triumph announced that they were expanding to increase capacity to over 130,000 motorcycles. Triumph Motorcycles (Thailand) Limited is a 100% UK owned company and now employs about 1000 staff.|$|E

25|$|In March 1983, only senior {{scientists}} and high civil and military officials {{were invited to}} witness the cold test of a working nuclear device. In March 1983, the Corps of Engineers, under General Akbar, cleared the underground tunnels and a PAEC's diagnostic team headed by Samar Mubarakmand arrived on the nuclear test site with trailers fitted with computers and diagnostic equipment. This {{was followed by the}} arrival of the DTD Group and the Wah Group Scientists (WGS) with the atomic device, in <b>sub-assembly</b> form. This was assembled and then placed inside the tunnel. A monitoring system was set up with around 20 cables linking various parts of the device with oscillators in diagnostic vans parked near the Kirana Hills.|$|E
25|$|BAE Systems plays a {{critical}} role in some of the world's biggest defence aerospace projects. The company makes large sections of the Typhoon Eurofighter at its <b>sub-assembly</b> plant in Samlesbury and assembles the aircraft for the Royal Air Force at its Warton Plant, near Preston. It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter—the world's largest single defence project—for which it designs and manufactures a range of components including the aft fuselage, vertical and horizontal tail and wing tips and fuel system. As well as this it manufactures the Hawk, the world's most successful jet training aircraft. Airbus UK also manufactures the wings for the A400m military transporter. Rolls-Royce, is the world's second-largest aero-engine manufacturer. Its engines power more than 30 types of commercial aircraft and it has more than 30,000 engines in service in the civil and defence sectors. Rolls-Royce is forecast to have more than 50% of the widebody market share by 2016, ahead of General Electric. Agusta Westland designs and manufactures complete helicopters in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|Another problem {{discovered}} by the jet fighters was unexpectedly dropping a wing at high speeds and high altitudes. This was traced to manufacturing defects in the wings that made no difference at low speeds and altitudes, but meant that each wing had a slightly different airfoil and hence, a different amount of lift. To counter this Sergey Ilyushin and his team developed a new manufacturing technique that reversed the traditional practice where the internal supporting members were affixed to the assembly jig and the aircraft's skin panels were then attached. This new method meant that the skin panels {{were placed in the}} jigs where the correct curvature and shape could be guaranteed and the internal structure was then fastened to them. This required that manufacturing joints be used along the chord lines of the wings and tail surfaces, which split the spars and ribs in half. [...] Similarly, the fuselage was built the same way, although it was split vertically along the centerline. This new technique did impose a small weight penalty, but had the unexpected advantage of greatly accelerating the assembly process as the internal equipment could be installed before the halves were joined together. This allowed several teams to work on a single <b>sub-assembly</b> before they were mated.|$|E
50|$|The {{academic}} sub-assemblies are {{the principal}} scientific and research organization center that unites the MAS members specializing in one or several related fields of science.

There are five academic sub-assemblies: <b>Sub-Assembly</b> of Biology, <b>Sub-Assembly</b> of Geology and Geography, <b>Sub-Assembly</b> of Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry, <b>Sub-Assembly</b> of Social Sciences and <b>Sub-Assembly</b> of Technology. The principal objectives of the MAS academic divisions are to develop fundamental research by the scientific subdivisions, coordination and analysis and forecast of the scientific development and to provide methodological guidelines to the institutes within the <b>Sub-Assembly.</b> Academic Sub-Assemblies establish and publish the field-specific scientific journals.|$|E
