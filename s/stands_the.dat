5|$|In 1776, Father Junípero Serra founded Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on a site}} {{close to}} the creek (possibly near the Cañada Gobernadora confluence), and the creek was named after the mission.

The mission was moved to a second site in present-day San Juan Capistrano, where it still <b>stands.</b> <b>The</b> Spanish referred to the Acjachemem as the Juañeno. The Spanish made the first recorded anthropogenic changes to hydrology in the San Juan watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams. Grazing animals introduced by Europeans, mainly cattle (and later sheep, after a drought decimated the local cattle ranching industry), consumed native grasses and left hillsides exposed and prone to erosion.|$|E
