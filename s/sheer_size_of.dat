5|$|On 5 June 1946, Boeing's Model 462, a straight-wing {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} six Wright T35 turboprops with a gross weight of 360,000pounds (160,000kg) and a combat radius of 3,110miles (2,700nmi, 5,010km), was declared the winner. On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale mock-up of the new XB-52 and do preliminary engineering and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to express concern about the <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified design requirements. In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E

5|$|The <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> {{the newly}} conquered lands made it {{difficult}} to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued {{for the remainder of the}} Tang Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E
5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it {{as the last of}} the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the <b>sheer</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E

Streaming mesh, which consists of a simplified model and refinement patches, is used to overcome this problem. Simplification method and the data structures for refinement patches play crucial role in this approach. By employing distance measure and normal field deviation, we propose a new error measure to faithfully simplify polygonal models, and introduce more efficient data structures for refinement patches. We implement the streaming mesh using Java. Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods reveals that the proposed method results in better quality LODs in some cases, and the new data structures for refinement patches accelerate the refinement process...|$|R

In this work, we discuss the engineering of a parallel algorithm with linear work and logarithmic span for the construction of the compact representation of planar embeddings. We also provide an experimental study of our implementation and prove experimentally that it has good scalability and low memory consumption. Additionally, we describe and test experimentally queries supported by the compact representation...|$|R

The Lockheed Corporation, which had proposed a twin-fuselage version of its C-5 Galaxy airlifter to carry the Shuttle, also saw its proposal rejected for the same reasons. A more modest conversion of existing C-5s was proposed, and nearly taken up by NASA, but it was determined that having aircraft continually available was preferable to being restricted by the United States Air Force on the use of C-5s, and Boeing's proposal for a conversion of the 747 airliner was selected, becoming the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. A proposed commercial version of the Virtus design, named Colossus, also failed to gain any further interest, and the Virtus design was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In {{the animal}} kingdom, {{there is general}} {{consensus}} that Brazil has {{the highest number of}} both terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of any country in the world. This high diversity of fauna can be explained in part by the <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> Brazil and the great variation in ecosystems such as Amazon Rainforest, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. The numbers published about Brazil's fauna diversity vary from source to source, as taxonomists sometimes disagree about species classifications, and information can be incomplete or out-of-date. Also, new species continue to be discovered and some species go extinct in the wild. Brazil has the highest diversity of primates (77 species) and freshwater fish (over 3000 species) of any country in the world. It also claims the highest number of mammals with 524 species, the second highest number of amphibians with 517 species and butterflies with 3,150 species, the third highest number of birds with 1,622 species, and fifth number of reptiles with 468 species.
