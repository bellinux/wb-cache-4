5|$|G. minor {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> {{would be able}} to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham.

25|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the outer}} and middle ear <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees.

50|$|However, {{the lack}} of wear on anomalocaridid {{mouthparts}} <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells, and computer modelling of anomalocaridid mouthparts <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> were possibly better suited to feeding on smaller, soft-bodied organisms by suction, since they would have experienced structural failure if they were used against the armour of trilobites.|$|R

5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> have been separated for millions of years. A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} and final chapter, Yajnavalkya lists exemplars of Paramahamsas, the highest renouncers: the sages Samvartaka, Aruni, Svetaketu, Durvasa, Ribhu, Nidagha, Jadabharata, Dattatreya and Raivataka. The Paramahamsas do not carry {{articles}} or show signs that <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> have renounced, their conduct is concealed, they may only seem insane. They do not carry staves, nor bowl, nor hair tuft, nor sacred thread, {{but they are the}} ones who seek after the Atman (self, soul).|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E

5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> occur on average about three times every century in the Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates. Experiments <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> can figure out some invisible displacement problems with a representational strategy. In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> have not evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown}} to have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe (née Clemm; August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847) was {{the wife}} of American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The couple were first cousins and {{publicly}} married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 26. Biographers disagree as {{to the nature of}} the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842 she contracted tuberculosis, growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in the family's cottage, at that time outside New York City.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum and {{the other}} three tree waratah species lie in the {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs (Telopea), South American Oreocallis, and Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the Eocene radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.flammeum and A.brachycarpum to be sister species, with A.wickhamii as their next closest relative. A.flammeum has yellow pollen grains, like A.brachycarpum and A.wickhamii but unlike all other members of the Embothriinae.|$|E

5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> were used for interment and some have forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; woody plants are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{primates}} (euprimates) {{do not appear}} in the fossil record until the early Eocene (~55mya), at which point they radiated across the Northern Hemisphere during a brief period of rapid global warming known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. These first primates included Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius, and Teilhardina on the northern continents, as well as the more questionable (and fragmentary) fossil Altiatlasius from Paleocene Africa. These earliest fossil primates are often divided into two groups, adapiforms (sometimes called adapids, or adapoids) and omomyiforms (or omomyids—suspected relatives of tarsiers). Both appeared suddenly in the fossil record without transitional forms to indicate ancestry, and both groups were rich in diversity and were widespread throughout the Eocene. Although few fossils of extant primate groups—lemuriforms, tarsiers, or simians—are known from the Early to Middle Eocene, evidence from genetics and newer fossil finds <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> may have been present during this early adaptive radiation. The divergence between strepsirrhines, simians, and tarsiers likely followed almost immediately after primates first evolved.|$|E

5|$|The gorge {{area was}} {{inhabited}} {{at least as}} early as the Iron Age, probably by the Dobunni tribe. In Leigh Woods above Nightingale Valley, a steep dry valley beside the suspension bridge, is Stokeleigh Camp, one of three Iron Age hill forts in the area. Stokeleigh was occupied from 3BCE to 1CE, and was also used in the Middle Ages. The camp was protected on two sides by the cliff faces of the gorge and Nightingale Valley, and was also protected by earthworks, and is now a scheduled ancient monument. A second hill fort was situated across Nightingale Valley, but has since been built on, and bridge road cuts through it. The third hill fort was situated {{on the opposite side of}} the gorge, in what is now observatory green. Archaeology, plus the configuration of the three forts, <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> played a role in defending the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} Brierre's death, the detectives have made little {{progress}} on their lead about Kaja, the victim's abusive ex-boyfriend. Ballard and Gharty <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> {{look more closely}} at Felix Wilson and his son, Hal (Jeffrey Wright), because Brierre had sex before her death and knew few men socially besides them. Pembleton and Gee, who are both very respectful of Felix Wilson's contributions to the African American community, dismiss the suggestion; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample. The next day's Baltimore Sun runs a story about the investigation into Kaja, which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime. Ballard and Gharty question Hal, who denies having sex with Brierre after tough questions from Gharty. After the interview, Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected black family.|$|E
5|$|Two {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, {{referred to as}} the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8and 3.0million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte magmas to erupt during the pre-explosive phase <b>suggest</b> <b>they</b> were relatively fluid as shown by their areal extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a maturing plumbing system underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, cupola-type magma chambers.|$|E
