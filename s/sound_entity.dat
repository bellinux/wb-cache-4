40|$|In The Chatter Quartet, for {{string quartet}} and laptop, I {{attempted}} to extract musical aspects of pre-recorded, idiosyncratic moments of heightened speech, {{and use the}} pitch content and rhythm found in chosen speech samples {{as the basis of}} musical material written for a string quartet, accompanied by pre-recorded speaking. One of my goals was to decontextualize these aurally unusual moments, and create new perceptual implications based on the musical elements discovered in the sounds, rather than the words themselves. Another goal was to create a unique sound palette, the rules of which were governed only by the interaction of rhythms, tones and timbres. This piece is part of a series of works I have been writing, each of which features a marriage between acoustic instruments and pre-recorded sounds. In the first such piece, Doppelganger, for clarinet and pre-recorded clarinet, I contrasted an acoustic instrument with itself, pre-recorded, and highlighted similarities between the two, as well as the unique potential of both the acoustic instrument, performed live, and its laptop-based, electronically triggered counterpart. The moments of face-to-face confrontation between such closely related <b>sound</b> <b>entities,</b> emanating from extremely different sources (breath and a resonating column of air vs. MIDI controlled digital samples) created an exciting dramatic and musical tension. Though {{it is part of the}} same theme of electroacoustic exploration in my work, in The Chatter Quartet, my approach and motivations were wholly different. Rather than beginning with the sound of the string quartet, or any of the individual instruments, I began with voices I had heard on the radio or television. It occurred to me that, at times, when I am listening to the radio or watching political broadcasts, my mind drifts. In these moments, I am still acutely aware of the sounds of the broadcasted voices, but I am no longer listening to, or comprehending, their words. Consequently, speaking voices assume the role of lulling musical instruments, rather than sources of cognitively useful or evocative information. (See more in text. ...|$|R

40|$|This study takes a {{close look}} at the link between English sounds as {{realized}} in normal speech. <b>Sounds</b> are discrete <b>entities</b> that carry in them abstractions which is the import of phonology in every language. The physical properties of sounds which are realized in speech production undoubtedly have an interrelation with this discrete nature of sounds. The researcher adopted a purely analytical approach in viewing this topic, with little reliance on literature. It may be described as a purely scientific study as the researcher uses practical examples and correlates to drum home the interconnection between abstract sounds and their physical properties. The study notes that a letter of the English alphabet, for instance ‘y’, has different production realisations as both a vowel and a consonant based on the articulatory nuances a phonetic analyst associates with it. And secondly, the study finds that English speech sound may or may not have the same physiological identification with its phonetic symbol...|$|R
40|$|When human {{subjects}} hear {{a sequence of}} two alternating pure tones, they often perceive {{it in one of}} two ways: as one integrated sequence (a single "stream" consisting of the two tones), or as two segregated sequences, one sequence of low tones perceived separately from another sequence of high tones (two "streams"). Perception of this stimulus is thus bistable. Moreover, subjects report on-going switching between the two percepts: unless the frequency separation is large, initial perception tends to be of integration, followed by toggling between integration and segregation phases. The process of stream formation is loosely named "auditory streaming". Auditory streaming is believed to be a manifestation of human ability to analyze an auditory scene, i. e. to attribute portions of the incoming sound sequence to distinct <b>sound</b> generating <b>entities.</b> Previous studies suggested that the durations of the successive integration and segregation phases are statistically independent. This independence {{plays an important role in}} current models of bistability. Contrary to this, we show here, by analyzing a large set of data, that subsequent phase durations are positively correlated. To account together for bistability and positive correlation between subsequent durations, we suggest that streaming is a consequence of an evidence accumulation process. Evidence for segregation is accumulated during the integration phase and vice versa; a switch to the opposite percept occurs stochastically based on this evidence. During a long phase, a large amount of evidence for the opposite percept is accumulated, resulting in a long subsequent phase. In contrast, a short phase is followed by another short phase. We implement these concepts using a probabilistic model that shows both bistability and correlations similar to those observed experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Presented of the 6 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD), Atlanta, GA, April 2 - 5, 2000 The NAVE is a {{low cost}} {{spatially}} immersive display system developed by the Georgia Tech Virtual Environments Group. The NAVE audio environment uses two independent speaker systems driven by a dedicated audio PC with two sound cards. The speakers are amplified by four Pioneer 200 watt receivers. The primary system utilizes 4 Bose Acoustimass speakers to create a three dimensional soundfield. A Sound Blaster LIVE! audio card is used for audio spatialization. The secondary system steers bass audio content across four zones embedded in the NAVE floor. Bass audio is moved within the zones using a Diamond Monster Sound MX 200 PC sound card. Bass vibration effects are maximized by six Aura Bass Shaker Pro's along with seat mounted subwoofer speakers. The steerable bass audio system {{can be used to}} create audio-tactile effects for simulating the vibration of vehicles, thunder, explosions, shockwaves, and earthquakes. A custom real-time audio effects application programming interface (API) allows virtual environment designers to attach <b>sounds</b> to graphic <b>entities.</b> The spatial position of sounds are synchronized with the position of their associated graphical objects. The API is also capable of reproducing real world phenomena including reverberation and doppler effects...|$|R
40|$|My artistic {{practice}} {{explores the}} dialectical relations between precision and indeterminacy, key concepts include touching at a distance, negotiating inertias, setting processes in motion and intervening within evolving trajectories. All of which {{to some extent}} sideline what might be perceived as the autonomy of a performer, foregrounding environmentally situated aspects of performance, rather than just {{the actions of the}} performer themselves. This presentation will suggest that Gadamer’s ‘fusion of horizons’ might be considered analogous to the notion of ‘performance ecology’ as put forward by John Bowers, an analogy premised on the relationship between a perceiver and their environment, as explored and constructed, through active perception. If, as Koestler suggests, the position at which perception lies between the real and the imagined is a ‘matter of degree’, then this can be configured as a creative threshold from which to imaginatively listen and negotiate. Performance ecology can therefore neither be exclusively determined by physical artefacts (instruments, for example) or timbral <b>entities</b> (<b>sounds),</b> but as a cultural field, soliciting a perceiver’s own memories and associations. The means by which this ‘imagined agency’ communicates itself is in the auditory, haptic and kinaesthetic dimensions; phenomena which are also in a sense the means by which environments and cultures are experienced and sustained, shot through with agencies as well as ambiguities to be negotiated...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} few decades, {{researchers}} have increased {{our understanding of how}} sound functions within various audio–visual media formats. With a different focus in mind, this study aims to identify the roles and functions of sound in relation to the game form Audio Games, in order to explore the potential of sound when acting as an autonomous narrative form. Because this is still a relatively unexplored research field, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to help establish a theoretical ground and stimulate further research within the field of audio games. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach to the topic, this research relies on theoretical studies, examinations of audio games and contact with the audio game community. In order to reveal the roles of sound, the gathered data is analyzed according to both a contextual and a functional perspective. The research shows that a distinction between the terms ‘function’ and ‘role’ is important when analyzing sound in digital games. The analysis therefore results in the identification of two analytical levels that help define the functions and roles of an entity within a social context, named the Functional and the Interfunctional levels. In addition to successfully identifying three main roles of sound within audio games—each describing the relationship between <b>sound</b> and the <b>entities</b> game system, player and virtual environment—many other issues are also addressed. Consequently, and in accordance with its purpose, this study provides a broad foundation for further research of sound in both audio games and video games...|$|R
40|$|The multi-faceted {{nature of}} twentieth-century music is {{anything}} but familiar to listeners who are accustomed to hearing Western music based on ideas steeped in the classical tradition. The emergence of new tonalities and atonality {{as well as new}} temporalities challenged and revolutionized commonly accepted notions of musical sound and musical motion. The surge of new music characterized by the treatment of <b>sound</b> as independent <b>entity,</b> the absence of functional tonality and the dissolution of metric order has created new demands on the perceptual-cognition abilities of the listener. The perception of atonal musical works has been a subject of interest for many scholars in the field of music cognition. The findings of recent studies addressing this issue have pointed to the presence of salient features as an aid to the comprehension of relationships between musical events in an atonal composition. Salient features which effectively serve as structural cues include change/contrast and repetition, with the latter emerging as the most frequently used and easily acknowledged form of salience. An examination of the role of repetition in the music of the post-serial American composer George Crumb sheds light on how repetition, a common ingredient in many conventional models of organization, is able to operate in atonal pieces as structural cue to patterns underpinning the musical form. The investigation further reveals the possible role of repetition, where it is associated with timbre, as clue to structural direction in compositions that subscribe to the contemporary notion of musical motion. published_or_final_versionMusicMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

The rise of YouTube meant {{distributors}} refused to buy short films anymore; instead they made Credo. It was filmed on location in London in a former foreign embassy and a Victorian fire station. The locations were chosen before the story was even written. However, they are forbidden to say exactly where shooting took place because the locations are slated to be developed into luxury apartments and the investors were worried {{the stories of the}} location being haunted could drive off buyers, but the writer did hint that they were a stone's throw from the Tyburn Tree.The cast and crew were convinced the buildings were haunted. Throughout filming, cast and crew both reported hearing strange sounds and voices. On one occasion, production stopped so a search could be mounted for an unknown figure watching the crew - but none were ever found. The director used the casts' fear to her advantage, sending the cast down into the basement to get them scared for real before shooting scenes where they were supposed to pretend to be scared. In an effort to find evidence the locations were haunted, they got a hold of a bat box. A bat box is a device used to catch bats, but Paranormal investigators have repurposed them to supposedly pick up sounds of ghosts. The results of the bat box experiments varied; in the fire station itself, Alex picked up a moaning sound on the top floor. On another location they investigated but didn't film at, Toni felt the bat box definitely picked up the <b>sounds</b> of an <b>entity</b> responding to their questions. while Alex didn't think they picked up anything supernatural, although he felt a 'presence' in the room with him.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{investigate}} how sound creates distinct, cognitive and spatial <b>entities,</b> <b>sound</b> spaces, {{and to find out}} how sound spaces constitute forms of human interaction. A further aim is to establish concepts used when studying sound spaces, thus contributing to a Swedish terminology for describing and analysing sound and sound spaces.   The analysis follows a hermeneutic spiral, alternating between inductive and deductive methodology, between the individual and the general. Conclusions are transferred from Istanbul to a broader level; to people in general. Forms of representation are developed by composing an exposition of pictures, maps, graphs, notes and links to acoustic files, alongside the written account.  The study is based on well-established music and acoustic terminology. Terms that are used in the thesis are explained in information boxes. Altogether, this constitutes an attempt to build a comprehensive cultural analytical vocabulary to describe in text what a sound space sounds like. The study shows how sound has much to tell about the lived life in a large city, here represented by sound spaces in Istanbul. Sound is greatly significant in people’s lives. Sound spaces can be regarded as arenas for communication between people and are included in a world of sound containing interaction and crucial information. By investigating and bringing attention to spaces of sound that are shaped by their users in such places as urban environments, insights are won concerning the significance of everyday life in the city environment. With emphasis on the importance of sound, the interconnection between the subjective and the objective world of sounds is studied, contributing to enhance the understanding of how the world functions through sounds. The sound spaces of Istanbul are the sounds of a metropolis, which means that the study not only portrays and analyses sound spaces in general, but stresses metropolis sound spaces, and conditions for listening, being heard and communicating in large cities.  The study contributes to bringing attention to and clarifying the knowledge that can be extracted by recognising the value of sound and listening in the research of cultural studies...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{clinical}} studies {{during the last few}} years, treatment results in respect to ovarian cancer have been improved considerably. The current standard therapy still remains the primary operation with the aim of maximum tumour reduction, followed by adjuvant systemic chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin for the FIGO stages IIb-IV [du Bois et al. 2009, Schmalfeldt et al. 2007]. The quality assurance study of the Gynaecological Oncology Study Group (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie, AGO) [du Bois et al. 2005 - 2] could show unambiguously that patients exhibit the best long-time results after having optimum operation and optimum chemotherapy, and that a suboptimal treatment has considerable negative effects on a progression-free survival and on survival itself. Failures in one of these two pillars of therapy cannot be compensated by the other pillar of therapy [du Bois et al. 2005 - 1]. In this case, it is important to stress that treatment of the ovarian carcinoma is to be seen in the primary as well as recurrent situation as a comprehensive plan which contains the surgical, cytostatic and molecular-biological pillar of therapy. Another component of this concept is the care of patients after therapy has been finished, and this is within the scope of aftercare and psycho-oncological care. The research activities of our working group focus on different modules in the therapy of primary and recurrent ovarian cancer. We could confirm in our retrospective examination of the intra-abdominal tumour propagation pattern incorporating 214 patients that the macroscopic post-surgical tumour rest is the strongest prognosis factor after the primary operation [Sehouli et al. 2009]. We were able to describe that in the primary situation, it is most often the peritoneum which is infested, and that an infestation in the upper abdomen often correlates with a poorer operability and with a percentage of macroscopically tumour-free patients which are to be operated on. With regard to the first-line therapy, the efforts of different working groups – after using different therapy strategies, as for example the addition of a third cytostatic substance in the first-line therapy to improve the survival of the patients – have up till now remained unsuccessful. In the multicentric phase II studies conceived and carried out by us, we were able to show that a schedule alteration seems to be promising: here, there is an interval curtailment towards a weekly therapy concept, or a sequential plan with weekly applications of paclitaxel in the first-line therapy [Sehouli et al. 2007, Oskay-Oezcelik et al. 2010]. These data were also confirmed only recently by a Japanese working group [Katsumata et al. 2009]. On account of the good results presented by different study groups, a prospective phase III study which compares the sequentially applied combination of carboplatin (q 21 d) and paclitaxel (q 1 w) against the established 3 -week regimen of both substances was to be initiated. As with the other <b>sound</b> tumour <b>entities,</b> newly proposed therapies for ovarian cancer also promise an improvement of the outcome. Nevertheless, the main problem of applying any „purposeful molecular-biological“ therapies towards ovarian cancer is that still no valid predictive factors exist for individual therapeutics to be able to carry out a specific selection of patients. The combination of substances, where each has its own purpose, with systemic chemotherapies seems to be interesting. First results of the first-line phase III study using paclitaxel plus carboplatin in combination with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab, where we have introduced the greatest number of patients in Germany, are expected only at the end of 2011. In spite of all efforts to improve the primary therapy of the advanced ovarian cancer, a recurrence still appears with approximately 65 % of the patients during the first 3 years. That is the reason why recurrence therapy for ovarian cancer has such a high value. In particular, therapy strategies are sought after here which examine therapy plans with a good efficacy and with a good side effect profile, because it in this case involves a palliative group of patients. With regard to complete survival, the effect of surgical intervention in the recurrent situation is still unsolved. Nevertheless, the DESKTOP I and II Study – in which we have been recruiting actively as a centre – could show that when a recurrence is operated on, a benefit is indeed to be seen for a macroscopically tumour-free patient [Harter et al. 2006]. Whether or not the number of macroscopically tumour-free patients can be raised by the use of a predictive score and this represents an advantage concerning complete survival in comparison with those not operated on, must be cleared in the DESKTOP III Study which is planned. Cytostatic therapy in the recurrence situation plays an important role. Along with a choice of the suitable cytostatic or cytostatic combination, the recurrence-free interval, the late toxicities remaining from the previous therapies, the general condition of the patient and the patient's own preference are also taken into consideration. It is indisputable that with a therapy-free interval of more than 6 months, a platinum-based combination should be recommended. Here, according to data presently available, a choice between carboplatin + paclitaxel, carboplatin + gemcitabine and carboplatin + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is possible [Pujade-Lauraine et al. 2009]. The projects of our working groups investigated other newer combinations involving carboplatin + permetrexed [Sehouli et al. 2010] and carboplatin + topotecan, {{in order to be able}} to offer even further options to the patients in this situation. For the patient population resistant to platinum (recurrence-free interval < 6 months) we could show that a combination therapy could achieve no significant increase in effectiveness with a clearly higher toxicity [Sehouli et al. 2008 - 1]. For this group, it is the cytostatic mono therapy which is currently recommended in the guidelines. Our study activities in this patient population dealt with a schedule optimization in order to reach a better therapeutic ratio [Sehouli et al. 2006, Sehouli et al. 2007 - 2, Oskay-Oezcelik et al. 2008]. The previous state of data shows that also in the recurrence situation, the substances aimed to be used can achieve a good efficacy. For this reason we are beginning a randomised phase II study for patients with an ovarian carcinoma resistant to platinum which compares the combination of topotecan and sorafenib with the combination of topotecan and placebo. The data presented by the EORTC with regard to the tumour marker regulation within the scope of the aftercare have raised many discussions [Rustin et al. 2009]. The results we presented at the ASCO 2009 which involved 1, 060 patients concerning the aftercare showed as a countermove to the scientific facet the wishes and expectations of the patients in regard to aftercare and the value of the tumour a marker from the patient's point of view [Oskay-Oezcelik et al. 2009]. With regard to good therapy compliance, the expectations and wishes of the patients concerning therapy management and the doctor-to-patient relationship play a crucial role. The survey just finished by us with more than 600 ovarian cancer patients should thereby provide considerable information and advice. Reflections on this should then lead to improvements. Another interesting concept is an international one which starts in the beginning of 2010 and which will also give an insight into the expectations of patients in different countries (www. expression 3. de). Finally, it must absolutely be stressed that patients with ovarian cancer – whatever type of therapy they receive – are to be treated preferably within the scope of the study group Ovar of the AGO (www. ago-ovar. de) and NOGGO (www. noggo. de) to achieve a systematic improvement of the therapy results...|$|R
