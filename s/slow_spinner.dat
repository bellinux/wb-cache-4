40|$|The cost {{of small}} digital {{computers}} {{has fallen to}} a level at which a <b>slow</b> <b>spinner</b> magnetometer using such a machine for data capture and pro-cessing is competitive in cost with existing high performance magneto-meters. The advantages of using a computer to replace the phase sensitive rectifier and digital read-out of existing machines are many and include: drift free integration over extended time scales, Fourier analysis of the waveform from the sensors, storing of the intermediate results of the various orientations and combining these to produce a complete result in terms of total intensity, declination, and dip, {{while at the same}} time eliminating any consent magnetic moment of the rotating mechanism. The results are printed and the measuring system allows a very simple method of estimating the errors for any particular integration period. The overall effect is of an instrument which is quick and convenient to use yet which gives results which are at least as good as those from existing machines. 1...|$|E

Bradman wrote: [...] "Undoubtedly he w{{as one of the greatest}} <b>slow</b> left-handed <b>spinners</b> of all time. His record testifies to that. No Australian left-hander of that type was Verity's equal and of the Englishmen I saw... there is no doubt that Hedley was as good or better than the others." ...|$|R

50|$|Dean was a left-arm bowler {{who could}} bowl fast-medium swing or <b>slower</b> <b>spinners</b> {{to suit the}} conditions. Joining Lancashire in 1906, he made an {{immediate}} impact with 60 wickets in his first season. He took 100 wickets in 1907 but was expensive given that virtually all pitches suited spin bowling. However, by developing fast-medium swingers of a similar style to George Hirst as a dry-weather alternative to his slow-medium spinners, Dean improved steadily to be by 1910 clearly the best bowler in the Lancashire eleven with 137 wickets. In 1911, although he was overworked when Walter Brearley was away on business, Dean went from strength to strength, taking 175 wickets in the County Championship and being by 23 wickets the leading bowler in first-class cricket (and this in spite of often resting when the fast bowler was away from business). In the six games he did partner Brearley, the two gave enough evidence {{that they could be}} formidable indeed: against Kent on a perfect wicket at Canterbury they got down eight wickets for 58 at the start and went on to take all twenty wickets in the match - Brearley twelve for 218, Dean eight for 144 - depriving Kent of a hat-trick of titles in the process.|$|R

He achieved his highest first-class score against the 1961 Australians with 88, and followed that up in the very next match with 7 for 35 in Leicestershire's second innings to give Oxford victory by 35 runs.|$|R

25|$|Giles {{started his}} career as a fast bowler before an early injury forced him to become a <b>slow</b> left-arm <b>spinner.</b> He made his {{first-class}} debut for Warwickshire in 1993, but it was 1996 when he gained a regular place in the side, winning the NBC Denis Compton Award for being 'The Most Promising Young Player' at the club. Giles was awarded his One Day International debut against Australia in May 1997, and 36 wickets in the 1998 season led to his first Test match against South Africa, although it would be a further two years before he would play another Test for England.|$|R

Baloo was a mainstay for the Hindus {{in the regular}} Quadrangular tournament in India but was an 'untouchable' himself. He took 114 wickets in all on the tour, including non first class games. The tourists might have fared better with the bat had K.M. Mistri played more than six innings (in which he scored 188 runs) but his duties 'kept him in close attendance on the Maharajah of Patiala'.|$|R

50|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Bolsterstone, Stocksbridge, Yorkshire, England, and educated at Bilton Grange, Rugby and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he {{graduated}} BA in 1901 and MA in 1905. An amateur whose main profession was as a schoolmaster for 43 years at Winchester College (1903-1946), Wilson bowled <b>slow</b> right-arm <b>spinners,</b> that could go either way, and batted well enough to score a century on first-class cricket debut, and another one in the annual Varsity match. He played a little for Yorkshire from 1899, but after leaving Cambridge in 1902, he then played no first-class cricket {{for the next ten}} years, preferring, or so he claimed, to play three club matches a week rather than two county games.|$|R
5|$|Like Leyland, the Yorkshire bowler Roy Kilner coached in India during 1927–28. However, {{in doing}} so Kilner {{contracted}} a fever and died shortly after returning to England. With a weakened bowling attack, and affected by injuries and loss of form, Yorkshire pressed Leyland into service as an occasional bowler in the 1928 season. He had done little bowling for Yorkshire at this point; the team possessed two <b>slow</b> left-arm <b>spinners</b> in Kilner and Rhodes, leaving Leyland with little opportunity. Having never bowled 50 first-class overs in a previous season, nor taken more than four wickets, he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets {{at an average of}} 34.20. At this stage, the Yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on Kilner's bowling workload, or succeed Rhodes in the senior spinner's position.|$|R

25|$|In 1894/5 Andrew Stoddart led {{a team to}} Australia {{that played}} five Tests in a see-saw series that saw England win the Ashes by 3 games to 2.

England replied with 325 {{and were asked to}} {{follow-on}} 261 behind. They made 437 to set Australia a target of only 177. Australia reached 113–2 at close of play, needing only another 64. Rain fell overnight, and Australia allowed play to be delayed for 20 minutes as a couple of England players, including <b>slow</b> left-arm <b>spinner</b> Bobby Peel had not reached the ground on time because they were hungover. Australia fell 10 short, with Peel taking 6 wickets and Briggs 3 on a pitch that had been made helpful by the rain. This was the first time a side following-on had won a Test match.|$|R

50|$|Having played Minor Counties cricket for Bedfordshire since 1955 and for Northamptonshire's second eleven since 1956, Peter Watts {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in 1958 {{in a couple}} of matches and then played in almost half the county's games in 1959, though his bowling opportunities were limited by Northamptonshire's reliance on the two Australian spin bowlers, George Tribe, who retired {{at the end of the}} 1959 season, and Jack Manning. In fact, in his first match of the season, against Warwickshire, he was the fourth spin bowler called on after Tribe, Manning and <b>slow</b> left-arm <b>spinner</b> Michael Allen, but took five wickets for just 30 runs, all five wickets coming in a spell of 53 balls at a cost of just 10 runs.
