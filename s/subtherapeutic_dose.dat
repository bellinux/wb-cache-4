The present study was performed to assess the ability of an anti-human CD 45 RB mAb to prevent rejection in a monkey MHC-mismatched kidney transplant model. The recipients were allocated into the following treatment groups: (1) isotype control IgG; (2) mouse anti-human CD 45 RB IgG 1 (6 G 3); (3) human-mouse chimeric anti-CD 45 RB-IgG 1 (C 6 G 3 -IgG 1); (4) human-mouse chimeric anti-CD 45 RB-IgG 2 (C 6 G 3 -IgG 2); (5) tacrolimus at a <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> and (6) tacrolimus and C 6 G 3 -IgG 1 in combination. Monotherapy with anti-CD 45 RB mAb significantly prolonged renal allograft survival to a median survival of 21 days. Adding a <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> of tacrolimus improved the efficacy of the anti-CD 45 RB mAb, achieving a median survival of 85 days, whereas a <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> of tacrolimus alone only moderately prolonged survival to 27 days. Treatment with anti-CD 45 RB mAb resulted in an alteration of the CD 45 RB(hi) : CD 45 RB(lo) cell ratio in the peripheral blood. We have, for the first time, demonstrated that an anti-human CD 45 RB mAb (6 G 3) can prolong graft survival. Induction with an anti-CD 45 RB mAb improves the efficacy of tacrolimus in the prevention of rejection.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{selection of}} malaria parasites within an individual host plays {{a critical role}} in the emergence of drug resistance. We have compared the selection of atovaquone resistance mutants in mouse models reflecting two different causes of failure of malaria treatment, an inadequate <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> and an incomplete therapeutic dose. The two models are based on cycles of insufficient treatment of Plasmodium berghei-infected mice: repeated inadequate treatment associated with a <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> (RIaT) (0. 1 mg kg- 1 of body weight) and repeated incomplete treatment with a therapeutic dose (RIcT) (14. 4 mg kg- 1 of body weight). The number of treatment cycles {{for the development of a}} stable resistance phenotype during RIaT was 2. 00 - 0. 00 cycles (n - 9), which is not statistically different from that during RIcT (2. 57 - 0. 85 cycles; combined n - 14; P - 0. 0591). All mutations underlying atovaquone resistance selected by RIaT (M 133 I, T 142 N, and L 144 S) were found to be in the Qo 1 (quinone binding 1) domain of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, in contrast to those selected by RIcT (Y 268 N/C, L 271 V, K 272 R, and V 284 F) in the Qo 2 domain or its neighboring sixth transmembrane region. Exposure of mixed populations of resistant parasites from RIaT to the higher therapeutic dose of RIcT revealed further insights into the dynamics of within-host selection of resistance to antimalarial drugs. These results suggest that both inadequate subtherapeutic doses and incomplete therapeutic doses in malaria treatment pose similar threats to the emergence of drug resistance. RIcT and RIaT could be developed as useful tools to predict the potential emergence of resistance to newly introduced and less-understood antimalarials...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{identification}} of a highly potent immunosuppressive/antiproliferative agent with an acceptable toxicity profile {{has long been a}} goal for the management of severe plaque psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus (Rapamune) for severe psoriasis when given alone or in association with cyclosporin. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, eight parallel group, pilot study in 24 out-patient centres in seven European countries, 150 patients, 18 years and older, with severe chronic plaque psoriasis were given sirolimus 0. 5, 1. 5 and 3. 0 mg m(- 2) daily for 8 weeks, either alone or in association with a <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>dose</b> of cyclosporin (1. 25 mg kg(- 1) daily). Cyclosporin 5 mg kg(- 1) daily was the positive control and cyclosporin 1. 25 mg kg(- 1) daily the negative control. The primary efficacy variable was the mean percentage reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters and sirolimus/cyclosporin blood concentrations. RESULTS: The greatest mean percentage decreases in PASI were seen with cyclosporin 5. 0 mg kg(- 1) daily (70. 5 %) and with sirolimus 3. 0 mg m(- 2) daily + cyclosporin 1. 25 mg kg(- 1) daily (63. 7 %). Both groups demonstrated significantly better results than cyclosporin 1. 25 mg kg(- 1) daily (mean decrease 33. 4 %). Serum creatinine levels were significantly lower for groups with sirolimus alone and sirolimus plus reduced-dose cyclosporin when compared with cyclosporin 5. 0 mg kg(- 1) daily. Adverse events associated with sirolimus included thrombocytopenia (5 %), hyperlipidaemia (9 %), aphthous stomatitis (9 %) and acne (13 %), whereas adverse events associated with cyclosporin included hot flushes (12 %), hyperlipidaemia (9 %) and increased serum creatinine (9 %).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{immunosuppressive agents}} {{used to treat}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in East China. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, involving 227 patients with IBD admitted to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University from June 2000 to December 2007. Data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics and immunosuppressants usage were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 227 eligible patients were evaluated in this study, including 104 patients with Crohn’s disease and 123 with ulcerative colitis. Among the patients, 61 had indications for immunosuppressive agents use. However, only 21 (34. 4 %) received immunosuppressive agents.

Animals were divided into 12 groups and observed for a maximum of 180 days. Histopathologic, hematology, and biochemistry analyses were conducted in all groups.

Plasma peak concentration, time to peak concentration and area under curve for famotidine were not affected by the co-administration of warfarin. However the plasma half-life of famotidine was slightly, but statistically significantly longer (p less than 0. 05) during maintenance treatment with warfarin (mean +/- s. e. m. : 2. 58 +/- 0. 14 h versus 2. 96 +/- 0. 16 h respectively). status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Drug {{intolerance}} or drug sensitivity {{refers to}} an inability to tolerate the adverse effects of a medication, generally at therapeutic or <b>subtherapeutic</b> <b>doses.</b> Conversely, a patient {{is said to be}} [...] "tolerating" [...] a drug when they can tolerate its adverse effects. It is {{not to be confused with}} a drug allergy, which is a form of drug intolerance, but requires an immune-mediated component. It is also not to be confused with drug tolerance ("drug resistance," [...] or tachyphylaxis) which refers to a lack of adverse effects even at higher than average doses. Some instances of drug intolerance are known to result from genetic variations in drug metabolism.|$|R
