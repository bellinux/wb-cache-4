25|$|The trams were {{initially}} used on KKS's three lines. Most services were only {{run with the}} motor cars and the trailers were seldom used. Some of the trams were on occasion leased to Holmenkolbanen, who used them on the Holmenkollen Line. The lack of <b>secondary</b> <b>suspension</b> caused complaints from customers who experienced a smoother ride with the trams operated by KSS and KES. KKS was sold to KSS in 1905 and the latter took over all the rolling stock. They were thereafter gradually painted in KSS's green color scheme. The open bays {{were removed from the}} motor cars in 1910 and renumbered 48–67. The trolley was replaced with a pantograph in 1915.|$|E
500|$|The {{last day}} with SM91 in service was on 1 November 2002. By then, 27 of the SL95-trams had been delivered, and Oslo Sporveier {{was able to}} operate its entire network with only {{articulated}} trams. Until 2003, trams 142 and 149 were not in service for long-term repairs. On 8 July 2004, a computer error caused tram 161 neither {{to be able to}} run nor open the doors, even with the emergency system. This was caused by the computer indicating that the tram was running at [...] while it stood still. All trams were later altered so the motorman could override such incidents. The final trams were delivered in 2004, and no. 142 was put into service in January 2005. At the same time, corrosion was discovered inside the articulation of tram 141. In 2006, Oslo Sporveier introduced a program to upgrade all the SL95-trams, including removing corrosion from the bodywork and the inside, as well as simplifying the lubrication of the joints, which prior to the upgrades required the entire trams to be de-hooked. These upgrades are planned to be completed by 2009. The trams have also had problems with the air supply freezing during cold spells, making it impossible to retract the side mirrors when changing direction, and terminating the <b>secondary</b> <b>suspension.</b> This requires the trams to be operated at walking speed without passengers.|$|E

To study the HST vibration dynamics the multibody system model has been developed and implemented in commercial software Gensys. By using the developed model and evolutionary algorithm the lateral damping parameters of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>suspensions</b> have been optimized. The results of optimization are presented via Pareto fronts with respect to safety and comfort objectives and via Pareto sets with respect to lateral damping parameters of bogie’s primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The optimized solutions provide deep insight into HST vibration dynamics. By using the obtained results adaptive control strategies for switching suspensions’ damping parameters are proposed which allow to increase vehicle service speeds and to enhance safety and comfort...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design methodology {{for the development}} of self-powered active lateral <b>secondary</b> <b>suspensions</b> for rail vehicles. It firstly investigates the energy flows in the active lateral <b>secondary</b> <b>suspensions</b> and analyzes the conditions for self-powered control in detail. The impact of the controller design on both the ride quality and the energy consumption is then used to guide the design/specification of actuators and to define key actuator parameters in order to achieve both expected performance improvement and zero-energy consumption for the actuators. Furthermore, a control strategy for dealing with larger than expected energy consumptions by the active suspensions is proposed to eliminate excessive power requirements, but also to ensure the ride quality improvement in comparison to that of passive suspensions. Computer simulations are used to validate the control strategy for the self-powered active suspension...|$|R

30|$|The {{suspension}} elements are directly proportional {{with the standard}} deviation of car body lateral acceleration and inversely proportional with the standard deviation of the car body lateral stroke. Lateral suspension stiffness elements of <b>secondary</b> air <b>suspensions,</b> K_sy, and <b>secondary</b> center pivot <b>suspension,</b> K_cpy, have both {{significant impact on the}} lateral response of the rail vehicle in comparison to the effect of the viscous lateral damper, C_sy. <b>Secondary</b> air <b>suspension</b> stiffness along lateral direction, K_sy, has the most significant effect on the passenger comfort, since its effect is doubled by the existence of two number of <b>secondary</b> air <b>suspensions</b> in comparison to single-center pivot suspension. The selection of softer lateral suspension stiffness provides better ride quality resulting in lower lateral car body accelerations but greater lateral car body displacements.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>suspensions</b> of a railway vehicle on {{stability}} and passenger ride comfort. The possible improvement of conventional suspension without using a controllable suspension system is investigated. A linear 17 degree-of-freedom (DOF) railway vehicle model is used to study the vibration response of the railway vehicle body. The equations of motion that represent the dynamics of the railway vehicle were derived based on Newton laws to describe the lateral, yaw and roll motions of the vehicle body, bogies and also wheel-sets. The spring stiffnesses and damping coefficients of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>suspensions</b> were varied incrementally in order to observe the response of the railway vehicle body. The vehicle model was simulated with lateral sinusoidal track disturbance using Matlab-SIMULINK software.
