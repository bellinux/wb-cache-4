5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
25|$|Rosa Parks {{was born}} Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee, Alabama, on February 4, 1913, to Leona (née Edwards), a teacher, and James McCauley, a carpenter. She was of African ancestry, though {{one of her}} great-grandfathers was Scots-Irish {{and one of her}} great-grandmothers was a slave of Native American descent. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> as a child and {{suffered}} poor health with chronic tonsillitis. When her parents separated, she moved with her mother to Pine Level, just outside the state capital, Montgomery. She grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester. They all were members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), a century-old independent black denomination founded by free blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|George Formby {{was born}} James Lawler Booth in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, on 4 October 1875. He was the illegitimate and {{only child of}} Sarah Jane Booth (c. 1856–1912), a poor, {{illiterate}} cotton weaver. His father, Francis Lawler, a coal miner, was not named on the birth certificate; {{six months after the}} birth of their son, the couple married, both aged about 19. Sarah worked as a prostitute; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> around [...] tall, and sang in pubs in exchange for alcoholic drinks. She was convicted 140 times for offences that included theft, prostitution, drunkenness and brawling. The marriage was turbulent, and Formby was often neglected, mistreated and suffered malnourishment. Because Sarah was frequently absent from home, and often detained overnight at the local police station, Formby was [...] regularly forced to sleep outside. As a result he developed asthma and became susceptible to bronchitis. In his later years he recalled that his [...] "childhood was the most miserable as ever fell to the lot of a human creature".|$|E

500|$|Beatrice Romaine Goddard {{was born}} in Rome, Italy in , the {{youngest}} of three children of wealthy Americans Ella (Waterman) Goddard and Major Henry Goddard. Her maternal grandfather was the multi-millionaire Isaac S. Waterman, Jr. Her parents divorced when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> and her father abandoned the family. [...] Beatrice was raised by her mother, who was unstable and abused her emotionally while doting on her mentally ill brother, St. Mar. They lived mostly in New York, where {{from an early age}} Goddard had to tend to St. Mar because he attacked anyone else who came near him. According to her memoir, when she was seven, her mother fostered her to a poor family living in a New York City tenement, then disappeared and stopped making the agreed-upon payments. The family continued to care for Beatrice, although they sank further into poverty. She did not tell them where her grandfather lived for fear of being returned to her mother.|$|E
500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>small</b> and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had [...] "learned to accept and love" [...] herself and added: [...] "...the {{most important thing is to}} think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will".|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Reckless was {{chestnut}} colored with a blaze {{and three}} white stockings. Her {{date of birth}} and parentage are unconfirmed, but she {{was estimated to be}} around three or four years old when she was purchased by members of the United States Marine Corps in October 1952. She was sold to the Marines by her owner, a young Korean stableboy called Kim Huk Moon, though that was not his real name. The horse was originally named [...] in Korean, which translates to [...] "Morning Flame" [...] or [...] "Flame-of-the-Morning", also reputed to be the name of her dam, a racehorse at the track in Seoul. Moon sold the horse, whom he had nicknamed [...] "Flame", to Lieutenant Eric Pedersen for $250 in order to buy a leg prosthesis for his sister, who had stepped on a land mine. The horse's breeding was thought to be primarily Mongolian though she did have some features, particularly the shape of her head, that were similar to horses of Thoroughbred lineage. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> standing only [...] and weighing [...]|$|E

500|$|Although {{book editor}} and {{university}} instructor James Michener could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright Quaker, he {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Navy in October 1942. [...] He was not sent to the South Pacific theater until April 1944, when {{he was assigned to}} write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely. [...] He survived a plane crash in New Caledonia; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the Treasury Islands, where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by [...] "scrawny residents and only one pig". [...] Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales. On a plantation on the island of Espiritu Santo, he met a woman named Bloody Mary; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> almost toothless, her face stained with red betel juice. [...] Punctuated with profanity learned from GIs, she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other Tonkinese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated. [...] She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in French Indochina. These stories, collected into Tales of the South Pacific, won Michener the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.|$|E
2500|$|In either case, such {{encouragement}} {{would have}} been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status. [...] When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>small,</b> her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her. As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science. Her mother Gabrielle-Anne was horrified at her progress and fought Louis-Nicolas at every step, once attempting to have Émilie sent to a convent.|$|E
