The {{compatibility}} of <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> modification {{agent and}} matrix asphalt was excellent, while different {{contents of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> had great influence on the mechanics properties of mixture. Based on the aggregate grade of the AC- 20 mixture, the mechanical properties of the matrix asphalt mixtures and the <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixtures with different quantities of <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> were studied by laboratory tests, including the high-temperature stability, low-temperature anti-cracking performance and water stability. This research is to give reference for the proper <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> quantity of the mixture...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{exists in}} large {{quantities}} in Buton Island, Indonesia, and until late 1990 s was used extensively in its natural state as a surfacing layer for existing road pavements.

Given the relatively high cost of refinery bitumen and the existence within the country of large resources of <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt,</b> the outcome of the research of natural <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> becomes significant for those involved in implementing the highway maintenance programs...|$|R

The {{results show that}} compared with common asphalt mixture, rutting resistances of diatomite modified asphalt mixture, modified lake asphalt mixture and modified <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture are greatly improved.

40|$|Buton <b>Rock</b> <b>Asphalt</b> (BRA) {{is natural}} <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> found in Buton Island, Northwest Sulawesi, Indonesia. This study compares the {{performance}} of asphalt concrete made by two different methods of BRA binder preparation. The fust method heats and crushes the <b>rock</b> into granular <b>asphalt,</b> while the second method extracts and recovers the bitumen out of the rock to produce pure BRA bitumen. Petroleum bitumen {{is used as a}} control. Rheological properties of pure BRA bitumen, a blend of petroleum bitumen, and pure BRA bitumen were determined. The properties of these binders were used to quantify the contribution of binder in resisting permanent deformation and fatigue crackmg. Bituminous mixtures of different BRA binders and petroleum bitumen were prepared. Ordinary bitumen was added to the mixture of granular BRA to achieve the optimum bitumen content. It was found that BRA binders yield mixtures with better stifhess modulus, rate of permanent deformation, and creep stifhess compared to petroleum bitumen mixture. Mixtures with a higher percentage of granular BRA yield a better performance when compared to the mixture of pure BRA bitumen. It may be concluded that granular BRA would be the best alternative, provided that the transportation cost of the material from Buton Island can be competitive...|$|R
