40|$|Ecological {{concepts}} and data may justify {{the selection of}} biodiversity conservation plans among different options, but {{can also lead to}} poor conservation guidelines if not properly used. The use and meaning of the 'surrogate' concept in ecology and conservation planning contexts is a typical example. <b>Surrogates</b> are entities such as species, environmental variables or habitats, which are used to represent a target entity such as genes, species, ecosystems or related metrics. 'Pattern-based surrogacy' identifies effective <b>surrogates</b> using statistical congruence, while 'selection-based surrogacy' identifies effective <b>surrogates</b> through a notional conservation plan or prioritization analysis where sites are added to a set of protected areas, often using a complementarity criterion between sites. With this clear framework in mind, an investigation of the coral reef literature revealed that most published studies on <b>surrogates</b> of reef biodiversity refer in fact to pattern-based <b>surrogates.</b> Fundamentally, {{there is nothing wrong with}} both approaches. However, efficient pattern-based <b>surrogates</b> are often recommended for conservation planning, implying that they could be efficient selection-based <b>surrogates.</b> In fact, efficient pattern-based <b>surrogates</b> are not necessarily efficient selection-based <b>surrogates</b> and vice versa. The reason is the complementarity rules used by selection algorithms. We call for more clarity from authors on the context in which effective <b>surrogates</b> have to be used, and more caution from managers when <b>surrogates</b> are to be used in conservation plans...|$|R

40|$|Because {{conservation}} planners typically lack data {{on where}} species occur, environmental <b>surrogates</b> including geophysical settings and climate types {{have been used}} to prioritize sites within a planning area. We reviewed 622 evaluations of the effectiveness of abiotic <b>surrogates</b> in representing species in 19 study areas. Sites selected using abiotic <b>surrogates</b> represented more species than an equal number of randomly selected sites in 43 % of tests (55 % for plants) and on average improved on random selection of sites by about 8 % (21 % for plants). Environmental diversity (ED) (42 % median improvement on random selection) and biotically informed clusters showed promising results and merit additional testing. We suggest 4 ways to improve performance of abiotic <b>surrogates.</b> First, analysts should consider a broad spectrum of candidate variables to define <b>surrogates,</b> including rarely used variables related to geographic separation, distance from coast, hydrology, and within-site abiotic diversity. Second, abiotic <b>surrogates</b> should be defined at fine thematic resolution. Third, sites (the landscape units prioritized within a planning area) should be small enough to ensure that <b>surrogates</b> reflect species' environments and to produce prioritizations that match the spatial resolution of conservation decisions. Fourth, if species inventories are available for some planning units, planners should define <b>surrogates</b> based on the abiotic variables that most influence species turnover in the planning area. Although species inventories increase the cost of using abiotic <b>surrogates,</b> a modest number of inventories could provide the data needed to select variables and evaluate <b>surrogates.</b> Additional tests of nonclimate abiotic <b>surrogates</b> are needed to evaluate the utility of conserving nature's stage as a strategy for conservation planning in the face of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{interventions}} {{implemented in}} slaughter establishments for {{the reduction of}} enteric pathogens on beef carcasses must be validated to demonstrate efficacy under commercial operation conditions. Validation studies can be conducted using <b>surrogates</b> which are nonpathogenic organisms that respond to a particular treatment in a manner equivalent to a target pathogen. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify <b>surrogates</b> for enteric pathogens to validate antimicrobial interventions on beef carcasses. The growth, attachment, resistance properties as well as the response to interventions on beef carcasses of nonpathogenic fluorescent protein-marked E. coli strains were evaluated and compared to E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella strains. Growth curves were performed in tryptic soy broth at 37 ?C and it was demonstrated that in general, growth parameters were not different among <b>surrogates</b> and target pathogens. Thermal resistance was compared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 55, 60 and 65 ?C; D-values of <b>surrogates</b> were not different or were higher than those of target pathogens. The acid resistance of <b>surrogates</b> was not different to that of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in PBS acidified with lactic acid at pH 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5. Some Salmonella serotypes were found to be less acid resistant than the <b>surrogates.</b> Survival of <b>surrogates</b> after storage at low temperatures (4 ?C and - 18 ?C) was not different or was longer than survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella. Additionally, the cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment to beef carcasses surfaces was not different among <b>surrogates</b> and pathogens. Antimicrobial interventions were applied on carcass surfaces under laboratory controlled conditions. After application of hot water washes, D-values were not different among <b>surrogates</b> and pathogens, while no differences were observed in log reductions (CFU/cm 2) among <b>surrogates</b> and pathogens when 2 % L-lactic acid sprays at 25 and 55 ?C were applied, regardless of the temperature and volume of the acid solution. The response of <b>surrogates</b> to water washes and lactic acid sprays on beef carcasses was also evaluated in commercial slaughter facilities. Reductions of <b>surrogates</b> were not different to those of aerobic plate count, coliforms and E. coli. However, the <b>surrogates</b> showed less variation and provided more consistent results than traditional indicators...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} communication {{experiences of}} <b>surrogates</b> {{who had recently}} made a major medical decision for a hospitalized older adult. DESIGN: Semistructured interviews about a recent hospitalization. SETTING: Two hospitals affiliated with one large medical school: an urban public hospital and a university-affiliated tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: <b>Surrogates</b> were eligible if they had recently made a major medical decision for a hospitalized individual aged 65 and older and were available for an interview within 1 month (2 - 5 months if the patient died). MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: Thirty-five <b>surrogates</b> were interviewed (80 % female, 44 % white, 56 % African American). Three primary themes emerged. First, {{it was found that}} the nature of surrogate-clinician relationships was best characterized as a relationship with a "team" of clinicians rather than individual clinicians because of frequent staff changes and multiple clinicians. Second, <b>surrogates</b> reported their communication needs, including frequent communication, information, and emotional support. <b>Surrogates</b> valued communication from any member of the clinical team, including nurses, social workers, and physicians. Third, <b>surrogates</b> described trust and mistrust, which were formed largely through surrogates' communication experiences. CONCLUSION: In the hospital, <b>surrogates</b> form relationships with a "team" of clinicians rather than with individuals, yet effective communication and expressions of emotional support frequently occur, which <b>surrogates</b> value highly. Future interventions should focus on meeting surrogates' needs for frequent communication and high levels of information and emotional support...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the contact arrangements and relationships between <b>surrogates</b> and surrogacy families and whether these outcomes differed according {{to the type of}} surrogacy undertaken. Surrogates' motivations for carrying out multiple surrogacy arrangements were also examined, and surrogates' psychological health was assessed. Semi-structured interviews were administered to 34 women who had given birth to a child conceived through surrogacy approximately 7 [*]years prior to interview. Some <b>surrogates</b> had carried out multiple surrogacy arrangements, and data were collected on the frequency, type of contact, and <b>surrogate's</b> feelings about the level of contact in each surrogacy arrangement, the <b>surrogate's</b> relationship with each child and parent, and her experience of, and motivation for, each surrogacy. Questionnaire measures of psychological health were administered. <b>Surrogates</b> had completed a total of 102 surrogacy arrangements and remained in contact with the majority of families, and reported positive relationships in most cases. <b>Surrogates</b> were happy with their level of contact in the majority of arrangements and most were viewed as positive experiences.
