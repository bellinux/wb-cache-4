5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (<b>see</b> <b>image).</b> However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the three were {{grounded}} on July 14, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which {{had been brought to}} map the region from the air, became instead a means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek. Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (<b>see</b> <b>image</b> above).|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (<b>see</b> <b>image).</b> Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E

5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (<b>see</b> <b>image),</b> which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} causes for the {{pathology}} of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (<b>see</b> <b>image</b> of the enzyme structure), which {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Lead also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, another enzyme involved in the formation of heme. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the joining of protoporphyrin and Fe2+ to form heme. Lead's interference with heme synthesis results in production of zinc protoporphyrin and the development of anemia. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (<b>see</b> <b>image).</b> Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E

5|$|The plan seemed ill-conceived and {{suggests}} that Narborough was obsessed {{by the possibility of}} treasure. It is also possible that Phips was being used in a complex way, with the sly intention that HMS Rose would act as a noisy decoy for his more important treasure hunt. Unlike the Falcon and Bonetta, Phips was not sent directly to search near Hispaniola where Narborough (correctly) believed a great treasure lay buried. Phips' instructions were not kept secret but were signed by the entire crew, thereby broadcasting their designs through the harbor and shipyards. On July 13, 1683, the articles of agreement (<b>see</b> <b>image)</b> were signed by Phips and seven other crew members, in the presence of Narborough and Haddock.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (<b>see</b> <b>image),</b> gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (<b>see</b> <b>image</b> directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E

5|$|William Thomas Stearn {{was born}} at 37 Springfield Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871/2–1922) and Ellen ("Nellie") Kiddy (1886–1986) of West Suffolk. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the River Cam, about two miles north of Cambridge's City Centre, where Springfield Road ran {{parallel}} to Milton Road to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (<b>see</b> <b>image).</b> Despite not having any family background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed {{a keen interest in}} natural history and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the wild flowers of the hedgerows and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when William was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties since his widow had no pension.|$|E
5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (<b>see</b> <b>image).</b> The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.|$|E

5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (<b>see</b> <b>image</b> from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
