5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
25|$|The name Gacaca {{is derived}} from the Kinyarwanda word umucaca meaning “a plant <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> to sit on that people prefer to gather on it”.

25|$|For pure {{chemical}} elements, polymorphism {{is known}} as allotropy. For example, diamond and graphite are two crystalline forms of carbon, while amorphous carbon is a noncrystalline form. Polymorphs, despite having the same atoms, may have wildly different properties. For example, diamond is among the hardest substances known, while graphite is <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> that it {{is used as a}} lubricant.|$|E
25|$|The {{pome fruits}} {{produced}} by plants in subtribe Pyrinae of family Rosaceae, such as apples and pears, have a structure (the core) in which tough tissue clearly separates the seeds {{from the outer}} softer pericarp. However, {{some of the smaller}} pomes are sometimes referred to as berries. Amelanchier pomes become <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> at maturity that they resemble a blueberry and are known as Juneberries, serviceberries or Saskatoon berries.|$|E
25|$|Stylistically, the {{lighting}} in the San Zaccaria piece has become <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> and diffuse {{that it makes}} that in the San Giobbe appear almost raking in contrast. Giovanni's use of the oil medium had matured, and the holy figures seem to be swathed in a still, rarefied air. The San Zaccaria is considered perhaps the most beautiful and imposing of all Giovanni's altarpieces, and is dated 1505, the year following that of Giorgione's Madonna of Castelfranco.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem was}} caused by heavy rain over the weekend prior to the game, which made the dirt in the sliding pits and pitcher's mound <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> that the cutouts {{covering}} them in the football configuration became mushy and uneven. Even when new dirt was shoveled on top, it quickly became just as saturated as the old dirt. The problem was solved by using asphalt hot mix, which allowed for a solid, level playing surface, but required a jackhammer for removal whenever the stadium was converted from football back to baseball (between August and October of each year).|$|E
25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as [...] "touching," [...] "moving," [...] {{as well as}} [...] "titillating". Film critic Glenn Kenny, {{in a review of}} the film for Premiere, stated that the relationship between Betty and Rita is [...] "possibly the healthiest, most positive amorous relationship ever depicted in a Lynch movie", whereas the French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for Cahiers du cinéma, noted that the love between the women depicted is [...] "of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema". In the pages of Film Comment, Philip Lopate held that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made so poignant and tender by Betty's [...] "understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire... It is a beautiful moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine maintained that the scene's [...] "eroticism [...] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows". Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent Film Channel as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor states, [...] "Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> and velvety it's like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film's dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed." [...] The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita–which borders on outright obsession–has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: [...] "The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire".|$|E

2500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "I'm Out", a [...] "crystalline" [...] rhythmic pop ladies' anthem, which {{features}} American rapper Nicki Minaj. Its melody {{is backed by}} [...] "clattering percussion". It was written by Timothy and Theron Thomas (Planet VI), who also wrote track number four, [...] "Keep On Looking". Other pop songs on the album include the Wynter Gordon-penned [...] "Livin' It Up", which was described by Billboard as a [...] "feel-good track" [...] that [...] "infuses island flavors." [...] It samples elements of the bridge from rap duo Kid 'n Play's 1988 song [...] "Rolling with Kid 'n Play". According to Idolator, it also contains Euro influences. [...] "Overdose" [...] is also a pop song, though this time utilising an electropop production and electronic dance music (EDM) beat, that was described by Idolator as the [...] "most straightforward pop track that Ciara has ever cut". The Rodney Jerkins-produced [...] "Read My Lips" [...] features a 1980s-inspired synthpop production with a sing-along chorus, whilst [...] "Sophomore" [...] is [...] "sexy-but-aggressive [...] grown-as-fuck." [...] On [...] "Sophomore", Ciara educates her partner on [...] "sex education", with lyrics such as [...] "So soft, my skin/ <b>So</b> <b>soft,</b> my booty/ <b>So</b> <b>soft,</b> my bed/ <b>So</b> <b>soft,</b> I got 'em sayin'/ Give me more". The song was originally leaked by DJ Orator in September 2012. It was produced by Soundz, who also co-produced [...] "DUI" [...] with The Rockstars. The album's lead single [...] "Body Party" [...] is the album's only ballad, it was co-written by Ciara's boyfriend Future and features a sample of Ghost Town DJ's 1996 single [...] "My Boo".|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} schedule originally {{called for the}} chariot race to be shot in the spring, when weather was cooler for the horses and when Wyler would not be placing heavy demands on Heston and Boyd's time.

Shooting of the chariot sequence began {{on the same day}} as principal photography. Once again filming was delayed.

2500|$|Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for {{the main}} reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a {{considerable}} degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track reel to reel, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album Educated Guess. She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including [...] "The Million You Never Made" [...] (Not a Pretty Girl), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, [...] "The Next Big Thing" [...] (Not <b>So</b> <b>Soft),</b> which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and [...] "Napoleon" [...] (Dilate), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{appeared}} before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 15 July 2003, Kelly appeared to be under severe stress which was probably increased by the televising of the proceedings. He spoke with a voice <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> that the air-conditioning equipment had to be turned off {{even though it was}} one of the hottest days of the year. His evidence to the committee was that he had not said the things Gilligan had reported his source as saying, and members of the committee came to the conclusion that he had not been the source. Some of the questioning was very precise. The Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, in particular, used a forceful tone in his cross-examination. For example, when asked to simply list the journalists that he met, Kelly declined to answer and requested that such a list be sought from the MoD, which triggered a response: [...] "...This is the high court of Parliament and I want you to tell the Committee who you met... You are under an obligation to reply". [...] The Chairman of the Committee (Donald Anderson) underscored the validity of MacKinlay's question telling Kelly: [...] "It is a proper question... If you have met journalists there is nothing sinister in itself about meeting journalists, save in an unauthorised way." [...] Mackinlay offered his opinion that Kelly had been used by Gilligan telling Kelly: [...] "I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The governor's {{commission}} {{was the first}} to release its findings, titled Report of the Commission appointed by Governor C. C. Young to investigate the causes leading to the failure of the St. Francis dam near Saugus, California. The report became the most widely distributed analysis. Along with most of the other investigators, they perceived the new leak as the key to understanding the collapse, although the commission believed that [...] "the foundation under the entire dam left very much to be desired." [...] The report stated, [...] "With such a formation, the ultimate failure of this dam was inevitable, unless water could have been kept from reaching the foundation. Inspection galleries, pressure grouting, drainage wells and deep cut-off walls are commonly used to prevent or remove percolation, but it is improbable that any or all of these devices would have been adequately effective, though they would have ameliorated the conditions and postponed the final failure." [...] They placed the cause of the failure on the western hillside. [...] "The west end," [...] the commission stated, [...] "was founded upon a reddish conglomerate which, even when dry, was of decidedly inferior strength and which, when wet, became <b>so</b> <b>soft</b> that most of it lost almost all rock characteristics." [...] The softening of the [...] "reddish conglomerate" [...] undermined the west side. [...] "The rush of water released by failure of the west end caused a heavy scour against the easterly canyon wall ... and caused the failure of that part of the structure." [...] There then [...] "quickly followed ... the collapse of large sections of the dam." ...|$|E
