5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> This aspect {{of her life and}} career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} her {{attempted}} suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed {{to undertake the}} long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties. Not only was her journey to Scandinavia fraught with peril (<b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> travelling alone {{during a time of}} war), it was also laced with sorrow and anger. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after Imlay failed to meet her in Hamburg. Wollstonecraft's despair increased as her journey progressed.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Maria began {{attending}} the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, {{and the next year}} with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Young {{became an}} {{industrial}} research chemist, {{working in the}} lacquer industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became {{an assistant professor of}} chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> and refused to hire her. Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E
5|$|Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben was a Protestant canoness (meaning that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{living in}} a {{religious}} community, but not bound by a perpetual vow) at a convent in Gerresheim, today a district of Düsseldorf. After 1579, she maintained a lengthy liaison with the Archbishop of Cologne, Gebhard of Waldburg-Trauchburg, Truchsess of Waldburg. In defense of her honor, two of her brothers convinced Gebhard to marry her, and Gebhard considered converting to Calvinism for her. Rumors spread throughout the Electorate of his possible conversion, and that he might refuse to relinquish his position. The Electorate had overcome similar problems. Hermann of Wied had converted to Protestantism and resigned in 1547. Salentin of Isenburg-Grenzau, Gebhard's immediate predecessor, had resigned upon his marriage. In December 1582, Gebhard announced his conversion and extended equal religious rights to Protestants in the Electorate. In February, he married Agnes. At the end of March 1583, the Pope excommunicated him. The Cathedral chapter promptly elected a new archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria.|$|E

25|$|The {{college is}} the first American {{institution}} of higher education to have granted a bachelor's degree to an African-American, graduating Alexander Twilight {{in the class of}} 1823. Middlebury {{was also one of the}} first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution, following the trustees' decision in 1883 to accept women. In 1886, May Belle Chellis was the first woman to graduate and she was the valedictorian (although she was not allowed to address the graduating class because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman).</b> Middlebury was listed as tied for the sixth-best liberal arts college in the U.S. in the 2018 U.S. News & World Report rankings.|$|E

25|$|Surviving {{accounts}} of the expedition differ on when Baret's gender was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumors that Baret was a woman had circulated for some time, but her gender was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached Tahiti in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore to botanize, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried out that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> It was necessary to return her to the ship {{to protect her from}} the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the Étoile to interview Baret personally.|$|E

In Chile she was welcomed {{by the secretary of}} the governor, who was her brother, Don Miguel de Erauso, but did not recognize her. She remained there for three years and because of a dispute with her brother, (possibly because of another woman) was banished to Paicabí, the land of Indians.

25|$|The Empress's faction lacked an {{equivalent}} war leader to Stephen. Matilda had a firm grounding in government from her time as empress, {{where she had}} presided in court cases and acted as regent in Italy with the Imperial army on campaign. Nonetheless, Matilda, as a woman, could not personally lead forces into battle. Matilda was less popular with contemporary chroniclers than Stephen; in many ways she took after her father, being prepared to loudly demand compliance of her court, when necessary issuing threats and generally appearing arrogant. This was felt to be particularly inappropriate since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, {{played an important role}} in seizing Normandy during the war but did not cross into England. Geoffrey and Matilda's marriage was not an easy one; it had almost collapsed altogether in 1130.|$|E

She then became principal at the Girl's High School in Yazoo, Mississippi, where she remained for 7 years. She resigned the position in the early 1880s in order to recuperate from a serious illness. Andrews then returned to Washington to become the principal at her former seminary school. She received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Wesleyan Female College in Macon, Georgiain 1882. In 1885 she moved to Macon, working {{as a professor of}} French and literature there from 1886 to 1896, before returning once again to Washington and devoting herself full-time to lecturing and writing.|$|E
25|$|Gaudron was {{admitted}} to the New South Wales Bar in October 1968 after having completed her articles of clerkship and commenced practice as a barrister.

She eventually shared a room with Janet Coombs, another pioneering female barrister. Gaudron regularly argued before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court in the early 1970s, particularly in the area of industrial law. In 1972 she became the first woman to be appointed to the Council of the New South Wales Bar.|$|E
