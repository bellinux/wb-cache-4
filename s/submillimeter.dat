5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel {{was not designed}} to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and <b>submillimeter.</b> It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, robotic {{spacecraft}} {{have been}} sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface in extensive detail. In addition, remote sensing of Mars from Earth by ground-based and orbiting telescopes has continued across much of the electromagnetic spectrum. These include infrared observations to determine the composition of the surface, ultraviolet and <b>submillimeter</b> observation of the atmospheric composition, and radio measurements of wind velocities.|$|E
5|$|The high {{sensitivity}} of superconducting niobium nitride bolometers make them an ideal detector for electromagnetic radiation in the THz frequency band. These detectors were tested at the <b>Submillimeter</b> Telescope, the South Pole Telescope, the Receiver Lab Telescope, and at APEX, {{and are now}} used in the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Observations of 55 Cancri A in the <b>submillimeter</b> {{region of}} the {{spectrum}} have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm. This limits the total mass of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not exclude {{the presence of an}} asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen in visible light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength surveys of the HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. <b>Submillimeter</b> observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for <b>submillimeter</b> and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E

SvalSat and Poker Flat are collectively responsible for half of the network's 140 daily passes. Satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using SvalSat includes the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Other American satellites include the United States Geological Survey's Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 and the private Iridium Communications' satellites.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the <b>Submillimeter</b> Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E
5|$|The far-infrared (24–70μm) and <b>submillimeter</b> (70–500μm) {{photometry}} {{performed by}} Spitzer and Herschel telescopes {{revealed that the}} surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3–7% of the surface. These studies were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake. However, another experiment has refuted these studies. Between 2006 and 2013, the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this {{study found that the}} variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous.|$|E

M. Keck Observatory at the Mauna Kea Observatory, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory at Livingston, Louisiana and Richland, Washington, and Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory in Corona del Mar, California. The Institute launched the Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech in 2006, the Keck Institute for Space Studies in 2008, {{and is also}} the current home for the Einstein Papers Project. The Spitzer Science Center (SSC), part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center located on the Caltech campus, is the data analysis and community support center for NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's Kepler Mission seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's light curve as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in infrared astronomy and <b>submillimeter</b> astronomy has revealed the constituents of other star systems.|$|E

500|$|The {{paper has}} been {{questioned}} by palaeontologists such as Andrea Cau and Thomas Holtz, who point out that feathers in theropod dinosaurs can grow in the same {{parts of the body}} as scales (as seen in Juravenator), and thus the presence of scales does not actually eliminate the presence of feathers from that part of the body. Furthermore, feathers are delicate structures which can be very easily lost due to taphonomic factors. Paleontologist Mark Witton was warmer to the study, suggesting [...] "we have to concede a scalier appearance than many of us thought likely", while also highlighting that much remains to be determined about tyrannosaurid life appearance. Though acknowledging the role that taphonomy plays in interpreting dinosaur skin, Witton points out that the scale impressions are high quality, consistent in form across all patches, and show no obvious evidence of fibre impressions or spaces for filament attachment, despite the preservation of <b>submillimeter</b> scales. More variation and evidence of deformation might be expected if taphonomy had distorted the specimens in a significant way.|$|E

2500|$|Micro{{extrusion}} is a microforming extrusion process {{performed at}} the <b>submillimeter</b> range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990. Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later. Regardless of method, {{one of the greatest}} challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. [...] "The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes." [...] Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the crystallite (grain) structure and boundaries.|$|E
