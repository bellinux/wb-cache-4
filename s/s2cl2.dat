5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, <b>S2Cl2,</b> SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E

50|$|Disulfur dichloride, <b>S2Cl2,</b> is {{the most}} common {{impurity}} in SCl2. Separation of SCl2 from <b>S2Cl2</b> is possible via distillation with PCl3 to form an azeotrope of 99% purity, however sulfur dichloride loses chlorine slowly at room temperature and reverts to disulfur dichloride. Pure samples may be stored in sealed glass ampules which develop a slight positive pressure of chlorine, halting the decomposition.|$|E

50|$|Disulfur is {{produced}} when {{an atmosphere of}} COS is irradiated with UV light using a mercury photosensitizer or when CS2, H2S2, <b>S2Cl2</b> or C2H4S are photolyzed. Singlet S2 is also formed when sulfur compounds such as H2S, PSF3 or COS are photolyzed. S2 can be generated by heating various organosulfur precursors.|$|E
50|$|Disulfur dibromide is {{the most}} stable sulfur bromide, however, its thermal {{stability}} is low. It is a toxic, orange/yellow liquid that smokes in air due to the reaction with water vapor. In the presence of moisture, disulfur dibromides reacts violently with oxidants, releasing bromide anion and sulfur oxides. In general, its reactivity resembles that of <b>S2Cl2.</b>|$|E

The more volatile byproducts such as carbon tetrachloride and sulfur dichloride can be removed by distillation.
