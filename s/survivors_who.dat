5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{arrives at}} the Ruskin Dam and finds a number of burned corpses, {{including}} those belonging to Quiet Willy and Dmitri. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is found with only minor burns, one of approximately fifty <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> were found nearby in the woods. Jeffrey Spender arrives looking for his mother, Cassandra (Veronica Cartwright), who is missing. Mulder meets with Scully about the incident, {{but she does not}} remember anything. Jeffrey sees Mulder and warns him not to get involved with his mother, who remains missing.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack, Noma sped off to depth charge the {{submarine}} while sending an SOS for West Bridge, since the initial explosion destroyed the cargo ship's wireless. Destroyer Burrows arrived {{to take on}} West Bridges <b>survivors,</b> <b>who</b> had situated themselves about a mile (2km) from the still-floating West Bridge. After boarding the destroyer, a head count revealed that four men were missing, but it also turned up two female stowaways.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{compensation}} total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each {{person who could}} prove he or she lived in Rosewood during 1923, and provide a $500,000 pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time. The four <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.|$|E

5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as a {{survivor}} during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Armenians, on {{the other}} hand, were mostly {{genocide}} <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> never fully integrated into Soviet life after their repatriation in the 1940s. The large-scale emigration of Soviet Armenians, mainly to Western countries, began in 1956. About 30,000 Soviet Armenians entered the country from 1960 to 1984, and another 60,000 moved throughout the late 1980s, during the Perestroika era. The total number of Soviet Armenian emigrants from 1956 to 1989, over 80% {{of them to the}} US, is estimated at 77,000.|$|E

Passengers included the first, second, or even third generation of descendants of the original children rescued by Sir Nicholas. The descendants of the children Sir Nicholas rescued had by 2009 grown to number 5,000 people. Passengers on the 2009 train also included Sir Nicholas's daughter Barbara. Other <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> did not travel on the reunion train instead met it at Liverpool Street.|$|E
5|$|The City of Gretna on the West Bank of the Mississippi River {{received}} considerable {{press coverage}} when, {{in the aftermath}} of Hurricane Katrina (late August 2005), displaced and dehydrated <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> attempted to escape from New Orleans by walking over the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's deputies, who set up a roadblock on the bridge in the days following the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Erielhonan are {{believed}} to have lived and farmed on the peninsula. They fought several wars, the last starting in 1653 with the Five Nations of the Iroquois. Despite initial victories over the Senecas, in 1654 the Erielhonans' largest village, Rique (at the modern city of Erie), was destroyed by 1,800 Iroquois warriors. By 1656 the Erielhonan had been destroyed as a people, although the Iroquois adopted <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> were absorbed primarily into the Senecas.|$|E

5|$|The {{party of}} Behar <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> had been landed at Tanjung Priok were {{initially}} interred in {{prisoner of war}} camps in Java; the male prisoners were sent to a camp near Batavia and the women were held in a female camp nearby. After {{all the members of}} the group had been interrogated, the survivors were separated and sent to other camps in Java or to work as slave labourers in Japan. All the survivors were freed after the end of the war in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> are able to achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is {{an extended period of}} nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|The train derails en route, {{forcing the}} duo to proceed on foot. As they fight through the disorganized Combine forces and rampant alien infestations, Kleiner {{appears on the}} screens Breen once used to pass out propaganda, and gives out useful updates to the {{evacuating}} citizens about the latest turn of events as well as reiterating the Citadel's imminent collapse. Alyx and Gordon eventually meet up with Barney Calhoun {{and a group of}} other <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> are preparing to move on a train station to escape City 17. Alyx and Gordon provide cover for the passengers as they board.|$|E

5|$|According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them {{returned}} to Mangalore and its environs, whilst 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1883) mentions that 15,000 persons returned, of whom 12,000 were from South Canara and 3,000 from North Canara. According to the Mangalorean Catholic genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely {{from the small}} group of <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> {{returned to}} South Canara. Soon after the death of Tipu, a detachment from the Bombay army under Lieutenant-Colonel Wiseman took possession of Mangalore on 4 June 1799, as well as the entire province of Canara, {{with the exception of the}} fortress of Jamalabad.|$|E
5|$|Chris {{appears in}} the 2010 live-action film , portrayed by Wentworth Miller.

He is reunited with his sister Claire, who cannot remember him because of memory damage caused by an Umbrella mind control device. He, Alice and Claire eventually defeat Albert Wesker and rescue imprisoned survivors being used for Umbrella's experiments. Miller said he prepared for the role by searching for images and videos of Chris on the Internet, as well as doing cardio for endurance.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Rare for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It was released in North America on October 11, 1999 and in Europe on November 2, 1999. The game follows the story of {{three members of the}} Jet Force Gemini team and their efforts to stop the advances of the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his army. It features a single-player mode where the player must explore a galaxy and save Tribals, a race of <b>survivors</b> <b>who</b> have been enslaved and imprisoned by Mizar, and places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete in traditional deathmatch games.|$|E
