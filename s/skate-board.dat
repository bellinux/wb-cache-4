50|$|Helmet: Helmets are {{particularly}} popular with sidemount divers, as {{they provide a}} convenient mounting point for primary and/or back-up lights. The primary function of the helmet remains to provide head protection in overhead environments. Sidemount configuration can mean that the more typical method of mounting back-up lights below the diver's shoulder D-rings becomes less favorable. This area is more heavily loaded with bungee and deco stage attachments, reducing access to back-up lights stowed from the D-ring. Mounting primary lights on the helmet can be advantageous as it frees up the hands in very confined spaces and/or when heavily task-loaded with other equipment. The draw-backs to helmet mounted lights are that it can {{increase the risk of}} snagging the helmet on obstructions and an increased potential to inadvertently dazzling dive buddies. Sidemount divers may choose to make their own helmet by adapting an existing climbing, kayaking or <b>skate-boarding</b> helmet, or may purchase an off-the-shelf cave/sidemount diving helmet.|$|R
40|$|Background—Skateboarding {{injuries}} {{have increased}} {{with the rise}} in popularity of the sport, and the injury pattern {{can be expected to}} have changed with the devel-opment of both skateboard tricks and the materials used for skateboard construc-tion. Objective—To describe the injury pattern of today. Methods—The pattern of injuries, cir-cumstances, and severity were investi-gated in a study of all 139 people injured in skateboarding accidents during the period 1995 – 1998 inclusive and admitted to the University Hospital of Umeå. This is the only hospital in the area, serving a population of 135 000. Results—Three of the 139 injured were pedestrians hit by a skateboard rider; the rest were riders. The age range was 7 – 47 years (mean 16). The severity of the injuries was minor (AIS 1) to moderate (AIS 2); fractures were classified as mod-erate. The annual number of injuries increased during the study period. Frac-tures were found in 29 % of the casualties, and four children had concussion. The most common fractures were of the ankle and wrist. Older patients had less severe injuries, mainly sprains and soft tissue injuries. Most children were injured while skateboarding on ramps and at arenas; only 12 (9 %) were injured while <b>skate-boarding</b> on roads. Some 37 % of the inju-ries occurred because of a loss of balance, and 26 % because of a failed trick attempt. Falls caused by surface irregularities resulted in the highest proportion of the moderate injuries. Conclusions—Skateboarding should be restricted to supervised skateboard parks, and skateboarders should be required to wear protective gear. These measures would reduce the number of skateboard-ers injured in motor vehicle collisions, reduce the personal injuries among skate-boarders, and reduce the number of pedestrians injured in collisions with skateboarders...|$|R
