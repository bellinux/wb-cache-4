Trois critères arthroscopiques sont décrits et analysés statistiquement sur 100 arthroscopies, pour dater le traumatisme responsable d’une lésion ligamentaire instable du carpe. La turbidité du liquide synovial (T 0 à T 4), l’infiltration synoviale hémorragique (S 0 à S 2) et l’état du cartilage (C 0 à C 4) sont corrélés au délai post-traumatique. La turbidité et l’infiltration synoviale hémorragique sont les plus significatives (p The {{goals of}} this thesis are {{to determine the}} criteria for dating an unstable scapholunate ligament tear; to assess the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of lesions of the extrinsic ligaments; to study the use of arthroscopy particularly for predynamic scapholunate instability and the testing of extrinsic ligaments; to possibly describe a new anatomical structure of carpal stabilisation; and finally, to evaluate with short follow-up the results of Viegas’s capsulodesis. Three arthroscopic criteria for dating wrist trauma causing unstable carpal ligament lesion are described and recorded in 100 arthroscopies, then subjected to statistical analysis. The turbidity of synovial fluid (T 0 to T 4), the hemorrhagic synovial infiltration (S 0 to S 2) {{and the state of}} the cartilage (C 0 to C 4) are correlated to the duration post trauma. The turbidity and the haemorrhagic synovial infi ltration are the most significant predictive criteria (p < 0. 001). The correlation between the degree of chondropathy and posttraumatic delay is also significant (p < 0. 01). The synovial infiltration has the most predictive value. The combination of three criteria increases predictivity. It is then possible to confirm the history, to determine whether it is an acute or subacute (less than 6 weeks) unstable lesion, recent chronic (6 weeks to 3 months) or old chronic (more than 3 months), or to record a pre-existing lesion. The extrinsic ligaments of the wrist can be accurately assessed by MRI scan. Two retrospective studies specified the image system and the most efficient procedure to investigate these ligaments. Imaging of these thin structures with an oblique and curved course is better performed using a three-dimensional MRI with high resolution and specific sequences with infra-millimetric cuts. The visualisation of pathologic extrinsic ligaments is improved with MRI arthrography or use of contrast. The MRI findings are correlated to clinical and arthroscopic findings. Both studies showed the benefit of high-resolution MRI to determine the site, dimensions and extent of the extrinsic ligamentous lesions of the carpus. Further study and correlations of MRI with arthroscopy are necessary to determine the exact place of MRI in the management of wrist sprains. The European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) sequence classifies the arthroscopic scapholunate instability in four stages according to the scapholunate gap. It divides the stage III of Geissler’s classification into volar widening (IIIa), dorsal widening (IIIb) and complete widening (IIIc). An arthroscopic cadaveric study was done to describe the impact of extrinsic ligament lesions on the type of scapholunate instability. Four sequential series of cuts were performed, distinguishing two different groups: volar ligament cuts and dorsal cuts. The series is small and the statistical analysis is not significant, however, a pattern emerged: cutting the volar and proximal scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIOL) with the radioscapholunate ligament (RSL) and long radiolunate ligament (LRL) provoked a stage IIIA instability. The additional sectioning of the dorsal SLIOL increased the arthroscopic instability (stage IIIC) with no radiological change. Cutting the dorsal SLIOL with dorsal intercarpal ligament (DIC) provoked a dorsal arthroscopic scapholunate gap (stage IIIb); the additional sectioning of all SLIOL, volar extrinsic ligament and DIC caused an arthroscopic instability (stage IV) as well as radiologic changes. In addition to complete SLIOL sectioning, the section of at least one volar ligament and one dorsal ligament was required to cause a stage IV. A systematic method of arthroscopic testing of extrinsic carpal ligaments is described. Most extrinsic ligaments are accessible to the palpation of their intraarticular part (RSC, LRL, short radiolunate (SRL), ulnolunate (UL), ulnotriquetral (UL), dorsal radiocarpal (RCD), triquetrocapitate (TC), scaphotrapezial (ST), and DIC)). They can be almost all be directly viewed through dorsal or ulnar portals. A classification of extrinsic ligament lesions is described according to the tension and the continuity of the fibres. The dorsal capsuloligamentous scapholunate septum (DCSS) is a thickening of the dorsal capsule, the dorsal intercarpal ligament (DIC), and the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIOL) with attachments to scaphoid and lunate. An arthroscopic and fluoroscopic study has shown that the selective cutting of DCSS provoked a constant arthroscopic scapholunate change but no radiologic change. This structure appears {{to play a role in}} the stability of the scapholunate joint. The preoperative and postoperative findings of 25 patients operated using the open Viegas’ capsulodesis between 2006 and 2010 were compared. Before the procedure, the Geissler’s laxity grade was determined using arthroscopy for all patients: three cases had a grade 2, 16 cases with a grade 3 and six cases a grade 4. The mean follow-up was 20 months (13 to 45). The last clinical evaluation showed a flexion-extension range of 109 ° and a range of inclination of 66 °. The grip strength was 27. 9 kgf on average; the EVA 2. 7 and the PRWE score 43. 8. On X-ray, the scapholunate gap was 1. 88 mm on average and the scapho-lunate angle, 54 °. The follow up is obviously too short to appreciate the radiological improvement following this capsulodesis. At final review, the patients returned to all activities without symptom in 11 cases, with disconfort in nine cases, difficulties in two cases and with disability in three cases. Among these three bad results, two were re-operated fore degenerative arthritis. Scapholunate instability whether acute or chronic remains a difficult problem. Firstline carers and the general population should be informed about the progressive deterioration of some tears: return to a pain free status after a few months but silent collapse and disabling osteoarthritis after a few decades. The patient suffering from a wrist sprain is entitled to appropriate emergency treatment, which can avoid later professional and/or social disability. Diagnostic criteria are now available to date the causative trauma and to determine the age of the instable lesion. K-wire fixation in the acute or subacute phase can achieve anatomic and stable scarring of a ligament injury. Scapholunate stability depends not only on the integrity of the interosseous ligament (SLIOL) but also on extrinsic volar and dorsal ligaments and capsular attachments. Some of them, like the DCSS, are real anatomical structures. They constitute a true scapholunate complex (SLC). A lesion of any of its components can be documented using X-ray and the resulting instability with the arthroscopy. Imaging technology is in continuous progress. CT Arthrography remains the golden standard for assessment of the interosseous ligaments. MRI arthrography can show lesions of the extrinsic carpal ligaments. Arthroscopy offers a different approach to stabilizers of the carpus and particularly to the components of SLC compared to conventional imaging methods. Morphological study of the extrinsic and interosseous ligaments is limited to the surface of their intraarticular portions, but the analysis can be enhanced by accurate and specific assessment of each ligament. A new classification of predynamic arthroscopic scapholunate instability can help diagnose associated extrinsic ligament injuries. Clinical, radiological and arthroscopic correlations can help to develop clinical tests for SLC components. Symptomatic reducible chronic scapholunate instability can be improved by dorsal capsulodesis. Strengthening the dorsal part of SLIOL according.

Nous construisons cette thèse autour de trois questions : quel est le mécanisme par lequel le raisonnement éductif se met en place ? Existe-t-il des situations dans lesquelles il est plus probable que le raisonnement éductif aboutisse ? Dans ce type de situations, y a-t-il des conditions sous lesquelles les performances de ce type de raisonnement s'améliorent ? Nous identifions les environnements de feedback négatif comme des situations <b>stabilisatrices</b> pour le raisonnement éductif. Ainsi, après avoir défini le concept de raisonnement éductif et caractérisé les environnements de feedback négatif, nous introduisons et testons dans une première partie les jeux du concours de beauté à feedback négatif. La répétition, l'élicitation et la circularité sont des conditions de succès de ce type de raisonnement dans une situation de marché. Ainsi, dans une deuxième partie, nous nous intéressons à l'application des jeux à feedback négatif sur les marchés de type cobweb. Notre thèse montre que, dans des situations de feedback négatif, les croyances réflectives se transforment en croyances intuitives plus rapidement, parce qu'à travers un raisonnement éductif l'équilibre est scanné de manière répétée et l'information utile est accrue. C'est la raison pour laquelle les marchés qui ont une structure de feedback négatif sont stable s et les agents qui y interviennent ont des croyances coordonnées. The goal of {{this thesis}} is to study the eductive-type of reasoning in negative feedback situations. We address it through an experimental approach. We construct this thesis around three questions: what mechanism is the eductive type of reasoning based on? Is this type of reasoning more likely to succeed in some particular situations? Can we find particular conditions improving the performance of the eductive reasoning? We identify the negative feedback environments as stabilizing situations for the eductive reasoning. Therefore, after defining the concept of eductive reasoning and characterizing negative feedback situations, we introduce and test {{in the first part of}} this thesis a negative feedback beauty contest game. Repetition, elicitation and circularity are the conditions of its success within a market situation. Therefore, in the second part of this thesis, we are interested in the application of this game in cobweb markets. Our thesis shows that, in negative feedback situations, reflective beliefs turn faster into intuitive beliefs, because through an eductive type of reasoning, the equilibrium is scanned several times, and useful information is increased. Consequently, a market with a negative feedback structure is stable and the agents within this type of market hold coordinated beliefs. {{goal of this}} thesis is to study the eductive-type of reasoning in negative feedback situations.
