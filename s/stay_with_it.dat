25|$|A macaque mother {{moves to}} the {{periphery}} of her troop to give birth in a secluded spot, unless the group is moving, when the female must <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Macaques usually give birth on the ground. Infants are born with dark-brown hair. They consume their first solid food at five to six weeks old, and can forage independently from their mothers by seven weeks. A mother carries her infant on her belly for its first four weeks. After this time, the mother carries her infant on her back, as well. Infants continue to be carried past a year. A mother and her infant tend to avoid other troop members, and the mother may socialize again very slowly. However, alloparenting has been observed, usually by females which have not had infants of their own. Male care of infants occurs in some groups, but not in others; usually, older males protect, groom, and carry an infant as a female would.|$|E
500|$|In a 20th-anniversary {{retrospective}} {{of the franchise}} in The Telegraph, David Horspool, the history editor of the Times Literary Supplement, defended the show's overall viewpoint, saying, [...] "There's no particular reason why grown-up historians shouldn't like Horrible Histories too... They simplify, {{and they have a}} definite point of view, but all historians are guilty of that to some degree." [...] He further said that [...] "Getting children interested in the past isn't necessarily easy, and Horrible Histories does it extremely effectively—and those who come to history because it's fun seem far more likely to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> in the long run." [...] Writing for entertainment website DorkAdore, Anna Lowman added that [...] "Terry Deary had the fine idea of getting kids into history by giving the facts a human face and a joke or two... The producers of the CBBC show have perfectly transferred Deary's ethos to television." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, Prichard {{wrote to}} Eisenhower, {{reminding}} him {{of what their}} football coach had taught them: [...] "If things break badly or go against you -- <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> all the harder." [...] Eisenhower's biographer, Matthew Holland, later wrote that Eisenhower had learned important lessons on the football playing field at West Point, and concluded: [...] "World War II was won on the playing fields of West Point, and Ike {{would prove to be}} the quarterback of the winning team." ...|$|E

50|$|Severny Vestnik (Се́верный ве́стник, The Northern Messenger) was an {{influential}} Russian literary magazine founded in Saint Petersburg in 1885 by Anna Yevreinova, who <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> until 1889.|$|R
2500|$|Dyson has won {{numerous}} scientific awards {{but never}} a Nobel Prize. Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg {{has said that}} the Nobel committee has [...] "fleeced" [...] Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, [...] "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> for ten years. That wasn't my style." [...] Dyson is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the show}} itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the New York Post proclaimed, [...] "Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use {{trying to pick}} a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a {{consistent}} characterization and <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> to the show's end. And when she opens her mouth to sing, she sings!" [...] William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram said that Merman was [...] "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" [...] and asserted that the show itself was {{comparable to those of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, [...] "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in Annie have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark".|$|E
6000|$|... "We must wait," [...] Lister {{replied with}} a twinkle. [...] "The trouble about an {{adventure}} is, when you start you're often forced to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and put it over. That sometimes costs more than you reckon." ...|$|E
50|$|Christenson {{returned}} to his unit for occupation duties in Germany and Austria. He <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> {{until the end of}} the war, and attained the position of Technical Sergeant.|$|R
5000|$|In Larry R. Gerlach's book of {{interviews}} with umpires, The Men in Blue, Ballanfant said, [...] "I can truthfully say I never did like umpiring. I <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because I had to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was mighty sick," [...] he observed, {{a kindly}} smile {{lighting}} up his rugged features, [...] "but he <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> through the reefin'. Your father should {{make something of}} him. I guess he'll do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Jerry, old man. All right, Jerry. All right.--Washee-washee, you fella boy!--Coming, Jerry, coming. Stick it out, old man.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{continued}} the man, [...] "I mean to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I'll get things into shape here, fix it {{up a little}} more and soon I'll have it,"--here his face radiated with a vision of hope--"so that I won't lose a single cent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] agreed Carnally. [...] "If you're {{not pleased}} with the Laurier gang, you can fire them out, and then you might not find the other crowd much better. But if a bad emperor meant to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> you'd have to use dynamite." ...|$|E
60|$|The hunters {{fired at}} her and then took to their heels, but having found her offspring, she <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and did not pursue the men. If she had {{overtaken}} them, {{she would have been}} a terrible enemy to encounter.|$|R
5000|$|They {{took the}} case to an {{arbitrator}} to consider how much Nippon should pay in damages. By that time, America had started the Iraq War, in March 2003. This was just the event {{that would have allowed}} Nippon to cancel the charter, if <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|At Powburn {{the road}} joins the A697 {{to cross the}} River Breamish and <b>stays</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> for 2 mi. The road heads west of north passing Newtown before {{crossing}} the River Till immediately before Horton. At Horton the road continues as a C road for 7 mi past Lowick.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{acknowledged}} Winthrop grimly, [...] "there's a reason. I've put {{quite a lot}} of work in on that road-bed {{the last}} few weeks, but the trouble is I won't get a dollar unless I <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and keep up to specification until next pay-day." ...|$|E
60|$|By and by {{a cluster}} of {{buildings}} rose out of the grass. A light or two twinkled; a frame house, a sod stable, and straw-covered wheat bins that looked like huge beehives grew into shape. The homestead was good, as homesteads in the back townships went, but Festing knew the land was badly worked. Charnock had begun well, with money in the bank, but luck had been against him and he had got slack. Indeed this was Charnock's trouble; when a job got difficult, he did not <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess we'll {{be ashamed}} of this afterwards, but I have got to talk," [...] he said. [...] "Anyway, we can't all get right in with the axe and shovel. My work's here, and I've just sense enough to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Besides, it's a sure thing that {{everybody}} who goes north won't rake out money. Now, you want the snow and the cañons? You can't have them; but I'll give you drift-ice, blinding fog, reefs and breaking surf instead. You want money? Well, we'll try to meet your views on that point, and by and by we'll double what you're getting." ...|$|E
50|$|Sometimes Shove-Its {{are passed}} off as Impossibles; it's worth {{mentioning}} that a Shove-It should spin totally flat, {{and a good}} Impossible should spin totally vertical, with the foot pushing it around during the vertical rotation. A Shove-It where the back foot <b>stays</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> throughout the spin is not an Impossible.|$|R
50|$|Kyrylyuk came to FC Dnipro Cherkasy back in 1987 {{when it was}} revived in KFK {{competitions}} {{under the}} name of Dnipro Heronymivka and <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> for the next eight years. That year Dnipro won the KFK competitions and were admitted to the Soviet Second League {{under the name of}} Dnipro Cherkasy.|$|R
5000|$|Years later, Brickley {{said of his}} career, [...] "My {{story is}} a good one. I was always a B team player growing up. A walk-on through college and I finally got an {{opportunity}} because I <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I was the NHL's version of Mr. Irrelevant and I happily played 13 years." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{very soon}} {{came upon a}} Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like {{the look of the}} creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] agreed Steve. [...] "Trouble {{is that he}} can't <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Soon as he {{collects}} some pay, he {{goes off}} on the prospecting trail, and then heads for Vancouver {{with a bag of}} specimens that aren't worth anything. When the mineral men hear of a new Hollin discovery they smile. Guess he's found most everything--gold, copper, zinc, and platinum--and never made fifty cents out of them, 'cept once when, so the boys say, a mining company fellow gave him five dollars to promise he wouldn't worry him again. Now they've orders in all the offices that if Hollin comes round with any more specimens they're not to let him in." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{that boy}} was going some, too. He couldn't cover the ground fast enough. When the {{division}} superintendents {{decided to send}} the overland back over {{the way it had}} come, then up on a cross [...] "jerk" [...] to the Oregon Short Line, and back along that road to tap the Union Pacific {{the other side of the}} wreck, that boy climbed upon the pilot and said he was going to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> This was too much for the Swede and me. It meant travelling the rest of that frigid night in order to gain no more than a dozen miles or so. We said we'd wait till the wreck was cleared away, and in the meantime get a good sleep.|$|E
5000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about horns and mouthpieces. A friend of mine got me to the right sax and set-up and I just <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because it worked for me. A sax is {{like a pair of}} shoes. If you get a pair that are comfortable, you can learn how to do any kind of dance in them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ramana {{taught that}} the [...] "I"-thought will {{disappear}} and only [...] "I-I" [...] or self-awareness remains.

2500|$|... "Some may criticize Peterson for not advancing, {{for finding}} his niche and <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> {{for an entire}} career, but while {{he may not be}} the most revolutionary artist in jazz, the {{documentary}} Music in the Key of Oscar demonstrates that breaking down barriers can be accomplished in more ways than one". [...] "He was a crystallizer, rather than an innovator".|$|R
6000|$|He {{smiled in}} {{response}} to her question. [...] "No, I feel nothing but weariness and a little depression. I can't help feeling somehow as if I were burning up a part of myself in that fire--the saddle I have ridden for years, my guns, ropes, spurs, everything relating to the forest, are gone, and with them my youth. I have {{been something of a}} careless freebooter myself, I fear; but that is all over with now." [...] He looked her in the face with a sad and resolute glance. [...] "The Forest Service made a man of me, taught me to regard the future. I never accepted responsibility till I became a ranger, and in thinking it all over I have decided to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> as the boys say, 'till the spring rains.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The first {{characteristic}} of the man was his love for every beautiful thing he saw or heard. Sometimes the object which fascinated him was the widespread sea or a solitary star; sometimes it {{was the work of}} man, the product of his heart and brain attuned, such as a passage from Homer, a legend of the Middle Ages, a vase of pure lines amid the rubbish of a museum, like a bird call or the scent of violets in a city street. Whatever the object that aroused his sense of beauty, he turned aside to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> a while, as on the byways of Europe you will sometimes see a man lay down his burden and bare his head before a shrine that beckons him to pray. With this reverence for beauty Keats had other and rarer qualities: the power to express what he felt, the imagination which gave him beautiful figures, and the taste which enabled him to choose the finest words, the most melodious phrases, wherewith to reflect his thought or mood or emotion.|$|E
60|$|And I think I am {{supported}} in this feeling by the unanimous practice, {{if not the}} confessed opinion, of all artists. The painter of portrait is unhappy without his conventional white stroke under the sleeve, or beside the arm-chair; the painter of interiors feels like a caged bird, unless he can throw a window open, or set the door ajar; the landscapist dares not lose himself in forest without a gleam of light under its farthest branches, nor ventures out in rain, unless he may somewhere pierce to a better promise in the distance, or cling to some closing gap of variable blue above;--escape, hope, infinity, by whatever conventionalism sought, the desire is the same in all, the instinct constant, it is no mere point of light that is wanted in the etching of Rembrandt above instanced, a gleam of armor or fold of temple curtain would have been utterly valueless, neither is it liberty, for though we cut down hedges and level hills, and give what waste and plain we choose, on the right hand and the left, it is all comfortless and undesired, {{so long as we}} cleave not a way of escape forward; and however narrow and thorny and difficult the nearer path, it matters not, so only that the clouds open for us at its close. Neither will any amount of beauty in nearer form, make us content to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> so long as we are shut down to that alone, nor is any form so cold or so hurtful but that we may look upon it with kindness, so only that it rise against the infinite hope of light beyond. The reader can follow out the analogies of this unassisted.|$|E
