5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be <b>shut</b> <b>off.</b> Every day, the MTA moves 13 {{million gallons of water}} when it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E

5|$|At {{the maiden}} voyage of the Springfield monorail, Lanley {{arranges}} for a well-attended opening ceremony, which will divert the town's attention while he escapes {{on a plane}} to Tahiti. The whole town turns out, and Leonard Nimoy is the guest of honor. The monorail departs just before Marge and Cobb arrive. Although it runs normally at the start, the controls soon malfunction and immediately begins to over-speed around the track, leaving Homer, Bart, and the passengers in danger, as the monorail's electricity cannot be <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> due to it being solar powered.|$|E
5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun to {{overflow}} at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> {{from the}} rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2015, {{the candle}} was lit {{nearly two weeks}} prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the candle to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> until the official lighting event.|$|E
5|$|Rain from Hurricane Dean closed several roads {{throughout}} Puerto Rico {{and there}} was heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported. The hurricane's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, but sparing the island its damaging winds. In the Cayman Islands, rain flooded roads and there were high waves along the coast, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported. There were localized power outages and the water supply was <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> briefly, {{but the rest of}} the island's infrastructure was unaffected. Approximately 2,000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters.|$|E

5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of people}} {{evacuated}} from northern {{areas of the}} Philippines as Ivan approached. Power was <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> prior to the storm {{to reduce the risk}} of electrocution. Four flights were cancelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines due to the storm. Residents in Taiwan were advised to take precautions for Typhoon Ivan, though autumn typhoons are rare in the island. Vessels were urged to stay at port due to rough seas throughout the Philippines. Disaster agencies were put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and rescue vehicles were prepped.|$|E
5|$|When World War I broke out, the British cut {{the transatlantic}} {{telegraph}} cable linking the US to Germany {{in order to}} control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicist Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|In March 2002, Novogratz joined Fortress Investments {{in time to}} join Wesley Edens, Robert Kauffman, Randal Nardone and Peter Briger, Jr. {{in taking}} the company public through its February 9, 2007, initial public offering. During the IPO, the company sold an 8% share {{to the public for}} $600 million. Before {{assuming}} his roles at Fortress as principal and director of Fortress Credit Corporation in 2006, he served as Co-Chief Information Officer of Macro Funds at Fortress Investment Group LLC. Although the Fortress' domain included both hedge funds and private-equity investments, Novogratz and his fellow Princetonian Briger ran the hedge funds. Although the stock price had risen to $35 at its IPO, by December 3, 2008, it dipped to as low as $1.87 after withdrawals from Novogratz' Drawbridge Global Macro fund were <b>shut</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} along the Gulf Coast. Many marine vessels were blown ashore or sunken in Pensacola, and railroads {{in the city}} were severely damaged. Numerous wharfs were damaged or destroyed, and many roofs were torn off buildings. Three forts {{in the vicinity of}} Pensacola suffered damage. Electricity in the city was <b>shut</b> <b>off.</b> A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola. Mobile and surrounding areas suffered similar damage, including destroyed timber, smashed windows, and sunken watercraft. In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people.|$|E
5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey up to New Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led by Clinton, made a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to <b>shut</b> <b>off</b> Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no farther up the river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale.|$|E
