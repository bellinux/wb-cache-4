5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E
5|$|Unlike humans, horses do not <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solid, {{unbroken}} {{period of}} time, but take many {{short periods of}} rest. Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.|$|E

25|$|People <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} locations. Some sleep {{directly}} on the ground; others on a skin or blanket; others sleep on platforms or beds. Some sleep with blankets, some with pillows, some with simple headrests, some with no head support.

25|$|In March 1929, Cliff White and Cyril Paris, {{two local}} extreme sports enthusiasts, created {{a plan to}} use the CPR cabin as an {{overnight}} point in their ski trek over the great divide. Unfortunately they {{could not find the}} cabin that night and were forced to <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dug-out in the snow. Upon waking in the morning they discovered that they had only just missed the CPR cabin. These two men were the first to ski what is now known as Sunshine Village.|$|E
25|$|A 16th-century {{physician}} {{wrote that}} many laborers dozed off exhausted {{at the start}} of each night; sexual intercourse with their wives typically occurring in the watching period, after a recuperative first sleep. Anthropologists find that isolated societies without electric light <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of patterns; seldom do they resemble our modern habit of sleeping in one single eight-hour bout. Much has been written about dream interpretation, from biblical times to Freud, but sleep itself was historically seen as a passive state of not-awake.|$|E
25|$|Memories of 'future relevance' {{are also}} {{consolidated}} greater during <b>sleep.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> study by Wilhelm et al., 2011, memories {{of items that}} participants knew were needed for the future (for the testing session) were remembered more after sleep. Sleep consolidated these memories of future relevance to a greater extent. Memories that are emotionally significant and relevant for the future are therefore preferentially consolidated during sleep. This can translate to mean that memories that are more meaningful or valuable to a person are consolidated more.|$|E

25|$|It {{is found}} in {{abundant}} coral areas from sub-tidal reef flats to deeper lagoons and seaward reefs and has a depth of 40 meters. Unlike other cleaner wrasses, this fish spans larger areas to clean and is cleans more during the day when it is active. It feeds on crustacean ectoparasites such as gnathiidae and fish mucus and, both individually and in groups, it will also clean sharks and rays such as grey reef shark, whitetip reef shark; Labroides bicolor will also clean other. At night, it may <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mucous cocoon.|$|E
25|$|Some {{societies}} {{display a}} fragmented sleep pattern {{in which people}} sleep at all {{times of the day}} and night for shorter periods. In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening. Plentiful artificial light has been available in the industrialized West since at least the mid-19th century, and sleep patterns have changed significantly everywhere that lighting has been introduced. In general, people <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more concentrated burst through the night, going to sleep much later, although this is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been found that there are gender {{differences}} {{between males and females}} in regards to visual memory and <b>sleep.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> study done testing sleep and memory for pictures it was found that daytime sleep contributed to retention of source memory rather than item memory in females, females did not have recollection or familiarity influenced by daytime sleep, whereas males undergoing daytime sleep had a trend towards increased familiarity. The reasons for this may be linked to different memory traces resulting from different encoding strategies, as well as with different electrophysiological changes during daytime sleep.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product of a culture with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had nocturnal habits, but was {{not confined to the}} darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in Dracula. She did, however, <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coffin. Carmilla works as a Gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.|$|E
25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E

25|$|For black-tailed prairie dogs, the {{resident}} male {{of the family}} group fathers all the offspring. Multiple paternity in litters {{seems to be more}} common in Utah and Gunnison’s prairie dogs. Mother prairie dogs do most of the care for the young. In addition to nursing the young, the mother also defends the nursery chamber and collects grass for the nest. Males play their part by defending the territories and maintaining the burrows. The young spend their first six weeks below the ground being nursed. They are then weaned and begin to surface from the burrow. By five months, they are fully grown. The subject of cooperative breeding in prairie dogs has been debated among biologists. Some argue prairie dogs will defend and feed young that are not theirs, and it seems young will <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nursery chamber with other mothers; since most nursing occurs at night, this may be a case of communal nursing. In the case of the latter, others suggest communal nursing occurs only when mothers mistake another female's young for their own.|$|E
