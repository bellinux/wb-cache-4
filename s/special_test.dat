5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing. Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led {{to the construction of}} a <b>special</b> <b>test</b> area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E

500|$|When Michael Thau and Warner Home Video {{started working}} on a film {{restoration}} in 2000, some of the extra footage was not added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt [...] "the pace of the film's storyline would be adversely affected [...] timing problems matching [...] with John Williams' [...] musical score, etc… The cut of the movie shown on KCOP was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV as the Television Station paid per minute to air the movie. The [...] "Special Edition" [...] cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making." [...] There was a <b>special</b> <b>test</b> screening of the Special Edition in 2001 in Austin, Texas, on March 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year, which did not occur. In May 2001, Warner Home Video released the special edition on DVD. Director Donner also assisted, working slightly over {{a year on the}} project.

500|$|Bungie {{used the}} beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within {{gameplay}} elements. [...] "We needed our fans to provide feedback," [...] said Lehto, adding {{that having a}} large audience to [...] "hammer" [...] on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called [...] "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" [...] from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The Reach beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; [...] "We tried {{to give people a}} little bit more of a direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," [...] said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; by the end of the beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed <b>special</b> <b>test</b> matches to eliminate lurking variables, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.|$|E

2500|$|Measuring low-value resistors, such as fractional-ohm resistors, with {{acceptable}} accuracy requires four-terminal connections. One pair of terminals applies a known, calibrated {{current to}} the resistor, {{while the other}} pair senses the voltage drop across the resistor. Some laboratory quality ohmmeters, especially milliohmmeters, {{and even some of}} the better digital multimeters sense using four input terminals for this purpose, which may be used with <b>special</b> <b>test</b> leads. Each of the two so-called Kelvin clips has a pair of jaws insulated from each other. [...] One side of each clip applies the measuring current, while the other connections are only to sense the voltage drop. The resistance is again calculated using Ohm's Law as the measured voltage divided by the applied current.|$|E

The fifth aspect is still shown in normal service and appears {{when the next}} signal is showing a green (or another flashing green) aspect and the signal section is clear, which ensures that there is sufficient braking distance to bring a train to a stand from 140mph.

2500|$|For {{identification}} of infection, the only method clinically available {{in most areas}} is the Ova and Parasite (O) exam, which identifies {{the presence of the}} organism by microscopic examination of a chemically preserved stool specimen. [...] This method is sometimes called [...] "Direct Microscopy". [...] In the United States, pathologists are required to report the presence of Blastocystis when found during an O exam, so a <b>special</b> <b>test</b> {{does not have to be}} ordered. Direct Microscopy is inexpensive, as the same test can identify a variety of gastrointestinal infections, such as Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium. [...] However one laboratory director noted that pathologists using conventional microscopes failed to identify many Blastocystis infections, and indicated the necessity for special microscopic equipment for identification. [...] The following table shows the sensitivity of Direct Microscopy in detecting Blastocystis when compared to stool culture, a more sensitive technique. [...] Stool culture was considered by some researchers to be the most reliable technique, but a recent study found stool culture only detected 83% of individuals infected when compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) <b>Special</b> <b>test</b> sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.|$|E

There {{is a great}} deal of research on <b>special</b> <b>tests</b> but much of the research is of a lower quality implying that the metrics from that research, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, is likely to vary greatly in the hands of different clinicians and in varying practice environments. A way to improve the clinical diagnostic process is to cluster OSTs and to use these clusters to either rule in or out different pathologies. The aim of the article is to review the best OST clusters, examine the methodology by which they were derived, and illustrate, with a case study, the use of these OST clusters to arrive at a pathology-based diagnosis...|$|R
