5000|$|As {{shown in}} the {{disassembly}} photo, the <b>switch</b> <b>actuator</b> pivots in two holes in {{the sides of the}} plastic switch body. An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a compression spring into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the compression spring, the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of running}} mains voltage to the switches, a low voltage—typically 24 V AC—is {{connected}} to remote momentary toggle or rocker switches. The momentary switches usually have SPDT contacts in an (ON)-OFF-(ON) configuration. Pushing the <b>switch</b> <b>actuator</b> {{in one direction}} causes the relay contacts to close; pushing it {{in the opposite direction}} causes the relay contacts to open. Any number of additional rocker switches can be wired in parallel, as needed in multiple locations. An optional master control can be added that turns all lights in the facility on or off simultaneously under the control of a timer or computer.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 1970s, mercury {{switches}} were popular. Their {{cost was}} more than that of other designs, but they were totally silent in operation. The <b>switch</b> <b>actuator</b> tipped a sealed glass vial connected via flexible leads, causing a drop of liquid metallic mercury to roll {{from one end to the}} other. When it arrived at the contact end, the drop of mercury bridged a pair of contacts to complete the circuit. Many of these switches were also equipped with a neon lamp connected across the contacts, and thus in series with the electrical load. This caused the indicator to glow faintly when the switch was off, as an aid to finding the switch in a dark room.|$|E

5000|$|The toggle {{mechanism}} provides [...] "snap-action" [...] {{through the}} use of an [...] "over-center" [...] geometry. The design was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg. The <b>switch</b> <b>actuator</b> does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of springs and levers. Turning the actuator does not initially cause any motion of the contacts, which in fact continue to be positively held open by the force of the spring. Turning the actuator gradually stretches the spring. When the mechanism passes over the center point, the spring energy is released and the spring, rather than the actuator, drives the contacts rapidly and forcibly to the closed position with an audible [...] "snapping" [...] sound. This mechanism is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud snap or click.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first light}} switch {{employing}} [...] "quick-break technology" [...] {{was invented by}} John Henry Holmes in 1884 in the Shieldfield district of Newcastle upon Tyne. The [...] "quick-break" [...] switch overcame the problem of a switch's contacts developing electric arcing whenever the circuit was opened or closed. Arcing would cause pitting on one contact and the build-up of residue on the other, and the switch's useful life would be diminished. Holmes' invention ensured that the contacts would separate or come together very quickly, however much or little pressure was exerted by the user on the <b>switch</b> <b>actuator.</b> The action of this [...] "quick break" [...] mechanism meant that there was insufficient time for an arc to form, and the switch would thus have a long working life. This [...] "quick break" [...] technology is still in use in almost every ordinary light switch in the world today, numbering in the billions, {{as well as in}} many other forms of electric switch.|$|E

40|$|Microfluidics is a quickly {{expanding}} {{field with}} numerous applications. The advent of rapid-prototyping and soft- lithography allow for easy and inexpensive fabrication of microfluidic devices. Fluid manipulation on the microscale allows for new functionalities of devices and components not {{available on the}} macroscale. Fluid flows on the microscale are laminar with chemical mixing defined strictly by diffusion allowing us to design microfluidic devices with precise control of fluid flow and chemical concentration. New microfluidic technologies can provide new functionalities for micro-total analysis systems for greater device integration and portability. To expand the utilization of microfluidics, this dissertation discusses new microfluidic techniques and devices. Chapter 2 examines microfluidics for quantitative cell biology. New techniques discussed in this dissertation allow us to use microfluidics to study cellular response on a cell-by-cell basis in stable environments.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of waveguide switches required an improved design for easy production and good RF performance. The {{goal of this}} project was to develop more fundamental and systematic design methods. Compared to the former state the gap between RF rotor and housing was increased. By the optimization of design parameters as the rotor diameter, shape of position of chokes and the width of waveguide paths the resulting impact on the RF performance was eliminated. To achieve this, a software based on orthogonal expansion and already used by BOSCH Telecom was adapted to this application and successfully used. The development of a sequential <b>switch</b> <b>actuator</b> achieved a substantial simplification of {{the production of the}} coil by changing the physical principle (reluctance instead of torquer type). The design of the magnetic circuit was in addition optimized by numerical field calculation. Numerical and test results prove, that the switch design chosen is able to fulfil mechanical and thermal requirements for space applications. The experience with the modelling of the RF behaviour {{on the one hand and}} the actuation characteristics on the other hand allows the development of several other waveguide switches. For every additional wave guide type a completely new RF model is to be developed with the same methods and tools. In contrast to this the actuators can be transferred. (orig.)

It {{is applied to}} a succession of increasingly complex single&# 8208;joint systems, starting with a linear and noncompliant system and ending with a revolute, nonlinearly tendon coupled and compliant system. The last configuration mimics the typical human joint structure, used {{as a model for}} certain joints of the anthropomimetic robot ECCEROBOT. The control strategy is based on a biologically inspired puller&# 8208; follower concept, which distinguishes the roles of the agonist and antagonist motors. One actuator, the puller, is considered as being primarily responsible for the motion, while the follower prevents its tendon from becoming slack by maintaining its tendon force at some non&# 8208;zero level. Certain movements require <b>switching</b> <b>actuator</b> roles; adaptive co&# 8208;contraction is used to prevent tendons slackening, while maintaining energetic efficiency.
