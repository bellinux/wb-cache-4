40|$|This study {{examined}} the involvement of ATPase activity in the acid tolerance response (ATR) of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 strain. In the current work, B. cereus cells were grown in anaerobic chemostat culture at external pH (pHe) 7. 0 or 5. 5 and at a growth rate of 0. 2 h - 1. Population reduction and internal pH (pHi) after <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> at pH 4. 0 was examined either with or without ATPase inhibitor N,N’-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and ionophores valinomycin and nigericin. Population reduction after <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> at pH 4. 0 was strongly limited in cells grown at pH 5. 5 (acid-adapted cells) compared with cells grown at pH 7. 0 (unadapted cells), indicating that B. cereus cells grown at low pHe were able to induce a significant ATR and Exercise-induced increase in ATPase activity. However, DCCD and ionophores had {{a negative effect on}} the ability of B. cereus cells to survive and maintain their pHi during <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> When <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> was achieved after DCCD treatment, pHi was markedly dropped in unadapted and acid-adapted cells. The ATPase activity was also significantly inhibited by DCCD and ionophores in acid-adapted cells. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that atpB (ATP beta chain) transcripts was increased in acid-adapted cells compared to unadapted cells before and after <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> Our data demonstrate that B. cereus is able to induce an ATR during growth at low pH. These adaptations depend on the ATPase activity induction and pHi homeostasis. Our data demonstrate that the ATPase enzyme can be implicated in the cytoplasmic pH regulation and in acid tolerance of B. cereus acid-adapted cells...|$|R

While little is known about how C. jejuni survives transit through the stomach, its low infectious dose suggests it is well equipped to sense and respond to <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> In this study, the transcriptional profile of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was obtained after the organism was exposed to in vitro and in vivo (piglet stomach) <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> The observed down-regulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins likely reflects the need to reshuffle energy toward the expression of components required for survival. <b>Acid</b> <b>shock</b> also caused C. jejuni to up-regulate genes involved in stress responses. These included heat shock genes as well as genes involved in the response to oxidative and nitrosative stress. A role for the chaperone clpB in acid resistance was confirmed in vitro. Some genes showed expression patterns that were markedly different in vivo and in vitro, which likely reflects the complexity of the in vivo environment. For instance, transit through the stomach was characterized by up-regulation of genes that encode products that are involved in the use of nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor and down-regulation of genes that are involved in capsular polysaccharide expression. In conclusion, this study has enabled us to understand how C. jejuni modulates gene expression in response to <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> in vitro and to correlate this with gene expression profiles of C. jejuni as it transits through the host stomach...|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} regulatory mechanisms governing synthesis of the flagellar protein subunits and their assembly into this complex organelle. The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the premier experimental model system for studying such cellular processes. When <b>acid</b> <b>shocked,</b> C. reinhardtii excises its flagella, rapidly and coordinately activates transcription of a set of flagellar genes, and ultimately regenerates a new flagellar pair. To define functionally the regulatory sequences that govern induction of the set of genes after <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> we analyzed the a 1 -tubulin gene promoter. To simplify transcriptional analysis in vivo, we inserted the selectable marker gene ARG 7 on the same plasmid with a tagged a 1 -tubulin gene and stably introduced it into C. reinhardtii cells. By deletion of various sequences, two promoter regions (2176 to 2122 and 285 to 216) were identified as important for induction of the tagged a 1 -tubulin gene. Deleting the region between 2176 and 2122 from the transcription start site resulted in an induction level which was only 45 to 70 % of that of the resident gene. Deleting the region upstream of 256 resulted in a complete loss of inducibility without affecting basal expression. The a 1 -tubulin promoter region from 285 to 216 conferred partial <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> inducibility to an arylsulfatase (ARS) reporter gene.

40|$|The {{response}} of Salmonella typhimurium to low pH includes a low-pH protection system called the acid tolerance response (ATR). The iron-regulatory protein Fur has {{been implicated in}} the ATR since fur mutants are acid sensitive and cause altered expression of several <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (J. W. Foster, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 6896 - 6902, 1991). We have determined that the acid-sensitive phenotype of fur mutations is indeed due to a defect in Fur that can be complemented by a fur(+) -containing plasmid. However, changes in cellular iron status alone did not trigger the ATR. Cells clearly required exposure to low pH in order to induce acid tolerance. The role of Fur in acid tolerance was found to extend beyond regulating iron acquisition. A mutation in fur converting histidine 90 to an arginine (H 90 R) eliminated Fur-mediated iron regulation of enterochelin production and deregulated an iroA-lacZ fusion but {{had no effect on}} acid tolerance. The H 90 R iron-blind Fur protein also mediated <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> induction of several Fur-dependent <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins and <b>acid</b> control of the hyd locus. In addition, a Fur superrepressor that constitutively repressed iron-regulated genes mediated normal Fur-dependent acid tolerance and pH-controlled gene expression.

For exponential phase cells, thermotolerance was enhanced by submitting the cells to prior heat or <b>acid</b> <b>shocks</b> {{independently of the}} pH of growth conditions. Stationary phase cells were significantly more resistant to heating than cells in the exponential phase but only when growth occurred under non-controlled pH.

Except for cells in the stationary growth phase grown under non-controlled pH, the heat or <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> treatments resulted in an intracellular increase in the well - known heat shock proteins, GroES and GroEL. The presence of chloramphenicol negated the heat shock response and production of GroES and GroEL, confirming that de novo protein synthesis was involved in cell protection.

Very few studies have investigated the response of stationary phase cells.

40|$|Enterobacteria have {{developed}} numerous {{constitutive and inducible}} strategies to sense and adapt to an external acidity. These molecular responses require dozens of specific <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (ASPs), as shown by genomic and proteomic analysis. Most of the ASPs remain poorly characterized, and {{their role in the}} acid response and survival is unknown. We recently identified an Escherichia coli gene, asr (<b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> RNA), encoding a protein of unknown function, which is strongly induced by high environmental acidity (pH < 5. 0). We show here that Asr is required for growth at moderate acidity (pH 4. 5) {{as well as for the}} induction of acid tolerance at moderate acidity, as shown by its ability to survive subsequent transfer to extreme acidity (pH 2. 0). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis of acid-shocked E. coli cells harboring a plasmid-borne asr gene demonstrated that the Asr protein is synthesized as a precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. Mutational studies of the asr gene also demonstrated the Asr preprotein contains 102 amino acids. This protein is subjected to an N-terminal cleavage of the signal peptide and a second processing event, yielding 15 - and 8 -kDa products, respectively. Only the 8 -kDa polypeptide was detected in acid-shocked cells containing only the chromosomal copy of the asr gene. N-terminal sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the two processing sites in the Asr protein precursor. Deletion of amino acids encompassing the processing site required for release of the 8 -kDa protein resulted in an acid-sensitive phenotype similar to that observed for the asr null mutant, suggesting that the 8 -kDa product plays an important role in the adaptation to <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> Analysis of Asr:PhoA fusions demonstrated a periplasmic location for the Asr protein after removal of the signal peptide.

40|$|Although Salmonella typhimurium prefers neutral-pH environments, it {{can adapt}} to survive {{conditions}} of severe low-pH stress (pH 3. 3). The process, termed the acid tolerance response (ATR), includes two distinct stages. The first stage, called pre-acid shock, is induced at pH 5. 8 and involves {{the production of}} an inducible pH homeostasis system functional at external pH values below 4. 0. The second stage occurs following an <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> shift to pH 4. 5 or below and is called the post-acid shock stage. During {{this stage of the}} ATR, 43 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (ASPs) are synthesized. The present data reveal that several ASPs important for pH 3. 3 acid tolerance are only transiently produced. Their disappearance after 30 to 40 min of pH 4. 4 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> coincides with an inability to survive subsequent pH 3. 3 acid challenge. Clearly, an essential feature of inducible acid tolerance is an ability to synthesize these key ASPs. The pre-acid shock stage, with its inducible pH homeostasis system, offers the cell an enhanced ability to synthesize ASPs following rapid shifts to conditions below pH 4. 0, an external pH that normally prevents ASP synthesis. The data also address possible signals for ASP synthesis. The inducing signal for 22 ASPs appears to be internal acidification, while external pH serves to induce 13 others. Of the 14 transient ASPs, 10 are induced in response to changes in internal pH. Mutations in the fur (ferric uptake regulator) locus that produce an Atr- acid-sensitive phenotype also eliminate induction of six transiently induced ASPs...|$|R

40|$|Tolerance to acidic environments is an {{important}} property of free-living and pathogenic enteric bacteria. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses two general forms of inducible acid tolerance. One is evident in exponentially growing cells exposed to a sudden <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> The other is induced when stationary-phase cells are subjected to a similar shock. These log-phase and stationary-phase acid tolerance responses (ATRs) are distinct in that genes identified as participating in log-phase ATR have little to {{no effect on the}} stationary-phase ATR (I. S. Lee, J. L. Slouczewski, and J. W. Foster, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 1422 – 1426, 1994). An insertion mutagenesis strategy designed to reveal genes associated with acid-inducible stationary-phase acid tolerance (stationary-phase ATR) yielded two insertions in the response regulator gene ompR. The ompR mutants were defective in stationary-phase ATR but not log-phase ATR. EnvZ, the known cognate sensor kinase, and the porin genes known to be controlled by OmpR, ompC and ompF, were not required for stationary-phase ATR. However, the alternate phosphodonor acetyl phosphate appears to {{play a crucial role in}} OmpR-mediated stationary-phase ATR and in the OmpR-dependent acid induction of ompC. This conclusion was based on finding that a mutant form of OmpR, which is active even though it cannot be phosphorylated, was able to suppress the acid-sensitive phenotype of an ack pta mutant lacking acetyl phosphate. The data also revealed that <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> increases the level of ompR message and protein in stationary-phase cells. Thus, it appears that <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> induces the production of OmpR, which in its phosphorylated state can trigger expression of genes needed for acid-induced stationary-phase acid tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium {{encounters}} {{a variety of}} acid stress situations during growth in host and nonhost environments. The organism can survive potentially lethal acid conditions (pH < 4) if it is first able to adapt to mild or more moderate acid levels. The molecular events that occur during this adaptive process are collectively {{referred to as the}} acid tolerance response and vary depending on whether the cells are in log- or stationary-phase growth. The acid tolerance response of logarithmically growing cells includes the participation of an alternate sigma factor, sigmaS (RpoS), commonly associated with stationary-phase physiology. Of 51 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (ASPs) induced during shifts to pH 4. 4, 8 are clearly dependent on sigmaS for production (I. S. Lee, J. Lin, H. K. Hall, B. Bearson, and J. W. Foster, Mol. Microbiol. 17 : 155 - 167, 1995). The <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> induction of these proteins appears {{to be the result of}} an acid shock-induced increase in the level of sigmaS itself. We have discovered that one component of a potential signal transduction system responsible for inducing rpoS expression is the product of the mouse virulence gene mviA+. MviA exhibits extensive homology to the regulatory components of certain two-component signal transduction systems (W. H. Benjamin, Jr., and P. D. Hall, abstr. B- 67, p. 38, in Abstracts of the 93 rd General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology 1993, 1993). Mutations in mviA (mviA::Km) caused the overproduction of sigmaS and sigmaS-dependent ASPs in logarithmically growing cells, as well as increases in tolerances to acid, heat, osmolarity and oxidative stresses and significant decreases in growth rate and colony size. Mutations in rpoS suppressed the mviA::Km-associated defects in growth rate, colony size, ASP production, and stress tolerance, suggesting that the effects of MviA on cell physiology occur via its control of sigmaS levels. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses of sigmaS produced from natural or arabinose-regulated promoters revealed that <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> and MviA posttranscriptionally regulate sigmaS levels. Turnover experiments suggest that MviA regulates the stability of sigmaS protein rather than the translation of rpoS message. We propose a model in which MviA or its unknown signal transduction partner senses some consequence of <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> and probably other stresses, and signals the release of sigmaS from proteolysis. The increased concentration of sigmaS drives the elevated expression of the sigmaS-dependent ASPs, resulting in an increase in stress tolerance. The avirulent nature of mviA insertion mutants, therefore, appears to result from inappropriate sigmaS-dependent gene expression during pathogenesis...|$|R

L. monocytogenes has the ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures and is therefore a danger to makers and consumers of ready-to-eat (RTE) food products, as these foods are not subjected to a heating step prior to consumption. During transmission from the environment through foods to humans, L. monocytogenes must adapt to a range of environmental conditions including varying temperature, preservative stress, gastric stress, and host immunological defenses. Mechanisms of environmental adaptation in L. monocytogenes include two-component response regulators (RRs), alternative sigma factors, and other positive (e. g., PrfA) and negative (e. g., CtsR) transcriptional regulators. We characterized the effects of L. monocytogenes growth temperature on (i) the contributions to in vitro host cell invasion of 14 RRs, alternative sigma factor [sigma][EXP]B, virulence regulator PrfA and surface associated proteins InlA and FlaA and (ii) the response to sudden <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> Overall, invasion was higher for L. monocytogenes grown at 30 [DEGREE]C compared to 37 [DEGREE]C. RR mutants "cheY and "degU were invasiondeficient when grown at 30 [DEGREE]C, but not 37 [DEGREE]C. We observed 37 [DEGREE]C-growth-dependent functional synergisms between !B and PrfA in contributing to host cell invasion and contributory synergisms between FlaA and InlA at both temperatures.

GroEL protein and mRNA levels were elevated in cells exposed to a variety of stresses, including <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> A nonpolar insertion into hrcA was created and used to demonstrate that HrcA negatively regulates the expression of the groEL and dnaK operons. The SM 11 mutant, which had constitutively high levels of GroESL and roughly 50 % of the DnaK protein found in the wild-type strain, was more sensitive to acid killing and could not lower the pH as effectively as the parent. The acid-sensitive phenotype of SM 11 was, at least in part, attributable to lower F 1 F 0 -ATPase activity. A minimum of 10 proteins, in addition to GroES-EL, were found to be up-regulated in SM 11.

The ∆pH across the cytoplasmic membrane is linked to cellular bioenergetics and metabolism of the body which is the major supplier of the proton motive force, so homeostasis of cellular pH is essential.

Moreover, resistance to the bactericidal effects of rabbit serum and <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> was impaired in the pst mutant, in contrast to the wild-type strain. In addition, the MIC of polymyxin was twofold lower for the mutant than for the wild-type strain. Although the pst mutant demonstrated an increased susceptibility to rabbit serum, this strain was not killed by chicken serum, suggesting the presence of differences in host innate immune defenses and complement-mediated killing. In APEC O 78 strain χ 7122, a functional Pst system is required for full virulence and resistance to <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> and polymyxin. Our results suggest that the mutation of pst genes induces a deregulation of phosphate sensing and changes in the cell surface composition that lead to decreased virulence, indicating the importance of the Pst system for the virulence of pathogenic E. coli strains from different hosts...|$|R
40|$|The acid {{tolerance}} response enables Salmonella typhimurium to survive exposures to potentially lethal acidic environments. The acid stress imposed {{in a typical}} assay for {{acid tolerance}} (log-phase cells in minimal glucose medium) was shown to comprise both inorganic (i. e., low pH) and organic acid components. A gene previously determined to affect acid tolerance, atbR, was identified as pgi, the gene encoding phosphoglucoisomerase. Mutations in pgi were shown to increase acid tolerance by preventing the synthesis of organic acids. Protocols designed to separate the stresses of inorganic from organic acids revealed that the regulators ς 38 (RpoS), Fur, and Ada have major effects on tolerance to organic acid stress but only minor effects on inorganic acid stress. In contrast, the two-component regulatory system PhoP (identified as <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> protein ASP 29) and PhoQ proved to be important for tolerance to organic acid stress but had little effect against organic acid stress. PhoP mutants also failed to induce four ASPs, confirming a role for this regulator in <b>acid</b> tolerance. <b>Acid</b> <b>shock</b> induction of PhoP appears to occur {{at the transcriptional level}} and requires the PhoPQ system. Furthermore, induction by acid occurs even in the presence of high concentrations of magnesium, the ion known to be sensed by PhoQ. These results suggest that PhoQ can sense both Mg 2 + and pH. Since phoP mutants are avirulent, the low pH activation of this system has important implications concerning the pathogenesis of S. typhimurium. The involvement of four regulators, two of which are implicated in virulence, underscores the complexity of the acid tolerance stress response and further suggests that features of acid tolerance and virulence are interwoven...|$|R

Membrane fluidity was monitored on intact whole O. oeni cells subjected to single and combined cold, <b>acid</b> and ethanol <b>shocks</b> by using fluorescence anisotropy with 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH) as a probe. Results showed that cold shocks (14 and 8 degrees C) strongly rigidified plasma membrane but did not affect cell survival. In contrast, ethanol shocks (10 - 14 % v/v) induced instantaneous membrane fluidisation followed by rigidification and resulted in low viability. <b>Acid</b> <b>shocks</b> (pH 4. 0 and pH 3. 0) exerted a rigidifying effect on membrane without affecting cell viability. Whatever the shock orders, combined cold (14 degrees C) and ethanol (14 % v/v) shocks resulted in strong membrane rigidification. Interestingly, O. oeni survived combined cold and ethanol shocks more efficiently than single ethanol shock. Membrane rigidification was induced by ethanol-and-acid (10 % v/v - pH 3. 5) shock and correlated with total cell death. In contrast, O. oeni recovered its viability when subjected to cold (8 degrees C) -then-ethanol-and-acid shock which strongly rigidified the membrane. Our results suggested a positive short-term effect of combined cold, <b>acid</b> and ethanol <b>shocks</b> on membrane fluidity and viability of O. oeni...|$|R

It has been shown that DnaK mRNA and DnaK protein of Streptococcus mutants were increased in response to <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> (Jayaraman et al. 1997), and the strain’s capacity for growth in low-pH media becomes impaired, when DnaK levels of S. mutans are lowered via knockdown, strongly indicating the involvement of DnaK in acid tolerance (Lemos et al. 2007). Tomoyasu et al. (2012) found that DnaK knockout mutants of Streptococcus intermedius exhibited slow growth, thermosensitivity and accumulation of GroEL in the cell.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} hurdles foodbome pathogens encounter is the acid barrier of the stomach. Salmonella, unlike other pathogens like E. coli 0157 :H 7 has a high infectious dose and is sensitive to low pH (pH 2). I hypothesized that Salmonella survives passage through the acid barrier of the human stomach (pH 1. 5 - 3. 5) because of the protective effects of food (i. e. fats). To test this hypothesis an in vitro transmission model (IVTM) was developed. The IVTM was a weeklong passage that was used to evaluate the impact of anaerobic growth, storage temperatures, <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> and the intrinsic parameters of food (i. e. fat content and pH) on Salmonella persistence. Transmission of Salmonella incubated in whole milk (49 %) and skim milk (47 %) were statistically different than the control (water) (3 %) at 4 �C. The results indicate that the presence of Salmonella in milk provides protection and promotes transmission through the IVTM...|$|R

40|$|Transcriptome {{analyses}} of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium revealed that 15 genes were significantly up-regulated after 2 h of adaptation with lactic acid. cadB {{was the most}} highly up-regulated gene and was shown to be an essential component. Lactic acid-adapted cells exhibited sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, likely due to down-regulation of the OxyR regulon. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium employs both a logarithmic-phase acid tolerance response (ATR) and a sta-tionary-phase ATR to cope with acid stress (23). The logarith-mic-phase HCl-induced ATR requires both pre- and post-acid-shock adaptation phases to be fully tolerant to a pHo of 3. 0 at 37 °C (13). The pre-acid-shock adaptation phase occurs after exposure to pH 5. 8 and involves the production of at least 12 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (5).

The recombinant protyrosinases expressed in S. cerevisiae were assayed for catalytic activities of mono-oxygenase and L-dopa oxidase at pH 5. 5 after <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> at pH 3. 0. Replacements of His- 63, His- 84, His- 93, His- 290, His- 294, His- 332 or His- 333 with asparagine resulted in mutant enzymes exhibiting no activities. The site-directed mutant Cys 82 Ala showed that Cys- 82 was also an essential residue for the activity. We obtained homogeneous preparations of activated tyrosinases from mutated thioredoxin fusion gene products expressed in E. coli by <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> The copper contents of engineered mutants and wild-type enzyme expressed in E. coli were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The wild-type enzyme contained 2 g-atoms of copper/mol of the subunit. The His 63 Asn, His 84 Asn, His 93 Asn, His 290 Asn, His 294 Asn, His 332 Asn, His 333 Asn or Cys 82 Ala substitution decreased copper binding by approx. 50 %, indicating that the mutants contain only approx. 1 g-atom of copper/mol of the subunit. The five mutants His 63 Asn, His 93 Asn, His 290 Asn, His 294 Asn and Cys 82 Ala contain only one copper ion, which is fully detectable by EPR. From the correlation of g(parallel) and (Cu) A(parallel), we deduced that the nitrogen or sulphur donors in the copper ligands {{should be in a}} square or a distorted tetrahedral geometric environment. In further atomic absorption spectrophotometry experiments, no copper atom was observed in the seven double mutants His 63 Asn/His 290 Asn, His 63 Asn/His 294 Asn, His 63 Asn/His 332 Asn, His 63 Asn/His 333 Asn, Cys 82 Ala/His 290 Asn, His 84 Asn/His 333 Asn and His 93 Asn/His 290 Asn. We propose a new structure of active sites of tyrosinase from A. oryzae: the most likely binding sites of tyrosinase for Cu(A) are His- 63, His- 84 and His- 93, with the remaining conserved Cys- 82 providing the fourth ligand.

The biology of cellular responses to stress has been a subject of vigorous investigations. Although much has been learned, details {{of some of these}} responses remain poorly understood. Members of heat shock chaperone HSP proteins have been linked to acetic <b>acid</b> and heat <b>shock</b> stress responses in yeast. Both acetic <b>acid</b> and heat <b>shock</b> have been identified to trigger different cellular responses including reduction of global protein synthesis and induction of programmed cell death. Yeast HSC 82 and HSP 82 code for two important heat shock proteins that together account for 1 - 2 % of total cellular proteins. Both proteins have been linked to responses to acetic <b>acid</b> and heat <b>shock.</b> In contrast to the overall rate of protein synthesis which is reduced, the expression of HSC 82 and HSP 82 is induced in response to acetic acid stress. In the current study we identified two yeast genes DOM 34 and RPL 36 A that are linked to acetic <b>acid</b> and heat <b>shock</b> sensitivity. We investigated the influence of these genes on the expression of HSP proteins. Our observations suggest that Dom 34 and RPL 36 A influence translation in a CAP-independent manner.
