5|$|One point {{still at}} issue is the {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below).

An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as <b>springing</b> from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch <b>springing</b> directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E

The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites <b>springing</b> up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main Ice and Fire fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M.

Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the <b>springing</b> of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E
5|$|Integrating elves into Christian {{cosmology}} without identifying them as demons. The {{most striking}} examples are serious theological treatises: the Icelandic Tíðfordrif (1644) by Jón Guðmundsson lærði or, in Scotland, Robert Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies (1691). This approach also {{appears in the}} Old English poem Beowulf, which lists elves among the races <b>springing</b> from Cain's murder of Abel. The late thirteenth-century South English Legendary and some Icelandic folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with Lucifer nor with God, and were banished by God to earth rather than hell.

5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines <b>springing</b> from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region.

Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began <b>springing</b> up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
