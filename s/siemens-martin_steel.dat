2500|$|The hull of Sampo {{was built}} of <b>Siemens-Martin</b> <b>steel</b> and divided into {{watertight}} compartments by eight transverse bulkheads. The bow was reinforced {{with a wide}} ice belt up to one inch (...) thick and all steel structures were dimensioned beyond Lloyd's Register requirements. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 24 degrees. Other innovative features included propeller blades that could be replaced underwater by the icebreaker's divers.|$|E

5000|$|HMS Seahorse was {{designed}} and built by Laird Brothers at Birkenhead for the Royal Navy as a fast deep-sea tug, suitable for handling their new classes of ironclad warship. In addition she was equipped for deployment as a fleet tender and despatch vessel. Steel was used in both the engines and shafts and, {{in the form of}} <b>Siemens-Martin</b> <b>steel</b> from the Landore Steel Company, for the hull and upperworks. Seahorses displacement was 670 tons, and dimensions 160 ft length between perpendiculars, 168 ft length overall, 26 ft beam and with 10 ft draught. She was powered by a pair of compound steam engines totalling 1100 ihp driving twin screws.|$|E
50|$|Hunedoara was {{the leading}} Romanian {{producer}} of long steel profiles, made in two electric arc furnaces. The first, with a capacity of 150,000 tons per year, two 50-ton furnaces and two 20-ton ones for alloyed steels shaped into ingots, featured vacuum degasification and electro-slag remelting. The second, turning out up to 400,000 tons a year, had two 100-ton secondary treatment furnaces with a continuous turning mechanism and eccentric bottom tap-holes. There were also two open hearth furnace steel mills. The first had five 100-ton ovens with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons a year, and a rolling mill for up to 450,000 tons of light profiles a year, used for making special products. The second <b>Siemens-Martin</b> <b>steel</b> mill had a production capacity of some 3.2 million tons per year and a rolling plant for light profiles (440,000 tons a year), heavy profiles (1,130,000 tons a year) and wire (280,000 tons a year). Stainless steel for bearings was also produced.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, New Zealand Railways awarded 20,850 pounds to John McGregor and Co shipbuilders of Dunedin to build a steamship for Lake Wakatipu at their Otago Foundry and Engineering Works. [...] The Earnslaw was designed by naval architect Hugh McRae and was based on a <b>Siemens-Martin</b> <b>steel</b> hull design and using Kauri for the decking. Propulsion was provided by twin coal-fired triple-expansion, jet-condensing, vertically inclined engines. The keel was laid on 4 July 1911. The ship was named after Mount Earnslaw, a 2889-metre peak at the head of Lake Wakatipu. She was to be 51.2 metres long, the biggest boat on the lake, and the largest steamship built in New Zealand. Transporting the Earnslaw [...] was no easy task. When construction was finally completed, she was dismantled. All the quarter-inch steel hull plates were numbered for reconstruction much like a jig-saw puzzle. Then the parts were loaded on to a goods train and transported across the South Island from Dunedin to Kingston at the southern end of Lake Wakatipu.|$|E
