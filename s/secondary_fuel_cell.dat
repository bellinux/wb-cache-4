40|$|The {{optimized}} conceptual {{engineering design}} of a space station tethered elevator is presented. The elevator is an unmanned mobile structure which operates on a ten kilometer tether spanning {{the distance between the}} Space Station and a tethered platform. Elevator capabilities include providing access to residual gravity levels, remote servicing, and transportation to any point along a tether. The potential uses, parameters, and evolution of the spacecraft design are discussed. Engineering development of the tethered elevator is the result of work conducted in the following areas: structural configurations; robotics, drive mechanisms; and power generation and transmission systems. The structural configuration of the elevator is presented. The structure supports, houses, and protects all systems on board the elevator. The implementation of robotics on board the elevator is discussed. Elevator robotics allow for the deployment, retrieval, and manipulation of tethered objects. Robotic manipulators also aid in hooking the elevator on a tether. Critical to the operation of the tethered elevator is the design of its drive mechanisms, which are discussed. Two drivers, located internal to the elevator, propel the vehicle along a tether. These modular components consist of endless toothed belts, shunt-wound motors, regenerative power braking, and computer controlled linear actuators. The designs of self-sufficient power generation and transmission systems are reviewed. Thorough research indicates all components of the elevator will operate under power provided by <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems will power the vehicle at seven kilowatts continuously and twelve kilowatts maximally.

Among metal–air batteries, the zinc–air option represents a safe, environmentally friendly and potentially cheap and simple way to store and deliver electrical energy for both portable and stationary devices {{as well as for}} electric vehicles.

30|$|Supercapacitors are a fast-developing {{technology}} in electric energy storage including lithium-ion <b>secondary</b> batteries, <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> and electrical double-layer capacitors [1, 2]. They are electrochemical storage devices {{able to fill}} the gap that exists between batteries and dielectric capacitors from the energy and power density point of view [3]. In recent years electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) have evoked wide interest, because of their capability to supply high power in short-term pulse, which makes them very good energy storage devices for applications such as hybrid power sources for electrical vehicles, portable electronic devices, and pulse laser techniques [4]. Materials for EDLCs should have a huge surface area to accumulate large amount of charges and size-controllable porous channel system for the easy access to the electrolyte [5]. The most promising materials are carbon spheres because of their commercial availability, price, and abundance [6]. Mesoporous carbon has got remarkable properties such as high specific surface area, large pore volume, low density, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, good chemical and mechanical stability, and great application potential to catalysts, electrodes, batteries, sensors, adsorbents in separation processes, gas storage materials, and templates for fabricating nanostructures [7 – 10]. Mesoporous carbon spheres can be fabricated with the mesoporous silica spheres as the templates [11]. Production of mesoporous carbon spheres, which is an inverse replica templated from mesoporous silica, attracted increasing attention [12].|$|R

For example, <b>secondary</b> batteries, <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> and etc., utilize ion {{conduction}} in solids effectively to convert chemical energy to electrical one. Gas sensing is of another importance for controlling energy devices and ensuring safe operation. We should {{pay attention to the}} fact that these materials need electrochemistry to work, i. e., electrochemical cells are the essential mechanism. For example, water electrolysis is an electrochemical process many people are familiar with, but we should notice that it can proceed only in electrochemical manner; in the other cases, the water splitting is not a spontaneous reaction and will never proceed under ordinary conditions. On the other hand, increasing emission of carbon dioxide, a major green-house-effect gas other than water vapour in the air, is a serious problem for the sustainability of human beings. We should change the primary energy source from fossil fuel to the so-called renewable energies, such as solar energy and wind energy. In addition, the reducing reliability and controversy of nuclear power these days give more reason for the introduction of these renewable energies. The use of these energies, however, needs efficient methods of energy storing and restoring, since the sun is not always shining and winds change every moment. “Hydrogen energy system ” (Fig. 1...|$|R

A wide variety of ICMs has been proposed, based on: (a) different families of polymer electrolytes; (b) ionic liquids (ILs); and (c) classical ion-conducting ceramics. In these materials, the long-range charge transfer events take place owing to complex processes, which involve several possible relaxation phenomena, such as: (a) ion hopping events between ion coordination sites; (b) relaxation modes of the host matrix; and (c) polarization effects occurring at the interfaces between the different domains characterizing the materials. Broadband electrical spectroscopy (BES) is a powerful tool for the accurate investigation of the roles played by electrical relaxation events in the charge transfer processes. Indeed, BES allows to carefully detect the fundamental relaxations governing the long-range charge transfer mechanisms and to correlate them to the morphology of ion-conducting materials.

30|$|Biomass {{is one of}} the {{renewable}} {{and potentially}} sustainable energy sources and has many possible applications varying from heat generation to the production of advanced secondary energy carriers. It has almost zero or very low net CO 2 emission since carbon and energy are fixed during the biomass growth [1]. There are different types of technologies for converting biomass to electricity or to a <b>secondary</b> <b>fuel</b> such as thermal conversion, chemical conversion and bio-chemical conversion [2]. However, thermo-chemical methods such as gasification have a great potential in producing a syngas mainly composed of H 2 and CO with traces of different gases such as CH 4 in different proportions [3]. The produced fuel gas can be flexibly utilized in boilers, engines, gas turbines or <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> [4]. Smaller scale gasification systems with internal combustion engines can now be used for thousands of hours to give reasonably high electrical efficiencies and limited emissions [5]. However, <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have the potential to operate at higher electrical efficiency and with lower emissions compared with traditional power generation techniques. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cells</b> are emerging as a leading alternative technology to the more polluting internal combustion engines in vehicle and stationary distributed energy applications. In addition, the future demand for portable electric power supplies is likely to exceed the capability of current battery technology. Hydrogen-powered <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> emit only water and have virtually no pollutant emissions, even nitrogen oxides, because they operate at temperatures that are much lower than internal combustion engines [6]. However, even <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> fuelled by hydro- carbon fuels have the potential to provide efficient, clean and quiet energy conversion, which can contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gases and local pollution. When heat generated in <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> is also utilized in combined heat and power (CHP) systems, an overall efficiency of 85  % in excess can be achieved [7]. Different types of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> suitable for several energy applications at varying scales have been developed, but all share the basic design of two electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by a solid or liquid electrolyte or a membrane. Hydrogen (or a hydrogen-containing fuel) and air are fed into the anode and cathode of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> and the electrochemical reactions assisted by catalysts take place at the electrodes [8]. The electrolyte enables transport of ions between the electrodes while the excess electrons flow through an external circuit to provide electrical power. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cells</b> are classified according to the nature of their electrolyte, which also determines their operating temperature, the type of fuel and a range of applications [9].

Sales of stationary <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have grown steadily over the past 2 years. Phosphoric acid <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> buses have been demonstrated in urban areas. Proton-exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> {{are on the verge}} of revolutionizing the transportation industry. These activities and many more are discussed during this seminar, which provides a forum for people from the international <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> community engaged in a wide spectrum of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> activities. Discussions addressing R&D of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technologies, manufacturing and marketing of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> and experiences of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> users took place through oral and poster presentations. For the first time, the seminar included commercial exhibits, further evidence that commercial <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology has arrived. A total of 205 papers is included in this volume...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{operating}} temperatures, PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> may {{be divided}} into two categories: low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have a low operating temperature below 100  °C, whereas high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> work at temperatures above 100  °C, typically in the range from 120 to 180  °C [2]. The heat and mass transport phenomena and material properties of low-temperature and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have some significant differences. A low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> typically needs and produces liquid water to keep the membrane hydrated, which incurs complicated heat and mass transport processes [3]. A high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> does not have liquid water in operation, which thus has different water transport mechanism compared to low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
