40|$|Data {{on field}} biomass {{measurements}} in temperate grasslands of northern China (141 samples from 74 sites) {{were obtained from}} 23 Chinese journals, reports and books. Net primary productivity (NPP) of grasslands was estimated using three algorithms (peak live biomass, peak standing crop and maximum minus minimum live biomass), respectively, based on availability of biomass data in sites. 135 samples which have aboveground biomass (AGB) measurements, have peak AGB ranges from 20 to 2021 g m(- 2) (mean = 325. 3) and the aboveground NPP (ANPP) ranges from 15 to 1647. 1 g m(- 2) per year (mean = 295. 7). 72 samples which have belowground biomass (BGB) measurements, have peak BGB ranges from 226. 5 to 12827. 5 g m(- 2) (mean = 3116) and the belowground NPP (BNPP) ranges from 15. 8 to 12827. 5 g m(- 2) per year (mean = 2425. 6). In total 66 samples have the total NPP (TNPP), ranging from 55. 3 to 13347. 8 g m(- 2) per year (mean = 2980. 3). Mean peak biomass and NPP varied from different geographical sampling locations, {{but they had a}} general rough regularity in ten grasslands. Meadow, mountain and alpine grasslands had high biomass and NPP (sometimes including <b>saline</b> <b>grassland).</b> Forested steppe, <b>saline</b> <b>grassland</b> and desert had median values. Meadowed and typical steppes had low biomass and NPP (sometimes including desert). The lowest biomass and NPP occurred in deserted steppe and stepped desert. Grassland ANPP has significant positive relationships with annual and summer precipitation as well as summer temperature (all p < 0. 01). However, grassland BNPP and TNPP have more significant negative relationships with summer temperature (p < 0. 01) than with annual temperature (p < 0. 05). The analysis of climate - productivity correlations implied that aboveground productivity is more controlled by rainfall, whereas belowground and total productivity is more influenced by temperature in the temperate grasslands of northern China. The present study might underestimate grassland NPP in northern China due to limitation of biomass measurements. Data on relative long-term aboveground and belowground biomass dynamics, as well as data of standing dead matter, litterfall, decomposition and turnover, are required if grassland NPP is to be more accurately estimated and the role of temperate grasslands in the regional to global carbon cycles is to be fully appreciated.

In data analysis there were used: classification method - hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis and as well as two ordination techniques: Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). As a result of the classification analysis five vegetation zones were distinguished, related to the following communities: community with Festuca rubra, Potentillo Festucetum arundinaceae, community with Euphorbia lucida and Phragmites australis, Triglochino-Glaucetum maritimae and Puccinellio distantis-Salicornietum brachystachyae. The ordination techniques used in the analysis have demonstrated that out of the measured soil properties the most essential part, {{in the formation of the}} grassland vegetation zonation, played the content of chloride ions (which was used here as the main salinity measure), while moisture and pH were of minor importance. All the measured environmental factors accounted for only a low percentage (26. 5 % in 1992 and 17. 2 % in 1993) of the total vegetation variation, what might suggest that besides chloride ions another factor might have affected the development of zonation...|$|E
40|$|For {{economic}} reasons, the Flemish {{government and}} the Antwerp port authorities are enlarging the Harbour of Antwerp. Therefore, they create new docks and industrial sites in the polders of “Het Waasland”, situated on the left bank of the Schelde - in front of Antwerp. Two decades earlier however, the Flemish government protected important parts of these polders by assigning them the status of Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EU Bird directive. In such cases, the Bird directive demands compensation measures {{for the loss of}} protected bird habitats. Among these protected habitats are the very rare <b>saline</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Because these grasslands need very specific hydrological and ecological conditions to develop, it isn’t possible to create them wherever we want to do. To find possible sites for the re-creation of these <b>saline</b> <b>grasslands,</b> we carried out a detailed study of the hydrology, geomorphology and ecology of the “Waaslandpolders”. The results indicate that the saline conditions originate from discharging groundwater passing through a saline peat layer. These conditions are related to the deposits of coarse grain soils, situated at the landside of dikes near former creeks. In the polders of “Het Waasland”, three other parts have the same origin and lie outside the future extents of the harbour. Only in one of them, we found the same special hydrological conditions present in the existing grasslands. The presence of these conditions says nothing about the occurrence of saline vegetation in the future. Therefore, we now study the development of <b>saline</b> <b>grasslands...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pressure-volume (p-V) analysis, {{instantaneous}} transpiration {{rate and}} relevant leaf structural information {{were used to}} compare leaf water relations for 23 angiosperm species from semiarid temperate loess-, sand- and saline steppe grasslands and several associated habitats representing a water availability gradient. For the species studied, the most marked differences occurred between grasses and dicots. Grasses in our survey possessed low (highly negative) osmotic potential both at water saturation and at turgor loss, moderate transpiration rate, relatively high leaf dry matter proportion (DMP) and - except for the sclerophyllous Festuca species - high specific leaf area (SLA, area per unit dry mass). In contrast, dicots had lower bulk tissue elasticity, higher (less negative) osmotic potentials, intense transpiration, and lower SLA andDMP than grasses. Therefore, grasses mainly invest in osmotic potential to extract water from drying soil, while dicots rely on relatively inelastic tissue that decreases water potential by a rapid drop of turgor with turgor loss occurring at relatively high water content. Habitat effects were significant for osmotic parameters only. Osmotic potential at full turgor and at turgor loss decreased in the following order: loess grassland ? sand grassland ??<b>saline</b> <b>grassland</b> ? loess wall. Life form influenced leaf structure only, since annuals possessed markedly higher SLA and lower DMP than perennials. Comparison of habitat specialist species within the same genus revealed that certain congeners (Achillea and Aster spp.) do not differ significantly in leaf water relations, thus they might rely on similar water supply in the three steppes. Other congeners (Festuca, Kochia and Plantago spp.) differed considerably, thus for these plants leaf function and structure must be different to ensure survival under the contrasting water regime. For the two generalist grasses (Cynodon dactylon and Dactylis glomerata) habitat-specific populations showed a tendency of increasing capacity for water extraction from soil (more negative water potential) with increasing habitat dryness, although differences were significant only between the extremes of the water availability gradient...|$|E
40|$|The saline {{area of the}} Kiskunság {{region of}} Hungary has varied micro-topographic {{conditions}} with different plant communities. This study was performed in a dry sandy grassland community (Potentillo arenariae-Festucetum pseudovinae Soó (1938) 1940) and a neighbouring saline sandy grassland community (Lepidio crassifolii-Puccinellietum limosae Soó (1947) 1957). These are located at different elevations and have completely different floristic composition and physiognomy due to the soil characteristics and water availability. We assessed how the different environmental conditions during summer period might alter some physiological traits of two dominant xerophytes of sandy grassland (Achillea collina L., Festuca pseudovina Hack. ex Wiesb.) and two halophytes of <b>saline</b> <b>grassland</b> (Lepidium crassifolium (W. et K.), Puccinellia limosa (Schur) Holmbg.). The relationship between soil water potential and water content showed lower water availability for plants in the saline habitat as the high water soluble sodium content (900 – 2000 ppm) of this soil type limits water absorption. Both halophyte species in this study exhibited lower K/Na ratio than xerophyte species. Between the two halophytes L. crassifolium {{can be described as}} a “leaf/shoot sodium accumulator” species while P. limosa as a “leaf sodium avoider” species. The four species differed in proline accumulation. The salt adapted species had multifold accumulation of proline as compared to species of dry sandy grassland. The three microhabitats differing in total plant cover offered different microenvironmental conditions for L. crassifolium. Proline content was twice higher in leaves of this species in the microhabitats with high soil Na+ content than in the closed microhabitat. Every species showed a transient reversible decrease of potential photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) at midday during the study period. In the saline habitat the midday depression of Fv/Fm for L. crassifolium was much larger than in case of P. limosa which reflected its higher susceptibility to photoinhibition. In sandy grassland Fv/Fm of A. collina was smaller than that of F. pseudovina. Mesophyll succulence index (Sm) expressing the ratio of water content to chlorophyll content was the highest in L. crassifolium (1. 6 – 2. 2 g H 2 O mg- 1 Chl). Sm was low in xerophyte species (0. 5 – 1. 1 g H 2 O mg-Chl), and the lowest value was found for the F. pseudovina (0. 54 g H 2 O mg- Chl) ...|$|E

40|$|Habitats vary {{considerably}} {{in the level}} of invasion (LI), i. e. the number or proportion of alien plant species. To determine typical LIs for different habitats, we compiled a database of 52 480 relevés from three contrasting regions: Catalonia, Czech Republic and Great Britain. We classified plants into neophytes, archaeophytes and native, and calculated the proportion of each group in 33 EUNIS habitats. Only 8 of 545 aliens found in the relevés occurred in all three regions. Despite this large difference in alien species composition, habitat LIs were consistent among regions. Few aliens were found in nutrient-poor habitats, e. g. mires, heaths and alpine grasslands. Many aliens were found in frequently disturbed habitats with fluctuating nutrient availability, e. g. in man-made habitats. Neophytes were also frequently found in coastal, littoral and riverine habitats. Besides local habitat properties LI depends on propagule pressure of aliens. To determine real susceptibility of habitats to invasions (invasibility), it is necessary to factor out the effects of propagule pressure on the LI. We did it by statistical modelling based on phytosociological data and digital maps. Using regression trees, the proportion of aliens was related to variables representing habitat properties, propagule pressure and climate. Propagule pressure was expressed through urban, industrial or agricultural land cover and human population density in the region. Urban and industrial land use positively affected the proportion of both archaeophytes and neophytes. Agricultural land use and higher population density positively affected the proportion of archaeophytes. After removing the propagule pressure effect, some habitats with intermediate LI had very low relative proportions of aliens. This indicates that these habitats, e. g., dry, wet and <b>saline</b> <b>grasslands,</b> base-rich fens or deciduous forests are invasion-resistant. Overall, habitats explained much more variation in the LI than propagule pressure. Our findings that (1) habitat LIs are consistent across contrasting parts of Europe, and (2) LI mainly depends on habitat type and less so on propagule pressure, enabled us to extrapolate our data to wider Europe. By plotting the quantitative information on the LIs from Catalonian, Czech and British data on the CORINE land cover map of Europe, we produced the first European LI map...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{extensive}} overview of plant diversity values in Palaearctic grasslands for seven standard grain sizes from 0. 0001 to 100 m². The data originate from 20 studies, including the Field Workshops of the Eurasian Dry Grassland Group (EDGG), ranging geographically from Spain {{in the west}} to Siberia in the east, from Sicily in the south to Estonia in the north and from the sea coast up to 3100 m a. s. l. The majority of data is from dry grasslands (Festuco-Brometea, Koelerio-Corynephoretea, Cleistogenetea squarrosae), but there are also some mesic, wet, saline, acidic, alpine and Mediterranean grasslands included. Among others, we compiled data from 1795 1 -m², 1109 10 -m² and 338 100 -m² plots. In all cases we present mean, minimum and maximum richness for the seven grain sizes, plus, in cases where also terricolous bryophytes and lichens had been recorded, the same values for total “plant” species richness, non-vascular plant species richness and fraction of non-vascular plants. The maximum richness values were 82, 101 and 134 for all “plants”, and 79, 98 and 127 vascular plants at grain sizes of 1 m², 10 m² and 100 m², respectively (all in Transylvania, Romania). Our overview comprises new, hitherto unpublished world records of vascular plant species richness at the scales of 0. 0001 m² (9) and 0. 001 m² (19, both shoot presence), from meso-xeric, basiphilous grasslands in Navarre, Spain, which is much higher than the previously known maxima. The highest values of non-vascular plant richness at 1 m², 10 m² and 100 m², respectively, were 49, 64 and 64, respectively (all in Sedo-Scleranthenea communities of Öland, Sweden, and Saaremaa, Estonia). In general, the dry, alpine and Mediterranean grasslands were much richer than the studied mesic, wet or <b>saline</b> <b>grasslands</b> at any spatial scale. The presented set of mean, minimum and maximum values and their metadata is publically available and will be continuously updated. These data can serve as a reference of “normal” richness, both in fundamental and applied research. To facilitate the application, we provide an easy formula based on the power-law species-area relationship that allows the estimation of richness values at intermediate grain sizes not included in our dataset. In conclusion, our data emphasise the role of Palaearctic grasslands as global hotspot of small-scale vascular plant diversity, {{while at the same time}} highlighting that in some grassland types also the bryophyte and lichen diversity can be extraordinarily high...|$|R
30|$|BR {{is another}} {{important}} plant growth regulator, which has profound impacts of leaf photosynthesis and plant performance. The results of previous experiments suggest that BR improve leaf carbon assimilation rate through increasing the content of chlorophyll, which is the light harvesting machine of plant photosynthesis. Moreover, it has also showed that BR application could significantly alleviate the impacts of various abiotic stresses. For instance, BR treatment enhanced photosynthetic performance of cotton seedlings under NaCl stress Ding et al. (1995; Xiao et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2007; Shu et al. 2011). For cucumber seedlings, BR treatment has also been found to promote the occurrence of new roots {{and the formation of}} lateral roots Bao et al. (2004). Similar results were obtained in our experiment; BR treatment (2 [*]×[*] 10 - 4  mM) alone increased the photosynthetic carboxylation capacity and CO 2 assimilation rate. Subsequently, BR treatment enhaned the plant density, height and biomass of the studied L. chinensis populations. As a <b>saline</b> alkali <b>grassland</b> rhizomatous plant, the occurrence of new and lateral roots is conducive for the growth as well as rhizome breeding of L. chinensis. The observed significant treatment effects of BR on L. chinensis may attribute to the stimulation of BR on the formation of new and lateral roots, which will not only directly enhance rhizome breeding and population density, but also indirectly improve plant water and nutrient uptake.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor an {{effective}} {{conservation and management}} in grasslands {{it is essential to}} understand mechanisms sustaining biodiversity. To gain knowledge is especially crucial in stressed grasslands harbouring a unique flora and fauna, like alkali grasslands. Aboveground vegetation, seed bank and environmental factors were studied in three stands of the following alkali grassland types: (i) Artemisia dry alkali grasslands at highest elevations; (ii) Puccinellia high and (iii) Puccinellia low grasslands at medium to low elevations, and (iv) Juncus wet alkali grasslands at the lowest elevations. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) Seed bank species diversity and density are the highest in the most stressed grassland types, where regeneration by seeds could have a major importance in sustaining vegetation diversity. (ii) Seed bank density of hygrophytes increases with decreasing elevation, because the cover of hygrophytes in the vegetation increases with decreasing elevation. The mean seed bank density ranged from 30, 104 up to 51, 410 seeds/m 2, which is higher than in most dry grasslands. Both the lowest seed bank density and diversity were detected in the most stressed Puccinellia high grasslands; Spergularia salina was the only abundant seed bank species (possessing at least 1000 seeds/m 2). These results not supported our first hypothesis. We detected the highest seed densities of almost all hygrophyte species in the lowest-elevated Juncus grasslands. But, we did not find a significant monotonous correlation between elevation and the overall hygrophyte seed bank density; because most of the hygrophyte species were missing from the seed bank at the medium-elevated, but most <b>saline</b> Puccinellia <b>grasslands.</b> Thus, our results only partly supported the second hypothesis. In total we detected more species in the seed bank than in the aboveground vegetation which emphasises that seed bank {{plays an important role in}} sustaining the diversity of alkali grasslands. However, characteristic graminoids possessed no considerable seed bank, except for Juncus compressus (up to 38, 619 seeds/m 2). We can conclude that persistence and establishment of most alkali grassland species are not supported by the local persistent seed bank...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} the {{distribution}} of salt and water in fields of both arable and <b>grassland</b> <b>saline</b> sodic clay soils were studied under temperate rainfed conditions. Leaching of the topsoils during winter rains was further investigated in soil columns. The field studies indicated the cyclical nature of leaching. During winter rains the water moving through the macropores uniformly leached salt from the soil profile to a depth of 1. 2 m, but in late summer the salt content of the grassland and arable soils had increased again by 11 % and 35 % respectively compared with their early spring salinity levels. The results indicated that the salt leached in winter was mainly not lost, but leached below 1. 2 m, only to rise again as the soil profile dried in the summer. The implications for managing and reclaiming these soils with gypsum are discussed. Undisturbed grassland topsoils were slow to release salt into the leaching water, maximum salt concentration in the leachate only being reached well into the winters rains. In disturbed arable soils the maximum leachate concentration was achieved shortly after leaching commenced. The changes in surface structure brought about by rainfall impact on bare restructured ploughlayer soils caused a significant decline in leaching efficiency (up to 40 %). The observed pattern of leaching questions the validity of the basic assumptions used in most of the mathematical leaching models. <br/...|$|R
