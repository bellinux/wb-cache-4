We investigated whether impairment of <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and lung diffusion capacity could be related to HRV indices in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Methods: Sixteen sedentary males with COPD were enrolled in this study. Resting blood gases, <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were measured. The RR interval (RRi) was registered in the supine, standing, and seated positions (10 minutes each) and during 4 minutes of a respiratory sinus arrhythmia maneuver (M-RSA). Delta changes (Δsupine-standing and Δsupine-M-RSA) of the standard deviation of normal RRi, low frequency (LF, normalized units [nu]) and high frequency (HF [nu]), SD 1, SD 2, alpha 1, alpha 2, and approximate entropy (ApEn) indices were calculated. Results: HF, LF, SD 1, SD 2, and alpha 1 deltas significantly correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second, DLCO, airway resistance, residual volume, inspiratory capacity/total lung capacity ratio, and residual volume/total lung capacity ratio. Significant and moderate associations were also observed between LF/HF ratio versus total gas volume (%), r= 0. 53; LF/HF ratio versus residual volume, %, r= 0. 52; and HF versus total gas volume (%), r=- 0. 53 (P< 0. 05). Linear regression analysis revealed that ΔRRi supine-M-RSA was independently related to DLCO (r=- 0. 77, r 2 = 0. 43, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Responses of HRV indices were more prominent during M-RSA in moderate to severe COPD. Moreover, greater lung function impairment was related to poorer heart rate dynamics. Finally, impaired lung diffusion capacity was related to an altered parasympathetic response in these patients.

With this as our main purpose, we prospectively evaluated 100 non-smoking subjects (50 males and 50 females), 20 to 80 years old, randomly selected from more than 8, 000 individuals. Gender-specific linear prediction equations were developed by multiple regression analysis with total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), residual volume (RV), RV/TLC ratio and inspiratory capacity (IC) as dependent variables, and with age, height, weight, lean body mass and indexes of physical fitness as independent ones. Simpler demographic and anthropometric variables were as useful as more complex measurements in predicting LV values, independent of gender and age (R 2 values ranging from 0. 49 to 0. 78, P< 0. 001). Interestingly, prediction equations from North American and European studies overestimated the LV at low volumes and underestimated them at high volumes (P< 0. 05).

METHODS: Twenty nine patients of mean (SE) age 64 (1. 5) years, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 42 (3) % of predicted, and 5 - 15 % reversibility to salbutamol 200 micrograms were randomised to receive four weeks treatment with salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily or placebo in a double blind crossover fashion with a one week washout period in between. Measurements of spirometric parameters, <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> and exercise capacity were made one and six hours after a single dose, and six hours after the final dose of salmeterol or placebo. RESULTS: Salmeterol produced a small increase in FEV 1 at one and six hours after a single dose, and this was maintained after chronic dosing (mean difference and 95 % CI versus placebo) : single dosing at one hour 0. 07 (95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 11) 1, single dosing at six hours 0. 16 (95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 22) 1, chronic dosing at six hours 0. 11 (95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 19) 1. The increase in forced vital capacity (FVC) was greater with salmeterol than with placebo six hours after single but not chronic dosing: single dosing at six hours 0. 17 (95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 29) 1, chronic dosing at six hours 0. 02 (95 % CI - 0. 18 to 0. 22) 1. Slow vital capacity was increased after treatment with salmeterol compared with placebo one and six hours after single but not after chronic dosing. There were no significant differences in <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> or exercise capacity after single or chronic dosing with salmeterol compared with placebo. Patients reported a significantly lower Borg score for perceived exertion following the six minute walk after chronic treatment with salmeterol compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Salmeterol produced a small improvement in spirometric values compared with placebo consistent with the degree of reversibility originally shown by the subjects to salbutamol 200 micrograms.

40|$|Background: Visceral {{adipose tissue}} (VAT) {{was shown to}} be {{increased}} in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) compared to control subjects with comparable body mass index (BMI). Our aim was to determine the relation of VAT by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in patients with COPD by disease severity, BMI, other indices of body composition and <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes.</b> Methods: 294 COPD patients admitted for rehabilitation were studied. Lung function, <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and body composition (i. e. BMI, waist circumference, fat-free mass, fat mass and fat distribution between android and gynoid fat mass) were assessed before entering pulmonary rehabilitation. VAT was estimated within the android region by using DEXA. Patients were stratified for gender, BMI (cut-off of 25 kg/m 2) and GOLD stage. To assess the impact of VAT on lung volumes, patients were also stratified for VAT less and above 50 th percentile. Results: Both male and female patients with more severe airflow limitation had significantly lower VAT values, but these differences disappeared after stratification for BMI. VAT was significantly and strongly correlated with other body composition parameters (all p < 0. 001). Patients with moderate to severe airflow limitation and lower VAT had increased static lung hyperinflation and lower diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. Nevertheless, multivariate stepwise regression models including for BMI, age, gender and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) as confounders did not confirm an independent role for VAT on static lung hyperinflation and diffusion capacity. Conclusion: After stratification for BMI, VAT is comparable in moderate to very severe COPD patients. Furthermore, BMI and demographics, but not VAT, were independent predictors of static lung hyperinflation and diffusing capacity in COPD...|$|E

The use of gas dilution techniques, such as multiple-breath nitrogen washout (MBNW), require minimal patient cooperation and allow FRC to be determined in those individuals unable to complete plethysmographic measurements. The MBNW technique is used clinically and for research, and provides accurate and repeatable measures in both children and adults [3, 4]. The 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines recommend waiting between repeated MBNW tests for ⩾ 15 min and that in obstructed patients a period of> 1 h may be required [2].

DESIGN: Follow-up cohort study. SETTING: University hospital pulmonary division and level 1 trauma center. PATIENTS: Sixteen survivors of severe ARDS (from 1992 to 1994) with a lung injury score > or = 2. 5. MEASUREMENTS: The follow-up study (from 1995 to 1996) included interview, physical examination, chest radiographs, <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>volumes,</b> diffusion {{capacity of the}} lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), blood gas analysis, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: The mean +/- SD interval between hospital discharge and functional assessment was 29. 5 +/- 8. 7 months (range, 15. 0 to 40. 7 months). In approximately {{one half of the}} patients, mild abnormalities in <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> were found. In 25 % (4 of 16 patients), lung function was obstructive; in 25 % (4 of 16 patients), lung function was restrictive; and in 6. 3 % (1 of 16 patients), a combined obstructive-restrictive pattern was revealed.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} of strategies {{for treatment of}} the altered <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> and against the development of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) following a left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) induced by myocardial ischaemia was investigated in a rat model of sustained postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. Methods Airway resistance (Raw) was identified from the respiratory system input impedance (Zrs) in four groups of rats. End-expiratory <b>lung</b> <b>volume</b> (EELV) was determined plethysmographically, and Zrs was measured under baseline conditions and following iv infusions of 2, 6 or 18 μg/kg/min methacholine. Sham surgery was performed in the rats in Group C, while the left interventricular coronary artery was ligated and Zrs and its changes following identical methacholine challenges were reassessed in the same rats 8 weeks later, during which no treatment was applied (Group I), or the animals were treated daily {{with a combination of}} an angiotensin enzyme converter inhibitor and a diuretic (enalapril and furosemide, Group IE), or a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem, Group ID). The equivalent dose of methacholine causing a 100 % increase in Raw (ED 50) was determined in each group. Diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure (Pap D) was assessed by introducing a catheter into the pulmonary artery. Results The sustained presence of a LVD increased Pap D in all groups of rats, with variable but significant elevations in Groups I (p[*]=[*] 0. 004), ID (p[*]=[*] 0. 013) and IE (p[*]=[*] 0. 006). A LVD for 8 weeks induced no changes in baseline Raw but elevated the EELV independently of the treatments. In Group I, BHR consistently developed following the LVD, with a significant decrease in ED 50 from 10. 0 [*]±[*] 2. 5 to 6. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 5 μg/kg/min (p[*]=[*] 0. 006). The BHR was completely abolished in both Groups ID and IE, with no changes in ED 50 (9. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 6 vs. 10. 7 [*]±[*] 4. 7, p[*]=[*] 0. 33 and 10. 6 [*]±[*] 2. 1 vs. 9. 8 [*]±[*] 3. 5 μg/kg/min p[*]=[*] 0. 56, respectively). Conclusions These findings suggest that a LVD following coronary ischaemia consistently induces BHR. The more consistent efficacy of both treatment strategies in preventing BHR than in treating the adverse pulmonary vascular consequences suggests the benefit of both calcium channel blockade and ACE inhibition to counteract the airway susceptibility following a LVD. </p...|$|R

The data of our study were collected from 102 patients with psychiatric problems who were living in hospices or in departments under the supervision of two large psychiatric hospitals. Data collection: patients were interviewed through a forty nine variables questionnaire. They also underwent two lung function tests: · Slow vital Capacity · Single - Breath co diffusing capacity volume/ time (DLCO) Results : 35, 8 % of patients were obese (BMI? 30) : 75, 3 % of patients were smokers. All participating patients showed a decrease of <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and capacities mainly expressed as a vital capacity decrease. The normal values of RV and FRC indicate that the main disorder affects the muscle strength, without any associated changes of the <b>static</b> <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and capacities. Patients diagnosed with depression sowed significantly lower values of TLC Alveolar Volume and FRC compared to those suffering from schizophrenia. Regarding to medication it didn’t seem to directly affect the respiratory parameters. Significantly lower values of FRC/ TLC and ERV were recorded from patients treated with antidepressant. Patients on milder medication showed significant higher Ti/ Ttot ratio values. Obese patients showed significant change of respiratory parameters, especially a decrease of TLC, RV, Tidal Volume, Alveolar Volume, VC and FRC. Obese smokers showed lower values of DLCO, DLCO (corrected), TLC, FRC, VC and Alveolar Volume. The vast majority patients complaining of morning cough and exertion dyspnoea were smokers. No significant correlation was observed between arterial blood O 2 saturation and the respiratory parameters studied. Depressive and maniodepressive patients sowed significantly higher BSA values (p= 0, 016) and body mass index (p= 0, 002) compared to those suffering schizophrenia. There higher rates of smokers among mails, younger patients and employed patients. Patients complaining of exertion dyspnoea were obese with lower values of TLC, FRC, and Alveolar Volume. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{long term}} effects on lung {{function}} of treatment of idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax by talc poudrage or simple chest drainage were assessed in 114 patients. Subjects were studied 22 - 35 {{years after their}} first pneumothorax with measurement of <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>volumes.</b> Eighty patients had been treated with talc pleurodesis and 34 with simple pleural drainage. At the follow up examination 17 had died from {{what appear to be}} unrelated causes and two had emigrated. Of the remainder, 75 participated fully in the study, 14 completed a postal questionnaire, and six failed to respond. The group treated with talc poudrage showed a mild restrictive impairment of lung function with a mean total lung capacity (TLC) of 89 % predicted. In subjects treated with simple drainage mean TLC was 96 % predicted. One subject treated with talc poudrage had extensive pleural calcification and a substantial reduction in lung function (TLC 58 % predicted) with some evidence of lung fibrosis. None of the subjects had developed a mesothelioma. We conclude that, although talc poudrage may cause a mild restrictive impairment of lung function and pleural thickening on the chest radiograph, the long term outlook is good...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Pulmonary {{disease is}} {{responsible}} for considerable morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc). <b>Static</b> <b>lung</b> compliance (Cst) has been observed to be decreased more often in SSc than the vital capacity, indicating {{that it is a}} sensitive measure of lung restriction. In this study Cst was compared with the carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO), a widely used measure of the function of the alveolar capillary unit, and with <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> in 59 patients with confirmed or suspected SSc. METHODS [...] Cst was calculated from the oesophageal pressure at different <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and the TLCO was measured with the single breath method. RESULTS [...] The TLCO was found to be the earliest sign of pulmonary disease and was already decreased at a disease duration of one year or less. Surprisingly, no relation was found between the TLCO and smoking habits, nor the degree of peripheral vascular disease. The TLCO correlated with the Cst and vital capacity. CONCLUSIONS [...] An early pulmonary lesion can be identified in patients with SSc with decreased TLCO at a time when no fibrotic changes are manifested...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Breath-hold divers employ {{glossopharyngeal}} insufflation (GI) {{in order}} to prevent the lungs from compressing at great depth and to increase intrapulmonary oxygen stores, thus increasing breath-hold time. The presented case study shows the physiological data and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) findings of acute hyperinflation, deliberately induced by GI, in a breath-hold diver and discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the associated hazards of this unique competitive sport. <b>Static</b> and dynamic <b>lung</b> <b>volumes</b> and expiratory flows were within the normal range, with vital capacity and peak expiratory flow being higher than the predicted values. Airway resistance and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide were normal. Static compliance was normal and increased five-fold with hyperinflation. dMRI revealed a preserved shape of the thorax and diaphragm with hyperinflation. A herniation of the lung beneath the sternum and enlargement of the costodiaphragmatic angle were additional findings during the GI manoeuvre. After expiration, complete resolution to baseline was demonstrated. Hyperinflation can be physiological and even protective under abnormal physical conditions in the sense of acute adaptation to deep breath-hold diving. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging is adequate for visualisation of the sequence of the glossopharyngeal insufflation manoeuvre and the complete reversibility of deliberate hyperinflation...|$|R
