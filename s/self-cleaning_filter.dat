40|$|Recent {{field data}} {{has shown the}} {{effectiveness}} of automatic <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>filters</b> in removing suspended solids down to less than 3 microns in size without flocculents, pre-coats or granulated media. Pre-treatment of ozone systems is often needed to remove organic solids that would utilize high amounts of ozone during oxidation leaving little for complete disinfection. <b>Self-cleaning</b> screen <b>filters</b> can physically remove much of that organic matter efficiently and economically resulting in the need for lower ozone concentrations. The use of ultraviolet light water treatment has been growing rapidly. An effective job of disinfection requires that microorganisms be directly exposed to light of the appropriate wavelength.

Age, higher intra-ocular pressure (IOP), and worse visual field status at a patient’s baseline examination are important risk factors for developing blindness in POAG [2]. IOP is regulated primarily by fluid resistance to aqueous humor outflow in the trabec-ular meshwork (TM) [3]. The TM functions as a one-way, low-flow, <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>filter</b> with an approximate two-third functional reserve [4]. The TM cell population decreases as an individual ages [4].

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the present work {{was to develop a}} new scale-prevention technology by continuously precipitating and removing dissolved mineral ions (such as calcium and magnesium) in cooling water while the COC could be doubled from the present standard value of 3. 5. The hypothesis {{of the present study was}} that if we could successfully precipitate and remove the excess calcium ions in cooling water, we could prevent condenser-tube fouling and at the same time double the COC. The approach in the study was to utilize pulse spark discharges directly in water to precipitate dissolved mineral ions in recirculating cooling water into relatively large suspended particles, which could be removed by a <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>filter.</b> The present study began with a basic scientific research to better understand the mechanism of pulse spark discharges in water and conducted a series of validation experiments using hard water in a laboratory cooling tower. Task 1 of the present work was to demonstrate if the spark discharge could precipitate the mineral ions in water. Task 2 was to demonstrate if the selfcleaning filter could continuously remove these precipitated calcium particles such that the blowdown could be eliminated or significantly reduced. Task 3 was to demonstrate if the scale could be prevented or minimized at condenser tubes with a COC of 8 or (almost) zero blowdown. In Task 1, we successfully completed the validation study that confirmed the precipitation of dissolved calcium ions in cooling water with the supporting data of calcium hardness over time as measured by a calcium ion probe. In Task 2, we confirmed through experimental tests that the <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>filter</b> could continuously remove precipitated calcium particles in a simulated laboratory cooling tower such that the blowdown could be eliminated or significantly reduced. In addition, chemical water analysis data were obtained which were used to confirm the COC calculation. In Task 3, we conducted a series of heat transfer fouling tests using a condenser heat exchanger in the laboratory cooling tower, from which we confirmed that the plasma water treatment technology could prevent or significantly mitigate mineral foulings in condenser tubes when compared with the no-treatment case. With the completion of the present work, a cooling water treatment technology using pulse spark discharges is currently ready for field-validation tests. The plasma water treatment technology is a true mechanical water softener with almost no maintenance, which continuously converts hard water to soft water spending a relatively small amount of energy. Such a mechanical water softener could find wide-spread applications to solve hard water problems both in industry and at home...|$|E

The land-based testing facility used natural sea water of high turbidity during the spring phytoplankton bloom. The mesozooplankton fraction was inspected with a standard binocular. Larger zooplankton were effectively removed with the filter; the smaller sized fraction containing larvae and nauplia were killed after chemical treatment. The phytoplankton component was monitored using flow cytometry. The huge colonies of the phytoplankton Phaeocystis globosa were disrupted in the hydrocyclone liberating the colony cells which passed as single cells through the filter. These cells remained viable but were finally killed in the secondary (chemical) step. Bacteria also passed all mechanical treatment steps unharmed but were killed in the final step. Viability tests with SYTOX Green, which were specifically designed for phytoplankton, showed that mechanical treatment did not affect the percentage of viable cells a short-term, but after several hours the viable cell counts dropped down to 70 %. Phytoplankton cells recovered within a single day and formed a new dense bloom rapidly. The bacteriostatic component of the chemical disinfectant (H 2 O 2) remained present for several days preventing regrowth of bacteria for up to 15 days after addition.

50|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} (RWH) is {{a practice}} of growing importance in the United Kingdom, particularly in the South East of England where there is less water available per person than in many Mediterranean countries. Rainwater harvesting in the UK is both a traditional and reviving technique for collecting water for domestic uses. This water is generally used for non-hygienic purposes like watering gardens, flushing toilets, and washing clothes. There is a growing demand for larger tank systems collecting between 1000-7500 litres of water. The two main uses for harvested rainwater are botanical uses, like gardening for plant irrigation, and domestic uses, like flushing toilets and running washing machines. Rainwater is almost always collected strictly from the roof, then heavily filtered using either a filter attached to the down pipe, a fine basket filter or for more expensive systems like <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>filters</b> placed in an underground tank.

The whole hydraulic system is a complex one: it is composed of a main cooling water network fed by pumps, a water-based fire fighting network for the hydropower generators and a backup cooling water network fed from the penstock pipes. The numerical model of the whole cooling water system consists of 87 pipes, 133 junctions, 6 variable speed driven centrifugal pumps, 59 valves and 3 reservoirs.

40|$|The use of {{sea water}} {{desalination}} to produce potable water for maritime vessels {{is essential for}} eliminating storage of potable water. Reverse osmosis (RO) is the technology of choice for desalination purposes; however, raw seawater must undergo pretreatment to avoid rapid fouling and plugging of RO membranes and modules. Current pretreatment technology is effective in the open ocean but in coastal regions involves frequent replacement of filter cartridges and increased maintenance costs. The standard pretreatment process consists of 20 Î¼m cartridge filters and 3 Î¼m cartridge filters in series. Several technologies were considered as options for improving the current pretreatment process. Multimedia filtration followed by hollow-fiber ultrafiltration was considered, but it was rejected {{because of the high}} required membrane surface area, high capital cost, and high pressure drop requirements. Mechanically-enhanced <b>self-cleaning</b> <b>filters,</b> followed by either microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF), were also considered. The selfcleaning filters were rejected because of mechanical complexity and high initial investment. The technology selected by The Salty Hogs is a sand filter followed by a 0. 1 Î¼m hollow-fiber microfiltration (HMF) unit. The sand filter is less expensive and less complex than a multimedia filter, and the HMF unit requires much less area and has lower capital costs than a UF unit. The sand filter/HMF combination can handle feeds with various turbidity levels and meet the task requirements to feed 21 gpm of filtered water to the RO unit, which is the flow rate required for the RO unit to produce 12, 000 gallons/day of potable water with 40 % recovery. Although the project focused on oceanic applications, inland water desalination plants can integrate The Salty Hogsâ€™ technology into existing RO desalination processes. This report presents the design for a full-scale, shipboard system that incorporates sand filtration and hollowfiber microfiltration. The shipboard unit is designed for optimal power usage and minimal space requirements. The water provided by the recommended process is filtered to 0. 1 Î¼m, an improvement that will lengthen the lifetime of the current spiral-wound RO membranes. The system is automated to back-wash the sand filters with water and back-flush the HMF membranes with air. Periodic chemical cleaning is required and involves the use of a sodium hydroxide wash followed by an acetic acid rinse. The spent sodium hydroxide and acetic acid solutions will be combined and neutralized before being discharged to the ocean. Task # 5 4 University of Arkansas The economic parameters for the system have been determined. Purchased equipment cost is $ 21, 000, and the total capital investment, based on factored estimates, is $ 133, 000. Over the projected three year lifetime of the RO membranes, the proposed process provides an incremental savings, including reduced maintenance and filter usage, of $ 92, 000, over the three year project lifetime when compared to the current cartridge filter system.
