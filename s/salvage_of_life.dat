40|$|PURPOSE: This report {{evaluates the}} {{efficiency}} of use of the lower extremity deep vein as arterial conduits in the autogenous repair of prosthetic infection after reconstructive aortoiliac surgery. METHODS: We reviewed our records for the period 1990 to 1994 of all patients with prosthetic infection after reconstruction for aortoiliac disease, and we selected for this study all those patients who underwent autograft repair with the lower extremity deep veins. RESULTS: Included were 15 patients: 12 had previously undergone direct aorto(ilio) femoral reconstruction, and three had an extraanatomic prosthetic graft. Thirteen patients were admitted with primary graft infection, and two were admitted with secondary graft-enteric erosion. Treatment consisted of prosthetic excision and aorto(ilio) femoral reconstruction with the superficial femoral vein. In situ reconstruction was performed in 12 cases. The operative mortality rate was 7 %. There were no early graft occlusions. One patient underwent an above-knee amputation because of concomitant femoropopliteal occlusion {{in the presence of}} a patent deep venous aortofemoral graft. Early postoperative limb swelling was common and was controlled with bed rest, elastic stockings, or intermittent pneumatic compression. The mean follow-up of this series was 17 months (range 4 to 33 months). Two patients died of unrelated causes. One graft occluded after 16 months. There were no reinfections, and all but one patient resumed normal daily activities. Disability from removal of the deep veins was minimal: only one patient continues to wear elastic stockings for limb swelling and shows signs of venous hypertension more than 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSION: Harvesting of the lower extremity deep veins is well tolerated. Autogenous reconstruction with these veins provides good potential for <b>salvage</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and limbs in case of prosthetic infection. A longer period of follow-up is required to study the long-term behavior of these grafts and to allow definite comparison with more conventional approaches. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Ranching – the breeding, raising, {{and selling}} of cattle – {{is one of}} the {{long-established}} occupations of the American workforce. This labor-intensive industry is confronted with the struggles of fierce industry competition, government regulation, and a fluctuating market. As a result of the evolution of the industry and alteration of the ranching demographic, ranchers are being forced to restructure their profession.

40|$|AbstractObjectives {{to compare}} the {{amputation}} rates, quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and health care costs in patients receiving duplex ultrasound scanning against clinical surveillance following femoropopliteal and femorocrural vein bypass. Design multi-centre, prospective, randomised controlled trial. Methods 1200 patients with a patent vein graft at 30 days postoperatively will be randomised to either clinical or duplex follow-up. All patients are seen in an out-patient clinic at 6 weeks, then 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months postoperatively. At each appointment patients are examined clinically; palpable pulses in the graft and crural vessels, presenting symptoms and their ankle–branchial pressure indices (ABPIs) measured. In the duplex group only, {{the results of the}} scan are monitored. The incidence of radiological and/or surgical interventions throughout the follow-up period are also noted. Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is measured using the SF- 36 and EuroQol questionnaires at the 6 and 18 month appointments. Hospital stays and resource use are documented for health economic analysis. Results the primary endpoint of this study is amputation or death from vascular causes; however, graft patency rates will also be compared between the groups. Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and health economic data will be used to determine if there is any benefit in either arm in these outcomes between follow-up strategies. Conclusions this large, randomised-controlled trial will hopefully provide direct evidence on the benefit of duplex surveillance for vein grafts in terms <b>of</b> limb <b>salvage,</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the patients and cost-benefit to the purchaser...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in {{patients}} with and without various ischemic complications after infrainguinal bypass grafting surgery for occlusive vascular disease. Methods: A sample of patients (n = 746) randomized in the Dutch BOA study (n = 2645), a multicenter trial that compared the effectiveness of oral anticoagulant therapy with aspirin in the prevention of infrainguinal bypass graft occlusions, was entered in this study. On the basis of clinical outcomes of the trial, the patients were grouped as follows: patients with patent grafts (n = 409); patients with nontreated graft occlusions, subdivided into an asymptomatic group (n = 32) and a symptomatic group (n = 65); patients with subsequent revascularizations (n = 194); patients with amputations (n = 36); and patients with failed secondary revascularizations followed by secondary amputation (n = 38). In case an outcome event occurred, the patients were regrouped accordingly. Every half year, the patients completed a Short Form– 36 and a EuroQol questionnaire. A multilevel model was used for repeated measure analysis. Results:The mean follow-up time was 21 months. The quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in patients with nontreated asymptomatic occlusions was roughly similar to the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in patients with patent grafts. Patients with symptomatic nontreated occlusions had the lowest outcome with regard to pain as compared with the other groups. Furthermore, physical and social functioning was lower for these patients than for patients with patent grafts. Revascularizations, successful or not, negatively affected pain, social functioning, and physical and emotional role. After successful revascularization, some improvement was observed in pain, physical and social functioning, and general and mental health as compared with the group with nontreated symptomatic occlusions. Amputation deteriorated physical functioning strikingly, especially after failed secondary revascularization. These patients also had the lowest scores of all the groups in the dimensions of social functioning, physical and emotional role, and mental health. EuroQol score showed deterioration <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> after all events, except for asymptomatic occlusions. The same patterns emerged if we stratified our analysis according to the indication for the initial operation: claudication or limb <b>salvage.</b> Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was constant over time in all the groups in the observed period. Conclusion: Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in patients with asymptomatic occluded grafts is similar to quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in patients with patent grafts. Revascularization of symptomatic occluded grafts improves quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> to a certain extent. Amputation, in particular after failed secondary revascularization, seemed to be the lowest possible outcome. The results of the Short Form- 36 and EuroQol measurements were in line with the clinical expectations. The association of disease severity with scores on the instruments supports the construct validity of these outcome measures for an objective assessment <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in controlled studies.
