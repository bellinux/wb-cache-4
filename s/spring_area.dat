2500|$|The {{following}} month, amid increasing criticism, the McDaniels rescinded {{the reward}} offer. [...] "Not {{only did it}} endanger the lives of divers who would risk going farther than they should," [...] said Sorenson, who was by then even more firmly convinced that their son had not died in the cave, [...] "it put {{all of our lives}} at risk because we have to go in to recover the bodies." [...] By that time the McDaniels had also come to believe that, if he had not died in the cave, Ben had been murdered. A phone tip line they set up had not received any calls, and no one who had not yet said anything was likely to be further motivated to do so, they said. (Ben's father elaborated the following year that the family was told to rescind the reward while in the Vortex <b>Spring</b> <b>area</b> for exactly this reason).|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the {{downtown}} Silver <b>Spring</b> <b>area</b> gained attention when an amateur photographer was prohibited from taking photographs in {{what appeared to}} be a public street. The land, leased to the Peterson Cos., a developer, for $1, was technically private property. The citizens argued that the Downtown Silver Spring development, partially built with public money, was still public property. After a protest on July 4, 2007, Peterson relented and allowed photography on their property under limited conditions. Peterson also claimed that it could revoke these rights at any time. The company further stated that other activities permitted in public spaces, such as organizing protests or distributing campaign literature, were still prohibited. In response, Montgomery County Attorney Leon Rodriguez said that the street in question, Ellsworth Drive, [...] "constitutes a public forum" [...] and that the First Amendment's protection of free speech applies there. In an eight-page letter, Rodriguez wrote, [...] "Although the courts have not definitively resolved the issue of whether the taking, as opposed to the display, of photographs is a protected expressive act, we think it is likely that a court would consider the taking of the photograph to be part of the continuum of action that leads to the display of the photograph and thus also protected by the First Amendment." [...] The incident was part of a trend in the United States regarding the blurring of public and private spaces in developments built with both public and private funds.|$|E

"Continued improvement, with {{favorable}} weather conditions, in the [...] winter-wheat {{states and}} encouraging {{messages from the}} Northwest [...] warrant an increase of crop estimates made two weeks ago and based [...] mainly upon the government's report. In all probability the yield [...] from winter fields will slightly exceed 600,000,000 bushels. [...] Increase of acreage in the spring states in unexpectedly large. For [...] example, Minnesota's Food Administrator says the addition in his [...] state is 40 per cent, instead of the early estimate of 20 per cent. [...] Throughout the <b>spring</b> <b>area</b> the plants have a good start and are in [...] excellent condition. It {{may be that the}} yield will rise to [...] 300,000,000 bushels, making a total of about 900,000,000. From such [...] a crop 280,000,000 could be exported in normal times, and by [...] conservation the surplus can easily be enlarged to 350,000,000 or [...] even 400,000,000. In Canada also estimates of acreage increase have [...] been too low. It was said that the addition in Alberta was 20 per [...] cent., but recent reports make it 40 per cent.
