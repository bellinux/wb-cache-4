5|$|The niche image {{carved on}} the {{southwest}} wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness to the wedding. Vishnu is witness to the marriage, <b>standing</b> <b>tall</b> behind the sitting Brahma {{on the right side}} of the panel. Just above the main images rishi (sages) and a few characters hanging from the ceiling are seen blessing the wedding.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, during Batista's celebratory speech, The Legacy attacked Batista, and injured him in storyline. This storyline {{was used to}} cover a real injury Batista had sustained. Orton's rematch that night, intended to be used despite Batista's absence, The following week, a match was held to determine the new WWE Champion between Orton, Triple H, John Cena and The Big Show, which Orton won. At The Bash pay-per-view, signs of dissention between DiBiase and Orton appeared when DiBiase argued with Orton backstage. Despite this, DiBiase and Rhodes both helped Orton retain his WWE Championship later that night against Triple H. This tension was later expanded upon when DiBiase's father booked Orton and DiBiase in a match on Raw {{while he was in}} charge; Orton won the match but the team showed solidarity later in the same evening by interfering in a WWE Championship contender match between Triple H and Cena, leading to it being ruled a no contest. This made the subsequent match at Night of Champions a triple threat contest. Similar tensions arose briefly in the group late in August when Rhodes' father, Dusty, booked Orton and Rhodes in a match on Raw. It quickly {{turned out to be a}} ruse with Dusty's intention to allow The Legacy to attack Cena, who was special guest referee.

25|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>tall</b> {{and still}} at the crease, Laxman had a keen {{awareness}} of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At {{the start of his}} career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best players of the hard (new) ball. However, Indian selectors played around with his batting positions, whenever India felt a lacuna regarding any batting number. He was forced to play in almost every position, including opening. Laxman found his home in the middle order, where he played most of his best innings, batting at numbers 3, 5 and 6. In a 2001 test against Australia and promoted to no. 3 in the second innings from his first innings position of 6, he scored 281 to take India to a huge lead after following on, resulting in a historic win, that also kickstarted an era of India's dominance in test cricket. Though Laxman was ideally suited for No. 3, Rahul Dravid was always preferred over him to bat at one-down. This resulted in Dravid getting opportunities to build partnerships with top and early middle-order batsmen, and score heavily. Laxman, despite being a far more aggressive and attacking batsman than Dravid (and equally skilled, with a similar test temperament), mostly came at no. 6, often finding himself stranded with tail-end batsmen, allowing him lesser number of big partnerships; this reflects in his final statistics, including total runs scored, number of centuries and average. Nevertheless, Laxman made most of this situation by garnering unprecedented support from non-specialist lower-order batsmen to save and win numerous matches for India.|$|E

Gillespie stated regarding Kellaway's observations: [...] "But <b>standing</b> <b>tall</b> on the steps of the Capitol, she was light-years removed from that terrible time, and America was no longer an 'unfriendly place.' Her poem 'On the Pulse of Morning' was a soaring call for peace, justice, and harmony.

She wished us 'Good morning' in her poem, and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning." ...|$|E

With the exception of the tarsus length, the standard measurements of the greater adjutant are on average greater than that of other stork species. A white collar ruff at the base of its bare yellow to red-skinned neck gives it a vulture-like appearance. In the breeding season, the pouch and neck become bright orange and the upper thighs of the grey legs turn reddish. Adults have a dark wing that contrasts with light grey secondary coverts. The underside of the body is whitish and the sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Juveniles are a duller version of the adult. The pendant inflatable pouch connects to the air passages and is not connected to the digestive tract. The exact function is unknown, but it is not involved in food storage as was sometimes believed. This was established in 1825 by Dr John Adam, a student of Professor Robert Jameson, who dissected a specimen and found the two layered pouch filled mainly with air. The only possible confusable species in the region is the smaller lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), which lacks a pouch, prefers wetland habitats, has a lighter grey skull cap, a straighter edge to the upper mandible and lacks the contrast between the grey secondary coverts and the dark wings.|$|E
