50|$|The Hierarchical Aggregation (or {{also known}} as RTCP {{feedback}} hierarchy) is an optimization of the RTCP feedback model and its aim is to shift {{the maximum number of}} users limit further together with quality of service (QoS) measurement. The RTCP bandwidth is constant and takes just 5% of session bandwidth. Therefore, the reporting interval about QoS depends, among others, on a number of session members and for very large sessions it can become very high (minutes or even hours)2. However the acceptable interval is about 10 seconds of reporting. Bigger values would cause time-shifted and very inaccurate reported status about the current <b>session</b> <b>status</b> and any optimization made by sender could even have a negative effect to network or QoS conditions.|$|E

40|$|Although IP {{multicasting}} {{has been}} deployed {{for more than}} a decade, management of multicast networks and service is still a challenging problem. The fact that IP multicast is a receiver-oriented and stateless protocol makes end-to-end multicast monitoring intractable task. Important multicast information such as join/leave status, group membership, tree information, path/traffic characteristics, and <b>session</b> <b>status</b> is either unrevealed or distributed in various locations on the network. In this paper, we present a new remote passive multicast monitoring infrastructure, called MRMON, to capture, analyze and present multicast session, traffic and membership information at real-time. The MRMON probes inhabit a well-organized multicast information structure (MIB) that provides a comprehensive view of multicast network activities in remote subnets. We show how information can be collected from different MRMON probes and then correlated to diagnose multicast session problems. MRMON is a crucial step toward effective multicast management, and our goal is to promote MRMON as a standard MIB in multicast management...|$|E
40|$|For {{scalable}} multicast transport, one of {{the promising}} approaches is to employ a control tree known as acknowl-edgement (ACK) tree {{which can be used}} to convey infor-mation on reliability and <b>session</b> <b>status</b> from receivers to a root sender. The existing tree configuration has focused on a ‘bottom-up ’ scheme in which ACK trees grow from leaf receivers toward a root sender. This paper proposes an al-ternative ‘top-down ’ configuration where an ACK tree be-gins at the root sender and gradually expands by including non-tree nodes into the tree in a stepwise manner. The pro-posed scheme is simple and practical to implement along with multicast transport protocols. It is also employed as a tree configuration in the Enhanced Communications Transport Protocol, which has been standardized in the ITU-T and ISO/IEC JTC 1. From experimental simula-tions, we see that the top-down scheme provides advan-tages over the existing bottom-up one in terms of the num-ber of control messages required for tree configuration and the number of tree levels...|$|E

30|$|In {{a cluster}} scenario, {{like the one}} shown in Figure 13, the session-oriented nature of SIP has {{important}} implications for load balancing. In a typical VoIP scenario, all transactions relevant to the same call must be routed to the same server; otherwise, the server will not recognize the call. Session-aware request assignment is the process through which a system allocates requests to servers such that sessions are properly recognized by that server, and subsequent requests, corresponding to the same session, are allocated to the same server [43]. In our case, in which no SIP INVITEs are used, there is no need of complex algorithms. On the contrary, a simple static approach to load balancing (such as a call-id hash algorithm [43]) is enough to ensure that messages with the same call-id, hence belonging to the same MBS service transaction (as defined in Section 5.1), are routed to the same server within the cluster. In addition, when the MBS service transaction (e.g., the Join procedure) is completed, in our architecture any future update of the user state can be processed by another replica of the MBSC-SS, since the <b>session</b> <b>status</b> of each user is stored in the DB. This allows managing computing resources very efficiently by employing simple load-balancing and failover techniques, since ASs do not have to maintain session states and can be powered off without any problem.|$|E
50|$|A {{stateless}} protocol {{does not}} require the server to retain <b>session</b> information or <b>status</b> about each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests.
