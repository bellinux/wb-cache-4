40|$|Purpose To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of near vision activities using additional portable electronic vision enhancement systems (p-EVES), to using optical magnifiers alone, by individuals with visual impairment. Methods A total of 100 experienced <b>optical</b> <b>aid</b> users were recruited from low vision clinics at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester, UK, to a prospective two-arm cross-over randomised controlled trial.

Results A total of 82 participants completed the study. Overall, maximum reading speed for high contrast sentences was not statistically significantly different for <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> and p-EVES, although the critical print size and threshold print size which could be accessed with p-EVES were statistically significantly smaller (p < 0. 001 in both cases).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{data on the}} {{pediatric}} population attending the Ophthalmologic Clinic's Low Vision Service at the São Paulo University Medical School. METHODS: Low vision ophthalmologic assessment, from April 1998 to December 2003, of 385 children and adolescents with mean age of 7 years; 51. 7 % males and 48. 3 % females. The main data analyzed were age, diagnosis, anatomic site of the ocular injury, visual acuity, and prescription of <b>optical</b> <b>aids.</b> RESULTS: 45. 4 % were below 6 years, and 54. 6 % were between 6 and 16 years. 35. 5 % experienced moderate visual impairment, 26 % had severe visual impairment, 8. 6 % had profound visual impairment, 10. 6 % were near blind, and 1. 6 % were blind. The main causes of visual impairment included congenital glaucoma (30. 6 %), macular retinochoroiditis due to congenital toxoplasmosis (16. 7 %), congenital cataract (12. 8 %), retinal and macular inherited disorders (11. 7 %), and optic atrophy (9. 8 %). Among school-age children, 52. 9 % received a prescription of <b>optical</b> <b>aids.</b> The most widely used <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> for distance were 2. 8 X 26 (34. 4 %); 4. 2 X 12 (30. 3 %); and 6 X 17 (26. 8 %) telescopic systems. The most frequently prescribed <b>optical</b> <b>aid</b> for near vision was the 2 x magnifying bar (33. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: There {{is a need for}} prevention of primary (congenital infections), secondary (congenital glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity), and tertiary (congenital cataract) visual impairment. The prescription of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> for school-age children will help them perform better at school and contribute to their social inclusion...|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} in Secret Knowledge, in January 1999 {{during a visit}} to the National Gallery, London, Hockney conceived of the idea that <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> were the key factor in the development of artistic realism. He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and became convinced that Ingres had used a camera lucida or similar device. From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> in earlier paintings, creating what he called the Great Wall in his studio by organizing images of great realistic art by time period. What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney-Falco thesis.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to evaluate treatments for homonymous visual field defects (HVFDs). We distinguish between three treatments: visual restoration training (VRT), <b>optical</b> <b>aids,</b> and compensatory training.

Compensatory approaches, which teach patients more effective ways of using their eyes, are currently the only form of treatment for which behavioral improvements have been demonstrated.
