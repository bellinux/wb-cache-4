40|$|Purpose To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of near vision activities using additional portable electronic vision enhancement systems (p-EVES), to using optical magnifiers alone, by individuals with visual impairment. Methods A total of 100 experienced <b>optical</b> <b>aid</b> users were recruited from low vision clinics at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester, UK, to a prospective two-arm cross-over randomised controlled trial.

Results A total of 82 participants completed the study. Overall, maximum reading speed for high contrast sentences was not statistically significantly different for <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> and p-EVES, although the critical print size and threshold print size which could be accessed with p-EVES were statistically significantly smaller (p < 0. 001 in both cases).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{data on the}} {{pediatric}} population attending the Ophthalmologic Clinic's Low Vision Service at the SÃ£o Paulo University Medical School. METHODS: Low vision ophthalmologic assessment, from April 1998 to December 2003, of 385 children and adolescents with mean age of 7 years; 51. 7 % males and 48. 3 % females. The main data analyzed were age, diagnosis, anatomic site of the ocular injury, visual acuity, and prescription of <b>optical</b> <b>aids.</b> RESULTS: 45. 4 % were below 6 years, and 54. 6 % were between 6 and 16 years. 35. 5 % experienced moderate visual impairment, 26 % had severe visual impairment, 8. 6 % had profound visual impairment, 10. 6 % were near blind, and 1. 6 % were blind. The main causes of visual impairment included congenital glaucoma (30. 6 %), macular retinochoroiditis due to congenital toxoplasmosis (16. 7 %), congenital cataract (12. 8 %), retinal and macular inherited disorders (11. 7 %), and optic atrophy (9. 8 %). Among school-age children, 52. 9 % received a prescription of <b>optical</b> <b>aids.</b> The most widely used <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> for distance were 2. 8 X 26 (34. 4 %); 4. 2 X 12 (30. 3 %); and 6 X 17 (26. 8 %) telescopic systems. The most frequently prescribed <b>optical</b> <b>aid</b> for near vision was the 2 x magnifying bar (33. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: There {{is a need for}} prevention of primary (congenital infections), secondary (congenital glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity), and tertiary (congenital cataract) visual impairment. The prescription of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> for school-age children will help them perform better at school and contribute to their social inclusion...|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} in Secret Knowledge, in January 1999 {{during a visit}} to the National Gallery, London, Hockney conceived of the idea that <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> were the key factor in the development of artistic realism. He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and became convinced that Ingres had used a camera lucida or similar device. From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of <b>optical</b> <b>aids</b> in earlier paintings, creating what he called the Great Wall in his studio by organizing images of great realistic art by time period. What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney-Falco thesis.|$|R

5000|$|The Hockney-Falco {{thesis is}} a {{controversial}} theory of art history, advanced by artist David Hockney and physicist Charles M.

In a 2001 book, Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters, Hockney analyzed the work of the Old Masters and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by [...] "eyeballing it".

Compensatory approaches, which teach patients more effective ways of using their eyes, are currently the only form of treatment for which behavioral improvements have been demonstrated.
