The association continued using the Greystone Cellars wine label. A year later, the Bisceglia brothers of San Jose purchased Greystone where they produced <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine</b> under the same label until 1930, and again beginning in October 1933. The Carpy family maintained part of the land, including a Victorian house nicknamed Albert's Villa south of the winery. The house burned down around 1929 and was replaced with a Spanish-style house that is now owned by the school.|$|E

25|$|From 1919 {{until the}} Repeal of Prohibition in 1933, many Italian-Americans {{struggled}} to keep their vineyards going. Many remained through providing <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine</b> to the Catholic Church or grape juice to the general market. These few holdouts can be credited with salvaging America’s viticulture heritage, {{in an industry that}} values the longevity and tradition of the vine and its produce.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture in Napa {{suffered}} several setbacks in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The Phylloxera louse killed many of the vines throughout the valley. Prohibition, enacted in 1920, caused many wineries to shut down. A few remained open with agreements to produce <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine.</b> Growers who elected to keep their vines planted sold their crops to home winemakers. The Great Depression slowed the wine business further. These events stalled {{the growth of the}} wine industry in Napa County, California for years.|$|E

For most of its history the region was known for its sweet fortified red wines made in a style similar to Port. In the 1960s, prior to winning DO status in 1976, the area began to shift its focus to dry white wines and the production of red <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine</b> used by the Christian Church for Communion.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide {{recognition}} seemed imminent until January 16, 1919 {{when the}} 18th Amendment {{ushered in the}} beginning of Prohibition. Vineyards were ordered to be uprooted and cellars were destroyed. Some vineyards and wineries were able to survive by converting to table grape or grape juice production. A few more were able to stay in operation in order to continue to provide churches <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine,</b> an allowed exception to the Prohibition laws. However, most went out of business. By the time that Prohibition was repealed in 1933, only 140 wineries were still in operation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{vineyard}} {{planted in}} the Okanagan was at the Oblate Mission in Kelowna in 1859, planted by French Catholic priest Charles Pandosy and was solely intended {{for the production of}} <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine</b> for the celebration of the Eucharist. Several small vineyards, planted mostly with Vitis labrusca sprang up until prohibition encouraged the uprooting and replanting with other agricultural crops. For most of the 20th century after prohibition, what limited wine production {{that took place in the}} Okanagan was mostly fruit wines made from berries, apples, cherries or even table grapes. One winery, Calona Wines founded in 1932, still remains from that period and was the first commercial winery in British Columbia and remains the oldest continuously running winery in the province. Eventually the use of French-American hybrid grapes, such as Marechal Foch and Vidal blanc took hold, led by the Stewarts of Quails' Gate Estate Winery.|$|E
25|$|Brother Timothy of Christian Brothers winery {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in establishing the}} modern wine industry in Napa. After an earlier career as a teacher, he transferred to the order's Mont La Salle located on Mount Veeder in the Mayacamas Mountains northwest of Napa in 1935 to become the wine chemist for the order's expanding wine operations. Christian Brothers had grown grapes and made <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine</b> in Benicia, California during Prohibition, but decided to branch out into commercial production of wine and brandy after the repeal of Prohibition. The science teacher was a fast learner and soon established Christian Brothers {{as one of the}} leading brands in the state's budding wine industry. Brother Timothy's smiling face in advertisements and promotional materials {{became one of the most}} familiar images for wine consumers across the country. Following the Second World War, the wine industry in Napa began to thrive again.|$|E
2500|$|Wine {{production}} in the Okanagan dates to the 1850s, {{with the establishment of}} Okanagan Mission and the planting of grapevines to supply <b>sacramental</b> <b>wines.</b> In the early 20th century, prohibition in Canada wiped out many of the Okanagan's earliest wineries and the commercial wine industry in the area was not revived until the 1930s. From this time through the mid-1970s, the Okanagan wine industry was based entirely on the production of fruit wines and those produced from hybrid grapes.|$|R

Before prohibition, it manufactured and sold champagne and other fine wines. Following prohibition, manufacturing was limited to <b>sacramental</b> <b>wines</b> and non-alcoholic beverages. Max's son Herbert M. Grifenhagen served as Vice President while his brother-in-law Jacob C. Rosenblum served as Secretary and Treasurer. Max served as President of the corporation until his death.

25|$|Prohibition {{developed}} as an unstoppable reform during the war, but Wilson played a minor role in its passage. A {{combination of the}} temperance movement, hatred of everything German (including beer and saloons), and activism by churches and women led to ratification of an amendment to achieve Prohibition in the United States. A Constitutional amendment passed both houses in December 1917 by 2/3 votes. By January 16, 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment had been ratified by 36 of the 48 states it needed. On October 28, 1919, Congress passed enabling legislation, the National Prohibition Act (informally known as the Volstead Act), to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment. Wilson felt Prohibition was unenforceable, but his veto of the Volstead Act was overridden by Congress. Prohibition began on January 16, 1920 (one year after ratification of the amendment); the manufacture, importation, sale, and transport of alcohol were prohibited, except for limited cases such as religious purposes (as with <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine).</b> But, the consumption of alcohol was never prohibited, and individuals could maintain a private stock that existed before Prohibition went into effect. Wilson moved his private supply of alcoholic beverages to the wine cellar of his Washington residence after his term of office ended.|$|E

5000|$|This view is {{sometimes}} erroneously identified as consubstantiation {{in that it}} asserts the simultaneous presence of four essences in the Eucharist: the consecrated bread, the body of Christ, the consecrated wine, and the blood of Christ; but it differs in {{that it does not}} assert a [...] "local" [...] (three-dimensional, circumscribed) presence of the body and blood in the <b>sacramental</b> bread and <b>wine</b> respectively, which is rejected as [...] "gross, carnal, and Capernaitic" [...] in the Formula of Concord.

2500|$|One of his responsa {{concerns}} {{the use of}} wine in the Jewish community during the Prohibition era. The Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on January 16, 1920, declared that [...] "the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within... the United States... for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited." [...] The subsequent Volstead Act defined [...] "intoxicating liquors" [...] and provided for several exceptions, one of which as for sacramental use. The Christian Church was able to successfully regulate the use of ceremonial wine. The clergy could easily monitor the nominal amount of <b>sacramental</b> <b>wine</b> that each worshipper drank, especially because it was usually drunk only in Church and only on Sundays (for the communion or Eucharist ceremony).|$|E
