5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may <b>splatter</b> on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD on July 22, 2003. The DVD includes bonus features including an audio commentary, six deleted scenes, three documentaries, two music videos, three trailers, interactive menus and subtitles. The audio commentary presents Ellis, Perry, Bress, and Gruber providing information about {{the making of the}} film and their intentions overall. Deleted scenes are a cross-examination with Isabella's husband Marcus Hudson (Roger Cross), a conversation between Eugene and Nora, a car chase concerning Kimberly's reckless driving, and Eugene's meeting with Death at the hospital, and extended versions of Kimberly's interrogation at the police station and the encounter with Bludworth. The first documentary labelled Bits & Pieces: Bringing Life To Death runs for 30 minutes and recalls the history of <b>splatter</b> film, on top of accounts in relation to the visual effects of the film. The second documentary entitled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back progresses for 18 minutes and brings out people recounting their own real-life experiences with death. The Terror Gauge, the third documentary, is a test screening system of the film in which viewers are subjected to biofeedback and neurological examination under neurophysiologist Dr. Victoria Ibric. Other featurettes of the DVD include the interactive game Choose Your Fate, the music videos of Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory and Seven Days a Week by The Sounds, the theatrical trailers of this film and its antecedent, in addition to informative trivias provided throughout the featurettes.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood <b>splatter</b> that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

The default input device of our system is a pressure-sensitive 2 D stylus, the most common sketching tool for digital artists, and we propose two interaction mode: ink-flicking mode and ink-dripping mode, {{that are designed to}} be analogous to the artistic techniques of ink <b>splattering</b> in real world. The core of our ink <b>splattering</b> system is a novel three-stage ink <b>splattering</b> framework that simulates the physics-based interaction of ink with different mediums including brush heads, air and paper. We have implemented the physical engine in CUDA and the whole simulation process runs at interactive speed...|$|R

25|$|Away {{from the}} mainstream, the <b>splatter</b> film {{director}} Jörg Buttgereit came to {{prominence in the}} 1980s. The development of arthouse cinemas (Programmkinos) from the 1970s onwards provided a venue for the works of less mainstream film-makers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Splatter</b> {{came into}} its own as a {{distinct}} subgenre of horror in the early 1960s with the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis in the United States. Eager to maintain a profitable niche, Lewis turned to something that mainstream cinema still rarely featured: scenes of visceral, explicit gore. In 1963, he directed Blood Feast, widely considered the first <b>splatter</b> film. In the 15 years following its release, Blood Feast took in an estimated $7 million. It was made for an estimated $24,500. Blood Feast was followed by two more gore films by Herschell Gordon Lewis, Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964) and Color Me Blood Red (1965).|$|E

25|$|The <b>splatter</b> {{film has}} its {{aesthetic}} roots in French Grand Guignol theatre, which endeavored to stage realistic scenes {{of blood and}} carnage for its patrons. In 1908, Grand Guignol made its first appearance in England, although the gore was downplayed {{in favor of a}} more Gothic tone, owing to the greater censorship of the arts in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Nader partook {{in these}} efforts from a dangerously close range, once having the brains and blood {{of one of}} his bodyguards <b>splatter</b> across his face as a {{cannonball}} fired from a Turkish gun decapitated him in a most grotesque manner. The Russians also sent some support in that they dispatched an engineer as well as a few siege guns although these did very little in progressing the battle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, {{the public was}} reintroduced to <b>splatter</b> themes and motifs by {{groundbreaking}} films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and the output of Hammer Film Productions (an artistic outgrowth of the English Grand Guignol style) such as The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and The Horror of Dracula (1958). Perhaps the most explicitly violent film of this era was Nobuo Nakagawa's Jigoku (1960), which included numerous scenes of flaying and dismemberment in its depiction of the Buddhist underworld Naraka.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to <b>splatter.</b> Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of squat toilets {{is that they}} are very easy to clean. They are also cheaper to make, they consume less water per flush than Western toilets, and, {{due to the lack of}} direct contact with the seat, some people claim that they are more hygienic. However, seat contact is not a real health risk and squat toilets allow <b>splatter</b> on one's own legs and feet. The waterless trough minimizes the risk of splash-back of water during defecation. However, because the products of excretion sit exposed to the open air until flushed away, they commonly produce much stronger odors than they would when submerged as in a Western toilet, an effect that is often quite noticeable in or anywhere near a Japanese restroom.|$|E

25|$|Every {{conceivable}} {{method of}} applying cutting fluid (e.g., flooding, spraying, dripping, misting, brushing) can be used, {{with the best}} choice depending on the application and the equipment available. For many metal cutting applications the ideal has long been high-pressure, high-volume pumping to force a stream of liquid (usually an oil-water emulsion) directly into the tool-chip interface, with walls around the machine to contain the <b>splatter</b> and a sump to catch, filter, and recirculate the fluid. This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive speeds and feeds, and constant, all-day cutting are not vital.|$|E
25|$|Masks On Even when a game isn't in progress, {{virtually}} all venues enforce a masks-on rule while players {{are within the}} playing area. More generally, within any given area of the park, either all players'/spectators'/officials' masks must be on, or all players' markers must either have a barrel block in place or be disconnected from their gas source, {{to ensure that a}} paintball cannot be fired from any nearby marker and cause eye injury. Some fields encourage players to aim away from opponents' heads during play if possible; <b>splatter</b> from mask hits can penetrate ventilation holes in the goggles and cause eye irritation, close-range hits to the mask can cause improperly maintained lenses to fail, and hits to unprotected areas of the face, head and neck are especially painful and can cause more serious injury.|$|E
25|$|On 22 October 1944 Bellamy's troop {{was part}} of a screen for {{infantry}} advancing near Doornhoek in the south of the Netherlands when it came under small arms, mortar and artillery fire. He engaged the enemy posts, eventually taking out three, and assisted the infantry in getting forward. Machine gun bullets struck his tank and caused molten lead to <b>splatter</b> in his face, and his tank entered a minefield and nearly ran over a mine. A jerry can of petrol spilt and set his bedding on fire, but he managed to get his burning tank and crew to safety. His beret was later found to have two bullet holes in it. For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross, which was personally presented to him by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in a ceremony on 5 March 1945.|$|E

25|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game. The {{player can}} perform several actions, {{including}} jump, sprint, crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights. When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will <b>splatter</b> their heads-up display (HUD), denoting {{that they have}} taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, then their health will recover. The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns {{at the beginning of}} each level, but may switch them out with another gun they find. Most guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat. In some levels, the player will be given special equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser designator.|$|E
25|$|From 1951 to 1953, most of {{her works}} are made from ripped {{drawings}} completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, {{the edges of the}} figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works. From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works. Some of the discarded works she used were <b>splatter</b> paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used Pollock's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage format. Others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between the two artists, which was lacking in their relationship by this time period, by combining their works together. By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either masonite, wood, or canvas. These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the Stable Gallery in 1955, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from Greenberg.|$|E
