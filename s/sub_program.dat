It was the first step in connecting real estate education and the industry itself. [...] By 1983, 61% of capital investments belonged to the real estate sector. The amount of money entering the communities for infrastructure expenses in the 1980s eclipsed the sum of all real estate investments from 1940 to 1979. [...] An up-to-date understanding of the industry along with the high-density population provided many with the opportunity to capitalise on realty sales. Areas like Lan Kwai Fong were improving at the time and became an [...] "alternative" [...] or [...] "open" [...] avenue to attract people who wanted things to be different.

As a result, African universities are hard-pressed to make appropriate decisions concerning the best allocation of scarce resources, which means that many of them are subscribing to databases that are inappropriate to their needs. These databases can be very expensive, taking the major share of a library's budget and leaving it little room to acquire other types of materials. Moreover, although database acquisition might be underwritten by donor funding at the outset, grants inevitably expire, leaving librarians with the dilemma of finding money to pay for subscription renewals - thus calling into question the long-term sustainability of CD-ROM utilization at their institutions. To meet these needs, the AAAS Sub-Saharan Africa Program decided to embark on an initiative to evaluate CD-ROM databases in the sciences and social sciences for their relevance to African teaching and research needs. The assessments were carried out in seven universities, two of which were in South Africa. An evaluation workshop was organized to assess the collected data.

40|$|The set {{covering}} problem (SCP), {{which has}} many practical applications, {{is one of}} the fundamental combinatorial problems. In this paper, a new neighborhood structure is proposed for solving this problem. In this structure, a linear programming (LP) model is generated by relaxing binary constraints, removing a selected column, and adding some inequalities. Then, a <b>sub</b> integer <b>programming</b> model, by joining the LP model solution and the incumbent solution, is created and its solution is considered as a neighbourhood solution. The neighbourhood structure can be implemented in various metaheuristics. This paper presents a matheuristic by combining a tabu search metaheuristic and the proposed neighbourhood structure. The matheuristic begins with an initial feasible solution. The initial solution is generated using a proposed heuristic method. The parameters of the matheuristic are tuned by a three-step method based on design of experiments. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, several standard test problems are used. The experimental results show the high performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, a mathematical model based on the SCP is used to formulate the train driver scheduling (TDS) in Iranian railways. The TDS is performed in two phases, i. e., duty generation to build all feasible duties, and duty optimization to assign the best possible duty to each train. The breadth-first algorithm is applied to make duties. The generated duty optimization problem has about one million duties. For solving this huge model, the proposed matheuristic is used.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} minimum weight design of space trusses under failure criteria, {{combining}} continuous and integer programming. The optimization of space truss is first performed {{by using a}} continuous optimization algorithm, the sequential linear programming (SLP). The linear <b>programming</b> <b>sub</b> problem is obtained by a linearization process of the original nonlinear problem, requiring the first order derivatives of both objective and constraint functions with respect to design variables. The linearization process and linear solution is repeated until convergence is achieved. However, in most practical problems, discrete values of the design variables are required, due to availability of standard member sizes and accuracy limitations in construction and manufacturing. Due to this limitation, this work uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the integer optimization problem by selection {{of a number of}} standard cross sections. The optimization results obtained from the first method (SLP) are the input data for the second stochastic global search method (GA). The constraints imposed to the optimization process are the member stresses, nodal displacements and minimum member size. The epsilon-relaxation technique is used to avoid the singular behavior of the stress constraint when the member areas goes to zero. The benchmark results shows competitive performance of the approach with respect to the literature...|$|R
