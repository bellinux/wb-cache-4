40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to determine the damage to samples of composite material when a current carrying wire is shorted {{to the surface of}} the composite material, and to determine whether enough current can flow through the material to blow a fuse before damage can occur. Fault current tests {{were performed}} on samples of graphite epoxy materials. Samples consisted of six layers of IM 7 graphite fiber mat in Hercules 8552 epoxy resin. A variable power supply provided up to 35 amps of current. The high voltage side of the power supply was attached to a wire at the end of a hinged arm, and the low side was attached to the edge of the sample. To test joints, the return was connected to the edge of one sample, and the high side was shorted to the top of the other sample. Tests show that when current exceeds approximately 5 amps, the graphite glows, and the epoxy melts out at the <b>shorted</b> <b>contact.</b> At higher current levels the epoxy burns. At voltages above 15 volts the epoxy outer coat is easily broken, and fire, flame, and a rise in current occur suddenly. When joints are introduced, resistance is increased, and the maximum current resulting from a short circuit to the graphite epoxy is reduced. This condition can easily result in fault current lower than the circuit breaker limit and higher than the 5 amp ignition level. The shorting contact and the joint become hot spots with melting epoxy, smoke, and fire...|$|E

However, well-conducted clinical trials on the {{efficacy of}} dithranol are not available, making comparison between these time-honoured treatments with currently available therapies impossible. We studied the effectiveness of dithranol in a care instruction programme using short time exposures (<b>short</b> <b>contact</b> treatment), UVB-phototherapy and dithranol treatment in an inpatient setting. In an open randomised study we included 250 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. The intention to treat group existed of 238 patients. 100 patients were treated with <b>short</b> <b>contact</b> dithranol, 78 Patients were treated with UVB and 60 patients underwent inpatient dithranol treatment.

Finally, a study of the structures of alkali metal hydrated and THF-solvated BArF salts showed that the interactions between the metal centre and the surrounding atoms depend not only on the size of the alkali metal centre but also on the occupancy of the first coordination sphere...|$|R
