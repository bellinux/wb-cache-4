5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> <b>Sulfur</b> <b>dioxide</b> frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E

Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with <b>sulfur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapour, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid.|$|E

40|$|In 1975 the United States Environmental Protection Agency {{initiated}} {{an historic}} process of regulatory reform, {{now known as}} the Emissions Trading Program. For nonuniformly-mixed pollutants, such as <b>sulfur</b> <b>dioxides,</b> air quality is a function not only of the level of emissions, but their location and stack heights as well. The focus of this paper is how to protect local air quality and limit long-range pollutant deposition caused by emission trades, while allowing as much cost-reducing trading activity as possible. The authors examine the implications of two trading rules in two different airsheds using programming simulation models. They find that the use of either trading rule represents a substantial improvement over relying exclusively on the current allocation of control responsibility. ...|$|R

In the middle of 1953, Amdur and her husband developed a method of spraying a combination mist of sulfuric acid and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dioxide</b> into humid chambers containing guinea pigs {{to investigate}} the damage that it would cause to their lungs.

High concentrations of sea salts and methanesulfonate were found under warm and humid storm conditions, whereas non sea salt (nss) -SO_ 4 ^ and SO_ 2 showed high concentrations in cold and dry Arctic air masses. Variation of nss-SO_ 4 ^ concentrations in mid-December coincided with the variation of SO_ 2 concentration, but the increase of nss-SO_ 4 ^ concentration in early-February lagged behind increase of SO_ 2 concentration.

40|$|This {{project has}} three major aspects: {{considerations}} of biodiesel production methods, characterization of fuel performance, {{and testing of}} fuel emissions. These samples were characterized in terms of percent yield, density, and viscosity. Based on a literary review, stir setting and temperature were selected as parameters effecting the transesterification reaction and the percent yield of the process. The canola biodiesel, soy biodiesel and petroleum diesel were characterized using the diesel test stand. Torque and fuel consumption were compared for these fuels. When the speeds were not significantly different, the power and specific fuel consumption were compared as well. The emissions testing for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and <b>sulfur</b> <b>dioxides</b> was performed in order to evaluate the exhaust for these different fuels...|$|R

Carrying out estimations on an unbalanced panel of 1463 observations over the period 1995 - 1999, {{we find that the}} abatement marginal cost for <b>sulfur</b> <b>dioxides</b> exceeds several times the French current tax rate. This suggests that, for this pollutant, the level of emissions is currently much more determined by the performance standards than by the tax.

Some studies in the EKC literature have examined {{the extent to which}} democratic nations are more or less apt to have improving environmental conditions, but they have drawn from static measures of a nation’s current regime.

Most of object in the suburban are characterized by absence on any thermal insulation. It is mostly about two-sided plastered objects but not rarely there are uncompleted building (ground floor is used for living but attic is not plastered and without windows and doors). Those objects, due to high thermal conduction coefficients, require great quantity energy for heating. Heat energy sources are stoves and boilers, which are feed with brown coal and biomass.
