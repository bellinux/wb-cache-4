5|$|Aristo {{was born}} in Jakarta in 1976. As a child, he became {{interested}} in film {{when he and his}} family went to the movie theatre together; in an interview with Tabloid Nova, he recalled that one of the first films he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> comedy starring Warkop. After beginning junior high school in 1988, he began to go to the theatres to watch films on his own. Despite his enjoyment of film, he was initially active in an indie band.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting what he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lack of drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger {{by allowing the}} latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> part of Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea was rough, {{and one of the}} ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{multi-wire}} <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{cutting machine}} designed to slice hard materials. This device {{is especially important}} in the solar cell industry. Over 80% of the world's solar cell production requires the cutting of silicon ingots into wafers. As <b>a</b> result, multi-wire <b>sawing</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important process in the photovoltaic and microelectronics industries.|$|R

25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one moment and then told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E
500|$|Taliaferro {{suggests}} that [...] "if Hay put any... indelible stamp on history, {{perhaps it was}} that he demonstrated how the United States ought to comport itself. [...] He, not Roosevelt, was the adult in charge when the nation and the State Department attained global maturity." [...] He quotes John St. Loe Strachey, [...] "All that the world <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great gentleman and a great statesman doing his work for the State and for the President with perfect taste, perfect good sense, and perfect good humour".|$|E
500|$|The {{leader of}} the mutineers was by now suspicious. The {{orientation}} of the sunrise, and birds the Malagasy had seen, did not match those of his homeland, which he pointed out to Leij, who spoke enough of the Malagasy language {{to tell him that}} the land they <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> different part of Madagascar. They dropped anchor when the ship was [...] "a mile [...] offshore", and the mutiny's leader, with more than fifty perhaps as many as seventy other Malagasy men and women set off for the shore in the ship's longboat and pinnace. They had promised their fellow Malagasy that they would light signal fires on the beach and send the boats back if it was safe for them to follow.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> modern bow <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> metal-framed {{crosscut}} <b>saw</b> in {{the shape}} of a bow with a coarse wide blade. This type of <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> also known as a Swede saw, Finn saw or buck <b>saw.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rough tool that can be used for cross-cutting branches or firewood (maybe up to 6 inches in diameter) down to size.|$|R
50|$|A {{piercing}} saw, {{also known}} as <b>a</b> jeweler's <b>saw,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type of <b>saw</b> commonly used in jewelry making on sheet metal. It is usually used on softer metals as the <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> delicate.|$|R

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and all I <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of people who couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E
500|$|Malachy later {{witnessed}} Mercedes and Calvin kissing {{but did not}} interrupt them. Wallace {{felt this}} was because he truly loved Mercedes and had accepted that [...] "his life is much better with Mercedes in it". Whittle explained that Malachy tested Mercedes and Calvin {{because he wanted to}} discover if [...] "what he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> one-off or more serious". The pair failed the test and Mercedes, fearing that Malachy knew the truth, told Calvin that they had to end their affair, [...] "but they simply can't stay away from each other". He added that the relationship could become more serious for Calvin as [...] "he's in danger of really falling for her". Mercedes began to develop feelings for Calvin who did not expect Mercedes to develop [...] "such deep feelings" [...] for him. When Calvin rejected Mercedes she informed Calvin's sister Sasha Valentine (Nathalie Emmanuel) that Calvin left Sasha's then boyfriend Warren to die in a fire; Sasha responded to the revelation by throwing Calvin out of their home. Not being able to [...] "get past what happened with Warren", Calvin and Carmel decide to end their relationship. Calvin confronted Mercedes, who [...] "tells him that he's ruined her life and warns that she's going to do the same to him".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively in The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "Apparently someone {{connected with the}} Thanhouser Company has learned something of ward politics, and the methods of controlling a convention are very clearly and bluntly stated. It isn't always possible to expose plots {{such as this one}} was exposed, {{but it would have been}} a good thing if it could be done.... The situations are dramatically worked out and the interest never flags from the beginning to the end. A love story adds a certain degree of interest to the picture, and the development of the plot is strengthened by the young people's lovemaking." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed with the plausibility of the depicted political manipulation, but found the picture to be interesting and the acting to be adequate. Later publications would also reference the film for its content, like The Columbia Companion to American History on Film which cites it as an example of a political machine based on graft and deceit. Neither graft nor deceit is actually in play with the production, for pure bribery is the method upon which the politician uses to gain political power. Kay Sloan, author of The Loud Silents: Origins of the Social Problem Film, states that the film explored the problem of political corruption and critics approved because they <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> realistic portrayal. Another release dealing with political corruption was The Girl Reporter, released by Thanhouser on August 16, 1910.|$|E

2500|$|What his {{students}} <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long cylinder filled with mercury, {{immersed in a}} vessel also filled with mercury. [...] When ammonia was generated through a glass delivery tube, the mercury in the beaker came down into the container vessel. [...] That was when Garner applied the touch of drama. [...] When he placed a stick of activated charcoal into the vessel the tube of the mercury again shot {{to the top of}} the cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|Stanwyck {{became a}} Broadway star soon afterward, {{when she was}} cast in her first leading role in Burlesque (1927). She {{received}} rave reviews, {{and it was a}} huge hit. Film actor Pat O'Brien would later say on a talk show in the 1960s, [...] "The greatest Broadway show I ever <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> play in the 1920s called 'Burlesque'."

2500|$|... "The Sermon on the Mount I <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> code {{of social}} duties, so to speak, a {{revelation of the}} {{fundamental}} principles of Social Justice and human fellow ship for this our everyday world. Such a passage as that beginning with the phrase, 'No man can serve two masters,' {{is nothing short of}} a brief but comprehensive Social Program. It is almost impossible to find in the whole Sermon on the Mount anything that could give an ecclesiastical or theological colour to these sayings. They are ethical, moral, social.|$|E
2500|$|... 1948 <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{turnaround}} {{point for}} the zoo, with new capital works being approved. In Sawer's March 1949 report, {{the details of the}} animals were given as 165 mammals in 51 species, 329 birds in 98 species and 19 reptiles in 8 species. An aquarium was built, on a smaller scale than Sawer had anticipated, but successful nevertheless. The zoo had also finally won the right to exhibit kiwis, partly due to New Zealand soldiers becoming known as Kiwis during the war. A curator's house, offices and laboratory were constructed in 1949.|$|E
2500|$|What he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> city under siege: [...] "'Lurid flames roared and belched {{and licked}} their forked tongues into the air.

[...] Making his way outside, Franklin found the source of the strange sound that had {{peppered}} his building. [...] "'The side-walks were literally covered with burning turpentine balls. I knew all too well where they came from, and I knew all too well why every burning building first caught fire from the top.'" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> ring <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> form of bandsaw {{where the}} band is rigid, rather than flexible. This {{requires}} the band to be circular, rather than the bandsaw's usual oblong of straight runs between two (or three) guide wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{change for the}} 1973 model <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new front fascia, {{required}} to meet new federal regulations. The new regulation mandated that all cars manufactured after September 1, 1972 {{must be able to}} take a [...] strike to the front without damaging safety related components such as headlamps and the fuel system. For 1973 only, rear bumpers had a [...] requirement. The Torino's front end featured totally new sheetmetal from the firewall forward, with a blunt, more squared-off fascia replacing the previous year's pointed prow. The new large square [...] energy absorbing bumper replaced the almost body-fitting chrome bumper used {{on the front of the}} 1972 Torino. The new larger bumpers caused all Torino models to increase in length by at least 1", and weight also increased by at least [...] for all models. [...] Rear bumpers and taillights were unchanged from 1972, but used new brackets that increased the space between the bumper and the sheetmetal.|$|E
2500|$|Three Sisters on Hope Street {{opened at}} the Everyman in Liverpool on 25 January before {{beginning}} a second run at Hampstead Theatre in London. The play received [...] "rave reviews", being described as [...] "an inventive reimagining" [...] and [...] "a bold, fresh and fruitful reinterpretation", showcasing [...] "lively and intelligent" [...] writing. Philip Key in the Liverpool Daily Post praised the adaptation as successfully capturing the sensibility of Liverpool, enabling the story to [...] "be familiar to both theatre-goers and many Liverpudlians." [...] Peter Fisher of The British Theatre Guide was even more ecstatic, describing the production as a [...] "superb project" [...] and a [...] "superb evening's entertainment". However, other reviewers were more ambiguous, with Michael Coveney branding the play a [...] "clever re-write" [...] but poorly served by the actors involved. Similarly, The Guardian Arts editor felt the piece to be [...] "a surprisingly faithful transposition", which [...] "ingeniously" [...] solves {{some of the problems}} inherent in relocating the original, but objected to what he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dependence on authorial cleverness in finding post-war parallels to their source".|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{used the}} full hour of his TV show on August 30 {{to talk about the}} rally. He said the crowd [...] "was polite. It was calm. It was friendly. It was welcoming. It was helpful," [...] and noted that zero arrests were made [...] "in a crowd this size." [...] In summing up the event, Beck {{declared}} that [...] "What you <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 500,000 people who never claimed that God was on their side. They wanted to change their lives so they could be on God's side." [...] Moreover, he said in preparing for the rally he tried for a year to get a military flyover or someone in a military uniform to present the flag and could not; at 9:59 am, one minute before the rally's scheduled start time, a flock of geese flew directly over the rally. Beck called it a miracle. He also said he received a call from the Smithsonian saying they wanted [...] "items from the event preserved for the Smithsonian." [...] During his recap broadcast, Beck also displayed a photograph of Sarah Palin at the rally, capturing her praying [...] "for a full 10 minutes", remarking that it was [...] "the most beautiful picture of Sarah Palin ever taken." ...|$|E
