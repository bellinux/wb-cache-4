However, a horizontal well requires a substantial engineering work compared to conventional directional drilling. Significant advances in drilling technology {{have made it possible}} to drill horizontally in almost any situation by using very specialized tools. But some inherent weaknesses to this technique still exist, like casing design. Most of the reported horizontal wells are completed with open hole or slotted linear. This type of completion is simple and inexpensive, but may not furnish enough support to the walls of the well to allow for long well life. This paper discusses casing design considerations for horizontal wells. It addresses the type and nature of loads applied on casing strings set in horizontal wells; examples of these loads are torque and drag, formation <b>subsidence,</b> <b>effect</b> of perforations, and bending loads. A design method for casing string under loads that prevail in horizontal wells is also included.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a climatology and trends of tropospheric ozone {{in the southwestern}} part of Indian Ocean (Reunion Island) and South Africa (Irene and Johannesburg). This study {{is based on a}} multi-instrumental dataset: PTU-O 3 radiosoundings, DIAL LIDAR, MOZAIC airborne instrumentation and Dasibi UV ground based measurements. The seasonal profiles of tropospheric ozone at Reunion Island have been calculated from two different data sets: radiosondes and LIDAR. The two climatological profiles are similar, except in austral summer when smaller values for the LIDAR profiles in the free troposphere, and in the upper troposphere for all seasons occur. These results show that the LIDAR profiles are at times not representative of the true ozone climatological value as measurements can be taken only under clear sky conditions, and the upper limit reached depends on the signal. In the lower troposphere, climatological ozone values from radiosondes have been compared to a one year campaign of ground based measurements from a Dasibi instrument located at high altitude site (2150 m) at Reunion Island. The seasonal cycle is comparable for the two datasets, with Dasibi UV values displaying slightly higher values. This suggests that if local dynamical and possibly physico-chemical effects may influence the ozone level, the seasonal cycle can be followed with ground level measurements. Average ground level concentrations measured on the summits of the island seem to be representative of the lower free troposphere ozone concentration at the same altitude (~ 2000 m) whereas night time data would be representative of tropospheric concentration at a higher altitude (~ 3000 m) due to the <b>subsidence</b> <b>effect.</b> Finally, linear trends have been calculated from radiosondes data at Reunion and Irene. Considering the whole tropospheric column, the trend is slightly positive for Reunion, and more clearly positive for Irene. Trend calculations have also been made separating the troposphere into three layers, and separating the dataset into seasons. Results shows that the positive trend for Irene is governed by the lower layer most probably by industrial pollution and biomass burning. On the contrary, for Reunion Island, the strongest trends are observed in the upper troposphere, and in winter when stratospheric-tropospheric exchange is more frequently expected...|$|E

A general discussion on geothermal systems, pollution potential, chemical characteristics of geothermal fluids and environmental effects of geothermal water pollutants is presented as background material. For the Imperial Valley, all publicly available water quality and location data for geothermal and nongeothermal wells in and near the East Mesa, Salton Sea, Heber, Brawley, Dunes and Glamis KGRAs have been compiled and plotted. The geothermal fluids which will be reinjected range in salinity from a few thousand {{to more than a}} quarter million ppm. Although Imperial Valley is a major agricultural center, groundwater use in and near most of these KGRAs is minimal. Extensive seismicity and subsidence monitoring networks have been established in this area of high natural seismicity and subsidence. The vapor-dominated Geysers geothermal field is the largest electricity producer in the world. Groundwater in this mountainous region flows with poor hydraulic continuity in fractured rock. Ground and surface water quality is generally good, but high boron concentrations in hot springs and geothermal effluents is of significant concern; however, spent condensate is reinjected. High microearthquake activity is noted around the geothermal reservoir and potential <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> are considered minimal.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{generally}} accepted that reinjection {{will be necessary}} for optimizing the exploitation of a geothermal field. Not only does this afford a way {{to solve the problem}} of disposal of cooled geothermal brine, but it also serves the purpose of maintaining reservoir pressure, thus reducing possible <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects,</b> and sustaining production flow rates. In addition, reinjection enhances thermal energy extraction from the reservoir rocks. However, reinjection creates a zone of relatively cold water around each injection well that will grow with time and eventually reach the production wells. When the cold water appears ('breaks through') in the producing wells, the efficiency of the operation may be drastically reduced. It is therefore important to design the system of injection wells to prevent cold water breakthrough before a specified time. For a given production field, it is essential that both the location and flow rates of the injection wells be optimized. In the present paper the results of an initial study of possible reinjection patterns for the Cerro Prieto geothermal field, Baja California, Mexico are discussed. First, the numerical model and assumptions made are described, then the various cases we studied are presented.

An interesting example is presented in this investigation, where three-dimensional Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT- 3 D) is applied employing alternative arrays that allow investigating the subsoil beneath the affected constructions. A small neighborhood comprised by a block of houses within the town of San Antonio Tecómitl is studied. The area is found towards {{the outskirts of the}} Chichinautzin range, in the southern limit of the Mexican Basin. This settlement suffers of strong damage in their structures due to fractures and subsidence within the subsoil. ERT- 3 D was carried out to characterize the subsoil beneath this urban complex. A special resistivity array (‘horse-shoe’ geometry) employing a combination of ‘L’, equatorial-dipole and minimum-coupling methods was carried out to fully ‘illuminate’ the subsoil beneath the block of houses. Computed resistivity models depicted a high resistivity pattern that coincides with the affected houses. Such pattern seems to extend beyond the limits of the surveyed areas, and is probably part of a more complex fracture system. It is very likely that fractures have been produced due to the poorly consolidated soil, which is part of a transition zone; the intense water extraction, that form ‘voids’ in the subsoil causing <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> and finally the existence of regional faults to greater extent that might control these shallow features...|$|R

This paper presents an analysis and interpretation of the multi-seam subsidence monitoring data from the first five panels in the second seam at the Ashton Underground Mine.

In an offset geometry, tilt and strain levels are observed to remain at single seam levels despite the greater vertical displacement. At stacked goaf edges tilt and strain levels are up to four times greater. Latent subsidence recovered from the overlying seam has been identified as a key contributor to the subsidence outcomes.

40|$|Abstract: Faults {{located in}} areas {{undergoing}} mining subsidence during the longwall extraction of coal seams may undergo reactivation. This {{has been observed}} and documented throughout the UK (and in other major coalfields around the world) over the past 150 years. The impact of subsidence induced fault reactivation may cause moderate to severe damage to foundations, houses, buildings, structures and underground services, as well as damage to agricultural land through disruption of drainage and alteration of the gradient. Monitoring of faults, as they are affected by undermining, {{has resulted in a}} better understanding of fault reactivation mechanisms and of the various styles of fault reactivation, in different geological and mining settings. The duration of fault reaction is difficult to determine {{due to the lack of}} observational data. However, trough subsidence following longwall extraction of coal is rapid, often being completed within weeks to months. This is commonly followed, shortly afterwards, by a period of delayed subsidence known as residual subsidence, which in the British Coal Measures, rarely accounts for more than 10 % of the total subsidence. In many circumstances, where faults are not present, residual subsidence is complete within four months, although several cases have been recorded where <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> were still being observed more than two years after mining had finished. Generally, it is accepted that fault reactivation sometimes may extend over the period of residual subsidence. In parts of the abandoned or partially active coalfields in the UK, relatively smaller ground movements have been observed in the vicinity of fault outcrops many years after mining has ceased. The reasons for this are not fully understood. Nonetheless, prolonged periods of fault reactivation may have an important effect on land use and construction...|$|R

The issues relating to time-lapse analysis using two such distinctly different data sets are addressed to provide an optimal cross-matching workflow that includes 3 D warping. Additionally {{an assessment of the}} differences between the imaging using single-azimuth streamer and multi-azimuth ocean-bottom-cable data is provided. The 3 D warping utilized in the cross-matching procedure is sensitive to acquisition and processing differences but is also found to provide valuable insight into the geometrical changes that occur in the subsurface due to production. As such, this work also provides a demonstration of the use of high-resolution 3 D interpreted warping to resolve the 3 D heterogeneity of the compaction and subsidence. This is an important tool for Valhall, and possibly other fields, where compaction and subsidence (and monitoring thereof) are key factors in the reservoir management since the predominant observed production-induced changes are compaction of the soft, high-porosity chalk reservoir, due to pore-pressure reduction, and the resultant overburden subsidence. Such reservoir compaction could have significant implications for production by changing permeabilities and production rates. Furthermore the <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> could impact upon subsea installations and well-bore stability. Geomechanical studies that have previously been used to model such subsidence and compaction are only constrained by observed surface displacements and measured reservoir pressure changes, with the geological overburden being largely neglected.

In such cases, separated longwall panel layout should be applied, i.e., panel width should be subcritical and stable coal pillars should be left between the adjacent panels.

The {{objective of}} Phase 1 {{is to develop}} the technology for power generation from high-temperature, high-salinity geothermal brines existing in the Salton Sea known geothermal resources area. Phase 1 work {{will result in the}} following: (a) Completion of a preliminary design and cost estimate for a pilot geothermal brine utilization facility. (b) Design and construction of an Area Resource Test Facility (ARTF) in which developmental geothermal utilization concepts can be tested and evaluated. Program efforts will be divided into four sub-programs; Power Generation, Mineral Extraction, Reservoir Production, and the Area Resources Test Facility. The Power Generation Subprogram will include testing of scale and corrosion control methods, and critical power cycle components; power cycle selection based on an optimization of technical, environmental and economic analyses of candidate cycles; preliminary design of a pilot geothermal-electric generating station to be constructed in Phase 2 of this program. The Mineral Extraction Subprogram will involve the following: selection of an optimum mineral recovery process; recommendation of a brine clean-up process for well injection enhancement; engineering, construction and operation of mineral recovery and brine clean-up facilities; analysis of facility operating results from environmental, economical and technical point-of-view; preliminary design of mineral recovery and brine clean-up facilities of sufficient size to match the planned pilot power plant. The Reservoir Production Subprogram will include monitoring the operation and maintenance of brine production, handling and injection systems which were built with private funding in phase 0, and monitoring of the brine characteristics and potential <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> during well production and injection. Based on the above, recommendations and specifications will be prepared for production and injection systems necessary to serve the pilot power and mineral recovery plants planned for Phase 3. The scope of the Area Resource Test Facility Subprogram will include evaluation, costing, design, construction and operation of an ARTF that can serve as a field facility for testing and evaluating high temperature, high salinity geothermal brine utilization components and systems being developed by various organizations and laboratories in the United States.

40|$|The Lake-Induced Convection Experiment has {{provided}} special field data during a westerly flow cold air outbreak on 13 January 1998, which has afforded {{the opportunity to}} examine an evolving convective boundary layer in unprecedented detail. Vertical cross-sections prepared from these data, extending from upstream over Wisconsin across Lake Michigan, show the modifying effects of land-water contrast on boundary layer mixing, entrainment, heating and moisture flux. Through this analysis, an unusually interesting case of lake-effect air mass modification was discovered. The data show distinctly different heights in vertical mixing of heat and moisture, as well as off-shore downwelling and <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> in the atmosphere. Analysis shows evidence of a new observational feature, the moisture internal boundary layer (MIBL) that accords well with the often recognized thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL). The “interfacial” layer over the lake is also found to be unusually thick and moist, {{due in part to}} the upstream conditions over Wisconsin, as well as the effectiveness of vertical mixing of moist plumes over the lake (also seen in the turbulence statistics). This suggests that the atmosphere can be more effective in the vertical mixing of moisture than heat. ^ Four scales of coherent structures (CSs) with differing spatial and temporal dimensions have been identified. The CSs grow in a building block fashion with buoyancy as the dominating physical mechanism for organizing the convection (even in the presence of shear). Characteristic turbulence statistics show evidence of these multiple scales of CSs, ranging from the smallest (microscale) in the cloud free path region near the Wisconsin shore, to the largest (mesoscale) in the snow-filled boundary layer near the Michigan shore. ^ A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model has been deployed to study the effects of buoyancy and shear on the convective structures in lake-effect boundary layers. The model simulations have been divided into a two-part study: (1) the general relationship of surface heat flux versus wind shear to study the convective geometry, and (2) specific simulations of convection analogous to what is seen in the CFP region for the 13 January 1998 event. Model simulations will also address the existence of multiple scales of CSs. ...|$|R
40|$|Extracting coal from {{underground}} mineworkings {{causes the}} overlying rocks to subside with associated {{changes in the}} stress regime. The aim of {{the study reported here}} was to apply the surface seismic reflection method to study the <b>effect</b> of <b>subsidence</b> on seismic velocity. Two sets of time-lapse surveys were carried out over two longwall mining panels in the Selby Coalfield. Seismic lines were profiled parallel and perpendicular to adjacent panels H 45 and H 46, respectively. A total of twenty-one repeated surveys were carried out along the two lines over a period of three years. The effect monitored was due to mining in the Bamsley Seam, at 550 m depth. As mining progressed, the traveltime of a strong reflection event from an anhydrite bed at 150 m depth was measured after processing the data with standard techniques. An overall increase in traveltime of about 4 % was observed. The progressive increase in traveltime over panel H 45 correlated well with empirical calculations of differential subsidence between the surface and the anhydrite. However, the magnitude of the change must principally be accounted for by a decrease in seismic velocity, associated with a reduction in the vertical effective stress. Although the traveltime over panel H 46 was also found to increase, and to correlate quite well with die expected differential subsidence, the agreement was less good along this transverse profile. This is attributed to asymmetric <b>subsidence</b> <b>effects</b> because the ground on the SW side of the panel had already been worked by panel H 45, but the ground on the NE side was unworked. At the time of each seismic survey across panel H 46, the profile was also levelled, and it was found that surface subsidence values along the profile increased towards panel H 45. As most of the subsidence caused by mining panel H 45 would have been completed by the time the H 46 profile was surveyed, the effect must be at least partly attributed to asymmetric subsidence due to panel H 46. Where the ground had been weakened by subsidence due to mining H 45, near-total subsidence from mining H 46 took place rapidly; but in the previously unworked ground on the NE side of panel H 46, the residual subsidence was presumably delayed by competent strata in the overburden. Further work is needed to confirm whether this explanation is correct...|$|R
