25|$|When battle came, {{the fort}} was outdated, inadequately armed, poorly supplied, and {{intended}} {{for a different}} form of combat than that it faced. These deficiencies are adequate {{to explain why the}} fort succumbed <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> at the first blow.|$|E

50|$|High distinctiveness: The geons differ qualitatively, {{with only}} two or three levels of an attributes, such as {{straight}} vs. curved, parallel vs. non parallel, positive vs. negative curvature. These qualitative differences can be readily distinguished thus rendering the geons readily distinguishable and the objects <b>so</b> composed, <b>readily</b> distinguishable.|$|R
25|$|As {{the result}} of {{numerous}} complaints concerning venality and partiality, Viceroy Carrillo de Mendoza began {{an investigation of the}} archbishop of Mexico, Juan Pérez de la Serna. The viceroy instructed the archbishop not to grant divorces <b>so</b> <b>readily,</b> not to accept gifts, and not to charge high prices in the butcher shop the archbishop owned.|$|E
25|$|The {{associations}} between Cleopatra {{and a black}} Africa were so profound that… any depiction of the ancient Egyptian queen {{had to contend with}} the issue of her race and the potential expectation of her blackness. Lewis’ white queen gained the aura of historical accuracy through primary research without sacrificing its symbolic links to abolitionism, black Africa, or black diaspora. But what it refused to facilitate was the racial objectification of the artist’s body. Lewis could not <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> become the subject of her own representation if her subject was corporeally white.|$|E
25|$|The Betrayer – A Nazgûl who was cursed {{long ago}} for {{yielding}} the Southlands to Sauron's rule, the Betrayer {{is driven by}} malice and self-hatred that knows no bounds. Of all the Nazgûl, the Betrayer is amongst the lowest of Sauron's lieutenants, for even the Dark Lord is leery of placing faith in one who betrayed his kin <b>so</b> <b>readily.</b> The Betrayer is another addition to the nine Ringwraiths by Games Workshop, depicted wearing Haradrim armor and a turban around his hood, although his weapon is a western longsword, instead of a Southron's weapon.|$|E
60|$|He {{satisfied}} {{us there}} was no danger of that kind {{in the way that}} we were to go: <b>so</b> we <b>readily</b> agreed to follow him; as did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.|$|R
50|$|A minor {{annoyance}} {{with the}} camera is that the cover caps for the remote-control socket and PC Sync sockets are not tethered to the body, and so are very easy to lose or misplace in use. Fortunately, these caps are common to many Nikon models (F100, D2, etc.) and <b>so</b> are <b>readily</b> and cheaply available.|$|R
5000|$|From this period, {{words like}} barbarophonos, cited above from Homer, came into use {{not only for}} the sound of a foreign {{language}} but also for foreigners who spoke Greek improperly. In the Greek language, the word logos expressed both the notions of [...] "language" [...] and [...] "reason", <b>so</b> Greek-speakers <b>readily</b> conflated speaking poorly with stupidity.|$|R
25|$|Founded by the Dane Halfdan Ragnarsson in 875, ruled for {{the great}} part by Danish kings, and {{populated}} by the families and subsequent descendants of Danish Vikings, {{the leadership of the}} kingdom nonetheless passed into Norwegian hands during its twilight years. Eric Bloodaxe, an ex-king of Norway who was the last independent Viking king of Jórvík, is a particularly noted figure in history, and his bloodthirsty approach towards leadership may have been at least partly responsible for convincing the Danish inhabitants of the region to accept English sovereignty <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> in the years that followed.|$|E
25|$|Following its publication, {{there was}} {{increasing}} support for {{ideas of the}} coexistence of God and Nature, with the deity setting Natural Laws rather than continually intervening with miracles. It is perhaps {{for this reason that}} Origin of Species was accepted <b>so</b> <b>readily,</b> upon its eventual publication. On the other hand, the knowledge of the scandal and experience of the reaction of his scientist friends confirmed Darwin's reluctance to publish his own ideas until he had well researched answers to all possible objections (though, in the end, Darwin had to publish earlier than he had wanted to anyway).|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E
50|$|As a {{resident}} of Indonesia for 17 years and more recently of Bali, Magson witnessed the devastation and social upheaval which affected the people of Bali after the bombing and <b>so</b> he <b>readily</b> accepted the role of chairman of YKIP (Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi, or the Humanitarian Foundation for Mother Earth), which was established to help the needy in Bali through health and education programs.|$|R

30|$|Raspberry fruits {{are formed}} from an {{aggregation}} of multiple fertilized ovaries {{each of which}} {{are referred to as}} drupelets as they become fleshy. In the condition known as crumbly fruit, which has been linked with pollen abortion and embryo sac degeneration, drupelets are generally reduced in number but greatly enlarged or, in the case of small reductions, cohere imperfectly <b>so</b> fruit <b>readily</b> crumbles when picked (Daubeny et al. 1967; Jennings 1988).|$|R
500|$|In Japan, Masaaki Hirakata, {{curator at}} the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography noted that [...] "‘Thunderbirds’ was like a modern sci-fi {{expression}} of bunraku, which probably explains why it was accepted <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> here,” during a 2001 exhibit devoted to the programme.|$|E
500|$|... "Because Whitehead's {{holistic}} metaphysics {{of value}} lends itself <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> to an ecological point of view, many see {{his work as}} a promising alternative to the traditional mechanistic worldview, providing a detailed metaphysical picture of a world constituted by a web of interdependent relations." ...|$|E
500|$|Scenes from White Zombie have {{appeared}} in other films including Curtis Hanson's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Michael Almereyda's Nadja, and Tim Burton's Ed Wood. The heavy metal band White Zombie appropriated their name from the film. The group's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film, [...] " [...] a great film that {{not a lot of}} people know about...It amazes me that a film that is <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> available can be so lost." [...] In 1997, the Janus company released a model kit based on the Murder Legendre character.|$|E

60|$|Indeed papa {{suspected}} both {{entrances to}} exist, as by them, {{in case of}} necessity, provisions could be <b>so</b> much more <b>readily</b> and secretly supplied, and escape made in some disguise from the one exit, should an entrance be forcibly made at the other.|$|R
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and <b>so</b> are <b>readily</b> available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|R
500|$|In addition, {{while many}} critics admired the adventurousness {{of the musical}} program and {{reviewed}} the shows favourably, others, particularly in music publications such as Rolling Stone, wrote scathingly of Harrison's reluctance to acknowledge the Beatles' legacy, together with his willingness to share the spotlight <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> with Shankar's orchestra of classical musicians and Preston. In his role as band leader, Scott spoke out in support of Harrison's musical direction and refuted reports that the tour was not going well; instead, he told Circus Raves, audience reaction had been [...] "radically different from city to city" [...] and dependent on whether concertgoers chose to listen, or came expecting to hear the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|Fenwick also asks rhetorically, [...] "Should we {{completely}} {{discount the}} testimonials of est graduates, {{knowing that they}} are not sufficiently rigorous measures to qualify as scientific evidence? [...] I don’t think so. The fact that positive testimonials are <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> obtained from est graduates, in combination with the observation that a majority of people who take the est training, continue to participate and have found the est experience to be rewarding. [...] Even if 'objective' changes are not documented in people's lives, it is noteworthy that people feel happier, more satisfied, more relaxed, and more 'alive.' If you 'feel' happier, then you 'are' happier – objective circumstances notwithstanding. Subjective states are clearly an important component of our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] is an R-pop music {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, lasting for a duration for four minutes and 52 seconds. The theme of social activism {{can be heard}} in the lyrics [...] "There’s got to be a way / to connect this world today." [...] The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world, and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone. Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> to war in the lyrics [...] "Couldn't we accept each other / Can't we make ourselves aware." ...|$|E
30|$|We use the {{standard}} package library of Bonnie++ from the Ubuntu multiverse repository with no special tuning. However, disk space for testing should be {{twice the size}} of RAM. All the machine types used could offer this, <b>so</b> /tmp was <b>readily</b> usable for tests.|$|R
60|$|They soon {{got down}} to the water's edge again. Here, instead of the broad and smooth pond which they had above the dam, they found a stream eddying, and foaming, and flowing rapidly down between rocks and logs. There was a bridge across the stream too, a short {{distance}} below. The boys were a little inclined to be afraid to embark, {{in what appeared to}} be a rather dangerous navigation, but they had confidence in Forester, and <b>so</b> they <b>readily</b> obeyed when Forester ordered the crew aboard.|$|R

500|$|Reviews for Entertainment Weekly, the Chicago Tribune, and Time {{were mixed}} or {{contained}} qualified praise. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in [...] "enough electronic marginal distinction {{to feed a}} coal town for a month" [...] and to compensate for how soulless the songs are, resulting in [...] "arid" [...] art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent, [...] "For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much {{the same sort of}} emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> in its own despondency." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Media Life Magazine, Tom Conroy {{felt the}} stoner comedy played to the series' strengths—a rarity, he felt, among comedians relying on such humor {{while under the}} {{influence}} themselves. While he dubbed the twins' humor [...] "as lazy and aimless" [...] as their animated counterparts at times, he concluded that [...] "its genial vibe makes it a pleasant way to burn off a quarter hour." [...] Reviewing both the series and Golan the Insatiable, Erik Adams of The A.V. Club felt [...] the [...] "horizons" [...] of Lucas Bros. were broader than that of Golan, given that its [...] "slacker vibe <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> goes with the surreal flow." [...] Adams stated the show resembled Adventure Time if the aforementioned series' creative staff were allowed to joke about marijuana, but concluded that the series' humor invoked no more than [...] "a moony grin".|$|E
500|$|Kona Gallagher, of TV Squad, praised [...] "Golden Ticket", {{especially}} the final act: [...] "Between Michael's face and Dwight's conference call, {{the last ten}} minutes of this episode were absolutely golden." [...] Gallagher said the episode returned to [...] "season one levels of Michael Scott stupidity", and particularly liked the way Dwight <b>so</b> <b>readily</b> accepted credit once the golden ticket promotion {{proved to be a}} success. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] an A- grade and particularly praised Steve Carell's Willy Wonka impression and the way Michael tried to distance himself after the promotional idea went bad. Rabin said, [...] "Tonight’s episode lacked a certain gravity but it delivered the goods, comedy-wise." [...] He also pointed out that the script was technically illogical in that Michael pretended he did not come up with the golden ticket idea despite the documentary camera crew filming his earlier discussions about it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The sun had {{set before}} we quitted the inn, {{and we had}} made no plans as to where we should go next, <b>so</b> we <b>readily</b> consented to the prince's {{proposal}} that we should embark without delay for the Isle of Black Marble. What a place it was! Rocks blacker than jet towered above its shores and shed thick darkness over the country. Our sailors {{had not been there}} before and were nearly as frightened as ourselves, but thanks to Thelamis, who undertook to be our pilot, we landed safely on the beach.|$|R
60|$|Arthur, {{who was at}} {{this time}} only about {{fourteen}} years old, was, of course, too young to exercise any judgment in respect to such questions as these, <b>so</b> he <b>readily</b> agreed to what Philip proposed, and very soon afterward Philip assembled an army, and, placing Arthur nominally {{at the head of}} it, he sent him forth into Normandy to commence the war upon John. Of course, Arthur was only nominally {{at the head of the}} army. There were old and experienced generals who really had the command, though they did every thing in Arthur's name.|$|R
60|$|WISE. Yes, so I say; not {{but that}} he was a {{drunkard}} and also thievish, but he was most arch in this sin of uncleanness: this roguery was his masterpiece, for he was a ringleader to them all in the beastly sin of whoredom. He was also best acquainted with such houses where they were, and <b>so</b> could <b>readily</b> lead the rest of his gang unto them. The strumpets also, because they knew this young villain, would at first discover themselves in all their whorish pranks to those that he brought with him.|$|R
