60|$|He soon bobbed up, and the shaggy man seized {{him by his}} <b>sailor</b> <b>collar</b> {{and dragged}} him to the shore, {{dripping}} and gasping for breath. They all looked upon the boy wonderingly, for the fox head with its sharp nose and pointed ears was gone, and in its place appeared the chubby round face and blue eyes and pretty curls {{that had belonged to}} Button-Bright before King Dox of Foxville transformed him.|$|E

60|$|It was at {{this moment}} that Miss West emerged upon the poop. She was as rosy and vital as ever, and certainly, {{if she had been}} sea-sick, she flew no signals of it. As she came toward me, {{greeting}} me, I could not help remarking again the lithe and springy limb-movement with which she walked, and her fine, firm skin. Her neck, free in a <b>sailor</b> <b>collar,</b> with white sweater open at the throat, seemed almost redoubtably strong to my sleepless, jaundiced eyes. Her hair, under a white knitted cap, was smooth and well-groomed. In fact, the totality of impression she conveyed was of a well-groomedness one would not expect of a sea-captain's daughter, much less of a woman who had been sea-sick. Life!--that is the key of her, the essential note of her--life and health. I'll wager she has never entertained a morbid thought in that practical, balanced, sensible head of hers.|$|E

While {{most of the}} games focus just on a single couple, some of the newer titles feature multiple couples.

50|$|The blue jean collar {{is perhaps}} the most {{recognisable}} item of the sailor suit, and tradition says that it dates from the times when seamen wore tarred pigtails. This is in fact false, as the collar was not part of uniform until after pigtails disappeared. The three stripes {{have nothing to do with}} Nelson's three victories but was simply standardised to three when uniform was regulated. It is often considered lucky to touch a <b>sailor's</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Pupils {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by the unique uniform of the school, which has not changed since 1922. The uniform resembles a sailor's suit, consisting of a pinafore with an upper section in white and lower section in navy blue skirt; and a white blouse with a <b>sailor</b> <b>collar,</b> {{which is to be}} worn over and covers 60% of the pinafore. Under the pinafore, single-colored undergarments (with the choice of white, grey, beige, navy or black) and shorts may be worn.|$|E
5000|$|Charmin Chattys shoulder-length {{hair was}} {{available}} in blonde and auburn, and she had blue side glancing [...] "life-like decal eyes." [...] Standing 24 inches tall, the doll came with a sailor outfit (a white jacket with a red <b>sailor</b> <b>collar,</b> jumper dress with a navy blue skirt, red knee socks, and blue-and-white saddle shoes). The doll, which wore eyeglass frames, was called [...] "the educated doll" [...] perhaps because {{it was able to}} speak foreign languages when its records were changed. Eight different outfits were available separately for the doll; each came with a record with phrases related to that particular outfit.|$|E
5000|$|The marines of the San Marco Regiment are {{designated}} as Marine Riflemen. Their rank system {{is similar to}} the Italian Army except that enlisted men are distinguished by a <b>sailor's</b> <b>collar</b> on the uniform and a navy blue beret. Both the Navy's San Marco marines and the Army's Lagunari amphibious infantry have the Lion of Saint Mark in their coat of arms. Plans to consolidate both organizations together (as it was during the early '50s when both Army and Navy contributed to a naval infantry unit known as the Settore Forze Lagunari that after became the Lagunari regiment) was abandoned in the mid-1990s. Today, however, close co-operation exists because of a common operations staff in Brindisi, which has continued to strengthen ties between the two units ( [...] Forza di Proiezione dal Mare [...] ).|$|R

5000|$|On Sunday, 14 July 1918, two priests {{came to the}} Ipatiev House to {{celebrate}} the Divine Liturgy. One of the priests, Father Storozhev later recalled, [...] "I went {{into the living room}} first, then the deacon and Yurovsky. At the same time Nicholas and Alexandra entered through the doors leading into the inner room. Two of his daughters were with him. I did not have a chance to see exactly which ones. I believe Yurovsky asked Nicholas Alexandrovich, [...] "Well, are you all here?" [...] Nicholas Alexandrovich answered firmly, [...] "Yes, all of us." [...] Ahead beyond the archway, Alexandra Feodorovna was already in place with two daughters and Alexei Nicolaievich. He was sitting in a wheelchair and wore a jacket, as it seemed to me, with a <b>sailor's</b> <b>collar.</b> He was pale, but not so much as at the time of my first service. In general he looked more healthy. Alexandra Feodorovna also had a healthier appearance. ...According to the liturgy of the service it is customary at a certain point to read the prayer, [...] "Who Resteth with the Saints." [...] On this occasion for some reason the deacon, instead of reading the prayer began to sing it, and I as well, somewhat embarrassed by this departure from the ritual. But we had secretly begun to sing when I heard the members of the Romanov family, standing behind me, fall on their knees ..." ...|$|R
50|$|Sport in {{the early}} years of the school {{consisted}} of drill given by a sergeant. The gymnastic dress was made of heavy thick blue serge with a light blue <b>sailor</b> <b>collar.</b> Games only began when an asphalt tennis court was laid down in what became the playground. In 1900 the school acquired the field which is where the girls went to play games. The flourishing of a lively PE department owed much to the vision of PE teacher Miss Stansfeld (BHS 1887-1918). Before its closure, the school had 22 acres (89,000 mÂ²) of games field and a spa centre ('the Canary Cage'), formally opened in 2005 by past pupil Dr Stephanie Cook OBE, (Olympic gold champion and World Champion in the modern pentathlon).|$|E
5000|$|The early 1800s was the {{beginning}} of a revolution in swimwear whenwomen flocked to the beaches for seaside recreation using typically black dress,knee-length, puffed-sleeve wool dresses, often featuring a <b>sailor</b> <b>collar.</b> This outfit had the goalof cover all skin to avoid suntan that was the sign of belonging to the social class ofcommon laborers.In that period there were bathing machines, little wood houses on wheels haul by horses, usually located in seaside place where the water was very shallow near the beach.Inside these people undressed were drawn out into deep water in order to let them swimming, and after came back when the bath was finished.By the end of the 19th century there was the need of having swimsuit less burdensome to allowexposure to the sun and for the new popular seaside activities. Despite the only game for women involved jumping through the waves while holding on a rope attached to a buoy.The bikini was introduced in 1946, when two French designers, Louis Reard andJacob Heim, reinvented the suit female swimsuit divided in two-piece, from {{the beginning}} was given the name of 'atome'.Although the belly bottom was still covered, this was an important transformation because this new form of beachwear was accepted.In 1950's women's curves were emphasized together with vivid colors until the 1970s whensexual revolution was in full force letting people show off their bodies.The cultural parameters, increasingly influenced by the media, inspired by the TV series, such as the famous [...] "Baywatch" [...] in 1989 where the high-cut leg become popular, taking as a model of sports looks.Nowadays fashion continues on this track.

60|$|He {{was dressed}} in the {{ordinary}} miner's garb of the Southern mines, perhaps a little more cleanly than the average miner by reason of his taste, certainly more picturesque by reason of his statuesque shapeliness. He wore a pair of white duck trousers, a jumper or loose blouse of the same material, with a low-folded <b>sailor's</b> <b>collar</b> and sailor-knotted neckerchief, which displayed, with an unconsciousness quite characteristic of the man, the full, muscular column of his sunburnt throat, except where it was hidden by a full, tawny beard. His long, sandy curls fell naturally and equally {{on either side of}} the centre of his low, broad forehead. His fair complexion, although greatly tanned by exposure, seemed to have faded lately as by sickness or great mental distress, a theory that had some confirmation in the fact that he ate but little. His eyes were downcast, or, when raised, were so shy as to avoid critical examination. Nevertheless his mere superficial exterior was so striking as to attract the admiration of others besides Mr. Hamlin; to excite the enthusiastic attention of Mr. Raynor, and to enable the editor to offer him as a fair type of the mining population. Embarrassed at last by a scrutiny that asserted itself even through his habitual unconsciousness and pre-occupation, the subject of this criticism arose and returned to the hotel verandah, where his pack and mining implements were lying. Mr. Hamlin, who for the last few days had been in a rather exceptional mood, for some occult reason which he could not explain, felt like respecting the stranger's reserve, and quietly lounged into the billiard-room to wait for the coming of the stage-coach. As soon as his back was turned the editor took occasion to offer Mr. Raynor his own estimate of Mr. Hamlin's character and reputation, to correct his misstatements regarding Californian resources and social habits, and to restore Mr. Raynor's possibly shaken faith in California as a country especially adapted to the secure investment of capital.|$|R
