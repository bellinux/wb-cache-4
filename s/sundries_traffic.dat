In its final form it {{had a number of}} 'sheds', which were called the Fruit Shed, Provision Shed, Delivery Shed, Fish Shed, Cloth Shed, Grain Shed, Potato Shed and the Shipping Shed, indicating the diversity of traffic handled there.

5000|$|In 1963 the Beeching {{report was}} published, The Reshaping of British Railways. The {{industry}} had been incurring mounting losses, considered by Government to be unsustainable, and the report indicated how matters might be got under control. Many rural branch lines, and many stations on main lines, were stated to be unremunerative, and {{were to be}} closed. Wagonload goods traffic over the whole system {{was considered to be}} heavily loss-making and was to be reduced in extent. <b>Sundries</b> <b>traffic</b> was especially unremunerative. Investment was to be concentrated on certain main routes, on accelerating the transition to modern traction and signalling systems, and the introduction of [...] "liner trains" [...] capable of fast transits carrying maritime containers.|$|E

Due to the proximity of the River Nene, the only way this could be done was to expand onto the site of Northampton Castle. On 18 December 1876, the L&NWR purchased the site from William Walker and subsequently demolished the remains of the castle except for the postern gate which, following a local petition, was moved to a new site in the boundary wall of the new station where it remains to this day. Â£30,000 was allowed by the L&NWR board for the improvement of passenger facilities and a goods shed was constructed {{on the site of the}} castle in 1880. The rebuilt station opened with the Loop Line north to [...] on 1 December 1881 followed by the line south to Roade on 3 April 1882. It comprised three through platforms and five terminal bays. Platform 1, which was sited on the east side of the running lines, was considered as the main up platform; it had two adjoining bay platforms, numbered 2 and 3. Platforms 4 and 5 were located at the south end of platform 1, while the two sides of an island platform on the down side of the station were platforms 6 and 7. A further down bay platform was situated at the north end of platform 6, along with other bays and loading docks for parcels and <b>sundries</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
