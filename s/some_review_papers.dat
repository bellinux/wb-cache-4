40|$|For decades, forest {{researchers}} {{have known that}} planting trees on cropland or pastures (that is, afforestation) can lower the surface albedo and that landscapes with low albedo absorb more solar radiation than more reflective surfaces. Consequently, afforestation will typically darken the Earth’s surface (when compared to grasslands or deserts). In spite of this knowledge, many believe that afforestation will cool the Earth’s atmosphere since wood is composed of carbon molecules. Therefore, there are two schools of thought on how afforestation affects global climate. The “CO 2 School” believes that afforestation will have a cooling effect, regardless of {{the location of the}} planted trees. In contrast, the “Holistic School ” believes the climate is a complex system affected by numerous variables, including clouds and the surface albedo. Many from this School say that afforestation in boreal zones could warm the Earth.

30|$|During manufacturing, service life-time, {{maintenance}} etc., braided composites {{are often}} subjected to various dynamic loading conditions, from low-velocity impacts to ballistic loads. In such regimes, small weak {{point in a}} composite part can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore, a response of braided composites to such conditions should be clearly understood. An overview of general impact behaviour of fibre-reinforced polymeric composites (FRPC) is given in <b>some</b> <b>review</b> <b>papers</b> (Davies and Olsson 2004; Crookston et al. 2005; Dixit and Harlal 2013). In most studies, the composites were impacted at different velocities, and the resulting damage was evaluated. The effects of various parameters such as impact energy and impactor shape on impact responses of composites were also studied. However, little {{attention was paid to}} braided composites. Impact damage in structural textile composites was introduced into consideration recently (Binienda, 2012; Ma and Gao, 2013), and most of these efforts were based on experimental studies, rather than numerical simulations. This section introduces some recent numerical attempts to predict damage in braided composites under impact loadings, with impact energy from relatively low levels to high ones.|$|E

30|$|Digital {{soil mapping}} is a {{practical}} solution for refining the spatial variability of soil information for large areas. A variety of digital soil maps are currently available including global (SoilGrids; Hengl et al. 2017) and regional (e.g., POLARIS; Chaney et al. 2016) products (Table  1). SoilGrids is a global product of soil property information available in a raster data format with 250  m resolution (Hengl et al. 2017), with recent advances for the continental US that provide data for 100  m pixels (Ramcharan et al. 2018). There are also local scale examples of digital soil mapping that could be useful for fire modeling. For example, the 2009 Hog Fire burned 73  km 2 in southeastern Arizona, USA, where {{approximately half of the}} burned area occurred on national forest land with no published soil survey available (Fig.  4). However, a digital soil map is available from work by Levi (2017) and provides predicted soil components for most of the burned area. A simple intersection of the digital soil map and the Hog Fire boundary indicated that two soil components accounted for 79 % of the burned area. One drawback of digital soil mapping data for fire modeling is that knowing about and then accessing localized data may be difficult as there is not currently a clearinghouse or repository of these data. <b>Some</b> <b>review</b> <b>papers</b> offer one mechanism of identifying existing studies (e.g., Grunwald 2009) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has compiled an annotated bibliography of digital soil mapping projects with NRCS participation (see NRCS 2018), but such lists are often not comprehensive. Some larger-scale projects like the 100  m SoilGrids project are readily available (Table  1). Another challenge to utilizing previously developed digital soil maps is that project objectives may have produced soil property maps that would not be easily translated to relevant fire ecology questions.|$|E
40|$|Background Avian {{influenza}} A (H 5 N 1) {{has been}} circulating around and {{remains to be}} one of the major threats to human beings since it first emerged in 1997. Besides vaccines, currently there are two major countermeasures to infection in clinical settings, which are antiviral therapies and immunomodulator treatments. Objectives To summarize evidence on the effectiveness of current treatments against H 5 N 1 infection and to explore the potential benefits of several immunomodulatory agents. Design Systematic review of cross-sectional studies and case series. Data sources Searches of PubMed for articles using the search term “(H 5 N 1 [Title]) AND antiviral[Title/Abstract]” and also manual search on PubMed for studies that are cited in <b>some</b> <b>review</b> <b>papers</b> in the first automatic search. Previous search results relating to human H 5 N 1 infection studies are also included. Study selection Included studies that were human H 5 N 1 infection cross-sectional studies or case series in which clinical outcomes were reported, CFR and survival rate were specified or could be easily derived from original data. Results 11 articles met the selection criteria and were included in our analysis. Sample size of the included studies ranged from 8 to 308 lab confirmed cases with median age varied from 10 to 29. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated ALT and AST at admission were strongly associated with worse clinical outcomes with different significance across studies. Oseltmivir treatment was generally initiated earlier among those who survived. Survival benefit of oseltamivir was the most significant if the patient received the treatment within the first two days after symptom onset, and it is still significantly effective when treatment was given up to eight days after symptom onset according to one study we included. Corticosteroid didnot show any beneficial effect or it is associated with a higher risk of death when it is given according to the current treatment protocol and a delayed initiation time. Conclusion Oseltamivir treatment is associated with survival benefit especially when initiated within the first two days after symptom onset, while immunomodulator therapies haven’t shown such benefit so far in clinical setting but some experiments in vitro and in vivo support their use in a manner which is different from the current protocol. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

The future {{relevance}} of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) {{to the treatment}} of urinary stones has been questioned by <b>some.</b> This <b>paper</b> <b>reviews</b> recent developments with an aim to predict the level of usefulness of SWL for the future. The incidence of urolithiasis is increasing throughout the world, and existing metaphylaxis is not widely effective. This results in an increasing need for active stone removal. SWL was and is a well established treatment modality for urolithiasis in the upper urinary tract. For most stone situations there will remain a reasonable choice between SWL versus endoscopic procedures, and it is unlikely that endoscopic procedures will displace SWL completely in general practice. In conclusion, SWL will continue to play an established, if slightly reduced, role in stone treatment in the future...|$|R
