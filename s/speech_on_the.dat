5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it.

It has been suggested that far fewer would have died, both then and in the decades that followed, if the Reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford administration had applied to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E

5|$|In his new positions, Khrushchev {{continued}} his kolkhoz consolidation scheme, which decreased {{the number of}} collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject was published in Pravda in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the antislavery Republican Party became the {{dominant}} political organization in Massachusetts, led by Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson who espoused Garrison's views in Congress and further increased sectionalism. In 1856, Sumner delivered a <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Senate floor so scathing and insulting to pro-slavery politicians that Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina severely beat {{him with a}} cane. By 1860, the Republicans controlled the Governor's office, the state legislature and the mayoralty of Boston.|$|E

The Seder convened in the Old Family Dining Room and lasted for two hours.

When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of what once were confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this activity by the government.|$|E

5|$|Women's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public {{meetings}} in Philadelphia beginning in 1846. A wide circle of abolitionists friendly to women's rights began in 1847 {{to discuss the}} possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women's rights. In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of women's rights, entitled The Province of Women, at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|After Joseph Stalin's death, {{the process}} of destalinization {{prompted}} debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's <b>speech</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries. In Poland, {{in addition to the}} criticism of the cult of personality, popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of 'local, national socialism' instead of following the Soviet model down to every little detail; such views were seen in discussion and critique by many Polish United Workers' Party members of Stalin's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant <b>speech,</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E

5|$|In January 1629, Charles {{opened the}} second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a {{moderate}} <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies {{in light of the}} case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to their protest.|$|E
5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic was even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism‚Äîwhich held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a <b>speech</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
