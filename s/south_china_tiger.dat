25|$|By 1987, {{the remnant}} <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> {{population}} {{was estimated at}} 30–40 individuals in the wild, so that danger of extinction was imminent. During a survey in 1990, <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> signs were found in 11 reserves {{in the mountains of}} Sichuan, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi and Fujian Provinces, but these data were insufficient to estimate population size. No tigers were directly observed; evidence was limited to sightings of tracks, scrapings and reported sightings by local people.|$|E

To date, five <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> have left the zoos of China and been sent to South Africa for re-wilding training. These tigers include: ...|$|R
25|$|The reason South Africa {{was chosen}} {{is because it}} is able to provide {{expertise}} and resources, land and game for the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers.</b> The <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> of the project has since been successfully rewilded and are fully capable of hunting and surviving on their own. This project is also very successful in the breeding of these rewilded <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> and 14 cubs have been born in the project of which 11 survived. These cubs of the 2nd generation would be able to learn their survival skills from their successfully rewilded mothers directly.|$|R
25|$|In 1973, the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> was {{classified}} as protected by controlled hunting. In 1977, the species {{was classified}} as protected, and hunting was prohibited.|$|E

25|$|There {{may still}} be some {{surviving}} South China tigers in the wild, with reports of tracks and local people sightings from Qizimei Mountains Nature Reserve, Hubei Province and in Yihuang county of Jiangxi Province. In May 2007, the Government of China reported to the CITES Secretariat {{that there is no}} confirmed presence, and declared the goal to reintroduce South China tigers to the wild. In September 2007, a body of an Asiatic black bear was found in Zhenping County that had possibly been killed and eaten by a <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger.</b> In October 2007, a supposed <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> attacked a cow in the same county.|$|E
25|$|<b>China's</b> captive <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> are {{now part}} of a {{centrally}} registered studbook. Before a studbook was established it was thought that this captive population was too small and lacking in genetic diversity for any re-population program to be successful, but {{since the start of the}} central register more and more <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> have been identified in zoos across China.|$|R

50|$|A large {{difficulty}} {{faced by}} the project is the limited gene pool for <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> - all of the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> in Chinese zoos are descended from only 6 individuals caught in the 1950s. Since these tigers in captivity have been reproducing with close relatives, {{the quality of their}} genes is deteriorating. The project plans to improve living conditions and breed them scientifically - to this end a breeding centre, the David Tang Tiger Breeding Center, has been constructed at the Laohu Valley Reserve.|$|R

25|$|The {{organization}} Save China's Tigers, {{working with}} the Wildlife Research Center of the State Forestry Administration of China and the Chinese Tigers South Africa Trust, secured an agreement on the reintroduction of Chinese tigers into the wild. The agreement, which was signed in Beijing on 26 November 2002, calls {{for the establishment of}} a Chinese tiger conservation model through the creation of a pilot reserve in China where indigenous wildlife, including the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger,</b> will be reintroduced. Save China's Tigers aims to rewild the critically endangered <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> by bringing a few captive-bred individuals to a private reserve in the Free State province of South Africa for rehabilitation training for them to regain their hunting instincts. At the same time, a pilot reserve in China is being set up and the tigers will be relocated and release back in China when the reserve in China is ready. The offspring of the trained tigers will be released into the pilot reserves in China, while the original animals will stay in South Africa to continue breeding.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, the German {{zoologist}} Max Hilzheimer {{first described}} the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> as similar in height to the Bengal tiger, but differing in skull and coat characteristics.

Their coat is lighter and more yellowish and the paws, face, and stomach appear more white; the stripes are narrower, more numerous and more sharp-edged.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} Save <b>China's</b> <b>Tigers</b> {{has attempted}} to rewild the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers,</b> with a breeding and training programme in a South African reserve known as Laohu Valley Reserve (LVR) and eventually reintroduce them to the wild of China.|$|R
5000|$|The Laohu Valley Reserve (LVR) is {{a roughly}} 350 square {{kilometer}} private reserve near Philippolis in the Free State.

LVR was created in 2002 out of 17 defunct sheep farms, and efforts to return the overgrazed land to natural status are ongoing. The <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> at LVR for rewilding are kept confined to a tiger-proof camp complex of roughly 1.8 square kilometers, with {{other areas of the}} reserve being used to protect native South African species. The word [...] "laohu" [...] is a Chinese term for tiger.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> {{population}} {{was reported to}} number more than 4,000 individuals in the wild when it became the target of large-scale government ‘anti-pest’ campaigns promulgated by Mao Zedong’s ‘Great Leap Forward’. The effects of uncontrolled hunting were compounded by extensive deforestation and probable reduction in available prey, large-scale relocations of urban populations to rural locations leading to fragmentation of tiger populations and increased vulnerability to local extinction from stochastic events. By 1982, only an estimated 150–200 South China tigers remained in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is a tiger {{subspecies}} in {{the provinces}} of Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi in southern China. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996, and is possibly extinct in the wild since no wild individual has been recorded since the early 1970s. Already in the late 1990s, continued survival was considered unlikely due to low prey density, widespread habitat degradation and fragmentation, and other human pressures. The name Amoy tiger {{was used in the}} fur trade. It is also known as the South Chinese, the Chinese, and the Xiamen tiger.|$|E

5000|$|... "Save China's Tigers" [...] {{was founded}} in 2000 by [...] Li Quan, former fashion {{executive}} at Gucci, Benetton and Fila in Italy. When Li Quan realized the dire state of the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> in the wild and saw the poor conditions in which captive <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> were living in China several years ago, she devoted herself to saving the tigers. She established the charitable foundation Save <b>China's</b> <b>Tigers</b> in the UK in 2000, and subsequently in the United States (2002) and Hong Kong (2003). She engineered the Chinese Tiger Conservation Model after observing and analysing how wildlife conservation and eco-tourism have succeeded in Africa.In 2001, Li Quan proposed to <b>China</b> to use <b>South</b> African expertise to help <b>China's</b> Chinese <b>Tiger</b> Rehabilitation & Reintroduction project, which the Chinese started in the 1990s, and invited a South African Team to visit China.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} created with the aims of {{nurturing}} captive-born <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> (Panthera tigris amoyensis) in South Africa and eventually releasing them into the wild in China.

25|$|Scientists {{confirmed}} {{the role of}} rewilding captive populations to save the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger.</b> A workshop was conducted in October 2010 in Laohu Valley Reserve in South Africa to assess {{the progress of the}} rewilding and reintroduction program of Save China's Tigers. The experts present included Dr. Peter Crawshaw of Centro Nacional de Pesquisa e Conservacão de Mamiferos Carnivoros, Cenap/ICMBIO, Dr. Gary Koehler, Dr. Laurie Marker of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, Dr. Jim Sanderson of Small Wild Cat Conservation Foundation, Dr. Nobuyuki Yamaguchi of Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences of Qatar University, and Dr. David Smith of Minnesota University, Chinese government scientists as well as representatives of Save China's Tigers.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> is {{considered}} a relict population of the [...] "stem" [...] tiger, living close to the possible area of origin.

Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that southern China or northern Indochina was likely the center of the Pleistocene tiger radiation.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "rewilding" [...] {{was coined}} by {{conservationist}} and ex-carnivore manager of Pilanesberg National Park, Gus Van Dyk in 2003. Gus Van Dyk, who {{in an effort}} to find the most appropriate translation of the Chinese term [...] "野化", chose to adopt the term [...] "rewilding" [...] to describe Save China's Tigers rewilding project of the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger.</b> Since then, the term [...] "rewilding" [...] has been widely used by wildlife organisations worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The prey menus of tiger and lion are similar. The <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> prey on blesboks (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi), springboks (Taurotragus oryx), gemsboks (Oryx gazella), black {{wildebeest}} (Connochaetes gnou), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), common elands (Taurotragus oryx), impalas (Aepyceros melampus), waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) {{and cape}} hares (Lepus capensis).|$|R
25|$|As of March 1986, 17 Chinese zoos kept 40 {{pure-bred}} <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> {{in their}} collections, including 23 males and 14 females, {{none of which}} were wild-born.

25|$|Since 2001, Save <b>China’s</b> <b>Tigers</b> <b>South</b> African {{team has}} been working with the Chinese State Forestry Administration to {{identify}} locations for the reintroduction of the rewilded <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers.</b> Nine sites from four provinces were surveyed using 36 ecological parameters. Two candidate sites were selected in Jiangxi and Hunan province in early 2005. The State Forestry Administration approved the sites by end 2005. Owing to the remarkable progress of Save <b>China’s</b> <b>Tigers</b> Rewilding project subsequently in South Africa, the Chinese authorities were further encouraged and decided to look for sites within the nature reserves where there would be fewer human population relocation issues in order to quicken the return of the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers.</b> In early 2010, a government scientific team identified an interim test site and three final sites, which are now awaiting approval from the relevant central government department. Save China’s Tigers’ scientific team is working with the Chinese authorities on the preparations in terms of fencing technology, re-stocking prey, and building tiger and wildlife management expertise.|$|R

Yet in February 2008, the Shaanxi Province Forestry Bureau released an apology, qualifying their earlier statements but without repudiating the pictures' authenticity, writing [...] "We curtly released {{the discovery of the}} <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tiger</b> without substantial proof, which reflects our blundering manner and lax discipline." ...|$|E
50|$|She {{initiated}} the world’s first such experiment by rewilding <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> {{in collaboration with}} the State Forestry Administration of China at the Laohu Valley Reserve in South Africa. The concept was initially controversial, but it is now widely accepted as a viable strategy for wildlife conservation by many mainstream wildlife organizations including the World Wide Fund for Nature.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the project}} organisers argue {{it will not}} cause such a problem as Laohu Valley Reserve has been {{converted}} from 17 pieces of defunct sheep farms that were overgrazed; thus no healthy ecosystems existed there at all. In addition, the tigers are in fenced-off camps - hence the <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> never roam outside Laohu Valley Reserve and there is, therefore, no contact between them and any healthy ecosystem that exists nearby. On the contrary, instead of having negative effects on South Africa's biodiversity, the project actually has positive effects on it. This is because the defunct sheep farms have been restored and converted into a wildlife reserve that is beneficial to the South African ecosystem. This can be considered {{the contribution of the}} <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> to the biodiversity of South Africa. Without the Chinese tigers, the land for the project in South Africa would never have been purchased.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, {{during the}} PRC's Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong {{declared}} <b>South</b> <b>China</b> <b>tigers</b> as enemies of man, and began organising and encouraging eradication campaigns. By the early 1960s, Chinese tigers {{had been reduced}} to just over 1,000 animals. A decade later, their range was reduced to three regions in southern China, two of which were located in the Jiangxi Province.|$|R
