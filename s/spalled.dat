5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have <b>spalled</b> large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and cobbing the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, cobbing and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of <b>spalled</b> ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>spalling</b> {{is a major}} factor in determining the fire resistance of concrete constructions. The apparently random {{occurrence of}} <b>spalling</b> has limited the development and application of fire resistance modelling for concrete structures. This Thesis describes an experimental investigation into the <b>spalling</b> of concrete on exposure to elevated temperatures. It has been shown that <b>spalling</b> may be categorised into four distinct types, aggregate <b>spalling,</b> corner <b>spalling,</b> surface <b>spalling</b> and explosive <b>spalling.</b> Aggregate <b>spalling</b> {{has been found to be}} a form of shear failure of aggregates local to the heated surface. The susceptibility of any particular concrete to aggregate <b>spalling</b> can be quantified from parameters which include the coefficients of thermal expansion of both the aggregate and the surrounding mortar, the size and thermal diffusivity of the aggregate and the rate of heating. Corner <b>spalling,</b> which is particularly significant for the fire resistance of concrete columns, is a result of concrete losing its tensile strength at elevated temperatures. Surface <b>spalling</b> is the result of excessive pore pressures within heated concrete. An empirical model has been developed to allow quantification of the pore pressures and a material failure model proposed. The dominant parameters are rate of heating, pore saturation and concrete permeability. Surface <b>spalling</b> may be alleviated by limiting pore pressure development and a number of methods to this end have been evaluated. Explosive <b>spalling</b> involves the catastrophic failure of a concrete element and may be caused by either of two distinct mechanisms. In the first instance, excessive pore pressures can cause explosive <b>spalling,</b> although the effect is limited principally to unloaded or relatively small specimens. A second cause of explosive <b>spalling</b> is where the superimposition of thermally induced stresses on applied load stresses exceed the concrete's strength...|$|R

25|$|As {{soon as the}} dam was {{loosened}} on {{its base}} the toe of the structure <b>spalled</b> off. This was probably the beginning of its breaking up, and probably occurred sometime after 11:30 PM during the 23 minutes in which {{the water in the}} reservoir apparently fell 3/10 of a foot. Thereupon, quite likely, a part of the east end of the dam, meanwhile undermined, went out and the dam at this end lost its hillside support. Hydrostatic uplift at the already loose west and the weight of the remaining portion of the undermined east end caused a temporary tilting of the dam towards the east, accompanied by a rapid washing away of the hillside under the dam at its west end which then also began to break up. The reservoir water was now rushing with tremendous force against both ends and against the upstream face of all that was standing of the dam. This rush of water carried away huge blocks of concrete from both ends of the dam...|$|E

2500|$|Small {{volumes of}} un-melted and {{relatively}} un-shocked material may be <b>spalled</b> {{at very high}} relative velocities {{from the surface of}} the target and from the rear of the impactor. [...] Spalling provides a potential mechanism whereby material may be ejected into inter-planetary space largely undamaged, and whereby small volumes of the impactor may be preserved undamaged even in large impacts. [...] Small volumes of high-speed material may also be generated early in the impact by jetting. [...] This occurs when two surfaces converge rapidly and obliquely at a small angle, and high-temperature highly shocked material is expelled from the convergence zone with velocities that may be several times larger than the impact velocity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1892, when Charles F. Lummis {{was visiting}} Acoma {{he listened to}} the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa. [...] Their access to the top was on the {{southern}} side where a large piece of the butte was said to have <b>spalled</b> off and formed a ramp, a [...] "stone ladder", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone {{on either side of the}} fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end[...] The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley. [...] In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops. [...] One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the [...] "stone ladder", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor could anyone else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird swooped down and scooped up the four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.|$|E

40|$|The ice {{crushing}} induced vibration {{and so-called}} lock-in behavior {{exhibited by the}} Molikpaq structure during a test case event that occurred on May 12, 1986 has been {{explained in terms of}} ice <b>spalling,</b> and associated sawtooth load and displacement patterns, and resonance of the coupled structure 2 ̆ 013 ice system where the mass and spring constant associated with the ice sheet are variable 2 ̆ 018 effective 2 ̆ 019 quantities that depend on the ice sheet speed. <b>Spalling</b> at the ice edge contact zone plays a key role since the <b>spalling</b> frequency is directly proportional to the speed of the ice sheet towards the structure. Two modes of <b>spalling</b> are described for this particular event. One mode, called system resonant capped (SRC) <b>spalling,</b> causes loading and displacement that is similar to classic high-amplitude sawtooth loading and displacement and occurs at <b>spalling</b> frequencies in the vicinity of, or less than, the resonant frequency of the structure 2 ̆ 013 ice system. In the present case the SRC <b>spalling</b> appears to be at the system resonant frequency. The other <b>spalling</b> mode is lowdisplacement 2 ̆ 013 amplitude erratic <b>spalling</b> that is characterized by temporal unevenness and unevenness in the magnitude of consecutive displacement sawteeth. This type of <b>spalling</b> occurs at an average <b>spalling</b> frequency of about 4 Hz, which is substantially higher than the SRC <b>spalling</b> frequency range. For the analysis rough estimates for the variation of the effective mass and effective spring constant of the ice sheet throughout a range of <b>spalling</b> frequency were determined numerically. This treatment predicts that, for ice with similar properties as the May 12 event at least, sawtooth loading of the structure that causes structural oscillations is inevitable when an expansive ice sheet crushes against it. Potential means of significantly reducing the amplitude of the load and displacement oscillations by influencing fundamental <b>spalling</b> characteristics using blade-like <b>spall</b> initiators installed on the structure faces at the ice level are discussed.

60|$|Early {{next morning}} (six a.m., March 3rd) we {{followed}} the right bank of the Wady el-Khandakí, which runs north with westing. Beyond it lay the foot-hills of gloomy trap leading to the Jebel el-Raydán, a typical granitic form, a short demi-pique saddleback with inwards-sloping pommel like the Pao d'Assucar of picturesque Rio de Janeiro. Here as elsewhere, the granites run parallel with and seaward of the traps. The Tuwayl el-Súk is nothing but an open and windy flat, where the Hajj-caravan used to camp an adjoining ridge, the Hamrá el-Tuwayl, shows <b>spalled</b> quartz, Wasm and memorial stones. The principal formation here is the mauve-purple conglomerate before described.|$|E
6000|$|This divide, {{also called}} the Jayb el Sa'lúwwah, with granites to the east, and traps mixed with granites on the west, shows signs of labour. Hard by, to the south-west, some {{exceptionally}} industrious Bedawi, of the Jeráfín-Huwaytát, had laid out a small field with barley. In the evening we walked westward to the hills that bound the slope; and came upon a rock-cut road leading to an atalier, where [...] "Marú" [...] has been <b>spalled</b> from the stone in situ. Some specimens had a light-bluish tinge, as if stained by cobalt, a metal found in several slags; and there were veins of crystalline amethyst-quartz, coloured, said the engineer by chlorure of silver (?). The filons and filets cut the granite in all directions; and the fiery action of frequent trap-dykes had torn the ground-rock to tatters. The western side of El-Kutayyifah also showed modern ruins.|$|E
6000|$|Upon this able report I {{would offer}} the {{following}} observations. We, who have travelled through {{a country like}} Midian, finding everywhere extensive works for metallurgy; barrages and aqueducts, cisterns and tanks furnaces, fire-bricks, and scoriae; open mines, and huge scatters of <b>spalled</b> quartz, with the remains of some eighteen cities and towns which apparently fell to ruin with the industry that founded and fed them;--we, I say, cannot but form a different and a far higher idea of its mineral capabilities than those who determine them by the simple inspection of a few specimens. The learned Dr. Percy at once hits the mark when he surmises that worthless samples were brought home; and this would necessarily occur when no metallurgist, no practical prospector, was present with the Expedition. As will appear from the following pages, all the specimens were collected a ciel ouvert, and wholly without judgment.|$|E
30|$|Through the {{comparison}} of coal wall <b>spalling</b> with the neighbouring No. 8104 face, it was found that: {{during the period of}} non-periodical ground pressure occurring, the average coal wall <b>spalling</b> ratio was 33.08  % and the <b>spalling</b> depth varied from 0.2 to 0.3  m at the No. 8104 face; the average <b>spalling</b> ratio was 22.06  % and the <b>spalling</b> depth varied from 0.18 to 0.25  m at the No. 8105 face. During the period of periodical ground pressure, the <b>spalling</b> ratio was 36.18  % at the No. 8104 face, and 29.16  % at the No. 8105 face. Based on the statistical analysis, the <b>spalling</b> depth and length were the largest in the middle parts of the No. 8104 and No. 8105 faces. In comparison with the No. 8104 face, the <b>spalling</b> ratio at the No. 8105 face was 33.4  % less than that at the No. 8104 face, and the <b>spalling</b> depth was also 50  mm less than that at the No. 8104 face. Therefore, it can be concluded that the coal wall <b>spalling</b> was significantly reduced and the face achieved a fast advance speed due to the application of proposed comprehensive control technology at the No. 8105 face in Tashan coal mine in Datong, China, including controlling face advance speed, increasing support initial abutment force and increasing the wall protection capacity of support.|$|R
30|$|The {{face advance}} speed also {{significantly}} affected wall <b>spalling.</b> The observations at the No. 8105 coal face demonstrated {{that with the}} increase of face advance speed, there was a reduction of damage area around the coal wall, and a reduction of wall horizontal displacement. In other words, the <b>spalling</b> of coal wall was suppressed. It is therefore suggested that the face advance speed should be rationally increased to reduce the exposure time and <b>spalling</b> of coal wall. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of controlling coal wall <b>spalling</b> was limited through the increase of face advance speed. With a large amount of observations on site, the effect of increasing face advance speed on coal wall <b>spalling</b> was found. If the advance speed is too high, the coal <b>spalling</b> might increase.|$|R
30|$|During the {{non-periodical}} pressure period, at {{the lower}} part of the face, the relationship between coal wall <b>spalling</b> and face advance speed showed a certain degree of randomness. When the face advance speed reached 2.4, 3.05, 5, 5.5 and 5.75  m/d, there was no <b>spalling</b> occurring. In general, the depth of coal wall <b>spalling</b> showed less variation with face advance speed {{at the lower}} part of the face, the average <b>spalling</b> depth concentrated within 0.3 – 0.4  m. With the increase of face advance speed, the <b>spalling</b> length and ratio showed a trend of decrease early, to increase at a later time.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the next}} day (February 22nd) we left the [...] "Nagwah" [...] at seven instead of six a.m., and passed to the right a {{granitic}} outcrop in the Wady bed, a reduced edition of the Burj. After an hour's slow walking we were led by a Bedawi lad, Hasan bin Husayn, to a rock-spur projected northwards {{from the left side}} and separating two adjacent Sayls or [...] "torrent-beds," [...] mere bays in the bank of mountains. A cut road runs {{to the top of the}} granite tongue, which faces the westernmost or down-stream outbreaks of the huge porphyritic masses on the other side of the Wady Sadr. The ridge itself is strewed with <b>spalled</b> stone, quartz broken from the veins that seam the granite, and with slag as usual admirably worked. Not a trace of human habitation appears, nor is there any tradition of a settlement having existed here; consequently we concluded that this was another atelier of wandering workmen. Below the rock-tongue we found for the first time oxydulated iron and copper, either free or engaged in trap and basaltic dykes: the former metal, also attached in layers to dark-red vermeilled jasper, here appears streaked with white quartz.|$|E
6000|$|The mining {{industry}} {{could not have}} been a prominent feature at Badá, or we should have found, as in Shaghab and Shuwák, furnaces and scoriæ. Yet about the tank we lit upon large scatters of <b>spalled</b> quartz, which, according to the Baliyy, is brought from the neighbouring mountains. Some of it was rosy outside: other specimens bore stains of copper; and others showed, when broken, little pyramids of ore. Tested in England, it proved to be pure lead, a metal so rare that some metallurgists have doubted its existence: the finds have been mostly confined to auriferous lands. The blow-pipe soon showed that it was not galena (the sulphide), but some of it contained traces of silver. Without knowing the rarity of these specimens, certain American officers at the Citadel, Cairo, compared them with the true galenas of the Dár-Forian mines, called Mahattat el-Risás (the [...] "Deposit of Lead"), in the Wady Gotam, three days north-east of the capital El-Fashr. The African metal is rich. Large quantities, analyzed by Gastinel Bey, gave fifty per cent. of lead, and of silver fifty dollars per ton; but the distance from any possible market will reserve these diggings {{for the use of the}} future. Some were sanguine enough to propose smelting the metal at Khartúm, where Risás is ever in demand; and accordingly, for a time Dar-For was [...] "run," [...] by a mild [...] "ring," [...] against Midian.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the caravan}} {{continued}} its course down the broad smooth Wady Ruways, on whose left side {{was a large}} atelier, with broken walls and <b>spalled</b> quartz of the Negro variety. Here we found, for the first time, the handmills made of the hardest grey granite, so beautifully worked further south; they explained the fine and carefully polished tube which {{had been brought to}} the first Expedition at Zibá.[EN#10] Several of these articles were all but whole, an exception in this land of [...] "clasts." [...] We then struck over the stony divide to the left, towards a fine landmark--a Khitm, or [...] "block," [...] shaped like a seal cut en cabochon: its name is the barbarous sounding Khurm el-Badaríyyah. During the ascent, which was easy, we passed a second strew and scatter of the white stone broken into small pieces. From the Col, reached at 9.45 a.m., a descent, vile for camels not for mules, presently landed us in the Wady Umm Ámil. The left bank of the hideous narrow gorge showed a line of wells or water-pits, made, said Furayj, by the Mutakaddimín (veteres),--the Ancients who were probably Mediævals. Crossing the torrent-gully we left on its right bank the ruins of large works, especially the upper parallelogram. After a thirteen miles' ride we halted at 10.40 a.m. under a rock on the left side, opposite three couthless heaps of water-rolled stones surrounded by fine quartz. By far the poorest thing we had yet seen, this [...] "town" [...] had been grandiosely described to the first Expedition at Zibá. Many blessings were heaped upon the head of Ámil and his mother: the name, however, as the Sayyid suggested, is evidently a corruption of Mu'ámil--"the workman, the employee."[EN#11] I would conjecture that here the slave-miners were stationed, Old Zibá being the master's abode: our caravan entitled it El-Lomán--"the bagnio, the prison for galériens." [...] On the coast-town I procured some specimens of heavy red copper which had been dug out of a ruined furnace; the metal is admirable, and it retrieves to a certain extent the lost reputation of Umm Ámil.|$|E
