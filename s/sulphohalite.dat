40|$|The mineral <b>sulphohalite</b> – Na 6 (SO 4) 2 FCl {{is a rare}} sodium halogen {{sulphate}} and occurs {{associated with}} evaporitic deposits. <b>Sulphohalite</b> formation is important in saline evaporites and in pipe scales. <b>Sulphohalite</b> is an anhydrous sulphate–halide with an apparent variable anion ratio of formula Na 6 (SO 4) 2 FCl. Such a formula with oxyanions lends itself to vibrational spectroscopy. The Raman band at 1003 cm− 1 is assigned to the (SO 4) 2 − ν 1 symmetric stretching mode. Shoulders to this band are found at 997 and 1010 cm− 1. The low intensity Raman bands at 1128, 1120 and even 1132 cm− 1 are attributed to the (SO 4) 2 − ν 3 antisymmetric stretching vibrations. Two symmetric sulphate stretching modes are observed indicating {{at least at the}} molecular level the non-equivalence of the sulphate ions in the <b>sulphohalite</b> structure. The Raman bands at 635 and 624 cm− 1 are assigned to the ν 4 SO 42 − bending modes. The ν 2 (SO 4) 2 − bending modes are observed at 460 and 494 cm− 1. The observation of multiple bands supports the concept of a reduction in symmetry of the sulphate anion from Td to C 3 v or even C 2 v. No evidence of bands attributable to the halide ions was found...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. The crystal {{structure}} of synthetic kogarkoite {{has been determined}} from X-ray data collected on an automatic diffractometer. The refinement was per-formed by a least-squares method employing anisotropic thermal parameters. The 3 t 57 reflections with I> 3 o(1) converged to a conventional R value of o. 033. The cell content is I 2 Na 3 SO 4 F, the space-group P 21 /m, a = I 8. o 74, b = 6. 958, c = I 1. 443 A, fl = IO 7. 7 I~ Kogarkoite presents a marked trigonal subcell with c' corresponding to [Io 2] of the monoclinic ell. The tri-dimensional framework can be considered built up by nine differently stacked layers of Na atoms approximately perpendicular to the c ' axis (five sheets are present in galeite, six in <b>sulphohalite,</b> and seven in sehairerite). The very close structural relationships between these minerals are discussed. KOGARKOITE, Na 3 SO 4 F, represents a natural phase in the system Na 2 SO 4 -NaF-NaC 1. This mineral was first found by Kogarko (I 96 I) in the Lovozero syenites (Kola peninsula) and sub-sequently inhot-springs deposits at Mt. Princeton, Colorado (Sharp, t 970). A compound correspond-ing to the mineral can be easily synthesized by evaporation of aqueous Na 2 SO 4 and NaF solu-tions. Indeed artificial sodium fluoride sulphate was described by De Marignac (t 859) and later by Wolters (r 9 IO) and Foote and Schairer (I 93 o). Pabst et al. (1963) and Pabst and Sharp (I 973) reported the results of crystallographic studies, assigning kogarkoite to the monoclinic system, with a marked rhombohedral pseudo-cell. The present work on the {{crystal structure}} of kogarkoite isa further contribution tothe crystallo-chemical study {{of the group of}} multiple salts having composition ranging from Na 3 SO 4 F to Na 6 (SO 4) 2 FC 1 (<b>sulphohalite,</b> Sakamoto, I 968).

40|$|SUMMARY. The crystal {{structure}} of galeite from Searles Lake (California) {{has been determined}} by means of X-ray diffraction data on a single crystal. A possible structure was derived from that of schairerite {{on the basis of}} chemical and lattice analogies and was confirmed by comparison of the observed iffractometric structure factors with the calculated ones. The refinement was performed by least-squares methods employing isotropic thermal parameters and assuming that atoms related by translational pseudosymmetry exhibit equal thermal parameters. The final R value is o'o 9. The cell content is 3 [Nats(SO 4). ~F 4 CI]; the space group is P 3 Im. The lattice dimensions are a 12 " 197 (4) /~, c 13 " 9550 o) /~. The marked subcell has P 3 ml symmetry and a 7 - 042 /~, c I 3 " 955 /~. The crystal struc-ture of galeite consists of a three-dimensional framework, formed by coordination octahedra around Na + ions, including tetrahedral holes with sulphur atoms at the centres. The three-dimensional framework can be considered built up by five octahedral sheets (seven sheets can be recognized in schairerite and six in <b>sulphohalite).</b> The very close analogies occurring in the structures of galeite and schairerite are discussed. THE present study follows the structural investigation of schairerite (Fanfani et al., 1975) and represents a further contribution to the crystallochemical knowledge of th...|$|E
