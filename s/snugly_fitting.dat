6000|$|The swordfish, when {{swimming}} at the surface, usually allows its {{dorsal fin}} {{and the upper}} lobe of its caudal fin to be visible, projecting out of the water. It is this habit which enables the fisherman to detect {{the presence of the}} fish. It swims slowly along, and the fishing-schooner with a light breeze finds no difficulty in overtaking it. When excited its motions are very rapid and nervous. Swordfish are sometimes seen to leap entirely out of the water. Early writers attributed this habit to the tormenting presence of parasites, but this theory seems hardly necessary, knowing what we do of its violent exertions at other times.

5000|$|It was {{initially}} {{believed that the}} charge was stored in the water in early Leyden jars. In the 1700s American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him {{to conclude that the}} charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge {{can be found on the}} metal plates, and therefore it must be in the dielectric.

50|$|Sceliages {{species have}} {{developed}} special adaptations to disarticulate millipedes - {{such as the}} shape of the clypeal margin, in particular the two front ‘teeth’, and the middle legs. The curvature of the meso tibiae is most evident in S. adamastor, <b>fitting</b> <b>snugly</b> around the circumference of the larger spirobolid, spirostreptid and julid millipedes. The adult male or female beetle straddles the subdued millipede and locks onto it particularly with the mid legs, and uses the front clypeal teeth to prise apart the ring segments of the millipede. Front legs assist in this operation, but the main work is done by the front clypeal teeth. The viscera or gut contents, the legs, and some bits of chitin are then used to form some 1-3 brood-balls {{depending on the size of}} the millipede. Brood-balls are prepared in a chamber underground and segment rings are discarded into the burrow. The brood-balls, each with one egg, are coated with a compacted layer of clayey soil to prevent desiccation, and are watched over by the female. Some Cephalodesmius species from Australia introduce additional food supplies as the larva develops, but this is not the case with Sceliages.|$|R
5000|$|Silicone Tails: Currently, {{silicone}} rubber tails (also known as platinum-cure silicone tails and Dragonskin silicone tails, after a silicone brand name) {{are the most}} popular and most expensive tails on the market. In addition to being relatively lifelike and durable, silicone tails are skin-safe and inert in most environments once cured. Neutral buoyancy in the water allows for ease of sinking and natural-looking swimming, although they are quite heavy (25-60 lbs) out of the water. Colors and patterns are only limited by the designer's imagination, and if produced properly, paint or pigment does not chip off the tail. The material has excellent elasticity, allowing relative ease in getting {{in and out of the}} tail, and <b>fitting</b> <b>snugly</b> once on. Silicone is slip-resistant and grips the skin, which results in less tail slip or gapping during vigorous swimming. It is rare to find silicone tails for less than $1000 USD, even used, and their prices increase with the amount of extra detail, color, and number of fins added. Silicone tails can costs many thousands of dollars. Mermaid Linden's tail is reported to have cost over $10,000 USD. [...] Due to the expense and heavier weight involved, platinum-cure silicone tails are not recommended for beginners.|$|R
30|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{inserting}} blocking screws, the proximal and distal fragments {{have to be considered}} individually. Factors contributing to the stability of bone–nail construct are stability at the nail entry site, a <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> medullary canal, impaction of the nail tip into the metaphysis and the interlocking screws. When the osteotomy is done in the metaphysis, the nail is usually centered in the longer bone fragment and may not need blocking screws unless the IM canal is significantly wider than the nail at the osteotomy site. Screws can still be used in the longer fragment if stability is a concern. The shorter metaphyseal fragment has a wide medullary canal and is at risk of toggling around the nail and developing undesirable angulation. Accordingly, the shorter fragment frequently needs blocking screws for additional stability.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Partial ear amputations {{are one of}} {{the forms}} of ear loss. A {{user-friendly}} design of prosthesis with safe suspension and an aesthetic appearance can be helpful to a patient who has lost part of their ear due to congenital absence or trauma. Prosthetic use has social and psychological effects on the patient and their family. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a technique of ear prosthesis fabrication with self suspension for these patients. Technique: To provide a <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> prosthesis, the only parts of the residual ear that were covered by the prosthesis were accurately manufactured and reduced in thickness to 0. 5 – 1 mm and 10 mm in width, so that the silicone extended over the stumps to provide adequate suspension.

40|$|Metacontrast is a {{powerful}} visual illusion by which the visibility of a brief stimulus is drastically reduced when it {{is followed by a}} <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> second, masking stimulus. There have been longstanding debates about the levels at which metacontrast mechanisms operate and about the temporal unfolding of the masking effect. Here, we use second-order features (texture and movement) in order to set a lower bound to the level at which metacontrast may be found. First, we show that interactions of two second-order stimuli readily produce typical metacontrast masking. We then create second-order single-transient stimuli that induce visual percepts when a random uniform texture is locally replaced by a similar random uniform texture. We show that these ultra-brief stimuli can be used both as target and mask. Using these single-transient stimuli, we seek to disentangle the relative contributions of mask onset and offset. Results suggest that, at least in the context of second-order masking, nearly all of the mask’s effectiveness is due to the very first visual event that follows the target...|$|E
40|$|When a {{virus infects}} a cell in our bodies, rather than letting the incubus lie hidden, the cell dis-plays tiny {{fragments}} of viral proteins {{on the cell}} surface. These peptide snips are neatly pre-sented in a <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> groove on molecular display stands called major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Here, roaming T cells from the immune system are free to probe the MHCs and see if their receptors recognize the presented peptides as being of foreign origin. In the case of class I MHCs, positive recognition by a passing cytotoxic T cell can result in the peptide-displaying cell (and its viral inhabitants) being targeted for destruction. Because MHCs are in {{the front line of}} an arms race with the viral invaders, the genes that encode them tend to change rapidly during evolution in an attempt to keep one step ahead of their adversaries—the virus mutates to avoid recognition by the immune system, but the MHC mutates so that its groove can accommodate the altered viral peptide, and thus the cycle re-peats. As a result, the MHC genes tend to vary considerably between individuals (hence the name MHC, which reflects their role in restricting our ability to transplant organs freely be-tween unrelated people), and natural selection tends to favor populations with a high diversity of MHC genes...|$|E
40|$|Scientists have {{developed}} a brain implant that essentially melts into place, <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> to the brain’s surface. The technology could {{pave the way for}} better devices to monitor and control seizures, and to transmit signals from the brain past damaged parts of the spinal cord. "These implants have the potential to maximize the contact between electrodes and brain tissue, while minimizing damage to the brain. They could provide a platform for a range of devices with applications in epilepsy, spinal cord injuries and other neurological disorders, " said Walter Koroshetz, M. D., deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. The study, published in Nature Materials, shows that the ultrathin flexible implants, made partly from silk, can record brain activity more faithfully than thicker implants embedded with similar electronics. The simplest devices for recording from the brain are needle-like electrodes that can penetrate deep into brain tissue. More state-of-the-art devices, called micro-electrode arrays, consist of dozens of semi-flexible wire electrodes, usually fixed to rigid silicon grids that do not conform to the brain's shape. In people with epilepsy, the arrays could be used to detect when seizures first begin, and deliver pulses to shut the seizures down. In people with spinal cord injuries, the technology has promise for reading complex signals in the brain that direct movement, and routing those signals to healthy muscles or prosthetic devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported the antifungal properties of a monoterpene phenol "Eugenol" against different Candida strains and {{have observed that}} the addition of methyl group to eugenol drastically increased its antimicrobial potency. Based on the results {{and the importance of}} medicinal synthetic chemistry, we synthesized eugenol-tosylate and its congeners (E 1 -E 6) and tested their antifungal activity against different clinical fluconazole (FLC) - susceptible and FLC- resistant C. albicans isolates alone and in combination with FLC by determining fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) and isobolograms calculated from microdilution assays. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results confirmed that all the tested C. albicans strains were variably susceptible to the semi-synthetic derivatives E 1 -E 6, with MIC values ranging from 1 - 62 μg/ml. The test compounds in combination with FLC exhibited either synergy (36 %), additive (41 %) or indifferent (23 %) interactions, however, no antagonistic interactions were observed. The MICs of FLC decreased 2 - 9 fold when used in combination with the test compounds. Like their precursor eugenol, all the derivatives showed significant impairment of ergosterol biosynthesis in all C. albicans strains coupled with down regulation of the important ergosterol biosynthesis pathway gene-ERG 11. The results were further validated by docking studies, which revealed that the inhibitors <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> the active site of the target enzyme, mimicking fluconazole, may well explain their excellent inhibitory activity. Our results suggest that these compounds have a great potential as antifungals, which can be used as chemosensitizing agents with the known antifungal drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} medieval hosen {{is not a}} view of a {{continuously}} improved product. It involves several nations, and several centuries, and like all Medieval innovation, its course is slow and uneven, guided more by habit and tradition than by thought. An apprentice to a tailor was trained by rote; a medieval tailor of any sort, by what examples we can find in literature and artwork, would draft an item for a customer freehand on the cloth, or perhaps rely {{on a series of}} master templates. Modern pattern sizes, in any notation, were an unknown concept in so far as we can tell. From this remote vantage point, {{take a look at the}} complexity of <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> the garment to the human body (anywhere on the body!), and you can begin to appreciate the difficulty in attempting broad innovations in style. A tailor who attempted a radical change in pattern would have to teach himself by rote how to recreate that new pattern, or possibly recreate his entire stock of master templates. This was not an age when people could afford to scrap or replace yards of specially cut cloth on a whim. Seemingly every time the medievals were faced with the decision of spending more labor or more material, they opted for the labor-intensive solutions: clearly, labor was cheaper than material. By necessity, therefore, any surviving garments were either likely to be widely used, or at worst, represent repairs to a standard garment. An exception to this rule might be fantastical show garments, such as parade armo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 1 °-spot was flashed up on a screen, {{followed}} by a <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> annular mask. We measured the amount of masking {{as a function of}} stimulus luminance. The surround was always mid-gray, the masking ring was either black or white, and the luminance of the spot target ranged from 0 % to 100 % of white in 4 % steps. Observers reported the apparent lightness of the masked spot by adjusting a matching spot. Results: A black annular mask made all spots that were darker than the gray surround appear to be transparent, that is, of the same luminance as the surround (complete masking). The black ring had virtually no masking effect on spots that were lighter than the surround. Conversely, a white ring made all spots that were lighter than the gray surround look apparently the same luminance as the surround (complete masking), but had virtually no masking effect on spots that were darker than the surround. In summary, a black ring masked spatial decrements but not increments, whilst a white ring masked spatial increments but not decrements. Thus masking occurred only when the spot and the ring had the same luminance polarity. This same-polarity masking still occurred when the target spot was larger than the ‘donut hole’ of the masking ring, so that the target and ring partly overlapped. This ruled out simple edge-cancellation theories. Instead, masking disrupts the filling-in process that normally propagates inward from the edges of a spot [Vision Res. 31 (7 – 8) (1991) 1221]. We conclude that metacontrast masking occurs within, but not between, separate visual ON and OFF pathways...|$|E
40|$|Background : Baksi sloppy hinge elbow is an all metal {{prosthesis}} having 7 0 - 10 0 varus - valgus inherent laxity at {{the hinge}} section with minimal motion bearing contact area. Due {{to the presence}} of laxity at it&#x 2032;s hinge section, any strain on the prosthesis dissipates primarily to the surrounding soft tissues thus protecting the cement bone interfaces. However, from our long term clinical experiences on the use of our sloppy hinge design since 1984 and the knowledge of literature review of the results of using other semi-constrained (sloppy) or unconstrained designs, it was observed that radiolucency or loosening at the bone-cement interface occurred mainly around the humeral stem in the long run due to the continued effect of rotational torque of forearm and hand. Hence, an attempt in the improvement of the design concept is being made. Methods : In this respect one flange each of one cm height and breadth and three mm thickness has been incorporated on either sides of the shank of humeral stem of the sloppy hinge at medio-lateral (coronal) plane which will be seated in the corresponding longitudinal groove cut on either side of humeral shaft extending from its transverse cut end to become single assembly during the rotation of humerus. Results : The preliminary results of clinical application of the modified sloppy hinge elbow in ten cases are found satisfactory. Conclusion : The cyclical compression and distraction forces during flexion and extension of the elbow will be distributed over the larger bony area of lower end of humerus where flanges of the humeral shank being seated. The rotational torque effect of forearm and hand particularly with the arm in abduction will be minimised at the humeral bone cement interface as the humerus and the prosthetic stem act as a single assembly by the <b>snugly</b> <b>fitting</b> of the prosthetic flange in the humural shaf...|$|E
