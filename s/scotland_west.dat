2500|$|Sulfur {{dioxide and}} {{nitrogen}} oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, {{but the majority}} of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. [...] Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5–6 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency – a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. [...] As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. [...] The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. [...] Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western <b>Scotland,</b> <b>west</b> Wales and the north eastern United States.|$|E
