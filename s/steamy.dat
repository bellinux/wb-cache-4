5|$|The D'Angelo-indebted grind session 'Rocket' and frisky 'Drunk In Love' are {{similarly}} sexy, but they're not sexy like a glamour shot or a <b>steamy</b> video. They're sexy like an overeager, pre-shower quickie, or a hushed morning make-out session before the baby wakes up. These {{are the most}} unapologetically raunchy songs she's ever sung, {{and in many ways}} also the most romantic.|$|E
5|$|Facing an {{uncertain}} future owing {{to the cost of}} restoration and refurbishment necessary to meet the stringent engineering standards required for main line operation, salvation came in 1996 when Dr Tony Marchington, already well known in the vintage movement, bought the locomotive, and had it restored over three years to running condition at a cost of £1million, a restoration which, at the time, was recognised as the most extensive in the locomotive's history. Marchington's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in a documentary, the Channel 4 programme A <b>Steamy</b> Affair: The Story of Flying Scotsman.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, <b>steamy</b> swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, <b>steamy</b> spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E

25|$|Gitlow {{followed}} his 1940 memoir with a <b>steamier</b> retelling of old tales called The Whole of Their Lives: Communism in America.

2500|$|The review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 88% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 33 reviews with the consensus: [...] "Loaded with atmosphere and drenched in the sizzling chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin, The Big Easy {{remains one of}} the strongest -- and <b>steamiest</b> -- thrillers of the 1980s." [...] The film is praised for the accuracy of Quaid's Cajun accent, which he meticulously researched in preparation for the role. However, residents of the New Orleans area were not so pleased, referring to it as [...] "cringe-inducing." ...|$|R

25|$|According to Abraham Gottlob Werner, {{the first}} phase of the Earth's {{development}} featured a great global ocean. This ocean was hot, <b>steamy,</b> and full of suspended sediment that eventually precipitated and formed bedrock. After this, the global ocean supposedly cooled and settled to such a degree that it began to subside and eventually conform to match the features seen today. During this time of subsidence, mountains were left behind as artifacts of erosion or a similar mechanism.|$|E

[...] So far as I could make out they were all nearly destitute men; hardly any of them had a proper sea outfit, and what small possessions they had were a source of mutual distrust. And as we pitched and floundered southward they gambled and fought, were brutal to one another, argued and wrangled loudly, until we protested at the uproar.|$|R

He went to the Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised on watching the Advocate-Times bulletin-board. He stood in the thickest and <b>steamiest</b> of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded the achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher, Babbitt remarked to complete strangers, [...] "Pretty nice! Good work!" [...] and hastened back to the office.|$|R

After a long discussion with her agent she finally agreed to perform in the video only if the sex was simulated. She changed her stage name to Hitomi Kobayashi for the video which was a surprise success, selling 50,000 copies. Her amazing popularity quickly made her the leading AV actress of the mid-1980s, and, not long after her debut, she had earned the title [...] "AV Queen." ...|$|R

The character embarked in a <b>steamy</b> on/off relationship with the hugely popular Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) in a romance storyline that lasted four years. The character's final storyline saw Craig investigate dodgy pills from a pharmaceutical company, Scott Spear, which resulted in his murder by hired thugs. His relationships often stemmed from his kind but overly protective personality, with a hugely cemented friendship with Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and a long running relationship with the feisty Alice Piper (Toni Potter).|$|E
5000|$|Warren has {{continued}} to write for both the Harlequin Temptation and Harlequin Blaze lines. She says these are her favorite lines because of [...] "the contemporary tone, the sexy feel", and {{that many of them}} contain humour. [...] The two lines are similar, except that Blaze allows for a longer book (by about 15,000 words) and has <b>steamier</b> love scenes. In 2004, Warren branched into single-title novels with the release of Drive Me Crazy. In 2007, she became the launch author for a new Harlequin series celebrating NASCAR. She wrote the first and last book in the sixteen-book series. Both of her novels featured cameo appearances by real-life NASCAR driver Carl Edwards, who worked closely with Warren to create a [...] "suitable fictional representation of himself."

Thomas and Mavis tell the engines about the meeting, and Thomas decides to tell Diesel 10, but gets cold wheels and backs down. The next day, Thomas races to the coaling plant and gets there in time to stop 'Arry and Bert from almost calling the meeting off as the engines start to argue about who is to blame for starting the trouble.

5000|$|Passion {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics and, as of 1 September 2013, {{is associated with}} a 34% rating on Rotten Tomatoes—based on 59 reviews: [...] "For better as well as worse, Passion is vintage Brian De Palma sexploitation—although with a storyline sillier than most, it fails to generate as much heat as his <b>steamiest</b> work." [...] Robert Bell of Exclaim! rated the film 8 out of 10, writing: [...] "It's just unfortunate that those unfamiliar with the director's work will have absolutely no context for the abstract and oblique tonal shifts or the references, leaving them to dismiss the film as terrible." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and Alan Pyke of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. Peter Sobczynski of Roger Ebert.com gave the film a four-star rating, calling it [...] "a spellbinding thriller", and DePalma [...] "one of the great seducers of cinema".|$|R
25|$|Later that spring, Scott {{returned}} to her beginnings as a comedian when she began work on her first comedy noir, Scared Stiff, with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Scott played an heiress who inherits a haunted castle on Lost Island {{off the coast of}} Cuba. Though Scott had fond memories of working on the set in the years ahead, at the time of filming, she found it trying. Scott found Lewis' impersonations of her offensive, while a jealous Hal Wallis instructed the director, George Marshall, not to let the romantic scenes between Scott and Martin get too <b>steamy.</b> Despite Scott's best efforts, including making excuses for Lewis' behavior to the press, most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor. Shooting took place late May to mid-July 1952. The film premiered the week of 28 May 1953 in Los Angeles. Despite the negative experience and reviews, Scared Stiff remains Scott's third favorite film.|$|E

5000|$|Arriving as a love {{interest}} for established character, Craig (Renato Bartolomei), Sarah became {{the centre of}} a high-profile storyline when it was revealed her young brother Daniel (Jarred Blakiston) was in fact her illegitimate son. Sarah and Craig's romance carried on {{for four years and}} climaxed in what has been described as [...] "Shortland Street's <b>steamiest</b> ever scene." [...] Sarah's romance storyline's again took a high-profile role with her pairing to TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) in 2006. Over the next 8 years the two were involved in a [...] "will they-won't they" [...] situation that involved the two getting married, divorced, having a child, and engaged for a second time. Public interest was high for the romance and boosted the show some of its highest ever ratings; the Prime Minister Helen Clark also expressed her interest in whether the two would end up together. In 2008 the character was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in a storyline producers intended to use to explore the long-term effects of the illness and help educate New Zealanders.|$|R
50|$|Very soon, the {{new airport}} is {{complete}} and the first airplane is sent to Sodor, but when Thomas accidentally derails some trucks, they hit the water tower, which {{falls to the ground}} and cracks the runway.

Seeing Diesel 10 working alongside a steam engine convinces Diesel, 'Arry and Bert to finally respect the steam engines themselves. With the aid of the other engines, they clear up the mess and Thomas collects George to fix the runway.|$|R
500|$|A {{scene in}} which Ivan and Paul shared a kiss on a sofa sparked some {{controversy}} with viewers. 126 people complained to media watch dog Ofcom deeming the scenes to be explicit. The company later cleared Emmerdale of any wrongdoing, and a spokesperson said that [...] "Ivan and Paul's behaviour was no more explicit than that previously exhibited by other characters in the soap. Given the inexplicit portrayal of this relationship, we consider that these scenes were acceptable." [...] While Andy Green of the Liverpool Echo said [...] "Paul and Ivan's fumble on the sofa was probably the <b>steamiest</b> pre-watershed gay scene ever shown on mainstream TV." [...] Brocklebank told So So Gay's reporter that Ivan's bisexuality storyline had a [...] "huge effect" [...] on the viewers. He revealed that he had received [...] "a lot" [...] of letters from Christian groups telling {{him that he would}} go to hell for kissing another male on pre-watershed television. However, he also received many from young gay and lesbian teenagers who had thanked him for [...] "making it easier to come out" [...] because they had someone to relate to.
